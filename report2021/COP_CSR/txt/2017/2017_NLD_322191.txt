In executing our strategy we are guided by our company compass which articulates our vision for the future and the role that Corbion envisions to play. Our strategy has a strong focus on generating cash flows, returns on investments, and profitable growth. To enhance value creation we use a differentiated management and capital allocation approach for our two business units. The strategy provides us with a framework to make consistent choices and decisions. Corbion Value creation and disciplined execution A differentiated Decision making and capital allocation based on well-defined criteria approach Enhanced external transparency Biobased Ingredients Focus on cash flow optimization and return on investment Strengthen the core Different priorities for different segments Productivity improvement program Streamline: € 20 million by 2016 Powered by megatrends Biobased Innovations Leverage lactic acid molecule and technology into new businesses Selective drive for Disciplined stage-gate investment approach growth Forward integration into PLA Improved free cash flows and return on investment Improved financial Focus on shareholder value creation performance Higher recurring dividend 2015: Additional € 100 million return to shareholders 2016: Additional € 75 million return to shareholders 10 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our strategy The strategy allows for a differentiated approach in our Biobased Ingredients and Biobased Innovations business units, tailored to different market circumstances. Biobased Ingredients Strategic Biobased Innovations Strengthen the core choices Selective drive for growth Strengthen • Bakery & Meat North America • Chemicals, Pharma, Electronics Invest to defend our position • Polylactic acid (PLA) • Meat South-East Asia & Brazil Grow • Succinic acid • Confectionery Invest for growth • Gypsum-free process • Medical Biomaterials • Alternative feedstock • Dairy • Beverages Explore • 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid • Animal health Invest selectively (FDCA) • Coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (CASE) Biobased Ingredients: Strengthen the core Our Biobased Ingredients business unit is the core of our company (comprising 98% of our sales). Our aim is to create sustainable value for our customers by supplying functional ingredients and safe performance chemicals building on our existing biobased technology platforms, with profitable growth for Corbion. We strengthen our core by focusing on our key customers within selected markets and targeting those markets through differentiated approaches. In the second quarter of 2016, as part of our strategy, we started the implementation of a process to further improve the portfolio profitability. This had a positive impact on the underlying price/mix of the portfolio, while volumes were adversely impacted. We addressed specific market needs using our core capabilities, which led to further insights into where we can grow with our value propositions and where we can further improve our productivity. Food Our Food business segment follows a strategy aimed at strenghtening and reinforcing our leading market positions in Bakery (which includes Bread and Sweet Baked Goods) and Meat in North America. We seek to grow in segments such as Meat in emerging markets and Confectionery, while exploring selected opportunities in Dairy and Beverages in several parts of the world. We will accomplish this by leveraging our core technologies (in lactic acid, emulsifiers, and functional blends) and capabilities in antimicrobial and structural control. In 2016 we successfully expanded our line of clean-label ingredients for the North American Meat market. We also started expanding our Dolton, Illinois, facility in order to be able to produce propylene glycol monoesters (PGME) emulsifiers which are used in sweet goods, bakery mixes, and other applications. The addition of PGME to the portfolio plus the fact that we signed an exclusive agreement with BASF to distribute their entire line of emulsifiers in the US means that Corbion now has most of the necessary building blocks to produce a Sweet Goods portfolio that matches the breadth of solutions currently offered to the Bread market segment. In addition to that, we introduced the non-PHO (partially hydrogenated oils) line of emulsifiers for dough applications in 2016. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our strategy 11 As the industry leader, Corbion succeeded in eliminating all PHO products in its portfolio by the end of 2016, long before the June 2018 deadline mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We successfully introduced our coated acid portfolio (PPMA) for Confectionery where it provides stability and delivers an instant but long-lasting sour taste. The European patent we received for our unique vinegar powder used as a preservative in Meat and other foods and in Beverage applications, strengthens our position as an industry expert in preservation and clean-label meat solutions. Biochemicals Our Biochemicals business aims to deliver sustainable value to manufacturers around the world. For our customers value is defined as the quality of a product’s functional performance balanced out against its cost-effectiveness. Our value propositions deliver proven performance with safety and sustainability uniquely ingrained in our technologies. We do this across several key areas: antimicrobials, PH-control, solvency, and polymers. By continuing to put customer needs at the center of everything we do, we will achieve strong growth in Biochemicals. In 2016 we have seen further formulations containing our (EPA registered) natural antimicrobial SANILAC in Home Care, an increased number of agrochemical formulations based on our PURASOLV solvents, and we are scaling up adhesive polymers prototypes for the market as well as proceeding with customer-led investments in our Fiberlive production capabilities for orthopedics in our Medical Biomaterials market. Productivity improvement program “Streamline” In order to deliver structural productivity improvements in all our processes, we launched the “Streamline” program to align the organization with the portfolio choices, simplify our business processes, optimize our manufacturing footprint, and drive competence development in commerce (enhanced customer loyalty), operations (world-class operations), innovation (accelerated innovation), and people (leadership and engagement). In all of these areas we have conducted projects in 2016, including commercial excellence training and portfolio management, the optimization of our sales and operations planning, the alignment of our innovation programs with customer opportunities, and the implementation of a leadership development program. The targeted € 20 million in cumulative annual savings from our productivity improvement program have been fully achieved in 2016, and the consolidation of our two US powder plants (integration of Kansas Avenue into Totowa) has been completed by June 2016, closing out our savings initiative of program “Streamline”. Biobased Innovations: Selective drive for growth Our Biobased Innovations business unit builds new biotechnology business platforms, using our capabilities in fermentation and downstream processing. We have a portfolio of highgrowth opportunities which require potentially high investments, the exact timing of which is difficult to predict. In this business unit we will drive growth via a disciplined capital investment approach, governed by a strict stage-gate process, while mitigating risks via upfront commercial commitments, market development, and/or partnering. As part of our strategy we are making the next step in the bioplastics value chain by becoming a PLA producer. In November 2016 we announced the intention to join forces with Total by creating a 50/50 joint venture to produce and market polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. Together with Total we are building a world-class PLA polymerization plant with a capacity of 75,000 tons per year at Corbion’s site in Thailand (next to our existing lactic acid plant). 12 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our strategy Following the successful launch in the European and Asia-Pacific markets, we launched our PLA portfolio of neat bioplastic resins for the North American market in 2016. Making these pre-marketing resins available in the US is expected to accelerate market acceptance of PLA and allows Corbion to gain a deeper insight into the various product-market combinations. Building further on our gypsum-free lactic acid technology we successfully incorporated process design improvements aimed at reducing both the operating cost of the process and the capital expenditure required for an industrial-scale production facility. In September 2016 we organized a workshop to establish a consortium for the acceleration of alternative feedstock development for PLA. Alternative or second-generation feedstocks are lignocellulosic biomass or woody crops, agricultural residues, or waste such as bagasse, corn stover, and wheat straw. Corbion is the first company in the world to have made PLA from alternative feedstocks, optimizing the lactic acid fermentation process to fit the special characteristics of the biomass. In the future, these alternative feedstocks can have a major impact on the biochemical and bioplastics industries and, combined with our gypsum-free technology bring us a step closer to producing biobased acids with superior resource and landuse efficiency. We have developed a proprietary process to produce 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from renewable resources. In 2015 we demonstrated our capability to produce the polymer PEF, based on FDCA – proving the excellent barrier properties, and better mechanical/thermal properties of FDCA, when compared to PET. In 2016 we scaled up the FDCA process to pilot level as next step in our development process. This has put us in a position to supply FDCA and PEF material to partners for the purpose of researching and testing a variety of applications. Together with BASF, Corbion operates the joint venture Succinity for the production and sale of biobased succinic acid. The production technology has been further optimized and sufficient succinic acid volumes have been produced to support market development. The main focus in the coming period will be the further development of the technology and ensuring the availability of cost-competitive biobased succinic acid in line with market growth. Improved financial performance In 2016 we continued to make good progress in executing our strategy and we are well on track to deliver on our 2015-2018 targets. In the past year we have made strategic choices involving our customer and product portfolios. These choices resulted in a significant margin improvement, but at the same time had an adverse, albeit temporary, impact on our top-line growth in the year. As a result our business unit Biobased Ingredients showed full-year sales growth below the guidance range of 2-4%. For 2017, we are confident top-line growth will return to our guidance range. In Biobased Innovations the EBITDA loss of € 6.4 million for the year was higher than 2015, because of lower heat-stable PLA sales and higher PLA-related expenses. We announced in November 2016 the intention to form a 50/50 joint venture with Total, which commenced 2 March 2017. The new PLA plant is estimated to be operational in the second half of 2018. In 2016 our net debt/EBITDA ratio was 0.6x. Our net debt/EBITDA ratio is expected to remain well below our covenants limit of 3.5x in 2017. Corbion continues to target a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.5x over the investment cycle.

Marçal Gotanegra Font Maintenance Manager Corbion Spain Keep creating At Corbion we’re creating a better future together 18 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our strategy Prediction is better than prevention How did I get here? I studied electronic engineering and first came to Corbion in 1993 when I was 20 years old as a student, for work experience. It was my father who suggested I come: he worked for Corbion (then Purac) for 38 years – although he worked in the Finance department. For me, finance was never my passion. I’ve always enjoyed scientific things and the challenge of solving practical problems. Which is why now, as the Maintenance Manager for Corbion in Montmeló, I am in the ideal job. What do I do? Quite simply, my role is to maintain all the equipment and machinery at our manufacturing facility, ensuring maximum availability at the lowest possible cost. I have a team of around 30 people and in the factory alone we are responsible for 9,000 different pieces of equipment. Our mantra is that prediction is better than prevention. The better we are able to predict and repair – the smoother the operation. We use various technology and instruments to monitor the health of our equipment. And we also conduct planned maintenance where, for example, we will visually inspect oil levels. If levels are too low in a piece of equipment it could start failing and affect production. Bottom line: it’s easier and cheaper to inspect the oil level than to repair a failure due to lack of lubrication! Going the extra mile Here in Spain we are part of the global maintenance platform. What exactly is the platform? It’s a place where we can learn from each other, share experiences and adopt new ways of improving our maintenance – in a standardized and consistent way. Corbion seems to be doing a good job: in recent years we have advised the Catalan government on energy efficiency and savings based on advanced maintenance; we were invited to coach a multinational agribusiness and food company in how to improve their maintenance; and we shape the syllabus of the Maintenance Post-Degree from our local university. The future We are not there yet, and there is still room for improvement. When I began in this role in 2009 I was not an expert. I relied on my colleagues, especially in Gorinchem, to mentor me. Now we are adopting this attitude across Corbion with our maintenance platform. I spent time with global colleagues learning about new reliability methodologies that help us make better decisions on maintenance strategy that affect the day-to-day running of the factory. My ambition is very simple: to improve every day!

CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 21 Results Net sales Net sales in 2016 decreased by 0.8% to € 911.3 million (2015: € 918.3 million) due to a volume decline (-1.2%) as a result of increased focus on portfolio profitability, partly offset by impacts from currencies (+0.2%), and acquisitions (+0.2%). The acquisition impact is related to our acquisition of the Archer Daniels Midland lactic acid business, effective as of 31 March 2015. Organic sales growth of -1.1% in the Biobased Ingredients business unit was mostly driven by volume declines in the Food business segment which was partly offset by a price/mix improvement. In the Biochemicals business segment limited volume growth was the main driver. All markets, except for Agrochemicals, contributed to this growth. The decline in Biobased Innovations was mostly driven by a negative price/mix effect, caused by a higher percentage of standard PLA sold, mostly offset by volume increases in lactide and PLA.

Currencies negatively impacted EBITDA by € 1.4 million. Biobased Ingredients increased EBITDA excluding one-off items by 13.9% driven by improved EBITDA margin levels (up from 17.3% to 19.8%). Program Streamline contributed € 5.0 million to this EBITDA growth. The EBITDA loss in Biobased Innovations increased slightly to € -/6.4 million (2015: € -/4.7 million).

The EBITDA margin excluding one-off items increased from 17.3% to 19.8%, as both Food and Biochemicals improved their margins despite the adverse volume trend, which had a very limited impact on the profit margin level. 24 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance Business segment Food Millions of euros 2016 2015 Net sales 676.6 687.8 Organic growth -1.9% 3.7% EBITDA 140.1 135.1 EBITDA excluding one-off items 142.5 129.2 EBITDA margin excluding one-off items 21.1% 18.8% The Food segment showed an organic sales growth of -1.9% in 2016. As part of our strategy we started to improve the profitability of our portfolio in the second quarter. This had a positive impact on the price/mix of the portfolio, but a negative effect on volumes sold. The EBITDA margin of the business segment improved (up from 18.8% to 21.1%) in 2016 compared to last year mainly due to lower input costs, program “Streamline,” and the improved product mix. In Bakery, sales decreased in 2016 in a stable US bread market. With the closure of our Kansas plant in the second quarter (as part of plant consolidation), we decreased the number of SKUs and moved smaller customers to an indirect delivery model, which negatively impacted our volumes. Sales were also impacted due to a negative comparison with 2015: mid-2015 we were able to accommodate a surge in demand for higher priced egg-containing products due to an outbreak of avian flu in the US. A reversal of this effect from the second quarter 2016 onwards put additional pressure on both volumes and price/mix, particularly in the third quarter comparables, and less pronounced in the fourth quarter comparable. On balance, Meat sales decreased slightly in 2016. Our sales in Asia and Latin America continued to grow at a brisk pace as demand for our preservation solutions grew. However, customer consolidation in the US put pressure on volumes and prices for more commoditized parts of the market. In the US, our high-end solutions, such as natural vinegar-based products, continued to show a healthy growth. In other markets (Beverages, Confectionery, Dairy), sales increased slightly in 2016. In 2016 we commenced operations in our new Dutch powder facility, which enables us to expand our Confectionery portfolio. Business segment Biochemicals Millions of euros 2016 2015 Net sales 213.0 208.1 Organic growth 1.8% 1.6% EBITDA 52.9 45.5 EBITDA excluding one-off items 53.4 45.5 EBITDA margin excluding one-off items 25.1% 21.9% Net sales in the Biochemicals business segment increased organically by 1.8% in 2016. Sales growth was seen in all markets during the year except for our Chemicals markets where agrochemical products decreased significantly due to lower commodity prices, leading to lower demand. The main drivers of the growth in 2016 were strong performances in Medical/Pharma and Electronics. The EBITDA margin for 2016 improved significantly from 21.9% to 25.1% due to lower input costs, program “Streamline”, and a positive portfolio mix effect. The positive mix effect was mostly attributable to above-average margins of our Medical/Pharma business. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 25 Central costs Millions of euros 2016 2015 EBITDA (19.7) (19.7) EBITDA excluding one-off items (19.4) (19.7) Central costs decreased slightly compared to last year, due to program Streamline savings. Biobased Innovations Millions of euros 2016 2015 Net sales 21.7 22.4 Organic growth -3.2% 106.7% EBITDA (6.4) (4.7) EBITDA excluding one-off items (6.4) (4.7) EBITDA margin excluding one-off items -29.5% -20.8% Average capital employed 89.8 63.8 Net sales decreased slightly in 2016. Sales are fully driven by lactide/PLA-related products which are mostly being used by our customers as test volumes. The price/mix effect was negative as a result of selling more standard grade PLA rather than higher value-added (heat stable) PLA. In November 2016 we announced the intention to form a 50/50 joint venture with Total, which commenced 2 March 2017. The new PLA plant is estimated to be operational in the second half of 2018. The EBITDA loss of € 6.4 million for the year was higher than 2015, because of lower heat stable PLA sales and higher PLA-related expenses. Depreciation, amortization, and impairments (in)tangible fixed assets Depreciation, amortization, and impairments (in)tangible fixed assets excluding one-off items amounted to € 49.8 million (2015: € 45.8 million). Operating result Operating result excluding one-off items increased by € 15.8 million to € 120.3 million in 2016 (2015: € 104.5 million). One-off items In 2016, a positive total of € 9.4 million in one-off items was recorded on result after tax-level, consisting of the following components in excess of € 1 million: • Reversal of a previously recorded impairment of € 13.4 million for the lactide plant in Thailand as a result of the intended sale to the Total Corbion PLA bv joint venture. • One-off costs of € 4.9 million incurred due to the closure of the Kansas Avenue powder blending plant. • Impairment of € 3.0 million related to our succinic acid development as a result of an envisaged change in the production process. • One-off net gains of € 2.2 million related to the sale of our Breddo-Likwifier activities. • A one-off gain of € 1.1 million related to a partial reversal of impairment of a loan for beet growers following the sale of CSM Sugar in 2007. • Positive tax effects on the above items of € 1.7 million. 26 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance Financial income and charges Net financial charges increased by € 1.6 million to € 7.4 million in 2016 due to the higher net debt position during 2016. Taxes The tax charge on our operations in 2016 amounted to € 14.3 million (12.1% of result before tax). Excluding one-off items and the DTA revaluation, the normalized effective tax rate would have been 24.9%. The key driver for the decrease is the recording of previously non-valued deferred tax assets (DTA). Going forward, a normalized effective tax rate in the range of 25-30% is expected. Statement of financial position Capital employed including goodwill increased, compared to year-end 2015, by € 46.6 million to € 596.5 million. The movements were: Millions of euros Capital expenditure on (in)tangible fixed assets 51.0 Depreciation/amortization/(reversal of) impairment (in)tangibles -40.0 Change in operating working capital 10.8 Change in provisions and other working capital -3.1 Taxes 11.0 Exchange rate differences 20.8 Other -3.9 Total movement in capital employed including goodwill 46.6 Major capital expenditure projects in 2016 were the completion of the construction of an acid powder production line in the Netherlands, the construction of our PLA polymerization plant, the development of our gypsum-free lactic acid production technology, the consolidation of our US powder blending facilities, and investments in our US emulsifier plants to (i) eliminate partially hydrogenated oils from our products and (ii) prepare the start of the production of PGME, an emulsifier mostly used in sweet goods. Operating working capital increased by € 13.0 million to € 173.2 million. This increase is the balance of an increase of € 10.8 million before currency effects and a currency effect of € 2.2 million. Shareholders' equity increased by € 10.7 million to € 498.5 million. The movements were: • The positive result after taxes of € 103.6 million. • A decrease of € 50.0 million related to the share buyback. • A decrease of € 52.5 million related to the dividend for financial year 2015 and the special interim dividend. • Positive exchange rate differences of € 15.6 million due to the translation of equity denominated in currencies other than the euro. • Share-based remuneration costs of € 2.2 million charged to the result. • Negative movement of € 2.4 million in the hedge reserve. • Negative defined benefit plan effects and tax effects of € 5.8 million. At the year-end 2016 the ratio of balance sheet total to equity was 0.6x (year-end 2015: 0.6x) CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 27 Cash flow/financing Cash flow from operating activities increased compared to 2015 by € 12.3 million to € 122.6 million. This is the balance of the higher operational cash flow before movements in working capital and provisions of € 10.8 million, a positive impact of the movement in working capital and provisions of € 2.7 million, lower taxes of € 0.3 million, and higher interest paid of € 1.5 million. The cash flow required for investment activities decreased compared to 2015 by € 4.6 million to € 50.5 million. Capital expenditures accounted for most of this cash outflow, partly offset by a cash inflow from the divestment of our US-based Breddo-Likwifier activities in December 2016. The net debt position at the end of 2016 was € 98.0 million, an increase of € 35.9 million compared to year-end 2015, mainly due to capital expenditures, the regular dividend, the special interim dividend payment, and the share buyback, partly compensated by the positive cash flow from operating activities. At the year-end 2016 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 0.6x (year-end 2015: 0.4x). The interest cover for 2016 was 23.0x (year-end 2015: 25.5x). We continue to stay well within the limits of our financing covenants. Reservation and dividend policy Corbion’s reservation policy is aimed at creating and retaining sufficient financial capacity and flexibility to realize our strategic objectives while maintaining healthy balance sheet ratios. Corbion intends to add the profit (or charge the loss) to the company reserves after payment of the statutory dividend on financing preference shares and after deduction of the proposed dividend on ordinary shares. Events potentially impacting our financing requirements such as acquisitions, divestments, reorganizations, or other strategic considerations can lead to adjustments in the reservation amount and the reservation policy. As regards Corbion’s dividend policy, the amount and structure of dividend on ordinary shares that the company will pay to its shareholders depend on the financial results of the company, the market environment, the outlook, and other relevant factors. The current dividend policy is to pay out 35-45% of net profit adjusted for one-off items. Periodically Corbion will review its net debt position in relation to the investment plans, and decide upon potential additional distributions. Dividend and share buyback proposal Upon adoption of the financial statements, holders of financing preference shares will receive the statutory dividend. A proposal to distribute a regular dividend in cash of € 0.56 per ordinary share will be submitted for approval to the General Shareholders' Meeting to be held on 15 May 2017. This represents 35% of our net profit excluding one-off items. The dividend will be charged to the Corbion reserves. In addition to the regular dividend on ordinary shares, € 25 million is proposed to be distributed as an additional cash dividend of € 0.44 per ordinary share, payable at the same time as the regular dividend. The proposed additional cash dividend on ordinary shares will also be submitted for approval to the General Shareholders' Meeting. Corbion also intends to distribute € 25 million to shareholders in 2017 through a new share buyback program to be commenced in April 2017 and to be completed before the end of 2017. 28 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance Outlook 2017 Our expectations for 2017 are based on moderate global economic growth. We are confident in the execution of our Disciplined Value Creation strategy. In the Food business segment we anticipate a better sales growth performance in 2017 as the temporary adverse sales growth effects of the portfolio optimization are expected to fade out in the first half of 2017. The Biochemicals business segment is also expected to show an improved sales growth performance in 2017 compared to 2016. As a consequence, for Biobased Ingredients, we expect full-year growth to be within the multi-year average guidance range of 2-4%. We expect the portfolio changes initiated over 2016 to have a continued positive effect on our EBITDA margin in Biobased Ingredients. However, as the price of sugar cane, one of our main raw materials, increased over the course of 2016, we anticipate an adverse effect on our EBITDA margin in 2017. On balance we expect some EBITDA margin pressure and our EBITDA excluding one-off items for 2017 to be slightly below that of 2016. The EBITDA margin in Biobased Ingredients is expected to remain firmly above the 18% target level. Volatility in the EBITDA of Biobased Innovations will remain high due to irregular product and sales order patterns and spend phasing of our major innovation initiatives. Overall capital expenditure in 2017 is expected to be between € 60-70 million (including 50% share of PLA joint venture capital expenditure) . We will hold a Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter of 2017 to provide an update on our strategy progress, targets, and plans for the future. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 29 Sustainability performance Responsible sourcing A significant part of the environmental and social impact in our value chain is upstream of our own operations. To safeguard an overall positive environmental and social impact of our biobased products, we need to ensure our raw materials are sourced responsibly. Our responsible sourcing strategy focuses on our agricultural raw materials, which are the basis for our biobased solutions. A sustainable agricultural supply chain is essential for the communities in which we operate, as well as for our business. We focus on sugar cane, soy, corn, wheat, and palm oil, which represent some 90% of our agricultural raw materials by quantity. Corbion is not directly involved in the growing, harvesting, and processing of these crops. We therefore focus our efforts on our tier-1 suppliers, requiring them to implement sustainable practices further up the supply chain. Farmer Processor(s) Corbion • Growing • Extraction • Conversion • Harvesting • Processing into final products Security of supply Our security-of-supply assessment evaluates raw materials on three pillars: supply, quality and food safety, and sustainability. For each pillar, several criteria are rated to estimate the risk of supply issues. The business impact of a supply issue is taken into account to determine the overall score. The risk assessment results in a high, medium or low score for each pillar per raw material. All product-related raw materials have been evaluated for the first time in 2016 and will be re-assessed annually. For high risk-raw materials, mitigation plans have been developed and are being implemented. Mitigation actions range from the recruitment of new suppliers to supplier visits to perform a more detailed risk assessment. Supplier code Our supplier code defines what Corbion expects from its suppliers in terms of meeting our responsible sourcing commitment. The code includes principles and criteria for business ethics, human rights and labor conditions, and environmental practices. We require our suppliers to sign our supplier code for confirmation. More specifically, in 2016 we developed a cane sugar code, an extension of our supplier code which includes the topics mentioned above and additional principles and criteria relating to land rights, good agricultural practices, and biodiversity. It is based on the definitions for sustainable sugar cane and derived products as set out by Bonsucro, a global non-profit, multi-stakeholder organization founded by WWF in 2005 to advance more economically, environmentally, and socially responsible sugar production. If our direct suppliers are not involved in sugar cane farming, we expect them to implement the farming-related principles with the farmers they source from. Possible non-compliances with these codes will be investigated and discussed with the supplier. If deemed necessary, the supplier is expected to implement a corrective action plan to effectively and promptly resolve the issue, with an agreed timeline. If the issue persists, Corbion may ultimately decide to terminate the relationship with the supplier in question. In 2017, we will develop crop-specific codes for our other key agricultural raw materials as well as more detailed governance, including supplier selfassessments and audits. 30 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance KPI 2020 Target 2016 2015 % of raw materials assessed on security of supply1) 100% 100% % of raw materials covered by generic supplier code1) >90% 98% % of cane sugar covered by cane sugar code1) 100% 80% 1) by quantity. Resource-efficient operations We want to produce our products in the most efficient way possible. Minimizing the use of raw materials and energy has always been a priority, both from an environmental and cost perspective. In our more than 80 years’ history, we have continuously improved our yield and reduced our use of energy, and we will continue to look for opportunities for further optimization. Our “zero waste” ambition focuses on the reduction of waste by valorizing all our by-products, transitioning to renewable electricity, and designing out waste during process development. In this way, we maximize the value that we generate from the resources we consume. This ambition contributes to the shift from a linear economy, based on a “take-make-dispose” system to a circular economy that is waste-free and regenerative by design. In 2016 we have analyzed our resource-efficiency performance over the past years and developed action plans to achieve the first milestone of our zero waste ambition: zero landfill of valuable by-products. In our lactic acid production process we generate several side streams to remove impurities and obtain a high-quality product. Many of these side streams contain valuable components and we have been able to find outlets for most of them. An example is gypsum, which has many industrial applications, amongst others, in building and construction,as mineral filler, as oxidizing agent, and in agriculture. A significant amount of the gypsum that we produce is used in agriculture as soil conditioner and in the cement industry, replacing the use of mined, virgin gypsum. Occasionally however, gypsum and other by-products of lactic acid production do end up in landfill and we aim to avoid this in the future by developing new outlets and making lactic acid with our gypsum-free production process (to be used in new lactic acid plants). The amount of landfilled by-product increased to 31 kT in 2016. The fields to which we supply gypsum as soil conditioner were too wet for the trucks to get into, resulting in some landfill of gypsum. Our second milestone is the transition to renewable electricity. We have developed an action plan to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2020. To engage our employees on our zero waste ambition and to collect ideas, workshops were organized at all major Corbion locations, including manufacturing sites and sales offices. In total, more than 245 people were trained on sustainability and zero waste and more than 47 projects were defined, ranging from campaigns to shut down unused equipment in our labs to improved recycling in our offices, labs, and manufacturing. KPI 2020 Target 2016 2015 Renewable electricity 50% 19% Landfill of by-products 0% 31 kT 3.4kT Sustainable solutions It is our ambition to provide our customers with solutions based on renewable resources that enable them to reduce their environmental impact. Corbion’s products for the Food and Biochemical industries provide our customers not only with functional, but sustainability benefits as well. Our solutions for shelf-life extension can be used to optimize food distribution and reduce food waste, which helps to make food accessible and affordable. Food waste also has a tremendous environmental impact. Globally, food waste uses a quarter of all water used for agriculture, requires land area the size of China to grow, and contributes 8% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Our biochemicals and bioplastics support the transition to a circular CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 31 economy by offering an alternative for fossil-based resources, with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, toxicity, and waste generation. Plastic packaging currently is an iconic example of the linear economy, with 80-120 billion US dollar in material value loss annually, after a short first use. Increased recycling, combined with the use of biobased plastics to decouple plastics from fossil feedstocks, is critical to achieve the new plastics economy proposed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. In 2016 we have defined a new KPI to monitor our usage of biobased raw materials. Currently some 97% of our raw materials are biobased. As this is already a significant percentage, we do not consider it a priority at this time to improve it further. KPI 2020 Target 2016 2015 % innovation projects assessed on sustainability 100% 67% % biobased raw materials1) 97% 1) by quantity, based on biobased carbon content, excluding inorganic raw materials. Sustainability foundations To realize our sustainability ambitions, a strong foundation underpinned by high ethical standards which we have built over many years, is required. Employee engagement, labor practices, health and safety, human rights, quality and product safety are qualifiers of our business. Employee engagement At Corbion we want to create an excellent place to work, where our employees can unleash their potential, passion, pride, and talent to drive sustainable growth. We do this by supporting our people in the best way possible guided by the following principles: • Attract, deploy, and develop people on the basis of the talent and leadership required for current and future jobs. • Encourage and support opportunities for further business and personal growth, and offer challenging career opportunities. • Reward performance using an international-market-competitive remuneration framework. • Provide a working environment where our engaged workforce can unleash their potential, passion, pride, and talent. To prepare our staff to continuously adapt to the changes that arise in our industry we have designed and implemented specific global training/leadership programs, more notably the Global Sales Effectiveness Training and Leadership Development Programs. We also continued the existing performance management system and executed for the third time the review and succession planning of talent throughout the business, ensuring quality and timely succession within the critical positions. The four key Corbion behaviors (set clear direction, make the difference, focus on customers, and deliver through teamwork) have been integrated in our performance management system and leadership development program to fully support the execution of our “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy. A key success factor will be the achievement of the right level of engagement of all employees and the creation of a culture focused on execution and innovation. An annual cycle has been launched comprising an engagement survey, communication, and impact planning. In 2016 the second survey has taken place with a staff response rate of 90%. Early 2017, we will be conducting a third survey, giving a more firm indication of the progress made so far and setting the course and direction of our engagement effort for the rest of the year. Environment, health, and safety We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and other stakeholders. First and foremost, all of Corbion’s facilities comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the countries and communities where we operate. 32 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance Corbion aims to create a safe and healthy workspace with the goal of having zero incidents because we believe no job is so important that it cannot be done safely and without adverse environmental impact. We therefore operate with the greatest care for safety, health and the environment for our employees and the communities we engage with. Our activities are supported by a management system that includes policies, procedures, training, and feedback, which ascertain that we comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations and in accordance with our own corporate standards and codes. In 2016 we have implemented a global Environment, Health, and Safety policy to harmonize best practices at our facilities. Corbion leadership and employees are committed to achieving a “zero incident culture.” Corbion fosters an open and transparent culture by encouraging all employees to report, amongst others, all near misses and events in order to continuously improve our safety and environmental performance. Our LTIR (Lost Time Injury Rate per 200,000 hours worked) was 1.2 for the full year of 2016 (2015: 1.9). The LDR or Lost Day Rate decreased from 56.8 to 33.3. Our employee absentee rate was 2.0% overall compared to 1.8% in 2015. We record and investigate all incidents, including those with contractors, by determining the root cause and implementing corrective and preventive measures. We deploy Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems, such as ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Human rights We support the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the key conventions of the International Labor Organization, the OECD guidelines, and we are a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact. We integrate these principles into our business activities. Our Code of Business Conduct covers amongst others child and forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association. All of our sites are assessed through Sedex and regularly audited (4-Pillar Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit). Through our supplier code and our cane sugar code, we expect our suppliers to respect human rights in their operations. Quality We are committed to delivering high-quality solutions that safely meet our customer expectations and fulfilling our customer promise through quality and manufacturing systems and processes. On a local level we operate in compliance with local regulations and legislation, while ensuring certifications are in place to meet customer and industry-adopted standards and requirements, such as ISO 9001, GFSI (BRC, FSCC22000), GMP+, GMP Pharma, FDA Pharma, Halal, Kosher, non GMO, Organic, and most recently FSMA. In addition we host customer audits predominantly from our international pharmaceutical customers and large food clients. These, and our selfassessment audits performed by our global Quality platform, ensure that we continue to improve our operational standards for quality and food safety. In 2016, the main area of quality incidents was again related to transportation (documentation), distribution, and packaging. To address this a company-wide effort has been started to work with our third-party logistics providers and transportation companies to improve performance. At the same time broader training efforts have been made for proper root cause analysis to improve effectiveness of our corrective and preventive actions (CAPA). An enterprise quality management system (EQMS) has been implemented to create a global system for case registration, investigation and CAPA records, which will also act as a repository of critical Management of Change notifications. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 33 I create a sensory experience Margaret Walsh Senior Scientist Corbion North America Keep creating At Corbion we’re creating a better future together 34 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance More Star Trek than Star Wars… How did I get here? I grew up in Ohio and began my career in an academic role as an organic chemist – making the molecules that go into LCD displays. There were elements of the job I loved, for example looking at the breathtakingly beautiful liquid crystal patterns under the microscope; but eventually I decided it was time for a new challenge. So when a vacancy opened up at Corbion (then American Ingredients) back in 2003, I decided to take the plunge. What do I do? My focus is on the emulsifiers that we sell to several industries (both food and non-food) – ingredients and additives that improve the “sensory” qualities like the look, taste, and feel of finished products. Surprisingly there are quite a few similarities in the way that emulsifiers crystalize into different forms in much the same way that liquid crystals do. The big difference of course is that humans eat emulsifiers, which are combined in dough – which is full of ingredients that change at a molecular level flour, yeast, eggs, etc. That’s my challenge: studying how our emulsifiers behave inside the product, in production; and then making the necessary adjustments for large-scale production by our customers. The key word is consistency. Consumers expect each loaf to look, smell, and taste identical to the next one. Going the extra mile Our big “aha!” moment has been the development of the Ensemble emulsifier line, which replaces emulsifiers made from partially hydrogenated fats in bread products. As a business we began putting time, resources and investment into this long before competitors – conducting major trials and spending a lot of time getting the sensory qualities (especially taste of course) just right. It’s been a real labor of love but our work has paid dividends, and Ensemble is already becoming the gold standard. It’s incredibly rewarding to see customers incorporating this product into often very complex baking processes without missing a beat in terms of both production and the quality of the end product. The future In the first 13 years here I developed two or three new products. In the past two years I have developed six! It’s been crazy but I wouldn’t change it for anything. As a scientist I’ve enjoyed stepping outside the lab and working with new teammates. Science mustn’t be done in a vacuum (even though we do use a vacuum in our work!). As for the future, I’m not just a scientist but also a science fiction fan. I’m more Star Trek than Star Wars: I have an optimistic view of the future and will continue to be fascinated by how such very small amounts of emulsifiers can have such a hugely positive impact on foods. Margaret Walsh CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our performance 35 O UR GOV E RN AN CE Corporate governance Corbion recognizes the importance of good corporate governance and the principles contained within the Dutch corporate governance code 2008 (the “Code”), namely, that a company is a long-term partnership between various parties related to the company. Our management bears overall responsibility for balancing the interests of these parties, mostly with the aim of ensuring continuity of the company. At the same time, Corbion aims to create long-term value for its shareholders. Corbion is committed to embedding the Code principles within the company, thereby abiding by the core concepts of good business practices, integrity, openness, and transparent and well-supervised management. The full text of the Code can be viewed at: www.commissiecorporategovernance.nl. Compliance with the Code With the exception of the deviations outlined in the paragraphs below, Corbion endorses and adheres to the principles and best practices of the Code. Important changes in the corporate governance structure are presented to the General Shareholders’ Meeting for discussion. Our corporate governance policy, including the relevant regulations and reports, can be consulted on the Corbion website. Deviations from the Code With respect to best practice provision II.2.5 of the Code, Corbion applies share ownership requirements instead of holding restrictions. The Supervisory Board believes that a mandatory share ownership leads to a more sustainable build-up and alignment of the interests of the Board members and the shareholders. As long as a member of the Board of Management does not comply with the share ownership requirements, vested shares received under share plans will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded. Corbion departs from the provisions of the Code with regard to the possible financing of income tax on vested shares under the share plan by selling part of the vested shares. Regarding its composition, the Supervisory Board always tries to strike the right balance between (international) expertise and experience. Diversity in – a certain degree of – nationality, age and gender variation may be instrumental in achieving the desired balance in the composition of the Board. In this respect, the profile of Corbion's Supervisory Board deviates from best practice provision III.3.1 of the Code. The required expertise and experience, as well as the availability of the right candidates, are decisive when proposing candidates for (re) appointment. Corbion continues to pay close attention to diversity including gender diversity in the profiles of new Board of Management and Supervisory Board members in accordance with Section 2:166 Subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, although it currently does not strictly follow the recommendation for an explicit target on gender diversity yet and has not formulated concrete targets in this respect. A diversity policy including possible target (setting) ambitions will be further prepared in 2017. 36 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance There are two other aspects in which Corbion departs from the Code. The members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are appointed by the General Shareholders’ Meeting on the basis of nominations by the Supervisory Board. The Corbion Articles of Association state that the General Shareholders’ Meeting can overrule any such nomination by an absolute majority of the votes cast, provided the said majority represents at least one third of the issued capital. In contrast with the Code, no second meeting will be convened if there is no quorum, as a second meeting is not required by law. The General Shareholders’ Meeting may decide to suspend or dismiss a member of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast, provided the said majority represents at least one third of the issued capital. This quorum requirement does not apply if the proposal for suspension or dismissal is submitted by the Supervisory Board. In contrast with the Code, no second meeting will be convened if there is no quorum, as a second meeting is not required by law. Corporate governance statement The information and statement pursuant to the Decree to determine additional regulations regarding the content of the Report of the Board of Management (Vaststellingsbesluit nadere voorschriften inhoud bestuursverslag), have been published on Corbion’s website, www.corbion.com (Investor Relations, Corporate Governance). Structure Corbion nv is an international holding company as described by Section 153, Subsection 3 under b, of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The “large company” regime therefore does not apply to Corbion nv. Corporate governance relates to the management and supervision of the company, accountability, and the influence of stakeholders on decision-making. The Board of Management (Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) is entrusted with the management of the company. As per 1 January 2015, certain key officers have been appointed to manage the company together with the Board of Management. The members of the Board of Management and these key officers together constitute the Executive Committee. Under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, the members of the Executive Committee share responsibility for developing objectives and the strategy, determining the risk profile, and implementing strategic and operational policies. The Board of Management has ultimate responsibility for the company’s management and the external reporting and is answerable to shareholders of the company at the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. The independent Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management. From among its members, the Supervisory Board has appointed an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee, and a Science and Technology Committee. The Board of Management fulfills its duties by promoting the interests of Corbion and its businesses. These interests are understood as the interests of all stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and business and financial partners. Corbion is aware of its corporate and social responsibilities and is deeply committed to protecting the interests of the community. Corbion works on the principle that corporate management should consistently develop and implement corporate policies taking into account the long-term and continuity perspective. Corbion endorses the importance of clear accountability for its policies and the results thereof. Ordinary shares in Corbion are listed on the Euronext in Amsterdam. The financing preference shares are not listed. No restrictions apply to the transfer of shares. If a shareholder or group of shareholders acquires 30% or more of the share capital, the said shareholder or group of shareholders is required by law to make an offer for the entire outstanding capital. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance 37 Shareholders have voting rights in proportion to the number of shares held. The annual General Shareholders’ Meeting will be held within six months of the close of the financial year. At this meeting, the Report of the Board of Management and Financial Statements drawn up by the Board of Management will be presented for adoption, amongst other things. If requests are received from shareholders who individually or collectively represent at least 1% of the issued capital to place items on the General Shareholders’ Meeting agenda, these will be honored provided they are submitted to Corbion at least 45 days prior to the date of the meeting. Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meetings will be held as often as the Board of Management and Supervisory Board deem necessary. An Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting will also be held if one or more shareholders who collectively represent at least 10% of the issued capital submit a written request to this effect to the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board enclosing a detailed list of agenda items. If neither the Board of Management nor the Supervisory Board – which have equal powers in this matter – respond in such a way that this Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting can be convened within six weeks of the request, the applicants are at liberty to convene the meeting themselves and appoint a Chairman. With the exception of cases in which a larger majority is required by law or the Articles of Association, decisions at the General Shareholders’ Meeting will be taken by an absolute majority of the votes cast. Decisions to amend the Articles of Association and/or dissolve the company may only be taken at a General Shareholders’ Meeting in which at least two-thirds of the issued capital is represented and by a majority of at least three-quarters of the votes cast, unless the proposal has been submitted by all incumbent members of the Board of Management with the collective approval of all incumbent members of the Supervisory Board, in which case the decision may be taken by an absolute majority of votes, regardless of the represented capital. Risk management Risk management and internal control With worldwide operations in various markets and jurisdictions, Corbion needs to ensure timely identification and effective management of all significant risks inherent to the execution of its strategy and realization of its objectives. Corbion has an enterprise-wide risk management (ERM) in place to preserve its reputation, assets, competitive edge, and profits. ERM is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and addressing risks that may impact the achievement of corporate objectives. The Board of Management is responsible for the design, implementation, and operation of Corbion’s risk management and internal control system. Corbion has defined a governance model that identifies clear reporting and accountability structures in line with the Dutch corporate governance code 2008. Risk appetite Our risk appetite is the amount of risk we are willing to accept to achieve our strategic goals. This requires adequate understanding and awareness of potential risks and their magnitude within the company. The level of risk appetite is set by the Executive Committee, but for areas that are close to or exceeding our risk appetite, involvement of both Senior Management and Executive Committee will be required. Our risk appetite can be summarized as follows. Risk category Risk appetite Strategic/market risk Moderate to high: balancing risks and rewards to achieve our growth, innovation and sustainability objectives 38 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance Risk category Risk appetite Operational risk Low: safety-related issues Moderate: other areas with a focus on improving operational and functional excellence Financial/compliance risk Low: full compliance with legal and regulatory reporting (including financial reporting) The impact on EBITDA in millions of euros of a 1% change in net sales, costs, profit, and currency changes is reflected as follows: Change Approx. EBITDA impact (Millions of euros) Net sales +1% / 1% +/4.6 Gross profit +1% / -1% +/3.0 Operating costs (= selling expenses + R&D costs + G&A expenses) +1% / -1% +/1.5 USD +1% / -1% +/1.0 YEN +1% / -1% +/0.2 Risk management approach Our approach to risk management aims to achieve a reasonable level of assurance, in line with the Enterprise Risk Management framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO – ERM). Our approach aims to embed risk awareness and risk management at all levels of Corbion to ensure that risk decisions are taken and evaluated consciously and properly. Our risk management approach covers strategic/market, operational and financial/compliance risks, which can be illustrated as follows. Global control framework Strategic/Market Operational Financial/Compliance Entity-wide controls To embed risk awareness, constant management attention and communication coupled with risk management workshops are essential to identify critical risks for all our business activities. Awareness, identification of risks, and action plans to mitigate these risks are at the heart of our risk management program. The progress in risk mitigation is discussed on an ongoing basis between business management and the Executive Committee. Key risk areas Below a summary is provided of the main risks that have been identified for Corbion, including possible impact and mitigation measures taken to address them. We make a distinction between Corbion-specific risks and risks of a more generic nature, which are also applicable to Corbion. There may be other risks which are currently unknown to Corbion, or currently believed not to be material, but which could ultimately have a major impact on Corbion’s business, objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, or capital resources.

The outcome of these tests supports us to further strengthen our IT security levels. In addition we reduce our risk exposure by strengthening our passwords, by increasingly transitioning applications to safe cloud environments, and by continuously raising IT security awareness with our people (e.g. e-learning, communications).

Entity-wide controls Our entity-wide controls are not limited to those outlined in this section. Also, various examples of policies and procedures can be found which are implemented by local operating companies. Legal and regulatory review Local management is responsible for compliance with laws and regulations. The Legal Department is consulted by local management on an ongoing basis. Every six months, local management reports the main open legal issues exceeding € 100,000 to Corporate Legal and Corporate Finance. Letter of Representation Every six months, managing directors and finance directors of each reporting entity or, where applicable, other senior staff, provide a Letter of Representation to the Board of Management. This letter represents compliance with financial reporting and internal controls. Business Conduct Program Guided by the principles of the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, our Code of Business Conduct describes principles with respect to personal and business conduct, asset protection, employment standards, and environmental protection and sets out the expected standard of behavior of all Corbion employees. This Code serves as an umbrella for underlying policies which cover in more detail areas such as competition law, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, and insider trading. Corbion has a network of regional Business Conduct Coordinators who support embedding of the Code of Business Conduct and the underlying policies in the local operations. Besides this, they function as a local point of contact for management and staff. All Corbion employees need to follow annually a mandatory training (either through e-learning or class room training) with respect to the Code of Business Conduct. In addition, selected groups of employees need to follow every two years mandatory e-learning trainings with respect to anti-corruption and competition law. A breach of the Code of Business Conduct can lead to disciplinary actions, including termination of employment. Under the Corbion Speak Up Policy, Corbion employees are able to report (potential) violations of the Code of Business Conduct to their manager or a Business Conduct Coordinator. Next to that, the Corbion Speak Up Line, which is available 24/7 and operated by an independent service provider, allows employees to report issues anonymously. In 2016, four complaints with respect to the Code of Business Conduct were reported. Appropriate measures have been taken by management. Tax principles Corbion considers paying taxes an important part of our corporate social responsibility. Based on this, and derived from our Code of Business Conduct as part of our corporate governance structure, we have adopted the following tax principles. These tax principles deal with all different types of taxes which we are obliged to report and pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including taxes on profits, value added taxes, wage taxes, duties, and various other taxes. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance 43 Business rationale/transfer pricing Corbion’s tax strategy follows from and is aligned with the business strategy and objectives. Consequently, we aim to pay the appropriate amount of tax depending on where value is created in each of the jurisdictions we operate in, following the normal course of commercial activity, and in accordance with domestic and international rules and standards. All our intercompany transfer pricing and policies are based on the “arm’s length principle.” Compliance We act at all times in accordance with all applicable laws in which we are guided by the relevant local and international standards. Compliance is monitored within a global tax control framework. Corbion complies with its statutory obligations and aims to file all required tax-relevant information with the appropriate tax authorities in a timely, transparent, and complete manner. Tax-related disclosures are made in accordance with the relevant domestic regulations, as well as applicable reporting requirements under IFRS. Relationship with tax authorities We seek to develop mutually respectful relationships with the various national tax authorities based on trust and transparency. To accomplish this we aim for an open and constructive dialog with the various tax authorities on the basis of disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances. In the Netherlands we concluded a so-called tax covenant (“horizontal monitoring”) with the Dutch tax authorities. Such covenant entails that the tax authorities can rely on Corbion to provide upfront disclosure of all relevant information, while it allows Corbion to get upfront confirmation of applicable tax treatment. Tax governance Within the governance framework, the conduct of the group’s tax affairs and the management of tax risks are delegated to the group’s tax department with support and assistance from the group and local finance departments. The Audit Committee supervises the activities of the Board of Management with respect to the tax governance framework. Global control framework Business planning, budgeting, and management review Based on Corbion’s strategy and plans, targets are set for the annual budget. After determining these budgets, the targets are rolled out to the responsibility areas (business units, operations, etc.) within Corbion. Quarterly updated estimates are made based on a forecast until the end of the year. Forecasts are specifically discussed between responsibility area leaders and the Board of Management. The Board of Management monitors business performance on a monthly and quarterly basis using a defined set of key performance indicators and reviews of actual results versus budgets, quarterly estimates, and the previous year. Local entities are visited frequently. Operational management meets at least once a month to discuss the strategy and related risks, the actual performance versus budget, and other significant matters in their respective areas. Financial control framework As Corbion operates worldwide, it is committed to maintaining high-quality, reliable financial reporting, and a good control environment. All reporting entities assess operational effectiveness of their financial closing and reporting processes, at mid-year and end-of-year, confirming compliance with the relevant guidelines and IFRS. Together with the Letters of Representation, this ensures the integrity of our financial reporting. During 2016 our main legal entities performed quarterly assessments of the effectiveness of their key financial process controls. The assessments have been included in internal audits and used as a starting point by external auditors. Improvement recommendations based on audit findings are followed up by local management, the status of which is being monitored regularly by the Board of Management. 44 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance Insurance Insurance is an integral part of our risk management approach as it is an instrument to manage the financial consequences of risks. The choice to obtain external insurance cover depends on the cost efficiency of the instrument. The coverage of insurances is monitored and benchmarked regularly. Internal audit Internal audit supports the organization in accomplishing its objectives by providing a systematic, disciplined approach for the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of our internal control and governance processes. The Internal Audit Charter is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee annually. The objective of internal audit is to provide a broad range of audit services designed to assist the Board of Management in controlling the business operations. It provides independent, risk-based objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value to the organization. Internal audit evaluates risks and ensures that the controls in place are adequate to mitigate the risks identified by management, identifying best practices, and recommending improvement opportunities to management. Internal audit at Corbion is based on a guest auditor and co-sourcing model where internal / external professionals provide the Internal Audit Director with specialized knowledge and capacity flexibility. Audit results are reported to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee. External audit Our external financial audit engagement ensures that all main entities are audited by the external auditor either for statutory and/or group purposes. The focus of the external auditor’s work is the financial reporting with the objective of providing a reasonable basis for the audit opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial position of our company. In control statement Corbion’s risk management and internal control systems are designed to identify in a timely manner the risks inherent to our strategic, operational, and financial reporting and compliance objectives and to determine appropriate risk responses as described above. Risk management and actions taken in the year under review were reported to and discussed by the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee. Internal representations received from management, regular management reviews, evaluations of the design and implementation of our risk management and internal control systems, and business and Audit Committee reviews are an integral part of the company’s risk management approach. It should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide certainty as to the realization of strategic, operational, and financial business objectives, nor that they can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. On the basis thereof, the Board of Management believes to the best of its knowledge that the internal risk management and control systems with respect to the financial reporting have adequately performed in 2016 and that these systems provide a reasonable level of assurance against inaccuracies of material importance in the financial reporting. There are no indications that the systems would not be adequate in 2017. All in all, the Board of Management is of the opinion that it has fulfilled the best practice provision II.1.4 of the Dutch corporate governance code 2008 with due observance of the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Commission.

Further, to the best of our knowledge the Annual Report gives a true and fair view of the position of Corbion as at the balance sheet date, and of the development during the financial year of Corbion and its group companies included in the Financial Statements, together with a description of principal risks Corbion faces. The members of the Board of Management have signed the Financial Statements pursuant to their statutory obligations under Section 101 Subsection 2 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and Section 25c Subsection 2 sub c of Chapter 5 of the Financial Markets Supervision Act (“Wet op het financieel toezicht”).

Rezlyn Chua CRM Analyst Corbion Asia Keep creating At Corbion we’re creating a better future together CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance 47 How many languages can you say “hello” in? How did I get here? How does a girl from Singapore end up working in Eastern Thailand? It’s quite simple really. After leaving college my first job was with a major electronics company. I realized that I wanted a job that involved talking to customers every day and solving their problems. So last year, when Corbion offered me the chance to work in Customer Relationship Management and Quality Assurance for their lactic acid operation in Thailand, I took it. What do I do? Across the whole of Asia from Australia and Japan to India – it’s my job to work with customers and our production facility to make sure that we can provide the product they want, when they want it. I’m often the first line of defense. So when a customer has a question about an order, a product its ingredients, or delivery… they often come to me first and then I go to my teammates to get the answer. What makes this a challenge is the diversity – across huge distances and very different cultures. I’ve learned how to say “hello” in a dozen different languages! Going the extra mile One time we had a customer in Australia who had omitted key information from their product order. They believed they were receiving a major product delivery from us, but they weren’t! Suddenly we needed to tear up our very carefully planned production forecasting and inventory and find a way of moving their order forward. This involved lots of frantic calls and emails both within Corbion and with the customer (four hours ahead of us) but we solved it and got their delivery to them on time. That’s what makes this a satisfying job. The future The more successful we are in the region, the more of a challenge our supply chain operation becomes. I would love to eventually become a buyer or planner at Corbion and take the next step in meeting that challenge. But for now I love being in Thailand and working with some wonderful people. Not for nothing is it known as the land of 1,000 smiles! Rezlyn Chua 48 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Our governance RE PO RT OF TH E S U P E RV I S O RY BOARD Overview 2016 In 2016, Corbion continued to execute its strategy “Disciplined Value Creation,” leading amongst others to the announcement that Total and Corbion will create a 50/50 joint venture to produce and market polylactic acid (PLA) polymers. The joint venture will combine Total’s technical and marketing knowledge and leading position in polymers with Corbion’s expertise in lactic acid and biopolymers, and is expected to accelerate market adoption of the innovative products it will supply. The Supervisory Board is pleased that Marcel Wubbolts joined Corbion as Chief Technology Officer as per 1 November 2016. In this capacity, Mr. Wubbolts is a member of Corbion’s Executive Committee and responsible for Corbion’s global R&D organization. He will be driving the innovation and technology agenda enabling business development opportunities to support the company’s growth journey. From a financial perspective, 2016 was a good year, with strong improvements in EBITDA,EBITDA margins, ROCE, and EPS. On 28 October 2016 Corbion successfully completed its € 50 million share buyback program that commenced on 21 March 2016. The share buyback program was part of Corbion’s commitment to return € 75 million to its shareholders in 2016 through a € 25 million additional cash dividend and a € 50 million share buyback program. The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Committee and all Corbion employees around the world for their dedication, loyalty, and hard work in 2016. Meetings of the Supervisory Board During the reporting year the Supervisory Board held six regular meetings with the Board of Management and four conference-call meetings. The discussions at these meetings covered frequently recurring topics, such as the strategy execution, the Corbion portfolio, developments in financial results, business developments in the business units and operating companies, trends in the markets where Corbion operates, key investments, group risks, internal risk management and control systems, the outcome of the evaluation by the Board of Management of the set-up and operation of these control systems, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, organizational and people readiness, succession planning, the organizational top structure, acquisitions and divestments, the Financial Statements, the Annual report, and the succession of the CTO. In addition, the Supervisory Board discussed in great detail the joint venture with Total. Prior to its regular meetings with the Board of Management the Supervisory Board also met in the absence of the Board of Management to discuss, amongst others, developments in the financial results, and the profile, composition, and performance of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board conducted a self-evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees and that of its members, supported by an independent external specialist. The review was based on the feedback provided in the previous year and a number of business CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board 49 challenges in the year under review. All findings were formally reported and discussed in the full Supervisory Board. The review showed that the feedback in the previous year (on succession planning, permanent education, and informal interaction) was addressed properly. The business challenges (addressing strategy, succession planning, and composition of the Supervisory Board) indicated that the Supervisory Board received timely and adequate information, enabling it to cooperate professionally and constructively when needed. Focus points for 2017 relate to the continued monitoring of strategy execution and leadership, with a special focus on diversity. Attendance at the in-person meetings held in 2016 was 100%. Attendance at the conferencecall meetings was almost 100%; in one instance one member was not able to attend and he provided input in advance and designated another Supervisory Board member to proxy for him. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board regularly met with the CEO, either in person or by phone. Also in this very intensive and important year for Corbion, all Supervisory Board members were able to make themselves sufficiently available to give adequate attention to the needs of Corbion. Members of the Supervisory Board regularly met with the members of the Executive Committee, business leaders, and members of corporate staff. Composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board consists of: M.F.J.P. Vrijsen, Chairman R.H.P. Markham, Vice-Chairman M.E. Doherty J.P. de Kreij S. Riisgaard Mr. R. Pieterse stepped down at the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of 12 May 2016, after twelve years of distinguished service to the company, in various Supervisory Board membership roles. The Supervisory Board has benefited immensely from his extensive management and financial experience and would like to thank him for his contribution. Regarding its composition the Supervisory Board always tries to strike the right balance between (international) expertise and experience. A certain degree of nationality, age and gender variation may be instrumental in achieving the desired balance in the composition of the Board. Required expertise and experience as well as the availability and diversity of the right candidates will be decisive when proposing candidates for (re)appointment. In the judgment of the Supervisory Board all its members are independent as required by the Dutch corporate governance code 2008. Committees of the Supervisory Board Audit Committee The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. J.P de Kreij (Chairman), Mrs. M.E. Doherty, and Mr. R. Pieterse (until 12 May 2016). In 2016 the Audit Committee met six times in the presence of the CFO, the external auditor, the VP Group Finance, and the Senior Director Internal Audit. The agenda at these meetings covered, amongst others, the annual and half-year figures, the interim management statements, accounting issues, the operation of the internal risk management and control systems, tax matters, the financing plan, treasury, status of legal 50 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board claims and litigations, status of the business conduct program, information technology developments and organization, and the reports of the internal and external auditors. The Audit Committee closely monitors the independence of the external auditor. It evaluates the performance of the external auditor on a yearly basis and where appropriate recommends the replacement of the external auditor. Furthermore, approval of the Audit Committee is required with respect to the fees for all audit services to be performed by the external auditor as requested by the Board of Management. The Audit Committee acts as the principal contact for the external auditor in case of irregularities in the content of financial reports. Nomination Committee The Nomination Committee consists of Messrs. M.F.J.P. Vrijsen (Chairman), R.H.P. Markham, and S. Riisgaard. The Nomination Committee met five times in 2016 in the presence of the EVP Human Resources. It discussed amongst other subjects the succession planning and composition of, and changes in the Supervisory Board, the performance of the Board of Management and its members, talent management, succession planning, the people strategy, and the succession of the CTO. Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists of Messrs. R.H.P. Markham (Chairman), M.F.J.P. Vrijsen, and S. Riisgaard. The Remuneration Committee met five times in 2016 in the presence of the EVP Human Resources, and discussed amongst other subjects the remuneration of the Board of Management, the level of achievement of the 2015 Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) targets for the members of the Board of Management, the progress of the STIP 2016 targets and the targets of the running Long-Term Incentive Plan programs, and the target setting for STIP 2017 and for the LTIP 2016-2019. Science and Technology Committee The Science and Technology Committee consists of Messrs. S. Riisgaard (Chairman) and M.F.J.P. Vrijsen. The Science and Technology Committee met four times in 2016 in the presence of the CTO (or his replacement) and members of the R&D leadership team. The agenda at these meetings covered, amongst other subjects, new technologies, PLA production and application, Food applications, Biochemicals and Medical Biomaterials, and external technology trends. Financial Statements, 1 January 2016 31 December 2016 The Financial Statements prepared by the Board of Management for the financial year 2016 have been audited and certified by KPMG Accountants N.V. The auditor’s findings on the Financial Statements have been discussed with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has accepted the Financial Statements and recommends that they be adopted by the General Shareholders’ Meeting. The members of the Supervisory Board have signed the Financial Statements pursuant to their statutory obligation under Section 101 Subsection 2 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Remuneration policy and report Remuneration policy and its implementation in 2016 To ensure Corbion’s development as a successful biobased ingredients and biotechnology company, the objective of the remuneration policy for the Board of Management is to create competitive remuneration packages and employment conditions, which align the interests of the Board of Management with the strategic direction and horizon of the company, with a strong CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board 51 emphasis on performance-related pay. The policy is in place since 2015 and was approved by the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting (AGM) in that same year. As we have described the full policy on our website www.corbion.com, this section only describes the highlights as applied in 2016. Remuneration reference levels The total compensation levels (base salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentive, and pay mix) are based on a combined reference group of European biotechnology companies and Dutch general industry companies (AMX and smaller AEX). Every two years a reference check will be performed to align the total compensation levels with market levels, for the first time in 2017. Base salary Members of the Board of Management are entitled to a base salary. Based on median market data the base salary for the CEO will be set between € 500,000 and € 600,000. For the CFO base pay is set between € 300,000 and € 400,000. The individual pay of the Board members will be determined by the Supervisory Board within the boundaries of the aforementioned ranges (from time to time). There are no automatic annual increases in the base salary levels. Per 1 April 2016, the annual base salary for Mr. De Ruiter (CEO) is € 550,000 and for Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot (CFO) € 350,000. Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) Members of the Board of Management are entitled to a short-term incentive. The STIP rewards operational execution and is aimed at strengthening and growing the Corbion business. It is determined by two financial targets: EBITDA and earnings per share (EPS) (both as defined in the policy). EBITDA will account for 70% of the total STIP; the remaining 30% will be determined by EPS. A range of 30% around each performance target (or such lower percentage as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set annually to determine the actual payout. The STIP payout at target level is set at 50% of base salary for the CEO, and 40% for the CFO. For 2016, the Supervisory Board applied the range of 30% for actual payout as follows: the threshold level was set at 85% and the maximum level at 115% for each target. An actual payout level of 114.5% has been achieved for the EBITDA target and a maximum payout level for EPS in the reporting year. This has led to a total payout of 125.2% of the attarget STIP for both Mr. De Ruiter and Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) The long-term incentive for the Board of Management is aimed at longer-term value creation in line with shareholders’ interests, measured over a performance period of three calendar years. To ensure that short-term performance also leads to sustainable long-term value creation, the LTIP measurement is fully aligned with the STIP: EBITDA and EPS account for 60% respectively 20% of the LTIP. In addition, 20% of the LTIP is determined by relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as compared to a specific TSR peer group. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 100% of base salary. The CFO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 80% of base salary. Meeting the performance target(s) will result in an LTIP payout at target level. A range of 50% around the performance target(s) (or such lower percentage as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set for the EBITDA and EPS performance to determine the actual payout. For TSR performance, threshold payout is set at meeting the eighth position in the peer group. Based on independent analysis by a leading bank in the Netherlands the TSR performance of Corbion versus the TSR peer group will be assessed after the three-year performance period. The number of performance shares conditionally granted to Mr. De Ruiter in 2016 (possible 52 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board vesting in 2019) is 27,404 representing a value of € 550,000 at the time of granting. The number of performance shares conditionally granted to Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot in 2016 (possible vesting in 2019) amounts to 13,951 representing a value of € 280,000 at the time of granting. Benefits allowance As a consequence of the use of executive assignment agreements, the company does not provide (social) benefits such as a company car, individual retirement, and medical or life insurance to Board members. That is why each Board member is provided with a benefit allowance. This is a fixed annual amount of € 200,000 for a CEO with an international background and € 100,000 for the CFO, to cover the cost of these expenses. Corbion does not grant loans to members of the Board of Management. There are no outstanding loans. Other compensation Mr. De Ruiter is entitled to a one-off time-restricted performance share award equivalent to a target value of € 2 million in Corbion shares to vest over three years, as of 1 January 2015 (this award was granted in 2014 and amended in 2015 by the AGM). The award bridges part of the compensation gap between the United States and the Netherlands. The award encourages delivering a growing, increasingly profitable, and sustainable business portfolio. The award will vest only if a minimum target (EBITDA growth, as defined in the share award) is achieved each year. If performance falls below target, no shares will vest. For at-target or above-target performance, the target number of shares (representing a value of one-third of the aggregate amount of € 2 million) will vest. The Supervisory Board has set long-term innovation milestones which allow for an additional vesting of up to 25% of the total number of shares. At the end of the three-year performance period, the Supervisory Board will determine whether these long-term innovation milestones have been reached. The award is subject to the general share-ownership requirement of two times the annual base salary; as long as Mr. De Ruiter does not comply with this share-ownership requirement, vested shares under this share award will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded. For 2016, the minimum target was achieved leading to the vesting of 39,897 shares to Mr. De Ruiter in 2017. Remuneration for the Board of Management The total annual remuneration for the Board of Management in 2016 amounted to € 2,602 thousand including STIP over 2016 (2015: € 1,773 thousand). The table below shows the amounts which the respective Board member (i) received/was entitled to in 2016 (base salary, STIP, benefits allowance, relocation costs) and (ii) received/was entitled to in 2016 by way of vesting (LTIP, special share award).

Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 3 March 2017 On behalf of the Supervisory Board M.F.J.P. Vrijsen CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board 55 I create zero waste by recycling residue. Fernando Costa Environmental Health and Safety Manager Corbion Brazil Keep creating At Corbion we’re creating a future where nothing is wasted 56 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board Plastic, wood, paper and metal are no longer going to landfill How did I get here I’m a Brazilian, and graduated as a mechanical and safety engineer and specialist in Environmental issues. I joined Corbion in 2005 as total productive maintenance (TPM) coordinator and from there I moved to the quality assurance department where I dealt with our various certifications such as ISO 9001, kosher, and halal. Then in 2009 I was given the task of implementing our environmental practices at the Campos plant – and particularly a recycling program to help us dispose of various types of waste residue more efficiently. What do I do? To put it simply, in our manufacturing facility we have 77 different residues that are produced, and that therefore need to be disposed of – ranging from plastic to metal to oil and carbon. I’m proud to say that today, Corbion Campos has practices in place to control 100% of residues generated from our processes. The residue is destinated according to legal requirements. Wood from empty pallets is donated to a local furniture company. Our waste plastic and paper is recycled with the profits going to the local community. Most importantly, only 10% of our waste residue is put into landfill, and the focus is to reduce this number dayby-day. Going the extra mile Beyond recycling we run a social responsibility program here at Campos that helps us contribute further to preserving the local environment. For example, we have a tree-planting project where over the past five years we have planted 1,300 new trees in a park about 20km from the factory. It’s not specifically a Corbion area, it’s for everyone to enjoy; and that’s a really satisfying thing. The future Rather than recycling, our focus is now shifting towards prevention – for example, reduction of amount of plastic cups we use, and subsequently throw way. It’s about education of our people and contractors – both the head and the heart. And I’m pleased to say the message is getting through. From a recycling point of view we will continue striving to improve as part of Corbion’s zero waste project. My ultimate goal is for us to achieve zero landfill. As for me personally…I’m very happy to be doing something I love and that makes a difference to the world around me. Fernando Costa CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 report of the supervisory board 57 SUSTAINABI L ITY STATE M E N TS Materiality and stakeholder engagement The foundation of our updated sustainability strategy is the materiality matrix, which we use to set priorities and ensures that we take a focused approach. A materiality analysis is about the identification of key issues that are important to our stakeholders and our strategy. The materiality matrix visualizes the results of this analysis, by plotting the relevant social, environmental, governance and economic issues as a function of their importance to stakeholders (vertical axis) and Corbion’s strategy (horizontal axis). In 2015 we updated our materiality matrix using an in-depth methodology (see Figure 1). We increased the number of issues in the evaluation to get a more detailed picture of their relative importance. To determine the relevance of these issues to our stakeholders, we conducted interviews with representatives of each stakeholder group (see Figure 2) to understand their expectations. Generally, our stakeholders really appreciated this opportunity to share their views and recommendations. We will continue this dialog to keep our assessment up to date and to signal emerging issues in time. Combined with our internal assessment of the importance of the issues to our strategy, this resulted in the identification of six material themes, which are the six themes in the upper right quadrant of the matrix. These six themes have a high impact on our strategy and are considered important by the majority of our stakeholders. Figure 3 provides an overview of the priority themes per stakeholder group, for the stakeholders that have a high impact on Corbion and vice versa. Each of the material themes is considered a priority for 3 to 4 high impact stakeholders. Each stakeholder also indicated some specific topics that are relevant to them, but not considered material overall. In 2017 we will update the materiality matrix, as input for our next strategy update. 58 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 sustainability statements Materiality matrix Sustainable supply chain Transparency Product environmental impact Resource-efficiency Renewable resources Innovation Importance to stakeholders Land use Safe, affordable, and healthy food Occupational health and safety Emissions Product safety Product quality and performance Bioethics and genetechnology Food waste Community engagement Human rights Economic performance Biodiversity Anti-corruption Talent attraction, Contribution to public debate development, and retention Partnerships Grievance mechanisms Employment Fair competition Employee engagement Privacy Fair taxes Remuneration policy Advocacy Diversity Importance to Corbion strategy Responsible sourcing Resource-efficient operations Sustainable solutions Other topics The materiality determination process (Fig.1) 1  Long and short list of themes: we have compiled a long list of relevant sustainability themes based on GRI indicators, benchmarking, and stakeholder input.

This responsibility is anchored in business targets and personal targets at various levels in the organization. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 sustainability statements 63 Reporting policy Our sustainability reporting is based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). For this report, the core option of the GRI G4 guidelines has been used. As required by the GRI G4 guidelines, the selection of topics is based on a materiality assessment (see Materiality). Additionally, we report on a number of themes such as occupational health and safety, quality, and product safety, which we consider qualifiers of our business. The environmental and social results for both the material topics and additional themes in this report include all entities that belong to the scope of the consolidated financial statements. The scope of the environmental data includes Corbion’s manufacturing sites. Offices and R&D laboratories are not included, except for our R&D laboratories and offices located at our Gorinchem and Totowa manufacturing sites. Please refer for our reporting approach on acquisitions and disinvestments to Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements. The sustainability results follow the same principles as our financial results. Data is collected from various reporting systems. For each KPI, data reporters, data reviewers, and data owners are defined, either at site level or at corporate level. The data reporter is responsible for the annual reporting of the data via the central reporting systems and for document retention and record-keeping related to this data. The data reviewer (from Finance) is responsible for the validation of the reported data. The data owner reviews and signs off. Site-specific data is consolidated and reviewed at corporate level by Finance and the Sustainability team. The review includes a comparison to data from previous years and a review of changes that could have impacted the results, such as improvement projects. In case of uncertainties, data estimation may be required, which is validated during review. We strive to continuously improve the data collection process and the reliability of the data. Significant changes that impact comparability including changes in measurement methods are explained in footnotes. There were no major changes in our sustainability policy in 2016. The sustainability sections of this report have not been reviewed by external auditors. This year we put effort into improving the quality of our reporting processes and next year we aim for assurance on the KPIs related to responsible sourcing, resource-efficient operations, and sustainable solutions. 64 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 sustainability statements Environmental performance Our resource-efficiency KPIs measure the performance of all of our operations on energy usage, water consumption, waste generation, and emissions. Our total energy consumption is comparable to 2015. In contrast to previous years, in 2016 our specific energy consumption increased by 2.3%, due to changes in our product mix. Some of our new product introductions require additional processing, which increases the energy consumed per ton. An example is the production of lactide at our manufacturing site in Rayong, Thailand. The production of lactide from lactic acid requires additional energy. Our energy savings projects (see Our ambitions and what we achieved in 2016) were not able to compensate for this extra consumption. For the same reason, our specific Scope I, II and Scope III GHG emissions increased as well. Our total water consumption decreased by 1.1%, due to various water savings projects (see Our ambitions and what we achieved in 2016). The specific water consumption slightly increased. Our overall waste generation increased by 26% due to changes in product mix. The majority of this waste, some 83%, is recycled. The amount of landfilled by-product increased to 31 kT. The fields to which we supply gypsum as soil conditioner were too wet for the trucks to get into, resulting in some landfill of gypsum.

This includes scope I emissions from direct production (for natural gas), scope II emissions from purchased energy (for electricity and purchased steam), and scope III emissions related to purchased goods and services, fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation, downstream transportation, business travel, and employee commuting. Biogenic emissions (mainly related to the consumption of biogas and to waste water treatment) are not reported. 3) Definition adjusted. Total water withdrawal is the sum of the water withdrawn from rivers, aquifers, rainwater reservoirs, municipal water supplies, including purchased steam. 4) Sum of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Waste means any substance or object arising from our routine operations which we discard or intend to discard, or we are required to discard. 5) Valuable by-products generated in the production of lactic acid.

New and amended standards adopted by the group In 2016, Corbion applied all the new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), if and insofar as these applied to Corbion and were effective as at 1 January 2016. 78 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The main effective changes applied by Corbion at 1 January 2016 are: Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle Corbion applied the amendments to IFRSs included in the Annual improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle for the first time in the reporting year. The application of the amendments had no impact on the disclosures or amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted None of the new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations not yet effective, have been applied by Corbion. The main effective changes after 1 January 2017 are: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9, issued in July 2015, replaces most of the guidance in IAS 39. IFRS 9 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to endorsement in certain territories. Corbion does not expect any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from this standard. IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much, and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts, and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. Corbion is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from this standard. So far, Corbion does not expect any significant impact. IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16, published in January 2016, establishes a revised framework for determining whether a lease is recognized on the (consolidated) statement of financial position. It replaces existing guidance on leases, including IAS 17. IFRS 16 is effective on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. Corbion is assessing the impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16. Corbion anticipates that the application of all other new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations currently known for future periods will have no significant impact on its financial statements. Consolidation The consolidation includes the financial data of Corbion nv and its group companies (together “Corbion”). All inter-company receivables, debts, and transactions have been eliminated. Group companies are companies in which Corbion nv exercises control. The results of acquisitions and divestments are recognized from the moment that control is obtained or transferred. Control is achieved when Corbion: • has power over the investee; • is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Corbion reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. When Corbion loses control over a group company, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the group company, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 79 Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former group company is measured at fair value when control is lost. Foreign currency The consolidated financial statements are in euros. The euro is Corbion nv’s functional and presentation currency. The functional currency is the currency of the primary environment where the group company operates and may therefore differ from one company to another. Transactions in other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rates that apply on the transaction date. Any monetary assets and liabilities resulting from such transactions are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Any exchange rate differences are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. The assets and liabilities of consolidated foreign group companies and the long-term foreigncurrency loans, which have been taken out to finance these subsidiaries, are converted into euros on the balance sheet date, taking taxes into account. The subsequent currency translation differences are incorporated in the translation reserve in equity. The results of the foreign group companies are translated into euros on the basis of average exchange rates. The difference between net profit on the basis of average exchange rates and net profit on the basis of the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date is incorporated in the translation reserve in equity. The same applies to exchange rate differences arising from borrowings and other financial instruments if they hedge the currency risk related to net investments. If a foreign operation is divested or scaled down the associated cumulative currency translation differences are recognized as result in the income statement. Property, plant, and equipment Land, buildings, machinery and equipment, and other operating assets are valued at the acquisition price or the cost of production, subject to straight-line depreciation calculated over the estimated economic life and the estimated residual value. The cost of production includes the cost of materials and direct labor and an attributable part of the indirect costs. Land is not depreciated. Grants are deducted from the acquisition price or the production costs of the assets to which the grant relates. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to Corbion. Depreciation methods, useful lives, and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is valued at cost less impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually – or more often if there are indications for impairment. Impairment is the amount by which the book value of the goodwill of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, being the higher of (a) value in use and (b) fair value less cost to sell. The value in use is the present value of the cash flows which the unit is expected to generate. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. If impairment is incurred, the impairment is charged to the income statement. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. 80 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements When an entity or activity is sold or closed down the goodwill allocated to the entity or activity is included in the calculations for the result of the sale. Customer base The customer base comprises the part of the paid acquisition sum which, upon acquisition, is allocated to the value of the acquired customer base. It is valued at fair value as at the acquisition date and amortized using a straight-line method over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from the customer base are recognized in selling expenses. Brands and licenses Brands and licenses comprise the part of the paid acquisition sum which is allocated to the value of the acquired trademarks and product licenses. Brands and licenses are valued at fair value as at the acquisition date and are subject to straight-line amortization calculated over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from brands and licenses are recognized in selling expenses. Research and development costs Research and development costs comprise the part of the paid acquisition sum which is allocated to the value of the acquired research and development costs. These costs are valued at fair value as at the acquisition date. Own research costs are not capitalized, but charged to the income statement. Own development costs are capitalized if the appropriate criteria are met. Research and development costs are valued at cost and amortized using a straightline method over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from research and development costs are recognized in research and development costs. Other intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets consist primarily of capitalized or acquired third-party software and licenses. Other intangible fixed assets are valued at historical cost if capitalized or at fair value if acquired and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life. Software and licenses amortization charges are recognized in general and administrative expenses. Emission rights are not recognized in the statement of financial position as cost is zero. Impairment of non-current assets other than goodwill At each reporting date an assessment is made whether there is any indication that non-current assets may be impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. If it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less cost to sell and the asset’s value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement to the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 81 In subsequent years, an assessment is made whether indications exist that impairment losses previously recognized for non-current assets other than goodwill may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that asset is recalculated and, if required, its carrying amount is increased to the revised recoverable amount. The increase is recognized in operating income as an impairment reversal. An impairment reversal is recognized only if it arises from a change in the assumptions that were used to calculate the recoverable amount. The increase in an asset’s carrying amount due to an impairment reversal is limited to the depreciated amount that would have been recognized had the original impairment not occurred. Investments in joint arrangements and associates Investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. Joint operations arise where Corbion has rights to the assets and obligations relating to the arrangement and therefore accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Joint ventures arise where Corbion has rights to the net assets of the arrangement and therefore equity accounts for its interest. Associates are entities over which Corbion has significant influence but not control, generally involving a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or joint control over those policies. Associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures and associates are measured initially at cost and subsequently adjusted for post-acquisition changes in Corbion’s share of the net assets of the investment (net of any accumulated impairment in the value of individual investments). Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial figures of joint ventures and associates to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of Corbion. Unrealized gains on transactions between Corbion and its joint ventures and associates are eliminated to the extent of Corbion’s stake in these investments. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the assets transferred. Deferred taxes Deferred taxes concern tax loss carry forward and liabilities and assets arising from temporary differences between the tax bases and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of (in-)tangible fixed assets, inventories, and provisions. Deferred taxes are determined using tax rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized if and insofar that is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference and tax loss carry forward can be utilized. Tax assets and liabilities are netted when there is a legal right and the intention to offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities with the same term and relating to the same fiscal unities are offset against each other. Inventories Inventories of raw materials, consumables, technical materials, and packaging are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) and net realizable value. Inventories of work in progress and finished products are stated at the lower of production cost and net realizable value. Total cost of production includes payroll costs and materials and an attributable part of the indirect production costs. 82 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when Corbion becomes a party to the contractual provisions of a financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or if the company transfers the financial asset to another party and does not retain control of substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognized when Corbion’s obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or canceled. At initial recognition, management classifies the company’s financial assets as either (i) at fair value through profit or loss, (ii) loans and receivables, (iii) held to maturity, or (iv) available for sale, depending on the underlying purpose of the acquired financial assets. Financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For instruments not classified as at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable transaction costs are initially recognized as part of the asset value. Directly attributable transaction costs related to financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are expensed when incurred. The fair value of quoted investments is based on current bid prices. If the market for a financial asset is not active, or if the financial asset represents an unlisted security, Corbion establishes fair value using valuation techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s-length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, and discounted cash flow analysis, making maximum use of market inputs. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets are measured as described below. At each balance sheet date, Corbion assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. Investments at fair value through profit or loss Investments at fair value through profit or loss are investments held for trading or designated as such by Corbion. A financial asset is classified as held for trading if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the short term. Derivatives are classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Financial instruments held for trading are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognized in the income statement. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in current assets, except for loans and receivables with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Held-to-maturity financial assets Held-to-maturity financial assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity that the company intends to hold to maturity. They are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. They are included in current assets, except for held-to-maturity financial assets with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category of financial assets or not classified in any of the other categories. They are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices with changes therein recognized directly in equity until the investment is derecognized or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded in equity is transferred to the income statement. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. Available-for-sale financial assets are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months after the balance sheet date. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 83 Derivative financial instruments and hedge activities Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value. The gain or loss on the remeasurement to fair value is immediately recognized in the income statement. However where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value hedge Fair value hedges hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. Changes in the fair value of a hedging derivative are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged are recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and are also recognized in the income statement. Cash flow hedge Cash flow hedges hedge possible fluctuations in cash flows which can be attributed to a certain currency, interest rate, or commodity price risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable expected future transaction. The effective part of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are designated and classified as cash flow hedges is recognized in equity. Gains or losses from the non-effective part are directly recognized in the income statement. If a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or if the instrument can no longer be qualified as a hedging instrument, the cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is recognized in the income statement. If the expected future transaction is no longer probable the cumulative result is transferred immediately from equity to the income statement. Net investment hedge Hedges for net investments in foreign operations are handled in a similar way as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses from the hedging instrument which can be attributed to the effective part of the hedge are recognized in equity; any gains or losses which cannot be attributed to the effective part are directly recognized as financial income and charges in the income statement. Cumulative gains and losses in equity are recognized in the income statement as soon as the foreign operation is partly divested or sold. Upon entering into a transaction the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged position, the risk management aims and the starting points for entering into various hedging transactions are documented. Corbion also documents its estimate as to whether the derivative financial instrument offsets the movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged positions effectively. The documentation process starts at the time of entering into such a contract and is updated continuously. Receivables Receivables are valued on the basis of the amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less provisions deemed necessary for non-collectability. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in bank, cash in hand, current deposits, money market funds, and highly liquid treasury bonds with original maturities of no more than three months. Bank overdrafts are presented as current interest-bearing liabilities. 84 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Equity Ordinary shares and financing preference shares are classified as equity. Financing preference shares are classified as equity since distributions to holders are at the discretion of Corbion. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as an equity deduction, net of tax. The price paid for repurchased shares (treasury shares) is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Dividend to be distributed to the holders of ordinary shares is recognized as a liability upon approval of the profit appropriation by the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. Corbion runs a share plan for the Board of Management and Senior Management and a sharebased plan for Senior Management. The fair value of the right to shares on the date of allocation is recognized in the income statement as payroll costs over the vesting period of the awards with a corresponding increase in equity. Pension and other post-employment benefits Pension and early-retirement schemes A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate pension plan or insurance company and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable), and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), are reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows: Service cost (including current service cost, past-service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements) Net interest expense or income Remeasurements The first two components of defined benefit costs are presented in profit or loss. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past-service costs. The retirement benefit obligation in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. A liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognizes any related restructuring costs. Other long-term employee benefit commitments The other long-term employee commitments relate mainly to anniversary commitments, past-service commitments, conditional incentive plans, and health insurance. These provisions are recognized on the basis of estimates that are consistent with the estimates used for the defined benefit obligations. However, all actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the income statement immediately. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 85 Provisions Provisions relate to a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the amount of which is uncertain but can be estimated reliably and of which it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources is required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flow at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. A provision for reorganization is recognized after Corbion has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly. A provision for a legal claim is recognized if a reliable estimate can be made of the expected outcome of the claim, measuring the claim as a weighting of all possible outcomes against their probabilities. A provision for an onerous contract is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived from the contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of fulfilling its terms and conditions. Liabilities Interest-bearing liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Upon sale or settlement of interest-bearing liabilities any profits or losses are directly recognized in the income statement. Leases Lease agreements in which the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as financial leases. All assets and liabilities of a financial lease are capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease agreements that do not qualify as a financial lease are classified as operational leases. Payments made are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. All operating segments are reviewed regularly by the Board of Management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance for which discrete financial information is available. Net sales Net sales comprises the proceeds of goods delivered to third parties less discounts and valueadded tax. Net sale of goods is recognized when Corbion has transferred the actual risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of the proceeds can be reliably measured, and when it is probable that the economic benefits of the sale will flow to Corbion. Costs of raw materials and consumables Costs of raw materials and consumables relate to the cost of consumption of raw materials, consumables, and packaging materials. Costs of raw materials and consumables are recognized in the income statement when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods sold have been transferred to a party outside the group. These costs include the purchase price of all raw material and all directly attributable costs. Production costs Production costs are the costs relating to production operations. Warehousing and distribution costs Warehousing and distribution costs relate to the costs of warehousing and transport, including transport insurance. 86 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Selling expenses Selling expenses relate to the costs of marketing and sales. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses relate to the costs of administration, management, and IT. Financial income and charges Financial income comprises interest income on cash and cash equivalents and interest income on loans to other parties. Interest income is recognized in the period to which it relates, using the effective interest method. Financial charges comprise interest expenses and exchange differences on borrowings, finance lease expenses, impairments of available-for-sale assets, and other financial expenses. All borrowing costs are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. Taxes Tax on the result is calculated on the basis of the result before taxes, taking account of untaxed profit elements, nonand part-deductible costs, and fiscal facilities. The prevailing nominal tax rates are applied. Non-recoverable withholding taxes on foreign dividends are taken into account. Taxes in the income statement for the year comprise current and deferred taxes. Taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly recognized in equity. Current tax is the expected tax rate payable on the taxable income for the year, using statutory tax rates at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. A discontinued operation is a component that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, and: (i) represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or (ii) is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Discontinued operations are stated on the basis of the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and cash flow statement. Fixed assets related to discontinued operations will no longer be depreciated and amortized after the classification as held for sale. Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement is drawn up using the indirect method. The items in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of the financial position have been adjusted for changes that do not impact cash inflow and outflow in the reporting year. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the average foreign exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case cash flows are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions. Working capital consists of inventories and receivables minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities, excluding payable dividend, interest, and income tax. The interest-bearing debts consist of non-current and current liabilities. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 87 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Corbion makes use of accounting estimates and judgments. Described below are the estimates and judgments as at the balance sheet date that carry a substantial risk of a material adjustment to the book value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year. Acquisitions Corbion has a process in place to identify all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible fixed assets. The judgments made in identifying all acquired assets, determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the results of operations. Estimated fair values are based on information available around the acquisition date and on expectations and assumptions of anticipated discounted cash flows that have been assessed as reasonable by Corbion. Goodwill impairment Every year, Corbion tests the goodwill based on the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value-in-use method. The value-in-use is calculated on the basis of estimates and judgments of the expected cash flows which are discounted on a WACC basis. For a description of the main estimates, valuation assumptions, and a sensitivity analysis of the applied assumptions see Note 11. Valuation and impairment testing (in)tangible fixed assets (In)tangible fixed assets are tested for sustained impairment if there is an indication of possible impairment. A key factor is the recoverable amount which is calculated on the basis of estimates and assumptions of anticipated discounted cash flows, on the one hand, and an estimate of the fair value less cost to sell, on the other. Pension and early-retirement schemes Actuarial calculations are used to determine provisions for group personnel arrangements and net receivables or obligations from group pension plans. These calculations use assumptions in respect of future developments in salary, mortality, staff turnover, return on investments et cetera. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can lead to actuarial gains and losses which are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For more information on the applied assumptions see Note 20. Taxes Corbion is subject to various tax systems across the world. Estimates and judgments are used to determine the tax items in the financial statements. Interpretation differences in tax liabilities are also taken into account. For more information on taxes see Note 21. 88 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3. Consolidated income statement before one-off items The consolidated income statement for financial years 2016 and 2015 before one-off items (non-IFRS financial measures) can be presented as follows. 2016 2015 Before One-off Total Before One-off Total one-off items one-off items items items Net sales 911.3 911.3 918.3 918.3 Costs of raw materials and consumables -444.1 -2.3 -446.4 -471.4 -471.4 Production costs -142.4 10.0 -132.4 -140.7 4.0 -136.7 Warehousing and distribution costs -47.4 -47.4 -48.3 -48.3 Gross profit 277.4 7.7 285.1 257.9 4.0 261.9 Selling expenses -63.1 -63.1 -63.9 0.1 -63.8 Research and development costs -31.3 -3.0 -34.3 -32.7 -32.7 General and administrative expenses -62.7 -0.6 -63.3 -56.8 -56.8 Other proceeds 2.5 2.5 Operating result 120.3 6.6 126.9 104.5 4.1 108.6 Less: depreciation/amortization/impairment (in)tangible fixed assets 49.8 -9.8 40.0 45.8 1.8 47.6 EBITDA 170.1 -3.2 166.9 150.3 5.9 156.2 Depreciation/amortization/impairment (in)tangible fixed assets -49.8 9.8 -40.0 -45.8 -1.8 -47.6 Operating result 120.3 6.6 126.9 104.5 4.1 108.6 Financial income 1.1 1.1 Financial charges -8.5 -8.5 -5.8 -5.8 Results from joint ventures and associates -1.6 -1.6 -0.6 -0.6 Result before taxes 110.2 7.7 117.9 98.1 4.1 102.2 Taxes -16.0 1.7 -14.3 -23.6 1.6 -22.0 Result after taxes 94.2 9.4 103.6 74.5 5.7 80.2 One-off items relate to material non-recurring items in the income statement that are exceptional by nature and are not related to the normal course of business. These exceptional items include amongst others write-down of inventories to net realizable value, reversals of write-downs, impairments, reversals of impairments, additions to and releases from provisions for restructuring and reorganization, results on assets sold, gains on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and any other provision being formed or released. The company considers events exceptional (one-off) when the aggregate amount of the events per line item of the income statement exceeds a threshold of € 0.5 million.

Segment information For its strategic decision-making process Corbion distinguishes between Biobased Ingredients and Biobased Innovations. For IFRS segmentation purposes Biobased Ingredients has been segmented into two further businesses, Food and Biochemicals. The unallocated part of total operations mainly comprises central activities. In the Food segment, our food ingredients portfolio keeps food safe and fresh, from creation to consumption, and as such, reduces food waste. It ranges from preservation ingredients to microbial spoilage prevention and ingredients that keep food fresh and tasty throughout shelf life. The combined use of industry knowledge and scientific creativity enables us to offer industry-leading biobased technology and sustainability gains. Our future-focused thinking impacts every industry ranging from baking, meat, and dairy to confectionery and beverage. In the Biochemicals segment, our biobased chemicals derived from renewable resources such as sugar or starch, are a sustainable alternative to fossil-based chemicals in various applications, including cleaning detergents, hand soap, coatings, and animal feed. Offering improved performance and multiple benefits, our biobased solutions are versatile and, at the same time, provide lower cost in use with enhanced environmental credentials. 90 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Our Biobased Innovations business unit creates new biotechnology business platforms. Our drive for growth is supported by a disciplined stage-gate investment approach using our own core technology platforms, acquired or licensed technologies, and partnerships to increase the odds of success. Our 50/50 joint venture with Total for the production and marketing of polylactic acid bioplastic (PLA) will be part of this business unit. Our high-performance PLA resin can be used to make a bioplastic for a wide range of applications, ranging from (degradable) food packaging to touchscreen computers and durable automotive components. Biobased Innovations also comprises the succinic acid joint venture with BASF (Succinity), as well as our longer-term development projects such as FDCA, a potential replacement for purified terephthalic acid (PTA), our gypsum-free lactic acid process, and the developments regarding the use of alternative feedstocks (lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural residues, or waste). Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Information on the use of alternative non-IFRS performance measures In the above table and elsewhere in the financial statements a number of non-IFRS performance measures are presented. Management is of the opinion that these so-called alternative performance measures might be useful for the readers of these financial statements. Corbion management uses these performance measures to make financial, operational, and strategic decisions and evaluate performance of the segments. The alternative performance measures can be calculated as follows: • EBITDA is the operating result before depreciation, amortization, and impairment of (in)tangible fixed assets. • EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by net sales x 100.

The Food and Biochemicals operating segments represent the levels to which 96 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements company goodwill is allocated for the purposes of impairment testing. The Biobased Innovations segment does not contain any goodwill. Main reasons for this approach are: • It represents a non-arbitrary, reasonable, and consistent basis for the allocation of goodwill. • The allocation is in line with the expected synergies at the time of an acquisition with benefits for more than one entity. • The allocation represents the lowest level where goodwill is monitored by the Board of Management, while not being larger than the operating segments. Breakdown of the book value of the goodwill by segment As at As at 31-12-2016 31-12-2015 Food 64.0 62.0 Biochemicals 2.2 2.2 Total operations 66.2 64.2 The recoverable amount of both segments is determined using a value-in-use method. The main assumptions used are derived from the financial and business plans for 2017 which have been approved by the Board of Management. From 2018 onwards a stable growth of 1% is taken into account in combination with a relatively constant cost structure. The future cash flows are discounted on the basis of the WACC before tax. Overview of the WACC used As at 31-12-2016 As at 31-12-2015 pre-tax post-tax pre-tax post-tax Food 8.8% 6.8% 9.8% 6.9% Biochemicals 9.0% 7.1% 10.2% 7.7% In addition, sensitivity analyses have been carried out in respect of the assumptions using: • A terminal value growth of 0% • A discount rate of +1% Both assumptions applicable at the same time would not lead to any impairment. Given the above assumptions and the outcome of analyses, the Board of Management has concluded that the value in use of both segments is not lower than the book value of the segments including goodwill. Impairment testing other intangible fixed assets In 2015, no impairments were recorded for intangible fixed assets. In 2016, an impairment of € 3.0 million was recorded related to our succinic acid development as a result of an envisaged change in the production process. The 'Other' movement relates to transfers of assets from intangible fixed assets to Property, plant, and equipment. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 97 12.

The face value of the receivables (excluding derivatives) does not significantly deviate from the fair value. The credit risk associated with trade receivables is managed by local finance managers. Periodically, each entity reports the expired credit terms and movements in the provisions for trade receivables to the Board of Management. The maximum credit risk in respect of trade receivables is € 113.5 million (2015: € 99.4 million). Trade receivables are not interest-bearing and generally have an average term of credit of 30-90 days. The impairment provision is based on expired terms of credit and defined individually. The trade receivables item includes an amount of € 17.6 million in receivables with expired terms of credit which are expected to be received and are therefore not provided for.

Other long-term employee benefit commitments Other long-term employee benefit commitments relate mainly to anniversary commitments, conditional incentive plans, and health insurance. Main characteristics of the defined benefit plans Corbion sponsors defined benefit pension plans in the US and UK. Both plans are closed schemes and based on final pay. Further, Corbion sponsors a legal severance payment plan in Thailand. All plans have been established in accordance with the legal requirements of the countries involved. The defined benefit plans are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the entity. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number of representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The plans typically expose the group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity risk. • Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high-quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently the plans have a relatively balanced investment in mainly equity securities and debt instruments. • Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partly offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments. • Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The defined benefit obligation as per year-end consisted for the vast majority of the UK plan and is summarized below: • The Normal Retirement Age (NRA) is 65; however, Section 1 members are able to take their benefits in respect of pre 1 October 2003 service unreduced from age 60. • Pensions in deferment increase in line with statutory revaluation with the exception of pre 1 October 2003 benefits for Section 1 members, which have an underpin linked to the level of pension increases in payment (which are linked to RPI). • Pensions in payment increase in line with RPI capped at 5% for benefits in respect of pre 1 January 2006 service and RPI capped at 2.5% for benefits in respect of post 31 December 2005 service. 104 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The UK pension scheme is in a deficit situation. For this scheme a recovery plan has been agreed in 2013 under which Corbion will contribute additional funding payments of GBP 1.1 million per year (commencing in 2013) with an increase of 5% per year payable until 2028 or until the scheme is no longer in a deficit situation. The strategic investment policy of the scheme can be summarized as follows: • A strategic asset mix comprising 50% in return-seeking assets and 50% in matching (bond-type) assets. • The return-seeking asset portfolio comprises a mix of equity investments and diversified growth funds. • Interest rate and inflation risk is managed through the use of liability-driven investments and corporate bonds of an appropriate duration. • Currency risk is managed by implementing a 50% currency hedge on the global equity holding. The average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2016 is 28 years.

The investment strategy is based on the composition of the obligations of the pension schemes. Based on Asset Liability Management models analyses have been performed on a regular basis to define the investment portfolio. At year-end the asset allocation was as follows. Asset categories of plan assets 2016 2015 Quoted equity securities 20.9 24.5 Quoted debt securities 10.3 37.4 Other 49.9 10.9 Total assets 81.1 72.8 The main weighted average actuarial assumptions 2016 2015 Discount rate 2.8% 3.8% Salary growth rate Pension growth rate 3.3% 2.5% 106 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.50% (11.3) 13.5 Salary growth rate 0.50% Pension growth rate 0.50% 6.5 (8.3) The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. To calculate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method is applied (calculation of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) which is also used to calculate the pension liability recognized within the consolidated statement of financial position. The expected contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in the coming year amount to € 2.1 million. 21.

Financial risk management and financial instruments Risk management framework Corbion’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, interest, commodity, liquidity, capital, and credit risk. The treasury department identifies and manages these risks. Treasury operates within a framework of policies and procedures which have been approved by the Board of Management. The treasury policy may change on an annual basis in light of market circumstances and market volatility. Corbion uses derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging exposures mainly to commodity, currency, and interest rate risks arising from the company's sources of finance and business. Corbion has a Treasury and a Commodity Risk Management Committee meeting periodically to review treasury and commodity activities and compliance with both policies. Currency risk Corbion is active on the international market, which means that it is exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations, particularly in the US dollar, Brazilian real, Japanese yen, and Thai baht. Foreign currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, and net investments in foreign operations. Translation risk Corbion is subject to foreign exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries’ income, assets, and liabilities into euros in the consolidated financial statements. To protect the value of future foreign cash flows, Corbion partially mitigates the foreign exchange exposure by applying natural hedging, meaning capital employed in foreign operations is financed using the country’s currency in order to avoid fluctuations due to translation effects. US dollar translation effects of the operating result are partially hedged by the interest paid on the US dollar loan. Currency fluctuations particularly in the US dollar can have a material effect on Corbion’s income statement. Corbion has policies in place to ensure that material currency translation exposures are hedged above specific limits as defined for each currency. Breakdown the unhedged translation risk for each currency Currency As at As at Millions of euros 31-12-2016 31-12-2015 US dollar 151.4 137.2 Brazilian real 19.4 14.7 Thai baht 71.0 101.7 110 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Transaction risk The currency transaction risk arises in the course of ordinary business activities. Corbion’s exposure to exchange rate movements in commercial operations is mainly related to EUR/ USD, THB/YEN, and EUR/YEN. Corbion uses forward currency contracts and currency swaps in order to hedge risks arising from purchase and sales deals and/or commitments from current purchase and sales contracts. Transactions that are highly probable are hedged and included in cash flow hedge accounting. Other reasonably probable transactions are partially hedged. For practical reasons a specific limit is defined for each currency. Hedge accounting is being applied to these contracts, so any unrealized fluctuations in the fair value are deferred in the hedge reserve of equity until the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in the result. All forward currency contracts expire within a year. Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments to exchange rate changes A 10% weakening of the euro against the Japanese yen would decrease equity by € 1.2 million, while the net result would not be significantly impacted. Interest rate risk Corbion's interest rate risk arises primarily from its debt. Corbion has an interest rate policy aimed at reducing volatility in its interest expense and maintaining a target percentage of its debt in fixed rate instruments. Currently, Corbion's interest rate exposure has been fully fixed (4.19% on average) for all of Corbion's long-term debt (€ 133.1 million) for a period of on average 8.4 years. Sensitivity analysis to changes in market interest rate Assuming the same mix of variable and fixed interest rate instruments, an interest rate increase by 50 basis points versus the rates on 31 December 2016 with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase of € 0 in the net result and of € 0 in equity. Commodity risk Corbion uses commodity derivative contracts to reduce the risk of price fluctuations in the main commodities used, being wheat, oils, gas, corn, and sugar. Corbion entered into commodity derivative contracts to hedge the variable price risk of the main commodities used. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of € 2.2 million as at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: asset of € 0.1 million). Hedge accounting is applied for the major part of these commodity derivative contracts. Further analysis can be found in the section on hedge transactions. All commodity derivative contracts expire within a year. Sensitivity analysis If the purchase price of the involved commodities would increase by 10%, net result would be impacted by € 0.1 million. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of Corbion not being able to obtain sufficient financial means to meet its obligations in time. The company actively manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability to committed borrowing capacity. Corbion manages cash flow based on cash flow analysis for the next 12 months. The committed credit facilities at Corbion’s long-term disposal amounted to € 300 million as at 31 December 2016. Corbion also has a private placement of $ 167 million with American institutional investors. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 111 To provide insight into the liquidity risk the table below shows the contractual terms of the financial obligations (converted at balance sheet date), including interest paid. The table below analyzes Corbion’s financial obligations which will be settled on a net basis, according to relevant expiration dates, based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual expiration date. The amounts shown are contractual non-discounted cash flows.

In respect of disbursed loans, other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents the maximum credit risk equals the book value (see Notes 13, 15, and 16). In respect of derivatives it equals the fair value. Given the credit rating that it requires of its partners Corbion has no reason to assume that they will not honor their contractual obligations. Based on today’s insights, the actual credit risk is limited. Capital risk management Corbion manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Corbion group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximizing return to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of Corbion consists of net debt (interest-bearing debts as detailed in Notes 22 and 23 offset by cash and cash equivalents as detailed in Note 16). 2016 2015 Private placement 158.1 153.4 Financial lease commitments 0.1 Other debts 0.6 0.8 Cash and cash equivalents -60.8 -92.1 Net debt 98.0 62.1 112 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements The Corbion Treasury Committee reviews the capital structure of Corbion on a quarterly basis. As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The main covenants for the credit facility and the US private placement are: • The ratio of net debt position divided by EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and impairment of (in)tangible fixed assets, and excluding one-off items and cash dividend of joint ventures received) may not exceed the factor 3.5 (2015: 3.5). • A minimum interest cover (EBITDA divided by net interest income and charges) of 3.5 (2015: 3.5). These external conditions were met in 2016 as well as in 2015. Corbion targets a net debt/ EBITDA ratio of 1.5x over the investment cycle. Ratios at year-end 2016 2015 Net debt position/EBITDA 0.6 0.4 Interest cover 23.0 25.5 Financial instruments Valuation of financial instruments Corbion measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: • Level 1: Fair value measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: Fair value measurements based on inputs other than level 1 quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). • Level 3: Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

As there are no market quotations for most of the loans the fair value of shortand long-term loans is determined by discounting the future cash flows at the yield curve applicable as at 31 December. • Given the short-term character, the fair value of non-interest-bearing liabilities equals the book value. • Currency and interest derivatives are measured on the basis of the present value of future cash flows over the remaining term of the contracts, using the bank interest rate (such as Euribor) as at the reporting date for the remaining term of the contracts. The present value in foreign currencies is converted using the exchange rate applicable as at the reporting date. • Commodity derivatives are measured on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, using market quotations or own variable market price estimations of the involved commodity as at the reporting date. 114 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Derivatives Hedge transactions The amount of € 0.8 million in hedge reserve (see Note 18) relates to the hedging of risks arising from future purchase and sales deals and/or commitments from current purchase and sales contracts amounting to € 19.5 million. The amount of € 50.5 million in translation reserve (see Note 18) relates to currency fluctuations in respect of the net investments in foreign operations less the currency fluctuations of the corresponding net investment hedges. In case of divestment of a net investment in a foreign operation, the corresponding net impact of the currency fluctuations is moved from the translation reserve to the income statement. In the past year no cash flow hedges were terminated due to changes to the expected future transaction. No ineffective parts were recorded in respect of the net investment hedge and cash flow hedge.

Share-based compensation Share-based remuneration arrangements: Board of Management A share plan is in place for the Board of Management. Two current and two former members of the Board of Management have a total of 362,135 unvested share rights in the company as at 31 December 2016 (2015: 401,306 ). The nominal amount of the shares which are claimable under unvested share rights equals € 90,534 per that date. 2013-2014 program Each year members of the Board of Management are entitled to a conditional grant of Corbion shares. There are two target levels for this incentive. One applies to the CEO and one to the CFO. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 60% of his base salary. The CFO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 50% of his base salary. The total number of conditionally granted shares is determined by dividing the “at target” amount applicable for the respective Board member (as a percentage of base salary) by the (undiscounted) fair value average stock price over the month prior to the date of grant (April of any year). The performance criterion for the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a three-year performance period. After vesting and share delivery, the Board members according to the plan rules, are required to keep the shares in a blocked account for another two years. The total lock-up period therefore is five years. For further details refer to the remuneration policy and report in the Report of the Supervisory Board. 2015-2016 program A revised program was introduced in 2015, as part of the new remuneration policy agreed by the AGM on 22 May 2015, aimed at longer-term value creation in line with shareholders’ interests, measured over a performance period of three calendar years. To ensure that shortterm performance also leads to sustainable long-term value creation, the LTIP measurement is fully aligned with the STIP: 60% of the LTIP is dependent on EBITDA and 20% of the LTIP depends on Earnings Per Share (EPS). In addition, 20% of the LTIP depends on relative TSR as compared to a specific TSR peer group. Each year members of the Board of Management are entitled to a conditional grant of Corbion shares. There are two target levels for this incentive: one applies to the CEO and one to the CFO. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 100% of his base salary. The CFO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 80% of the base salary. The total number of conditionally granted shares is determined by dividing the “at target” amount applicable for the respective Board member (as a percentage of base salary) by the share price. The share price is defined as the average closing price of the Corbion share during the last full calendar quarter preceding the conditional grant of shares. At the beginning of the performance period, targets for the LTIP are set by the Supervisory Board for the three-year performance period as follows. 1. A target based on EBITDA, a threshold (minimum) and a range around the performance target to determine the actual payout for 60% of the LTIP. 2. A target based on EPS, a threshold (minimum) and a range around the performance target to determine the actual payout for 20% of the LTIP. 3. The TSR performance is benchmarked against the TSR performance of Corbion’s TSR peer group and the relative ranking determines the actual payout for 20% of the LTIP. Meeting the performance target(s) results in a LTIP payout at target level. A range of 50% around the performance target(s) (or lower as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set for the EBITDA and EPS performance to determine the actual payout. There is no payout below the low end of the range and no additional upside above the top end of the range. For the TSR performance, threshold payout is set at meeting the eighth position in the peer group (consisting of sixteen companies). Target payout is achieved at the fourth and fifth position in the peer group and maximum payout is achieved at reaching the first and second position in the peer group. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 119 One-off time-restricted performance share award CEO At the time of his appointment in 2014, Mr. De Ruiter was granted a one-off time-restricted performance share award equivalent to a target value of € 2 million in Corbion shares to vest over four years. This award bridges part of the compensation gap between the United States and the Netherlands. The award encourages delivering a growing, increasingly profitable, and sustainable business portfolio. The value of one conditional share is equal to the average share price of five days preceding the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting (AGM), no discounts are applied. The award vests in four equal parts per year, only if a minimum Corbion growth rate is achieved each year. Delivering predetermined long-term (4-year) innovation milestones allows for an additional vesting of up to 25% in year 4 of the total number of shares. This means that the actual number of shares that vest, will range between 0% and 125% of the grant value. The value of the vested shares depends on the performance delivered and the share price development. In 2015, the plan was partially adjusted to be fully aligned with the updated strategy and consequently with the new remuneration policy. The performance period has been aligned with the regular long term incentive plan, starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2017. Further, EBITDA growth has been introduced as annual performance metric (instead of sales growth) to be set at the beginning of each year by the Supervisory Board. Movements in number of unvested shares of the (former) Board of Management (at maximum) Year of allocation Total as Allocated Vested and Total as at 31-12-2015 in 2016 expired in 2016 at 31-12-2016 2013 61,307 61,307 2014 236,359 29,922 206,437 2015 103,640 9,975 93,665 2016 62,033 62,033 Total 401,306 62,033 101,204 362,135 Valuation model and input variables The fair value of the non-market-based components of the above-mentioned performancerelated shares allocated in 2016 was € 21.66 per share (2015: € 18.22) The fair value of the market-based components of the above-mentioned performance-related shares allocated in 2016 was € 25.33 per share (2015: € 21.37).

Participants in these plans are awarded a provisional cash payment. Depending on the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of Corbion compared with the peer group and continued employment after a period of three years, the actual gross amount if any is determined and paid. In 2015, an equity-settled plan similar to the 2015 program for the Board of Management was introduced for Senior Management. 120 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Movements in number of unvested shares of senior management Year of allocation Total as Allocated Vested and Total as at 31-12-2015 in 2016 expired in 2016 at 31-12-2016 2015 133,698 9,385 124,313 2016 118,396 277 118,119 Total 133,698 118,396 9,662 242,432 Certain members of management receive a package of Corbion shares worth 9.5% of fixed salary (commitment award).

CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information 129 Independent auditor’s report To: the General Shareholders Meeting and the Supervisory Board of Corbion N.V. Report on the accompanying financial statements 2016 Our opinion In our opinion: • the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Corbion N.V. as at 31 December 2016, and of its result and its cash flows for 2016 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code; • the accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Corbion N.V. as at 31 December 2016, and of its result for 2016 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. What we have audited We have audited the financial statements 2016 of Corbion N.V., based in Amsterdam. The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements. The consolidated financial statements comprise: 1 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016; 2 the following consolidated statements for 2016: the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows; and 3 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The company financial statements comprise: 1 the company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016; 2 the company statement of income for 2016; and 3 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ section of our report. We are independent of Corbion N.V. in accordance with the Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. KPMG Accountants N.V., registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity. 130 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information Audit approach Summary • Overall materiality of EUR 5.5 million • 5.5% of normalized result before tax Coverage of: • Valuation Lactide plant • 91% of revenue • Valuation capitalized • 94% of result licenses and before tax development costs • Taxation • 85% of assets Materiality Based on our professional judgment we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at EUR 5.5 million. The materiality is determined with reference to the normalized result before tax, of which it represents 5.5%. We consider the normalized result before tax as the most appropriate benchmark given the fact that Corbion N.V. is a profit-oriented entity. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for qualitative reasons for the users of the financial statements. We agreed with the Audit Committee that misstatements in excess of EUR 275,000, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds. Scope of the group audit Corbion N.V. is head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the financial statements of Corbion N.V. Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities. The Group operates through a number of legal entities. These entities form reporting components which are primarily based on geography (countries). To achieve sufficient coverage over the Group’s significant risks, we performed audits for group reporting purposes of six components, as well as audits of specific revenue balances and the related accounts receivable balances at one other component. We have: • performed, as group auditor, audit procedures at the following group entities: − Corbion N.V.; − Purac Biochem B.V.; CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information 131 • used the work of other KPMG component auditors when auditing the following group entities: − Caravan Ingredients Inc; − Purac America Inc; − Purac Bioquimica S.A.; − Purac Sínteses Industria e Comércia Ltda; − Purac Asia Pacific PTE; and, − Purac Thailand Ltd.; − Expalkan (Thailand) Ltd. • performed review procedures or specified audit procedures at other group entities. The group audit team provided detailed instructions to all component auditors who were part of the group audit, covering the significant audit areas, including the relevant risks of material misstatement, and set out the information required to be reported back to the group audit team. The group audit team visited entity locations in the United States of America. During these visits and telephone conferences, the audit approach, the findings and observations reported to the group audit team were discussed in more detail. Also file reviews were performed for the entities in the United States of America and in Spain. By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the financial statements.

During initial audit engagements we have to gain sufficient knowledge about the company, its business, control environment and application of accounting principles in order to perform our initial audit risk assessment and planning of audit activities. A detailed transition plan, including independence clearance, was prepared prior to the start of the audit. We gained an understanding of Corbion N.V. and its business, including its control environment and accounting policies as we were involved early in the year at group and local entity level. We have been in close contact with the predecessor auditor Deloitte Accountants B.V. and have performed reviews on their audit files at all levels throughout the group. During the year we had regular meetings with management and the Audit Committee, performed half-year procedures and assessed key accounting matters at an early stage. Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. 132 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information Valuation lactide plant Description The valuation of the Lactide plant in Thailand is significant to our audit due to its invested amount and expected judgement involved in the assessment of the recoverability of this asset. In 2016, Corbion announced it entered into an agreement with Total to set up a 50/50 joint venture in 2017 and to sell its lactide production unit and the PLA polymerization plant in Thailand to the joint venture. The book value of the Lactide plant is significantly lower than the lower range of the market valuation of the Lactide plant as agreed in the joint venture agreement, which resulted in the reversal of the impairment taken in previous years under IAS 36 having a significant impact on the 2016 financial statements. As a result of the joint venture agreement, the Lactide plant is included in the Assets Held for Sale. We refer to note 10 Property, plant and equipment in the consolidated financial statements. Our response Audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the signed agreements with the joint venture partner. We compared the book value of the lactide plant with the calculation of the recoverable amount based on agreed selling price. Our observation Overall we found that the assessment made by management resulted in an acceptable valuation of the Lactide plant in Thailand. Valuation capitalized licenses and development costs Description The valuation of the capitalized intangible fixed assets, related to licenses and development cost, are significant to our audit due to their size and judgement involved in the assessment of the recoverability of those items. We refer to note 11 Intangible fixed assets in the consolidated financial statements. Our response Our audit procedures included, among others, an evaluation of the company’s policies and procedures for evaluating the presence of potential impairments, challenging management’s main assumptions and the robustness of forecasts. We evaluated key assumptions amongst others through discussions with management and market developments, historical analysis and cooperation agreements with third parties. We, amongst others, critically assessed and tested methodologies, the weighted average cost of capital and other data used, such as market expectations and projected cash flows. Further, as part of our audit procedures, we included valuation experts in our team to analyse and evaluate the discount rates used by the company to determine the recoverable value and have assessed the results of their work as part our audit. We have evaluated whether adequate disclosure of impairments were made in accordance with IAS 36. Our observation Based on our procedures performed we considered management’s key assumptions to be within a reasonable range and that disclosure in the financial statements of the capitalized licenses and development cost meets the requirements of IAS 36. CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information 133 Taxation Description Corbion operates in various tax jurisdictions. During 2016, Corbion utilized EUR 3 million of previously unrecognized deferred tax assets and recognized EUR 10 million of additional deferred tax assets mainly related to the Netherlands and Spain. Both the evaluation of tax risks and valuation of deferred tax assets in respect of taxable losses, were significant to our audit because the assessment requires specialised tax knowledge, significant judgment and is based on assumptions that are affected by uncertain future events such as profitability of operations. We refer to note 8 Taxes and note 21 Deferred tax in the consolidated financial statements. Our response Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s assessment of tax risks and using our own tax specialists to assist us in assessing identified tax risks. We further inspected the appropriateness of the level of deferred tax asset balance recognized in the balance sheet. We mainly focused on the long-term forecasts and critically assessed the assumptions and judgments included in these forecasts by considering the historical accuracy of forecasts and the sensitivities of the profit forecasts. We have evaluated whether adequate disclosure of the tax position and tax loss carry forwards were made in accordance with IAS 12. Our observation Overall we assessed that the assumptions used by management resulted in a balanced valuation of the deferred tax assets and that disclosure in the financial statements of Corbion’s tax position meets the requirements of IAS12. Report on the other information included in the annual report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: • Corbion at a glance; • Message of the CEO; • Company Highlights; • Report of the Board of Management; • Report of the Supervisory Board; • Sustainability statements; • Other information, as included on page 129 until 141. Based on the below procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: • is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements; • contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of other information, including the Management Board’s Report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code and the other Information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. 134 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2016 Other information Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Engagement We were engaged by the General Shareholders Meeting as auditor of Corbion N.V. on 22 May 2015. The audit of the 2016 financial statements was our first year’s audit. Description of the responsibilities for the financial statements Responsibilities of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements The Board of Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Netherlands Civil Code. Furthermore, the Board of Management is responsible for such internal control as the Board of Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to errors or fraud. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Board of Management is responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting framework mentioned, the Board of Management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud during the audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. For a further description of our responsibilities in respect of an audit of financial statements we refer to the website of the professional body for accountants in the Netherlands (NBA) https://www.nba.nl/Documents/Tools%20Vaktechniek/Standaardpassages/Standaardpassage_nieuwe _controletekst_oob_variant_%20Engels.docx.
