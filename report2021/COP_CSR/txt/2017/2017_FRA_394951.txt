At OT we recognize that we can only truly grow sustainably with the involvement of our stakeholders. This is why we engage with stakeholders in a number of ways each year on a range of sustainability issues. The purpose of the report is to communicate to our stakeholders, including the main groups of employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and competitors, the steps that OT is taking to improve its sustainability performance, and the ethical values that guide us. OT undertakes an annual, third party assessment of its CSR performance and contribution to sustainable development by the CSR notation agency, EcoVadis. This extra-financial assessment takes into account criteria other than common corporate financial results. These are social criteria such as Environment, Labor and Fair Business Practices. The annual assessment provides a reliable sustainability rating for an increasing number of our customers. In 2016, the EcoVadis annual assessment of OT’s CSR performance resulted in OT achieving a silver recognition and recognized for significant improvement in Fair Business Practices and Sustainable Procurement. With this score, OT ranks in the top 9% of suppliers assessed by EcoVadis in all categories.
