Testimonials of current scholarship beneficiaries of the CIS corporate Foundation Asmae, a graduate student in the master’s degree program at the ISC Paris Business School (75) in management information systems. Supported by the Foundation since 2014. “ One of the biggest challenges for a business school student is balancing the challenges of academic study, expensive school costs, engagement in a not-for-profit and holding a regular job. The financial burden that is compounded by other forms of stress experienced by students can have a real impact on performance and academic fulfilment. The CIS Foundation thus represents an enormous opportunity by allowing me to look ahead to the future while reducing my preoccupations about financing my studies. I am extremely grateful for this scholarship which is encouraging me to persevere in my studies. It represents an invaluable support for pursuing my studies. Anouk, an undergraduate student in economics at the Sorbonne (Paris). Supported by the Foundation since 2014. “ “ It is with enormous gratitude and the sentiment of enormous privilege that I was accorded a CIS scholarship in 2014 and 2015 to support my continuing studies to obtain a higher degree. This scholarship is a testimony of your confidence and is helping me stay on track with the challenging path I have chosen. I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree (Licence 2) in economics at the Sorbonne. Without the opportunity of pursuing the preparatory program at Intégrale Paris and the credits thus obtained, I would never have been able to join this prestigious University. Having you at my side gives me even more force and determination to surmount the difficulties I have encountered and the efforts I must provide.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for the Group formed by Catering International & Services as the parent company and its subsidiaries. The Group's business is conducted in international markets. The Group is a global provider of catering services in extreme environments. This includes services for meals, living accommodations, technical maintenance and associated services (security, medical assistance, leisure and recreation). The Group's customer base includes companies, very often major names in their sectors, from Western nations. These companies usually operate through local independent entities or local joint enterprises in the oil and gas, mining engineering and public works sectors The Group thus provides its customers with support services for their operating sites that are generally located in emerging countries. 2. Basis of preparation and accountinG policies In accordance with EC regulation No. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002 of 19 July 2002, companies listed on a regulated European market must prepare, for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005, their consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), formerly referred to as IAS (International Accounting Standards). The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Catering International & Services S.A. for ﬁscal 2015 and 2014 are in consequence prepared on the basis of IFRS. There is no difference between the IFRS of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the independent accounting standard-setting body of the IFRS Foundation and EU IFRS applied by the Group. Application of the following standards, amendments and interpretations became mandatory for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015: ■ Annual improvement cycles (2011-2013) for IFRS 3, IFRS 13 and IAS 40 ■ IFRIC 21 Levies. In the absence of a signiﬁcant impact from the application of interpretation IFRIC21, the ﬁnancial statements for the comparative periods were not restated Application of these standards, amendments and interpretations did not have a material impact on the Group's consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB whose application was not mandatory for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015: 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report ■ Amendments to IAS 19 Deﬁned beneﬁt plans: employee contributions; ■ Annual improvement cycles (2010-2012) for IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IAS 24, IFRS 8, IAS 16, IAS 38 and IFRS 13. The Group has not applied any of the standards or interpretations in advance. The impact of the application of these new standards on the ﬁnancial statements is currently being analysed by the Group. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION Basis of consolidation Consolidation includes all companies controlled by Catering International & Services on an exclusive basis or over which Catering International & Services exercises a signiﬁcant inﬂuence. All subsidiaries and equity investments meeting such criteria are consolidated, even in cases where they account for a negligible inﬂuence on consolidated operations as a whole or if their operation is not destined to continue. Consolidation methods The ﬁnancial statements of companies over which Catering International & Services exercises exclusive control are fully consolidated. Control, within the meaning of IFRS 10, is taken to mean the power to deﬁne and manage, directly or indirectly, the ﬁnancing and operating policies of the company in order to obtain beneﬁts from its activities. Control is generally presumed to exist if the Group holds more than half the voting rights of the company in question. The companies over which the Company exercises a signiﬁcant inﬂuence are accounted for by the equity method. It should be noted that at 31 December 2015, there were no subsidiaries in this latter category VALUATION METHODS Presentation of ﬁnancial statements Under the option provided for by Revised IAS 1, CIS Group has chosen to present income and expense items recognised directly in equity, in accordance with other standards (foreign exchange gain / loss, changes in fair value of available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, changes in fair value of cash-ﬂow hedges, etc.), in the statement of comprehensive income and presented immediately after the income statement. Deﬁnition of operating income Operating proﬁt includes all income and expenses directly related to the ordinary activities of the Group, whether such income and expenses are recurring in nature or result from non-recurring decisions or operations. Other operating income and Other operating expenses include a limited number of income and expense items described in note 5 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction. Payables and receivables in foreign currency are translated at the year-end exchange rate. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded in income. In compliance with IAS 29, the Group studies inﬂation trends in countries where it operates and for 2015 has not identiﬁed any hyperinﬂationary economy as deﬁned by this standard requiring a restatement approach to its ﬁnancial statements. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 75 > Financial report The following translation methods are used for the ﬁnancial statements of foreign subsidiaries: Balance sheet items (not including equity translated at the historical exchange rate) are converted into euros at the year-end exchange rate. Income statement items as well as income attributable to the Group presented under equity are translated according to the average exchange rate for the year. The difference between net proﬁt translated at the average rate and net proﬁt translated at the year-end rate is recorded in the consolidation reserves. Current / non-current assets and liabilities Assets to be realised, consumed or transferred within the scope of the normal operating cycle or within the twelve months following the year-end, are recognised under “current assets” as are assets held for sale and cash and cash equivalents. All other assets are recognised under “non-current assets”. The liabilities to be realised within the scope of the normal operating cycle or within the twelve months following the year end, are recognised under “current liabilities”. All other liabilities are recognised under “non-current liabilities”. Stock option plan Stock option plans may be established by the Group providing for settlement through CIS shares at price and exercise period conditions speciﬁc for each grant. The deﬁnitive fair value of the services received in consideration for the grant of these options is measured in reference to their fair value on the grant date. For the valuation of these options, the Group uses a binomial mathematical model. Total fair value determined according to this method is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This expense is recognised in staff costs as a reverse entry for an increase in the consolidated reserves. When the option is exercised, the cash amount received by the Group for the exercise price is recognised under cash offset with a corresponding entry in consolidated reserves. There are no stock option plans currently in force. Treasury shares When the Group purchases its own shares, the amount paid for the shares and the transaction costs directly attributable are recognised as a change in equity. The results of disposals of the shares are also charged directly to equity and as such are not recognised under income of the period. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net proﬁt (attributable to the Group) by the number of shares outstanding at year-end. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net proﬁt (attributable to the Group), adjusted for the ﬁnancial cost (net of taxes) of dilutive debt instruments, by the average number of outstanding shares at year-end, plus the average number of shares that, according to the treasury method would have been issued if all dilutive instruments issued had been converted (stock options or convertible bond). The weighted average number of shares in issue is not calculated as the number of the only potentially dilutive securities, namely treasury shares, is too small to have an effect on an indicator per share of any kind. The dilutive effect of each convertible instrument is determined by seeking the maximum dilution of basic earnings per share. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report Related party transactions Related party transactions concern in particular transactions with: ■ The legal entities control directly or indirectly, on an exclusive basis, through one or several intermediaries, or exercising a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the Group; ■ The main executives of the Group. Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, i.e. after deducting amounts for discounts and taxes. Revenue is recognised when there is a transfer to the buyer of the material risks and rewards which generally coincides with the transfer of title or completion of the service. Borrowing costs In accordance with the guidelines of Revised IAS 23 applicable as from 1 January 2009, borrowing costs for investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets relating to projects undertaken after this date where the period for construction or preparation for their intended use or sale is more than one year must be included in the cost price of these assets. Application of this standard has no impact on the ﬁnancial statements of CIS Group. Leases Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases when they result in transferring substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership from the lessor to the lessee. All other contracts are considered as operating leases; Assets held under ﬁnance leases are accounted for as assets of the Group at fair value as from the commencement of the lease or, if lower, at the fair value of minimum lease payments owed thereunder. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the balance sheet as a debt. Lease payments are broken down between the interest expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. These interest expenses are recorded under net ﬁnancial expense. For operating leases, these payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement over the lease term. The beneﬁts received an expected as a reward on signature of the operating lease are also spread over the lease term. The Group does not have any signiﬁcant operating leases providing such beneﬁts and its ﬁnancial statements are not subject to adjustments on that basis Intangible assets a-Goodwill In accordance with revised IFRS 3 when control is acquired over businesses or companies, such business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under this method, assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired company that meet the deﬁnition of identiﬁable assets or liabilities are recognised at fair value on the acquisition date. The difference between the acquisition cost of the business or securities of the company acquired, and the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the acquisition date is recorded in balance sheet assets under goodwill if positive and in the income statement for the year of acquisition if negative. Acquisition costs must be recognised under expenses and the company may choose between the full or partial goodwill methods for each transaction. Goodwill is tested for impairment every year or more frequently as soon as events or circumstances arise indicating that an impairment loss might be incurred. Such events or circumstances exist when material modiﬁcations occur that would call into question the substance of the initial investment over a sustained period. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 77 > Financial report For conducting impairment tests, goodwill is allocated to each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the organisation implemented by the Group. A CGU is deﬁned as a homogeneous group of assets that generates cash inﬂows largely independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable value of the CGU is equal to the higher between (i) its value in use measured according to the discounted cash ﬂow method and (ii) its fair value minus the cost of sales. If the recoverable value of the CGU is lower than the carrying value of its assets, the impairment loss is allocated in priority to goodwill. An impairment loss recognised on goodwill is reversible in nature and cannot be reversed. To determine value in use, estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted according to a rate reﬂecting current assessments of the time value of money and the speciﬁc risk for the asset or the CGU in question. bOther intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are recognised at cost while those acquired through a business combination are recognised at fair value on the acquisition date. Finite life intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives: Useful life (in years) Software 3 Non-compete clause 5 Indeﬁnite life intangible assets are not amortised and tested annually for impairment at least once a year in accordance with IAS 36. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated according to the straight-line method over the estimated useful life for the different categories of assets that are as follows: Useful life (in years) Fixtures and improvements 10 Transport equipment 5 Ofﬁce and computer equipment 3 Ofﬁce furniture 5 Assets located at foreign sites 2 to 5 (according to the terms of customer contracts) In the event of any internal or external indication of impairment, the Group will assess the recoverable value of the tangible assets and record an impairment loss if the net carrying value exceeds their recoverable value. 78 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report Inventories and work in progress Inventories are measured (including transport cost (according to the weighted average cost method. However, for reasons relating to software applications or statutory requirements, where this method cannot be used, the FIFI (ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out) method is used, with a marginal impact on the measurement of inventory and consumables. Furthermore, values used are adjusted for risks of expiration associated with such inventories. Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at face value. Trade receivables are, if appropriate, depreciated to take into account the collection risks. Cash and cash equivalents In accordance with IAS 7 cash and cash equivalents include readily available cash, as well cash balances blocked in Algeria as a result of restrictions currently imposed transferring dividends and amounting to €€27,463,000 at 31 December 2015 (See note 14 – Provisions and other non-current liabilities). Net cash includes cash and cash equivalents as described above from which are deducted short-term bank facilities and overdrafts. Provisions for contingencies and expenses In accordance with IAS 37, a provision is recorded when there exists an obligation towards a third-party at the end of the reporting period, whether legal, contractual or constructive, resulting in a probable outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts to settle the obligation, without receiving in exchange resources of a value at least equivalent to the latter expected after closing date. Current and deferred tax In accordance with IAS 12, the deferred taxes are determined according to the liability method for timing differences between the book values and the tax bases for the assets and liabilities items. They are not discounted and are measured using the ofﬁcial year-end tax rate which will be applicable as soon as the timing differences are reabsorbed. Deferred tax assets arising from timing differences and tax loss carryforwards are recognised when considered recoverable over the period of validity, taking into account the historical and forward-looking information. It should be noted that no French tax sharing arrangements between the parent company and subsidiaries exist within the Group. Evaluation of risks The risk are of the same nature as those described in section 6-Main risks and uncertainties of the Board of Directors' management report on operations for the year ended 31 December 2015 as well as those mentioned herein in notes 14 and 15; ANNUAL REPORT 2015 79 > Financial report 3. GeoGraphic seGMent inforMation In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are those presented by management based on the Group's internal reporting procedures.

Procedures have been implemented accordingly to reduce the most likely exposures, mainly associated with cash ﬂows in foreign currency generated by business operations. In order to limit the foreign exchange risks, the expenses and income are generally denominated in the currency of the country of operation, thus maintaining a certain balance. All borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. 7. corporate incoMe taX ■ In accordance with IAS 12, the deferred taxes are determined according to the liability method for timing differences between the book values and the tax bases for the assets and liabilities items.

The breakdown of the corporate tax in the income statement is as follows (€ thousands): 2015 2014 Proﬁt before tax 11,434 15,315 Tax at French rate of 33 % 1/3 (3,811) (5,105) Impact of non-deductible expenses (39) (26) Impact of operating country tax rates and tax bases (1,046) (849) Corporate tax income (expense) (4,896) (5,980) 82 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report 8. intanGiBle assets Intangible assets include the following items (€ thousands): Currency Changes in Acquisition / Disposals / 31/12/2014 translation Group 31/12/2015 Allowances Reversals adjustments structure Software 1,012 76 (19) (78) (1) 990 Goodwill 7,307 82 7,389 Non-compete clauses 2,300 2,300 Other intangible assets 518 518 Gross intangible assets 11,137 76 (19) 4 (1) 11,197 Amortisation of software (590) (144) 19 48 1 (666) Amortisation of non-compete clauses (2,290) (10) (2,300) Amortisation of other intangible ﬁxed assets (242) (39) (281) Amortisation, depreciation and impairment (3,122) (193) 19 48 1 (3,247) Net intangible assets 8,015 7,950 CIS deﬁnes a cash ﬂow generating unit as the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, corresponding to the smallest identiﬁable group of assets that generates cash inﬂows largely independent of the cash inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets. For such purpose, CIS Group has selected as UGT. the country level. Goodwill consists of goodwill arising from the acquisition of Cieptal in 2006 and from the acquisition of Top Service in the Democratic Republic of Congo. For Top Service, CIS Group applied the partial goodwill method and did not recognise signiﬁcant items relating to its allocation period. This goodwill is tested for impairment annually according to the separate values of these two CGUs. The following assumptions were used to determine their value in use. 2015 2014 Discount rate (WACC) 6.5% to 8.5% 8% Of which country risk premium 8.0% 6.2% Perpetuity growth rate 3% 3% Budget period 3 years 3 years Furthermore, to prevent any risk associated with this valuation, a sensitivity analysis has been performed based on the following parameters: ■ -2 points of growth in sales ■ -1 point of growth in the operating margin ■ -2 points of growth in long-term cash ﬂows. This analysis did not indicate a recoverable value lower than the carrying value of the CGU.

ANNUAL REPORT 2015 87 > Financial report 19. off-Balance-sheet continGencies and coMMitMents ■ No capital lease commitments exist. ■ Commitments given at 31 December 2015 amounted to €8,775,000, of which:  performance bonds €7,209,000  advance payment guarantees €792,000  tender bonds €551,000  other guarantees €223,000 The maturities of these guarantees range from 1 to 5 years. 20. pension oBliGations A provision for retirement beneﬁts is recorded in the balance sheet for €340,000 relating exclusively to headquarters and expatriate staff. Beneﬁts for local staff are not material in light of less favourable regulations, high turnover and the use of ﬁxed-term employment contracts. The Group records the total amount of its beneﬁt obligations for retirement, early retirement, retirement severance payments, social security, long-service awards, contingency fund and other similar beneﬁts both for the personnel currently working and retired personnel, net of the plan assets and the amounts not recognised in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19. For the deﬁned contribution plans, payments made by the Group are expensed in the period to which they relate. For deﬁned beneﬁt plans, the costs are estimated using the projected unit credit method. Future employee beneﬁt obligations are measured on the basis of assumptions about wage escalation trends, retirement age and probability of payment. These future payments are taken to their present value using a speciﬁc discount rate. The actuarial gains and losses (change in beneﬁts and ﬁnancial assets due to the changes in assumptions and experience adjustments) are recognised under other comprehensive income and amounted to €40,000 at 31 December 2015. Employee beneﬁt costs are divided into 2 categories:  A charge from the reversal of the measurement of present value (net of return on plan assets) recorded under ﬁnancial income and expense;  Operating expense corresponding to service costs; Assumptions used for the calculation are as follows:  A retirement age of 65  Average decrease in career proﬁle  Average staff turnover: 5%  Salary escalation: 1.5% per year  Discount rate: 1.5% per year  Separate mortality ratios based on distinct mortality tables for men and women (Reference: Insee TD 2007-2009 Table) 21. cash and cash eQuivalents in foreiGn currencies Cash and cash equivalents have been translated into euros at the closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. The resulting translation differences are recognised in the income statement of the year as currency gains or losses. 88 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report 22. staff Changes in staff costs and the workforce are as follows (staff costs in € thousands): 2015 2014 Salaries and External Salaries and External Headcount social staff Headcount social staff contributions costs contributions costs Headquarters staff 49 5,919 49 5,921 Expatriate staff 214 6,559 1,020 260 7,401 1,831 Local staff 11,519 84,831 11,325 77,876 Total CIS staff 11,782 97,309 1,020 11,634 91,198 1,831 Local external staff 178 1,373 250 1,929 Workforce managed by the Group 11,960 97,309 2,393 11,884 91,198 3,760 23. consolidated coMpanies The following companies were consolidated: Company Consolidation method Group ownership interest 2015 2014 CIS Parent company 100% 100% ARCTIC CATERING SERVICES (ACS) Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS UKRAINE Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS ASIA Full consolidation 100% 100% ARCTIC CATERING SERVICES (ACS) Full consolidation 85% 85% CIS CAMEROON Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS CHAD Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS BOLIVIA Full consolidation 99% 99% CISM VENEZUELA Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS BRAZIL Full consolidation 100% 100% CATERING NORTH AFRICA SERVICES Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS GEORGIA Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS SAKHALIN (1) Not consolidated 100% ANNUAL REPORT 2015 89 > Financial report CIS NEW CALEDONIA Full consolidation 60% 60% CIS PERU Full consolidation 100% 100% CIEPTAL Full consolidation 100% 100% ICS GUINEA CONAKRY Full consolidation 100% 100% CISY YEMEN Full consolidation 50% 50% UKRAINE CATERING & SERVICES (UCS) Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS ANGOLA (2) Not consolidated 60% CAC KAZAKHSTAN Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS NIGER Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS BURKINA FASO Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS SIERRA LEONE (3) Not consolidated 100% GCS GUINEA CONAKRY Full consolidation 100% 100% CNA MAURITANIA Full consolidation 100% 100% MOHJAT AL-IRAQ GENERAL TRADE Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS MIDDLE EAST Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS DOMINICANA Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS MALI Full consolidation 100% 100% CIS NACALA Full consolidation 80% 80% CIS PACIFIC Full consolidation 100% 100% SUPPORT SERVICES MONGOLIA Full consolidation 49% 49% TOP SERVICE Full consolidation 70% 70% CATER CONGO (4) Full consolidation 100% CIS MOCAMBIQUE (5) Full consolidation 80% CIS ARABIA (6) Full consolidation 55% CIS TURQUIE (7) Full consolidation 55% The Yemeni company CISY and the Mongolian company Support Services Mongolia were fully consolidated as control has been given to the parent company CIS, even though CIS SA's percentages of ownership interest are respectively 50% and 49%.

total assets of €41,297,573 and an income statement presented in list form showing revenue of €34,237,969 and a proﬁt of €803,686. The ﬁnancial period runs for twelve months from 1 January to 31 December 2015. The notes and tables presented below are an integral part of the annual ﬁnancial statements. The separate annual ﬁnancial statements of CIS for the year ended 31 December 2015 were approved by the Board of Directors on 15 April 2016. 1. annual hiGhliGhts The subsidiary CIS Sierra Leone was dissolved in 2015 and the proceeds of this liquidation amounted to €1.2 million. 2. siGnificant accountinG policies General principles and policies The separate parent company ﬁnancial statements for the period have been prepared and presented in accordance with the general principles of conservatism, the time period concept and going concern. For the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items, the historical cost method has been applied. These ﬁnancial statements were prepared on the basis of French GAAP, and notably the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), the accounting decree of 29 November 1983 and the revised French General Chart of Accounts of 1999 as described by Regulation 99-03 of the national French standard setting body, the Accounting Regulations Committee (Comite de la Reglementation Comptable or CRC ) of 29 April 1999. Other regulations applied included CRC regulation 2002-10 for the depreciation, amortisation and impairment of assets and amended by CRC regulation 2003-07 and CRC regulation 2004-06 on the deﬁnition, recognition and measurement of assets. Consistency principle The methods of measurement used for this period are the same as for the previous year. No assets meet the breakdown criteria in the ﬁnancial statements for the period ended 31 December 2015 Depreciation and amortisation periods for foreign operations are based on their useful lives deﬁned according to the terms of the contracts. Assets and accounting methods The main accounting methods applied are as follows: ■ Intangible assets Intangible assets are comprised mainly of:  Goodwill on an exceptional basis fully amortised in 2004 as a result of the dissolution of the subsidiary Myanmar Catering Services Ltd;  Software amortised over 3 years;  Non-compete clauses signed with partners amortised over 5 years. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 97 > Financial report ■ Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost (purchase price and related expenses, though excluding expenses incurred in their acquisition). ■ Depreciation Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis according to their useful lives. Useful lives for these assets are as a general rule as follows:  Fixtures and improvements 10 years  Transport equipment 5 years  Ofﬁce and computer equipment 3 years  Ofﬁce furniture 5 years  Assets at foreign sites 2 to 5 years (according to the term of the contracts) ■ Financial assets Equity investments, as well as the other ﬁnancial assets are recognised at their purchase price, excluding incidental expenses. The ﬁnancial assets are written down, when appropriate, by recording a provision to take into account their market value at year end. This value is usually determined in reference to the share of equity held in the companies concerned, which may be adjusted by taking into account future cash ﬂows over a ﬁve-year period. In those countries where the repatriation of dividends poses a risk, the corresponding amounts are recognised in income when received. ■ Inventories and work in progress Inventories are measured (including transport cost (according to the weighted average cost method. However, for reasons relating to software applications or statutory requirements, where this method cannot be used, the FIFI (ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out) method is used, with a marginal impact on the measurement of inventory and consumables. Furthermore, values used are adjusted for risks of expiration associated with such inventories. ■ Receivables and payables Receivables and payables are recognised at face value. A provision for impairment is recorded when the economic value or realisable value of a receivable is lower than the carrying amount. ■ Foreign currency transactions Receivables and payables in foreign currency are translated into euros at the closing exchange rate at the end of the reporting period. Resulting translation differences are recorded in the balance sheet under unrealised exchange losses and gains and a provision is recorded for the unrealised exchange losses. ■ Marketable securities Marketable securities are measured at acquisition cost excluding expenses incurred in their acquisition. In the case of the transfer of a block of shares of the same class conferring the same rights, their value has been estimated at the weighted average purchase price. Treasury shares held by CIS are recorded as marketable securities. An impairment charge is recognised determined in reference to share price trends 98 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND THE INCOME STATEMENT FIXED

I. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE On 15 April 2016, the Board of Directors decided to adopt the MiddleNext code of corporate governance of December 2009 (the MiddleNext Code ) to as reference for the company in matters of corporate governance, considering that this code is more adapted to the size and structure of its shareholder base. MiddleNext is the independent French association representing listed SMEs and midcaps. This code may be consulted at the MiddleNext website (www.middlenext.com). The MiddleNext Code contains items referred to as points to watch constituting issues to be addressed by the Board of Directors to promote effective corporate governance. The Board of Directors duly noted these points to watch at the meeting of 15 April 2016. The Board of Directors has adopted 13 out of the 15 recommendations of the MiddleNext Code. Certain provisions of the MiddleNext Code were however not selected for reasons explained in the following table: MiddleNext Code recommendations not followed Comply or Explain by the Company : The Board of Directors has rules of procedure (Board charter) specifying the conduct of business rules for directors and Board operating procedures, in accordance with MiddleNext Code Recommendation 7: recommendation 7.

In addition, we propose that you accept the appointment of YLD Conseil, a company in the process of incorporation represented by Yves-Louis Darricarrere as a new director for a term of three years ending on the date of the general meeting called to approve the ﬁnancial statements for ﬁscal year 2018. There were no changes in 2015 in the composition of the Board of Directors. In accordance with MiddleNext Code recommendation 7, the Chairman-CEO, currently the only director holding an executive ofﬁce, does not occupy more than three other positions in other listed companies, including in foreign companies or companies outside their group. ■ Gender balance: Currently there are four women serving on the Board of Directors out of twelve members, in compliance the quota set by French law No.0 2011-103 of 27 January 2011 on gender balance within company boards. ■ Independent directors: The notion of an independent director is that used for MiddleNext Code recommendation 8, and namely :  they must not be a salaried employee or corporate ofﬁcer of the company or of a company in its group, and must not have held such a position within the last three years;  they must not be a signiﬁcant client, supplier or banker of the company or its group, or a client, supplier or banker for whom the company or its group represents a signiﬁcant share of its business;  they must not be a reference shareholder of the company;  they must not have a close family relationship with a corporate ofﬁcer or reference shareholder;  they must not have been an auditor of the company in the course of the previous three years. After reviewing the situation of its members with regards to these criteria, the Board considered that seven of its members constituted independent directors within the meaning of the MiddleNext Code out of the total of 12:  Christian Daumarie, director.  Henri de Bodinat, director.  Michel de Bonnecorse, director.  Sophie Le Tanneur, director.  Frédéric Bedin, director.  Gonzague de Blignieres, director.  Marine Firminy (SASU 75 Paris), director. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 109 > Financial report ■ Terms of ofﬁce: The term of ofﬁce under the articles of association is currently set at six years. However, in accordance with MiddleNext Code recommendation 10 and the provisions of statute, the Board of Directors, ensuring that the length of terms of ofﬁce is adapted to the speciﬁc characteristics of the company, considers that a term of three years is better adapted to the Company and the functioning of the Board. A term of three years would allow the shareholders to intervene on a more frequent basis regarding the composition of the Board of Directors and the ensuring the independence of directors, while allowing Board members the necessary time to acquire an understanding of the speciﬁc characteristics of the Company, the complexity of its core business and its different areas of intervention. This question will be submitted for approval to the next general meeting to be held on 6 June 2016. ■ Director ethics: On 15 April 2016, the Board of Directors adopted rules of procedure specifying the conduct of business rules for directors and Board operating procedures, in accordance with MiddleNext Code recommendation 7. All directors have signed this Board charter. On this basis, each director is informed of the obligations arising from their appointment, and notably those relating to the rules on holding several positions, in the event of any conﬂict of interests arising after their appointment, a director must inform the Board; directors should have good attendance records and ensure they have obtained all necessary information on the subjects addressed in the meetings before making any decision and they must observe the rules of professional secrecy and ethics in this area. The Company does not apply paragraph 7 of recommendation 7 relating to the presence of directors at the general meeting. However, the rules of procedure provide that directors undertake to participate in general meetings and directors have been informed of the importance of their participation in these meetings. ■ Choice of directors: In accordance with MiddleNext Code recommendation 9, when each director is appointed or reappointed, sufﬁcient information about his or her experience and skills should be included in the annual report and provided to the General Meeting. In addition, as from the next General Meeting, each proposal for the appointment or reappointment of a director must be the subject of a distinct resolution in order that shareholders may freely decide on the composition of the Company's Board of Directors. 3. conditions for the preparation and orGanisation of the work of the Board of directors ■ Rules of procedure: In line with the decision to refer to the MiddleNext Code and by application of recommendation 6 of said Code, the Board of Directors' meeting of 15 April 2016 adopted rules of procedure specifying :  The Board of Directors' powers and restrictions imposed on the powers of the Chairman-CEO;  The composition of the board and independence criteria applicable to directors;  The directors' duties and the rules of ethics to which they are subject;  The working of the Board and directors' compensation rules. ■ Frequency of meetings: The Board of Directors provides that meetings shall be held as often as the interests of the Company require. 110 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report ■ Meeting notices: In the absence of Board rules of procedures, the rules of the articles of association were applied. On that basis, in accordance with the Company's articles of association, directors may be called by all means within a reasonable time period and at least 10 days before the proposed Board meeting date. In accordance with Article L.823-17of the French commercial code, the Statutory Auditors were invited to the meetings that reviewed and approved the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements. ■ Transmission of information to directors: The agenda of the different Board meetings is established by the Chairman. Each director is provided with this agenda within a reasonable period in advance of the meeting and at least 10 days before each meeting is held.

Subjects that of a particular sensitive nature, urgent or requiring a greater degree of conﬁdentiality may be discussed without a prior distribution of documents. ■ Holding of meetings: The meetings of the Company's Board of Directors are held at the company’s headquarters, except for the meetings destined to approve the interim and annual ﬁnancial statements that are held in Paris. ■ Minutes of meetings: The minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors are drawn up at the close of every meeting. ■ Board evaluation: The Board of Directors has not adopted formalised procedures for the self-assessment of the Board's work. However, in developing and adopting the rules of procedure, directors exchange points of view and suggest areas for improving the functioning of the Board and the preparation of its work. The Company is attentive to the importance of diversiﬁcation of the Board, with ﬁve women currently serving as directors. The Company has understood the need to increase, to the extent possible, the representation of women on the Board, in order to comply with the new quota requirements that will enter into force in 2017. 4.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES Our Company has developed internal control procedures to ensure rigorous ﬁnancial management, risk management and prepare information to be provided to shareholders on its ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial statements. 1. oBjectives of internal control The objective of the CIS internal control procedures is to prevent risks resulting from the Company's business and ensure that operations are conducted in compliance with the company's procedures as well as applicable laws and regulations. These procedures are primarily destined to ensure the reliability and fair presentation of ﬁnancial and accounting information communicated by the company. These procedures take into account the speciﬁc nature of the Company's business that is exercised exclusively in international markets through subsidiaries and branch ofﬁces. 2. orGanisation and iMpleMentation of internal control procedures CIS has adopted three organisational priorities for internal control: ■ Internal control manager: A position was created in 2013 of Internal Control Manager reporting directly to Executive Management with the following missions: auditing the quality of internal control procedures already implemented by all Group entities; improving risk management; identifying new areas of risks to which our business is exposed and implementing appropriate procedures to address these risks. ■ Internal control functions for business operation:  Internal control is also assured by the ﬁnancial controller who performs on-site missions in the operating countries and who is tasked with conducting all investigations considered necessary to verify the efﬁcacy of accounting and ﬁnancial processes in each subsidiary, compliance with established rules (banking and legal authorities, obligations, account and cash ﬂow management, etc.) and identify incidents of potential fraud.  A position of vice president with responsibility for management control was created in 2012 tasked primarily to monitor and analyse key management indicators, improve controls and proﬁtability and ensure the security of operations.  Furthermore, country managers and regional managers are responsible for management issues relating to subsidiaries and entities under their authority. To this purpose, they conduct a certain number of veriﬁcations both with a purely management focus in relation to quality and proﬁtability objectives and to identify potential deﬁciencies.  It should also be known that Statutory Auditors exist for each Group subsidiary in connection with the consolidation process responsible for certifying the accounts and identifying, as required, all risks of accounting irregularities and information relating to the going concern of these subsidiaries. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 115 > Financial report ■ Quality approach: CIS has implemented a quality management system (QMS) to meet the objectives set by the company’s quality policy and the requirements of the ISO 9001-V2008 standard for which the Marseilles headquarters obtained certiﬁcation in February 2004 (catering engineering, food and living accommodation services in extreme conditions and in emerging countries, managed from the head ofﬁce). Within this context, the Company has produced a quality manual (QM) deﬁning and specifying the various company processes as well as any related procedures. In parallel, a quality department was created to monitor and update the quality system. To this purpose, internal audits are carried out on a regular basis to ensure that the provisions adopted by the quality management system are in compliance with the standard, applied and effective. The suitability and effectiveness of the quality management system is assessed on a regular basis through process or management reviews by the different parties concerned. Regardless of the type of review (process or management), the methods are similar and only their scope is different:  The process review applies to a single process,  The management process focuses on a set of processes with a summarised approach. The frequency of these reviews is adapted to the results of prior reviews and the availability of all participating parties, with the planning schedule updated by the Quality Manager. All actions are planned and monitored jointly by the Quality Manager and the relevant concerned parties. 3. preparation and verification of accountinG and financial inforMation The ﬁnance department, operating under the authority and oversight of Executive Management, is responsible for all accounting functions. In performing this role, it collects all accounting and ﬁnancial information transmitted by subsidiaries, after successive controls were performed by the relevant subsidiary and regional managers, with the intervention of their own departments as well as the auditors of the subsidiaries. The Finance Department consequently exercises a role of oversight with respect to the relevant standards and laws (in particular relating to legal compliance and tax matters). The Finance Department also is responsible for ensuring the consistency of all ﬁnancial information and the production of ﬁnancial statements. To this purpose, it ensures in particular the quality of the translation of the ﬁnancial statements of foreign subsidiaries. The Finance Department is responsible for supervising cash management operations and ensuring the conformity and validity of the translation of transactions in foreign currencies. 116 ANNUAL REPORT 2015 > Financial report Preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements In compliance with EC regulation 1606/2002 on the application of international accounting standards, the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements of 31 December 2015 were prepared in accordance with the international ﬁnancial reporting standards (IFRS) in issue on that date. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer is responsible for the consolidation. All relevant items are then audited by the Statutory Auditors before the ﬁnancial statements are published. Marseilles, 15 April 2016 Régis ARNOUX Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer ANNUAL REPORT 2015 117 > Financial report 118 ANNUAL REPORT2015 > Financial report To the shareholders: The purpose of this document is to present you the reasons for the resolutions submitted to the Annual Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting in accordance with article L.225-115 3° of the French commercial code. The General Meeting of 6 June 2016 has accordingly been called mainly for the following reasons: (i) to approve the complete revision proposed of Company's articles of association and to adopt the new articles of association; (ii) to obtain approval by the Company's shareholders of the annual and consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the periods ended 31 December 2015, adopted by the Board of Directors; (iii) to set the dividend, approve the regulated agreements and set the amount of attendance fees; (iv) to renew the ofﬁces of directors whose terms are expiring; (v) to appoint a new director; (vi) to vote on the renewal on the terms of ofﬁce of the Statutory Auditors and the Alternate Auditors; (vii) to approve the authorization given to the Board of Directors to deal in the Company's shares. I. EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTIONS 1st resolution Many legislative changes have been introduced since 2010 including in particular:  the ordinance of 9 December 2010 transposing Directive 2007/36/EC of 11 July 2007 and decree No. 2014-1466 of 8 September 2014 eliminating the main obstacles preventing the shareholders of companies having their registered ofﬁce in the territory of a member state of the European Union whose shares are admitted to trading in a regulated market established in or operating within the European Union from exercising their rights. This Directive in this way promotes an efﬁcient participation of the shareholders in general meetings, in particular when they do not reside in the State where the meeting is held; The ordinance authorizes in particular shareholders to request that items of business be placed on the agenda of the meeting, without being required to simultaneously ﬁle a draft resolution; It also simpliﬁes procedures for voting by proxy, by allowing shareholders of listed companies to appoint as their proxy, any individual or legal entity of their choice to participate in the general meeting and vote in their name. This reform was accompanied by a measure designed to prevent conﬂicts of interest and establish guidelines for the practice of actively soliciting to serve as proxies.  Decree°2014-1466 of 8 December 2014 modifying in particular the date and procedures for determining the status of shareholder authorized to participate in the general meetings of listed companies, as provided for by article R.225-85 of the French commercial code. The right to participate in shareholders' meetings is henceforth subject to registration of the shares in the share account on the second business day prior to the meeting at 00:00, and no longer an accounting entry on the third business day preceding the general meeting at 00:00.  Law No. 2015-990 of 6 August 2015 relating to holding multiple ofﬁces in listed companies  Law No. 2015-994 of &7 August 2015 relating to employee representation on Boards of Directors. In effect, the obligation to provide for employee representation on the Board of Directors has been extended to public limited companies (sociétés anonymes) or limited stock partnerships (sociétés en commandite par actions) employing for two consecutive years: • at least 5,000 permanent employees in the company and its subsidiaries, direct or indirect, having its registered ofﬁce in France; • at least 10,000 permanent employees in the company and its subsidiaries, direct or indirect, having its registered ofﬁce in France or another country and having an obligation to establish a Works Council (new article L.225-27-1 I of the French commercial code);  Ordinance No. 2015-1576 of 3 December 2015 regarding requirements to disclose the crossing of shareholder thresholds. ANNUAL REPORT 2015 119 > Financial report Furthermore, on 15 April 2016, the Board of Directors decided to adopt the MiddleNext code of corporate governance of December 2009 (the MiddleNext Code ) as reference for the company in matters of corporate governance, considering that this code is more adapted to the size and structure of its shareholder base. MiddleNext is the independent French association representing listed SMEs and midcaps. This code may be consulted at the MiddleNext website (www.middlenext.com). Accordingly, in accordance with MiddleNext Code recommendation 10, the Board of Directors, ensuring that the length of terms of ofﬁce is adapted to the speciﬁc characteristics of the company, considers that a term of three years is better adapted to the Company and the functioning of the Board. A term of three years would allow the shareholders to intervene on a more frequent basis regarding the composition of the Board of Directors and the ensuring the independence of directors, while allowing Board members the necessary time to acquire an understanding of the speciﬁc characteristics of the Company, the complexity of its core business and its different areas of intervention. Pursuant to the above, we propose that the Company's articles of association be revised in order to comply with new legislation in force applying that apply to commercial companies and the recommendations of the MiddleNext Code.

Conclusion Based on this work and the limitations mentioned above, we attest to the completeness of the required CSR Information in the management report, with the exception of information relating to the breakdown of employees by gender and age; recruitment and dismissals; absenteeism; collective agreements occupational illnesses; water consumption and supply in relation to local constraints; energy consumption, energy performance measures and use of renewable energies; waste prevention, recycling and elimination measures which were only presented or a limited scope as indicated in the methodology note. 2. reasoned opinion on the fair presentation of csr inforMation Nature and scope of work We conducted three interviews with persons responsible for preparing CSR information, departments responsible for collecting information and, where appropriate, those in charge of internal control and risk management procedures in order to: ■ assess the suitability of the Guidelines in the light of their relevance, completeness, reliability, impartiality and comprehensibility, and taking industry best practice into account when necessary; ■ verify the implementation of a data-collection, compilation, processing and control procedure designed to produce CSR Information that is exhaustive and consistent, and familiarise ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures involved in preparing the CRS Information We selected the CSR information to be tested and determined the nature and scope of the tests, taking into consideration their importance based on the company's proﬁle, the social and environmental impact of its activities, priorities in terms of sustainable development and industry best practice. With regard to the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important : ■ At level of the consolidating entity, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to substantiate the qualitative information (organisation, policy, action), we followed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and veriﬁed, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data and we veriﬁed their consistency and concordance with the other information in the management report; ANNUAL REPORT 2015 137 > Financial report ■ at the level of a representative sample of countries selected by us by activity, contribution to the consolidated indicators, location and risk analysis, we conducted interviews to ensure that procedures are followed correctly, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations made and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The sample thus selected represents 21% of headcount and 100% of quantitative environmental data. For the other CSR consolidated information published, we assessed is based on our knowledge of the Company. Finally, we also assessed the relevance of explanations given for any information not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We consider that the sampling methods and the size of the samples retained based on our professional judgement allow us to issue a moderate assurance. A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive veriﬁcations. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to all information systems and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR Information cannot be completely eliminated. Conclusion Based on this work, with the exception of the impact of the absence of information mentioned in part one of this report, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.
