Environment UN Global Compact Principles covered: Principle 7: Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental Challenges Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental Responsibilities Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally Friendly technologies 17 Environment Current Commitment Bidco Africa understands that its activities occasionally affect the environment and the communities in which we operate. It is, therefore, the company’s responsibility to manage these impacts and control them to the bear minimal possible. A brief description of our Processes, Policies or Systems  Bidco is committed to protect the Environment. We are certified for ISO 14001, Environmental Management System  We are totally dedicated to preventing pollution in order to assure protection of human health and the environment and are committed to achieve its continual improvement through the effective operation of the environmental management system.  Whereas there are compliance and regulatory laws, we have our own set standards that we abide by in cases where the existing are inadequate.  We run an effluent treatment plant to treat our waste to ensure that we recycle water for other uses such as cooling and watering lawns. In so doing, we minimize our resource consumption and improve our environmental performance.  Our policies are constantly reviewed to ensure that the activities, products and services are appropriate to nature and have no adverse impacts on human health and the environment.  Our environmental policy is communicated to all the stakeholders promptly and made available at all stages and levels of our engagement. Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) The company has invested in a state-of-the-art effluent treatment facility which will see the amount of water used in all processes reduced by half. The high technology plant has automated systems that is able to recycle already-used water which is, instead, used for other purposes such as cleaning and in the washrooms. Similarly, water that is to be discharged undergoes thorough clean-up through the plant before it is released. All checks are done and the effluent elements are in full compliance with the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA). Environmental Clean-up The company cares for the cleanliness and hygiene of the community where the operations are. In the belief of not just doing good but also being good, staff took part in environmental clean-up and creating awareness to the community on the need to observe cleanliness at all times. 18 Part of Bidco staff take part in the clean-up exercise in Thika town. ‘SAVE WATER TOWERS’ PROJECT Bidco, together with a number of stakeholders, kicked off a 5 years ambitious project dubbed ‘Save Water towers and started at ’ Ndakaini Dam, in Murang’a County in Kenya which is one of the largest dam in Kenya supplying up to 80% of the water consumed in Nairobi and its environs. Over the years, the water levels in the dam have drastically reduced as a result of the destruction of the water catchment areas hence affecting the lives of the people depending on the water as a result of frequent water rationing. The project seeks to plant up to 1 million Bamboo trees at the various Aberdare water catchment areas in order to conserve the environment as well as improve the supply of water. The project has brought together other stakeholders such as Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC), Kenya Forestry Service (KFS), Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), Africa Plantation Capital (APC) and the Ministry of Water, Environment and Natural Resources. 19 The first phase of the project was launched in May 2017 in an event that brought together the management and staff of all the key stakeholders and officially opened by the Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Water, Environment and Natural Resources Judy Wakhungu. 20 Ministry of Water, Environment and Natural Resources Cabinet Secretary Judy Wakhungu, Bidco Chairman Vimal Shah, Bidco CEO Thiagarajan Ramaurthy and Director of Africa Plantation Capital Kevin Karoki planting Bamboo seedlings at Ndakaini Dam. Environment –Future Activities planned for next year  We plan to participate in more tree planting activities in an effort to help conserve the environment.  The Bamboo project is a major area of focus for the company and it plans to bring more stakeholders to help realize the goal at the end of five years. Energy  Bidco activities are all centered on ensuring Energy efficiency in realizing responsible Consumption with minimal or no wastage.  Our daily energy use and consumption is recorded and monitored which helps enhance Efficiency.  We have invested in energy efficient machinery and equipment such as the LED bulbs that save on efficiency and cost of power.  Bidco runs a Co-generation plant that uses bio-waste to generate its own power. This helps in conserving the environment and reducing the wastes. Recently, Bidco has started contracting farmers to grow Bamboo which it will eventually use for its energy use. The crop is a source of renewable energy and is environmentally friendly and is easy to grow.  The company has established a sound Energy Management System leading to a proactive environmental preservation and the highest degree of efficient utilization of energy.  We also train our staff to ensure competence in energy efficiency and conservation on a day-to-day operational basis.  Bidco also complies with the Energy Act 2006, the Energy (Energy Management) Regulations 2012 and other statutory requirements governing energy efficiency. Accordingly, we have an energy policy statement that is communicated to all our stakeholders such as the employees, government regulatory bodies, energy suppliers through platforms such as the website, notice boards, working areas and in reports on energy.  We are totally dedicated to minimize energy consumption through continual improvement in energy conservation through effective energy management systems practiced at every level and the involvement of every employee/member of the Bidco Family, without exception. 21  We benchmark our performance continuously against the best in the world, review energy targets periodically in order to improve our energy performance and eliminate wastage.  We monitor, record and evaluate the consumption of energy and enhance efficiency through re-designing and implementation of energy efficient programs.  We regularly conduct internal and external energy audits to identify areas of improvement as also to ensure total compliance with our energy policy.  We review our energy policy whenever the need arises due to technological advances or policy changes to ensure that our activities and processes conform to best practices.  We communicate our Energy Policy to employees and all our stakeholders. Activities planned for next year  Bidco has implemented an Energy Management System in compliance to the ISO 50001 standard.  To continue with its plans on effective energy use and environmental conservation, Bidco plans to fully implement the use of Bamboo as an effective source of renewable energy in the co-generation facility. Anti-corruption UN Global Compact principles covered; Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery. Current Commitment  We remain committed to implementing the10th principle of anti‐corruption and ensuring its total elimination in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.  We are in the process of implementing ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management System. A brief description of our Processes or Systems  Bidco has rolled out a Code of Ethics booklet to all its staff and stakeholders who have signed a commitment form to follow all that is defined in the code.  We have clearly demarcated governance structures that all employees are aware of and that have the full backing of the management.  We have guidelines and policies on anti-corruption. Corruption remains an offence in Bidco and the offence is punishable by termination and prosecution.  We also have a policy in place to curb any conflict of interest and to ensure that all tenders are analyzed and opened before a panel to ensure transparency and accountability. 22 Activities implemented in the last year The Bidco Africa Code of Ethics launch and implementation As reported in the previous year, Bidco made public its Code of Ethics which clearly outlines what is expected from all stakeholders in the cause of carrying out business with the company. The company acknowledged that working together to enhance Happy Healthy Living across Africa recognized the need to put down the values in a guiding document that can be referred to during the day-to-day activities. It became a guide to dealing with each other and not a substitute for good decision making and affirmed commitment to living according to the ethos, principles and values. The launch was done in a ceremony that saw the Chairman of The Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) Nick Nesbitt endorse the move. Other stakeholders such as customers, bankers, insurers, distributors, the media and staff were also present to witness the occasion. The code which can be found on this link from the website sets the standards by which the stakeholders are expected to conduct themselves and their operations. The code, which applies to all stakeholders, covers among other subjects, the use of corporate funds, conflict of interest and even protection of company information. It celebrates a broad diversity in culture, language and working practices but nevertheless applies to all irrespective of cultural and geographical differences. Why a Code of Ethics It is an expression of all the values and an instrument of self-regulation that outlines the rules and regulations that every Bidco stakeholder must follow to uphold the company’s ethical standards. It guides on how to resolve ethical dilemmas and provide contact information in case of any questions and concerns. Business Ethics The code has become an authoritative guide which determines what is expected of all stakeholders and how to judge a misconduct. It discusses among other issues, Confidentiality & Non-disclosure of information, use of Information Technology, Privacy, Anti-corruption, Protecting Bidco’s property. Occupational Health and Safety, Environmental Protection, Integrity, Respect, Fair Treatment, Sustainability, Fair Competition, Responsible Marketing, Conflicts of Interest, Business and Financial Records, Bribery and Confidentiality of Information. 23 As a result, a proper working committee to bring the code to life is in place.
