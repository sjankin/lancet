Founded in 1876, the Morimura Group is a corporate group whose name is synonymous with Japan’s ceramic industry. Over the 140 years since its founding, the Group has been sincerely committed to delivering high-quality products on time and at a reasonable price. Around 1930 Inheriting the corporate DNA of the Morimura Group, the NGK SPARK PLUG Group will deliver Real Value beyond customers’ expectations. Developed Japan’s first spark plug 1958 Commercialized cutting tools The Nittoku Way—The Nittoku Group’s Shared Values— Magoemon Ezoe, who was convinced of the advent of a motorized society in Japan, decided In 1958, started the manufacture of to manufacture spark plugs domestically, even ceramic cutting tools. This has NGK SPARK PLUG has newly set the values to be shared across the company by reviewing and outlining the ideas that have been valued since the though the number of automobiles produced in since been contributing to cost the country was only 49 units at that time. He reduction and higher efficiency in founding of Morimura Gumi, from which the Morimura Group originated. By never straying from the values passed down through the generations and succeeded in developing Japan’s first spark plug reaffirming the role that we are committed to fulfill, we will continue to make steady progress. product processing by developing in 1930 and began selling the product. In 1936, ceramic tools that are far superior in terms of cutting speed, he established NGK SPARK PLUG as Japan’s first plug manufacturer. product life and finished surfaces compared with cemented carbide tools. Morimura Gumi began international ShikaiShikai-Keitei means to cooperate with Shiseitrade to get back the assets that had the people of the world (Shikai) like Keitei left Japan.
