International Holding a/s CVR. no. 31 15 85 91 Corporate Social Responsibility 2016 SCHUR INTERNATIONAL HOLDING A/S – CSR STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Our company's history started more than 170 years ago. Since Schur was founded in Denmark in 1846, we have experienced the ups and downs of this world. Thanks to the efforts of our talented staff, good relations to suppliers and customers and responsible management, we have been able to stay in business until today. It is a great pleasure and a great responsibility. It is our task to safeguard Schur's future. It goes without saying that both then and today we must be engaged in sustainability – what made and will make us able to sustain. To achieve this, we think it is necessary that we continue to work on a good balance between the three bottom lines – people, planet and profit. This is the only way we can survive as a company. It is also the only way we can overcome today's big challenges together with the rest of the world, like for example climate change. Since 2015, UN Global Compact and its 10 principles has been the overall framework for this work. This report includes the results of our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives implemented during the accounting year 2015/2016. We are pleased to show our continued support via this, our second annual Communication on Progress Report.
