To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. However, we must admit our principles are under pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in late 2014 when securing the “CSR Abroad Stig Maasbøl Group CEO Prize”, an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of ScanCom International A/S Foreign Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to continue our CSR strategy. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom controls all materials and products in order to meet all relevant regulations in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified hardwood, and today we use 100% FSC hardwood. At the same time we continuously optimize our operating activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Our main operation site in Vietnam is operated under ISO 14001 certificates. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labour rights. Key features of this are: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification for health and safety management was obtained for the Vietnamese operation in 2014. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact, in addition to BSCI monitoring and certifications, sends a clear signal to all stakeholders that we are committed to doing business the right way and supports our activities in terms of meeting the CSR requirements of our global customers. Requirements for contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for the improvement of CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practises this by performing CSR audits at key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them to sign our Code of Conduct, and targets are set for continuous improvement in terms of that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom, even with the difficult market conditions, has been able to remain true to its basic CSR values and to make progress, or at least maintained the same high level, in all 10 of the UN Global Compact principles. For the future, ScanCom will continue to further develop commitment to the UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. It is important for me to highlight that for ScanCom CSR is not a project that starts and ends, but a strategy integrated into daily business and into our business plan. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures The finance figures for ScanCom International A/S are presented below: Key figures (DDK million): 2016/17 2015/16 2014/15 2013/14 2012/13 Income Statement: Revenue 886.1 898.1 880.8 672.2 710.6 EBITDA 45.3 47.3 32.6 21.2 39.7 Profit/loss on ordinary operating activities 19.6 22.8 10.3 6.7 16.7 Financial income and expenses, net -12.0 -9.0 5.1 -12.6 -13.7 Profit/loss on ordinary activities before tax 7.6 13.8 15.4 -5.9 3.0 Tax on profit/loss -4.4 -7.3 -5.2 0.1 -0.4 Net Profit/loss for the year 3.3 6.5 10.1 -5.8 2.6 Balance: Balance sheet total 538.3 564.9 593.8 506.1 431.6 Purchases of property, plant, 22.8 31.2 35.0 20.2 12.4 and equipment, gross Current Assets 392.6 393.5 427.3 357.9 280.3 Equity 154.0 156.1 152.7 150.3 160.1 Short-term debt 377.6 401.3 432.8 301.3 210.4 Employees: Average number of emloyees 3,144 3,459 3,932 4,415 4,284 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives For season 16/17 ScanCom selected the performance indicators given below and set related objectives.

Supplier of the year ScanCom International received a “Supplier of the Year” award from one of our biggest customers, Jysk. Human rights ScanCom International is committed to influencing our employees and business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be seen in full on our website: http://www.scancom.net SCVN uses the BSCI monitoring system to ensure that its contract manufacturers, as a minimum, comply with basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labour conditions. For season 16/17 ScanCom verified quality and social compliance for 30 contract manufacturers and used 27 contract manufacturers, all of which were registered on the BSCI platform. 9 ScanCom International A/S BSCI monitoring of Contract Manufacturers Contract manufacturers SS 15/16 SS 16/17 Production site registered on BSCI audit platform 30 27 Total number of BSCI audits, initial and re-audit 18 25 Total number of ScanCom Code of Conduct audits 30 27 BSCI compliance rating SS 15/16 SS 16/17 A (Outstanding) 1/30 3/27 B (Good) 2/30 1/27 C (Acceptable) 25/30 22/27 D (Improvement needed) 2/30 1/27 E (Non-Compliant) 0/30 0/27 ScanCom continued to increase collaboration with more contract manufacturers and their production sites were registered on BSCI, in order to meet the new code of BSCI requirements and to ensure implementation. Applied with new audit announcement method (Semi-Announced). Supplier audits ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR levels at our suppliers. All suppliers signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. 100% of new suppliers, where relevant, were subject to an onsite CSR audit conducted by ScanCom. In general, the top level management of suppliers is integral to developments in this area, as the awareness and commitment of suppliers is improved due to the allocation of resources and time in order to make improvements. Child labor and forced labor During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits, BSCI and SMETA audits. Again for this season we can report that no cases of child labour or forced labour were recorded. Labor ScanCom is committed to the support and protection of labour rights including: abolition of child labour, elimination of forced labour, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination.

SCVN’s activities are situated in an area with a traditionally very high labour turnover in the furniture industry. ScanCom was affected by this for several years and actively addressed the problem by creating incentives for employees to stay. These have taken the form of an improvement in working conditions and the provision of a range of benefits: supporting the children of employees, providing a transportation allowance, and assistance with house rental. Specifically to meet legal requirements, in the previous year we installed an air cooling system to reduce temperatures at most production areas which had a high temperature. The focus on making it attractive to stay with ScanCom was continued throughout season 16/17 and seems to have had a positive impact. The employee turnover rate for SCVN was reduced from 51% in season 15/16 to 49% in season 16/17, and although this figure may still be considered high, it meets the objective for this parameter. Related to this area, it is worth noting that the headcount was significantly reduced in 16/17 due to advanced robotics technology and the installation of CNC machinery at production areas. The aim of this shift was to increase capacity and reduce the amount of manual labour as well. SCIN In terms of labour turnover for season 16/17, there was a decrease of 7.3% compared to 15/16. This is because this year the total number of shipments was lower than last year so we did not employ as many contract workers. Additionally, the job market is so competitive that most employees try to keep their work as it is difficult to find alternative employment. 14 ScanCom International A/S SCBR The labour turnover of SCBR saw significant variation from the previous year due to high movement at the Rio Grande do Sul “Minas do Leão” site, which was adjusting its staffing. A positive for SCBR in this area is the permanence of the employees on its staff, which would see the turnover as low if only the Telemâco Borba was considered. In the last three years, labour turnover was relatively high due to the activation of the unit at Minas do Leão in Rio Grande do Sul/RS. The population of the city is considered “agricultural” rather than experienced in logging. This has caused ScanCom to hire many people, a lot of whom subsequently resigned due to lack of experience and difficulty in adapting to the segment. The number improved by 21% in the period of 15/16, when people were adapting and finding the work attractive, motivated by the organizational climate, benefits and guarantees of certain wages at the end of each month. For the period 16/17 this number increased by 9%, raising the total to 46%. The reasons for this were: shutdowns imposed by ScanCom in light of estimates of production reduction which were motivated by the low price marketing of pine wood. This led to an immediate reduction in Fixed costs, causing the personnel frame to be adjusted to suit the demands of the operation. Overtime Overtime rates have now stabilized for all companies in the group and all are in compliance with local regulations. Wages and benefits SCVN In Vietnam, the legal minimum wage is frequently adjusted, most recently by 7% in Jan 2017, and ScanCom has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level, applying principles for actual living costs rather than the minimum wage. In season 16/17 the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 23% higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continued the policy of an extra 2.5 % health and social and unemployment insurance for workers compared to the legal requirement. SCIN pays contract workers at the rate of the minimum wage as decided by the government and all permanent employees are paid at a minimum of 16.4% above the minimum wage level, depending on position and responsibility SCBR pays wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. For the latter period 16/17, SCBR salaries were at least 28% above the national regulation, which is a positive factor in terms of the retention of staff. Discrimination ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. Age distribution of employees. (Numbers are per end of season) The low median age of ScanCom’s employees reflects the age distribution in the population of the countries where manufacturing takes place. Furthermore the official retirement ages are relatively low with 55/60, 55/55, 60/65 years for women/ men in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Brazil respectively. 15 ScanCom International A/S Age Site Season Group Grand Total 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-65 Management 5 147 135 20 1 308 2016-2017 (Headcount in Staff 41 141 23 5 3 213 June 2017) Worker 520 1,184 561 141 7 2,413 Total Headcount 566 1472 719 166 11 2,934 SCVN Management 3 169 115 14 1 302 2015-2016 (Headcount in Staff 34 139 23 7 2 205 June 2016) Worker 385 1,111 491 117 4 2,108 Total Headcount 422 1,419 629 138 7 2,615 Management 0 2 19 5 26 2016-2017 (Headcount in Staff 0 15 8 2 25 June 2017) Worker 24 56 71 18 169 Total Headcount 24 73 98 25 220 SCIN Management 0 2 22 3 0 27 2015-2016 (Headcount in Staff 0 15 7 1 0 23 June 2016) Worker 19 60 63 13 0 155 Total Headcount 19 37 92 17 0 205 Management 0 1 1 1 0 3 2016-2017 (Headcount in Staff 6 8 4 0 0 18 June 2017) Worker 3 22 15 4 0 44 Total Headcount 9 31 20 5 0 65 SCBR Management 0 1 1 2 2 6 2015-2016 (Headcount in Staff 10 10 4 1 1 26 June 2016) Worker 30 40 22 20 2 114 Total Headcount 40 51 27 23 5 146 Salary comparison for female and male employees (USD/month). At ScanCom salaries for each country are commensurate with qualifications and role, not gender. Differences in the above figures are related to different kinds of jobs. The salaries of SCBR are readjusted, according to the Union’s determination, at least once a year. In relation to the previous year, there was a restructuring of some sectors and closure of the unit at Minas do Leão RS. Due to layoffs and hiring, salaries in some categories have suffered reductions. 16 ScanCom International A/S The variation also occurred due to the adjustment of the staff in general terms. Older company employees have been disconnected from higher salaries, directly impacting on the average.

In relation to the OHSAS 18001 regulations, SCVN has now fully implemented standards associated with firefighting and safety regulations. SCVN The number of accidents in season 16/17 was reduced by 18 % compared to season 15/16. Last season the CSR Objective focused on the importance of reporting Lost Time Injuries. The improvement came about due to a CSR management system that was launched to focus on Personnel Safety and Occupational Health and measures to be taken to prevent accidents, incidents and work related illness. There were two incidences of small fires due to equipment. As a result, a schedule has been devised to follow a maintenance procedure for relevant equipment, allied to regular testing in order to prevent fire. Additionally, a fire prevention and firefighting course including evacuation and fire drill procedures are held for all workers every year with the aim of raising awareness and giving employees relevant, useful knowledge and skills. These include: following the rules and instructions given, actively listening and participating during the “HSE tour” report, asking supervisors for advice, stopping work when it is unsafe or when you see unsafe acts or unsafe conditions. SCIN trains all new employees in health and safety, including evacuation and fire drill procedures and this is repeated twice a year. SCIN also provides general training to give information related to broader areas of health and safety, such as first aid training, motorbike safety and HIV-AIDS prevention and awareness. 17 ScanCom International A/S SCBR In the 16/17 period a solitary accident occurred and this improvement from the previous year was possible due to the work carried out by the Work Safety Department, which promoted awareness among all collaborators. In the previous year 15/16, a larger number of accidents occurred, with more days lost due to the need for recovery. “Nothing serious in general” Lost days, all types (incl. maternity leave): As for the lost days, in 15/16 we had the largest number of pregnant women and “miscellaneous” absences due to various symptoms of illness based on the “CID” International Code of illness. This raised the number , as in Brazil each pregnant woman stays at home for 120 days. In the period, the number of staff was reduced due to the closure of the unit at Minas do Leão RS. Days lost to sickness remained at the same level as the previous year; it is a difficult area to control as it is linked to the characteristics of individual employees. Due to accident prevention campaigns, we have managed to reduce and control the number of accidents and absences resulting from accidents. Maternity leave was also taken by two employees. Even with the reduction of the collaborators ‘ framework, we have strengthened and intensified training on safety at work, which has resulted in a reduction in the number of accidents.

The annual audit was undertaken with a good result. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data 18 ScanCom International A/S Over the preceding years ScanCom has worked towards an improvement in the collection of reliable data and this has now reached a satisfactory level. Resources In general, all parameters show positive results due to effective management for year 16-17 compared with 15-16.

New methods for recycling wood and plastic composite furniture have resulted in increased recycling figures. Total electrical energy was reduced because we: applied an energy management system and made use of the energy monitoring data from sub-meters; installed LED lighting at all production sites and offices. We aim to continue this control when new machines are installed in future. SCIN Electrical energy consumption for 16/17 was 12.5% lower than 15/16 but the amount is not so significant. Water consumption is for toilet facilities for employees only and this is lower than 15/16 due to lower numbers of employees. Industrial waste is higher as we cleaned out unused material. Sawn timber is lower due to the number of shipments being lower. SCBR In general, SCBR presented a reduction in its use of resources, motivated by the awareness of our collaborators and disabling the Minas do Leão unit. 19 ScanCom International A/S In the Telemachus Borba unit, the boiler and the drying activities were interrupted for a period of three months, which also contributed to the decrease. Waste volumes (Metric Tons) SCVN Recycled waste was sold to contractors for reuse. Domestic waste handling increased during last season. Hazardous waste was reduced because we controlled all production processes closely and improved classification in the waste handling procedure. SCIN Hazardous waste: this season we started to dispose of small items of hazardous waste such as lamp, oil, cotton rag, finishing material, in accordance with government regulations and coordination with a third party for disposal. SCBR SCBR, during the last period, adjusted some controls, allowing a better preview of the processes, thus offering opportunities for improvement. Following this line, we have campaigns to raise awareness of how best to use the resources and also classification for disposal, for which we allowed a reduction in residues destined for general disposal.

Restricted substances. In season 16/17 ScanCom updated its List of Restricted Substances as added 4 new SVHCs to the Candidate list in order to continue to meet relevant legal requirements (ECHA) and those of customers. We experienced a continued increase in customer focus on restricted substances, and our system was in all cases able to provide the requested information for materials used in our products. Legality of wood The European Union Timber Regulation is increasingly being enforced. ScanCom continues to maintain its Due Diligence System (DDS) every year. To ensure that the requested documentation is provided to our customers, we experienced a need to try to simplify the documentation process. We also continue to maintain FSC certification at ScanCom with annual renewal by an independent 3rd party, approved by the EU as a control organization. The certificate covers all wood used by the ScanCom supply chain. Anti-corruption ScanCom maintains its own Code of Conduct with annual updates. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees and all new employees receive training in the content. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct is communicated to all subcontractors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers – and they are requested to sign the code. All subcontractors’ employees working on ScanCom’s premises during season 16/17 have received the training in ScanCom’s Code of Conduct and were monitored in terms of workplace safety. 21 ScanCom International A/S Training activities In season 16/17 ScanCom continued systematic training of employees to support the understanding and practice of social compliance and good environmental behaviour.
