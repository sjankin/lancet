Our main actions include reducing the number of printers, printing on both sides of the paper automatically, and running employee awareness campaigns. Most of our communications are digital. Where printed documents are necessary, we use recycled paper. Our printon-demand platform enables employees who need to publish a commercial brochure to order the exact quantity they need, when they need them, avoiding the waste of over-ordering.
