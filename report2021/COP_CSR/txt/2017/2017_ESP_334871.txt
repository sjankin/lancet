Today, I am pleased to present you the results of our effort. In 2016, we registered growth in our sales figures, number of people and especially, in our production capacities, due to the trust that our clients have placed in us. Because of our expansion, we implemented a new organisational structure with the objective of reinforcing local teams to provide more value to our clients and, at the same time, to advance in the standardisation of our processes and the integration of our people, from a global perspective. In July 2016, Rut Aranda was appointed CEO of Cerealto. Rut accepted the great challenge to continue to lead this corporate project, after 14 years in the Company, in different roles such as I+dea Director, Americas Director and Northern Europe Director. We are convinced that her tenacity and leadership ability combined with her knowledge and global vision of the Company will provide us with the necessary force to allow us to progress in the right direction. Likewise, we have made big efforts towards reinforcing leadership within the organisation, promoting knowledge of our business model in key positions and deploying objectives and action plans to the entire workforce, to ensure that our teams work in the same direction. Moreover, we have promoted the training and development of our colleagues in business related matters, through San Pelayo Business School (our school for leaders). Also, we have contributed to the training of the children of our workers who have shown excellent academic performance, by granting them Excellence Scholarships. This year we renew our commitment to society, through our adherence to the Global Compact and its ten principles. In 2017, we will continue focused on the expansion and consolidation of our business project and, especially, on our people’s wellbeing. We are aware of the fact that to achieve the objectives that we have set, we must keep on applying the same enthusiasm, passion and dedication as we have done up until now. Finally, I would like to thank the dedication and effort of everyone who works daily to turn this great dream that we call Cerealto into a reality. With best wishes, Luis Ángel López President ANNUAL REPORT • CEREALTO 2016 • Cultivating the future 4 Message from the CEO I am pleased to present our annual report in which we take stock of our performance and our commitment with all our stakeholders, for the fifth consecutive year. 2016 was a year of expansion and consolidation for Cerealto, as endorsed by our main financial indicators. We achieved a turnover of €93 million and an EBITDA of €4.2 million. We attained a total production of 71,000 tonnes with a workforce of 860 people. This year, we reached an agreement with Mondelēz for the acquisition of its biscuit factory located in Mem Martins (Portugal), we began the manufacturing of gluten free products in Worksop (United Kingdom) and formalised a deed of sale for the acquisition of Pastificio Mediterranea, the plant in Silvano d’Orba (Italy), we have operated since 2013. Likewise, €46 million has been allocated for the development of new projects, the integration of our operations in Mem Martins (Portugal), the construction of the factory in Worksop (United Kingdom) and the acquisition of new technologies in Tepeji (Mexico). Consequently, we have adopted a new organisational structure, which has led to strategic changes within the organisation. We are convinced that these will allow us to maintain our flexibility and adapt our ways of working to our clients in each region, while we continue to be coordinated and to take advantages of global synergies. I would like to highlight the strengthening of the Operations and Market Intelligence areas. This has allowed us, on one hand, to advance in the standardisation of our production processes and factory certifications and, on the other hand, to capitalise our knowledge on consumers, markets and categories and to increase our capacity to innovate. Similarly, we are working along with suppliers as an integral component of the value chain, to guarantee the quality and food safety of our products, while we promote their adherence to our Suppliers Code of Conduct. With regard to the environment, we have incorporated the carbon footprint calculation into our new plants in Tepeji, Worksop and Mem Martins with the aim of starting to implement programmes to reduce and improve all our factories and businesses. I would like to finish by thanking all our colleagues for their flexibility in the face of continuous change and for assuming new and bigger responsibilities on a daily basis. It is your tenacity and motivation to exceed expectations what will drive us to achieve the results that we dream of. Thank you.

As at the close of 2016, 3% of our UK colleagues, 2% in Italy, 4% in the United States and 1% in Mexico and Spain belonged to these groups. For this reason, we are working together with the social players of each country with the aim of identifying these groups (people with disabilities, war veterans, women at risk of exclusion, among others), establishing communication channels and finding the best way of integrating them as colleagues. We draw attention to our Open Day ’Barriers to work’ organised in Worksop, United Kingdom, with the aim of encouraging candidates with barriers to accessing employment to apply for jobs at Cerealto. On that day, there was a presentation about the Company and the role of colleagues in our factories. More than 40 candidates and cooperation agencies took part.

ANNUAL REPORT • CEREALTO 2016 • Cultivating the future 44 Focussing on the consumer If we want to continuously exceed the expectations of our customers, we have to be at the forefront of the latest trends and very close to the consumers in order to know about their tastes and preferences at first hand. That is why we use contrast mechanisms with the consumer, including blind tastings. The demand for gluten-free products has also increased in the segment of people with celiac diseases, allergies and intolerances as well as being products perceived by consumers to be healthier. Accordingly, there is a growing tendency for consumers to look for products which, without losing their taste, are healthier. In the same vein, they also demand goods products which contain cereals and ancient seeds, such as quinoa or spelt. ANNUAL REPORT • CEREALTO 2016 • Cultivating the future 45 In accordance with consumer trends, we will continue to further develop alternatives without palm oil, increase the range of glutenfree and healthy products for groups with special needs, and build on innovative concepts that lead to developments which cover a previously unmet need.

To this end, we are working with the suppliers as an integral part of the value chain in order to guarantee food safety, product quality, a level of service and a competitive price to our clients, as well as ensuring that they maintain ethical behaviour. To achieve this, we use a supplier approval system which includes a series Due to the addition of new manufacturing plants, the foundations were of very demanding requirements as regards quality and food safety, as laid for homogenizing and standardising the purchasing processes and well as environmental, social and ethical criteria. procedures in all the plants, so that we will be more efficient and work in the same way.
