Responsible investors are taking action at a gathering speed, including making moves to reduce investment portfolios’carbon footprints and the undertaking the “Aiming for A”initiative that seeks to transform the business models of investee companies through engagement. Priority Areas These investors are not simply putting some money into ESG funds, but taking social and environmental factors into account for all investment decisions. I would like T&D Holdings to also aim for ESG investment on par with that of (3) Global Environmental European institutional investors. There are several reasons I believe the Company should aim that high. Firstly, T&D Holdings is a universal owner with investment diversified among a wide range of stocks. Over the long run, the performance of those investments hinge on overall economic trends. It therefore makes sense to invest in a Protection manner that serves to increase the sustainability of both the overall economy and society at large, including by working to resolve ESG issues through investments. Further, considering ESG factors when investing the funds entrusted to the Company protects the interests of the customers, namely, the policyholders. Social contribution This is because it is the policyholders that are actually affected by the recent phenomena of abnormal weather and economic disparities, both of which have started to pose real risks to life and health. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor released an interpretative bulletin pertaining to the Employee Retirement activities Income Security Act (ERISA), stating that taking ESG factors into account is compatible with fiduciary duty. In Japan, the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) and the Pension Fund Association have become signatories to the United Nation’ s Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Given these changes in the external climate, I think it is time for T&D Holdings as well to shift its initiatives on the investment front into a higher gear.
