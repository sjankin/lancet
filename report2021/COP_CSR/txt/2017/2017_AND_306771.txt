This year we've taken an important qualitative step forward with this report, making it more visual and attractive for all those who are interested in finding out more about our social responsibility policy, a crucial aspect of the corporate culture at Tag Systems. Our commitment to all these people is to meet their expectations. With our employees we promote training and opportunities to grow, at the same time as supporting a good work/life balance with new measures implemented this year. To our suppliers we pass on the commitment to the environment and sustainable quality of our products and production processes, asking them to take on this commitment as well. For our clients we continue to work hard to achieve their complete satisfaction, reaffirming our commitment to offer them the best products and services, be they traditional or digital, with the best possible combination of quality, price and sustainability. Once again, in 2016 we have renewed the commitment we acquired by joining the United Nations Global Compact to implement the principles promoted by this international initiative in our company. The ten principles of Global Compact are always taken into account when planning the company’s strategy and growth. Our aim is for Tag Systems to be a sustainable firm in terms of the environment, finance, society and corporate governance. In the financial area, we want to make a profit while applying a balanced approach, taking efficient advantage of all the resources at our disposal. In terms of the environment, we strive to reduce waste and use energy-saving criteria in our production processes, this year having considerably reduced our consumption of water and gas oil, as well as increasing the amount of waste that is managed and recycled. In the area of society and policy, we take advantage of opportunities to deal with people from different countries and cultures, attempting to discover the best ideas from each one and each place, encouraging harmony with all our stakeholders in society. Once again, we would like to thank you for your help and support.

We use different mechanisms and implement actions to ensure safety and prevent occupational risks. Tag Systems has implemented and certified an occupational health & safety management system as per the standard OHSAS 18001:2007. The Occupational Risk Committee at Tag Systems is made up of 7 people from different departments related to Administration and Production. We also have emergency teams made up of 14 people from different departments, strategically chosen to ensure all shifts and departments are covered. All members of the emergency team receive training in primary and secondary response to be able to put out fires, carry out first aid and implement evacuation procedures. Our occupational health & safety policy also ensures we have safe facilities duly equipped to carry out the activity in question. Below is a description of the improvements made in 2015 related to occupational health & safety:  All personal protective equipment was replaced with more comfortable equipment that is more acceptable for those employees who need to use it, whilst also maintaining the same degree of protection.  Ergonomic rugs were placed in zones where employees need to stand for many hours or have to constantly get on and off machinery steps.  Access to the terraces was improved by placing an officially approved anchoring device to be able to access this zone more safely.  Procedures were drawn up for using and maintaining the different pieces of equipment, making all departments aware of these procedures by giving training. Year after year, the Human Resources Department at Tag Systems devotes a lot of time and effort to raising awareness among the workforce of health & safety issues in order to reduce work-related accidents. In 2015 the incidence rate fell by almost 2 points compared with the previous year. Incidence rate 2013 2014 2015 Incidence rate (number of accidents involving sick leave per 36.03 17.86 15.5 1,000 employees) PROGRESS REPORT 2015 18 3.4 Training Guaranteeing the welfare of employees also involves motivating and encouraging their professional development. Tag Systems allocates part of its budget to giving training in different areas. Our aim is to foster knowledge, learning and the continued development of skills and abilities among our employees. In 2015, this investment in training was similar to previous years. Nevertheless, in 2015 fewer hours of training were given in total.

Data from the Comisión Nacional de Energía de España (2014) and data from the EDF energy group from France (2015). It has been assumed that, in 2013 (the latest data available according to the FEDA 2014 report), 80% of the electricity purchased outside Andorra came 31% from France and 49% from Spain. The remaining 20% was produced in Andorra and is totally associated with hydroelectric since, although a small proportion of the energy is generated via a rural transformer substation, there are no data for the associated CO2 emissions, so this has not been included in the calculation (FEDA, CSR Report, 2014). 4.3 Waste management Tag Systems has a PRP-0029/11 licence to produce waste, as well as an internal procedure to manage waste. We keep a record of the waste generated and this is duly handled by the appropriate operator. Waste generated 2013 2014 2015 Treatment Paper (kg) 1,145 1,093 1,151 Recycled.

We're aware of the importance of the materials used in manufacturing our cards and therefore select the best raw materials applying a strict approval procedure. We apply the following criteria to select our suppliers:  Whether they have any certificates and/or systems for quality, the environment or occupational health & safety  Local suppliers take priority  Environmentally-friendly products  The product's technical adaptability Every year, the Purchasing Department is responsible for monitoring suppliers who have a direct impact on the quality of our final product. This monitoring is carried out by controlling external supplies following the procedure described in the procurement policy. The Quality Department also controls materials as they are delivered, detecting any imperfections or mistakes in the material supplied, helping to avoid problems in the future with production. If any defect is detected, the Quality Department opens a Quality Non-Conformity file for the supplier and this information is used subsequently in the follow-up. Finally, the findings from evaluations are regularly passed on to our suppliers.
