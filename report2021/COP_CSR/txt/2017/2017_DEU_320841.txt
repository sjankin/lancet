This is because the revenue adjustment aims to improve the comparability of the initial post-acquisition period with future postacquisition periods, while the expense adjustment aims to improve the comparability between post-acquisition periods and pre-acquisition periods. This should particularly be considered when evaluating our operating profit (non-IFRS) and operating margin (non-IFRS) numbers as these combine our revenue (non-IFRS) and expenses (non-IFRS) despite the absence of a common conceptual basis.  Our restructuring charges resulted in significant cash outflows in the past and could do so in the future. The same applies to our share-based payment expense because most of our share-based payments are settled in cash rather than shares.  The valuation of our cash-settled share-based payments could vary significantly from period to period due to the fluctuation of our share price and other parameters used in the valuation of these plans.  In the past, we have issued share-based payment awards to our employees every year and we intend to continue doing so in the future. Thus, our share-based payment expenses are recurring although the amounts usually change from period to period.

Key risks are reported quarterly to the chairperson of the Supervisory Board and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board regularly monitors the effectiveness of SAP’s risk management and internal control system. At the direction of our Audit Committee, the Corporate Audit department regularly audits various aspects of the risk management system and its effectiveness. Additional reassurance is obtained through the external audit of the effectiveness of our internal control system over financial reporting and the early warning system.

Only after having made that decision will Consolidated Financial Statements. we be able to reasonably estimate the impact of these new (a) Classification of financial assets requirements on our financial statements. Under our current policies, we classify most of our debt and equity investments as available-for-sale financial assets. We expect that the majority of our debt investments will be measured at amortized cost under IFRS 9, as we hold them to collect contractual cash flows which solely represent payments of principal and interest. Equity investments can be classified as either fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), and we have not yet made a decision in this regard. Consequently, we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the introduction of IFRS 9 on the accounting for our equity investments. Loans, trade, and other financial receivables and contract assets are held to collect contractual cash flows and are expected to give rise to cash flows solely representing payments of principal and interest. Thus, we expect that these will continue to be measured at amortized cost. Derivatives will continue to be measured at FVTPL. However, we will continue to analyze the contractual cash flow characteristics of all instruments approved to be used and the related business model in more detail before reaching a final conclusion on the classification for IFRS 9. (b) Financial liabilities We have never designated any financial liabilities at FVTPL and have no current intention to do so. Thus, we believe that we will not have a material impact with regards to financial liabilities, considering that the only significant change that IFRS 9 brings to the accounting for financial liabilities is that for liabilities designated as at FVTPL, changes in the fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability must be presented in other comprehensive income (OCI).

Values assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets. Budgeted operating margin Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current fiscal year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains. Pre-tax discount rates Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using pre-tax discount rates. Pre-tax discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach. Terminal growth rate Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates.

SAP’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of SAP’s CEO and CFO to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). SAP’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment under these criteria, SAP management has concluded that, as at December 31, 2016, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.

To achieve a example, how well we engage with our employees and inspire truly integrated strategy, we must understand these them to commit to our vision and strategy, support a healthy connections and work to support them throughout SAP. Figure 1 business culture, and succeed in reducing our carbon emissions. below shows how different elements connect. To achieve this quantification, we created cause-and-effect chains that show how specific actions we take at SAP lead to shifts in behavior. This behavior impacts on our business and has a financial consequence. Such analysis establishes more than just a correlation between non-financial indicators and financial impact. It also reveals why and how something such as employee engagement ultimately leads to gains or losses in business performance. We believe that such insights are a prerequisite for fully modeling the financial impact of non-financial performance. Using Cause-and-Effect Analysis To create and validate these chains of cause and effect, we turned to both internal and external stakeholders. We started with those inside SAP, meeting in small groups that rigorously examined the impacts of activities related to each of our nonfinancial indicators. Next, we conferred with external stakeholders, including academics, financial investors, and industry peers, to vet our findings. Finally, we used real data from SAP to translate our cause-and-effect chains into a quantified impact on operating Figure 1: Connectivity between Social, Environmental, and profit. Economic Performance Documenting Financial Impact Since 2014, SAP has used techniques such as linear regression analysis to document the financial impact of four non-financial indicators.

Taking a Proactive Stance Against Corruption SAP is proactively working in collaboration with the wider business community to fight against corruption and the negative impacts it creates. SAP is a member of the German chapter of Transparency International, a non-profit, nonpartisan organization that combats corruption in government and international business and development. In addition, we are active in the Alliance for Integrity (AfIn). AfIn is a business-driven, multistakeholder initiative promoting economic integrity and compliance in business. It was initiated by a number of multinational companies, business associations, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the Society for International Cooperation (GIZ), the German Global Compact Network and sequa, a nonprofit development organization.

Furthermore, 82% of our employees stated, “I actively contribute to sustainability goals at SAP.” This is up from 80% in 2015 and 46% in 2009. Nurturing a Network of Sustainability Champions While sustainability requires strong leadership, it cannot be mandated from the top. To help drive progress with sustainability initiatives, we need the support of employees in every part of SAP. To address this, we have a global internal network of more than 100 sustainability champions who represent different regions and lines of business at SAP. They dedicate 10% of their work time to promoting sustainability. Not only do they act as role models, but they also tailor sustainability to local and LoB needs and interests as well as share best practices.

Maintaining High Standards Across Our Supply Chain We expect all of our business partners to respect human rights and to avoid complicity in human rights abuses. Our codes of conduct for suppliers and partners require them to uphold labor rights and to provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. We work collaboratively with our suppliers and partners on the implementation of these codes. In addition, we may carry out on-site audits to assess performance. Respecting Human Rights Throughout Our Product Lifecycle As a business software company, we are committed to respecting and protecting human rights throughout the lifecycle of our products – from design through development to use. We develop innovative solutions that help customers embed human rights standards into their business and supply chain strategies. We also develop solutions that help to advance human rights in areas such as healthcare, education, and public services. For example, our healthcare solution SAP Medical Research Insights delivers software that addresses the areas of patient care, cancer research and cancer prevention. When designing any solution, our development teams ensure that the product complies with human rights standards. For example, accessibility is a key area of focus and we follow Web content accessibility guidelines such as Section 508 to ensure inclusive design in all our software. The protection of personal information is another key area of focus for our development teams. To help ensure that our products enable our customers to respect digital rights, we adhere to robust privacy and security standards. These are defined in our global product development, quality, product standards, and data protection and privacy policies.

Targeted to reach a 5% spend ratio for diversity suppliers in selected countries by 2020, the GPO will proactively involve diversity suppliers in selected categories in defined countries into our sourcing process. Demonstrating our commitment to supplier diversity, SAP became a corporate member of the following minority supplier organizations in 2016: – Minority Supplier Development U.K. (MSDUK) – WeConnect International Upholding High Standards Across Our Supply Chain Today’s digital networks help us connect with an increasing number of global suppliers, quickly and easily. However, with Additional Information on Economic, Environmental and Social Performance Sustainable Procurement 237 supply networks becoming more complex, companies face even greater challenges in ensuring their suppliers uphold high ethical standards. To help address this, we are developing an innovative SAP Ariba solution for supplier risk management that enables companies to identify and manage their response to a range of supplierrelated risks. Our GPO is collaborating with the SAP Ariba product development teams to finalize and implement this cloud solution. With the SAP Ariba Supplier Risk Insights solution, organizations can establish due diligence, ongoing monitoring, and remediation processes to proactively address risks across the source-to-pay process and the full supplier base. This innovative solution provides buyers with a command center that helps them monitor all relevant risk information. It also offers daily alerts and notifications to buyers based on their preferences. Sustainability risks covered by the solution include unethical practice, workplace discrimination, workplace safety neglect, the use of child labor, human trafficking, and environmental disasters such as oil spills and radioactive contamination. In addition, our GPO worked on a pilot project with the SAP Ariba team and the Made in a Free World organization to identify the areas of greatest risk of forced and child labor in our supply chain. As part of this project, we requested information about our suppliers’ supply chains and analysis of this data is helping us to pinpoint potential risk areas for further investigation. We are also strengthening the enforceability of the code of conduct for suppliers and it is now an integral part of our standard contracts. It is also included in our global terms and conditions. Driving Innovative Sustainability Projects SAP works closely with suppliers to find new ways to make our supply chain more sustainable. We have a number of ongoing projects that minimize our impact on the environment in areas such as enterprise mobility, catering, office supplies, and SAP events. Our chief procurement officer and chief sustainability officer meet each quarter to discuss progress and challenges related to embedding sustainability in our procurement practices.

Among other improvements, this sets printers to produce double-sided, black-and-white printouts as a default. This year we have also made significant advances in paperless contracting. By using the SAP Signature Management application from DocuSign to enable electronic signatures, we have been able to handle 31,472 pages of contract, cutting down on paper contracts significantly. Changing Working Behavior We have also successfully changed working behavior to significantly reduce the amount of pages that our employees print. A secure pull-printing system requires that employees bring their ID badges to a printing device to activate a job. This makes people think about whether the printout is really needed. With more than 76,000 employees currently using this system, our printing volume has reduced by 15.4 million pages in total since 2014. SAP employees can access a printing dashboard that shows the company’s progress in reducing paper consumption at global, regional, and country levels.

The NPS can range from –100% to 100%. We aim to include at least 70% of all eligible direct customers from all regions and industries in the annual survey. From each company, multiple roles (decision makers, influencers, end users) are invited to provide feedback. In 2016, approximately 29% of invited customers (accounts) participated in the survey. In 2015, customers who purchased SAP Hybris and Concur solutions were included for the first time; in 2016, we also added customers of Fieldglass and Ariba to our global process. As we further harmonize processes in acquired entities, the customer segments used for customer surveys has not yet been completely harmonized across the SAP Group. Specifically, due to the nature of the business, the Concur customer sample includes a higher proportion of general business customers in comparison to other Group entities. As a result, Concur responses make up a large proportion of the total customer sample. Our Customer NPS accounting policy helps ensure that SAP achieves a trustworthy consolidated NPS for our on-premise and cloud-based services.

We are one of the global corporations that have signed on to the RE100 initiative. Led by The Climate Group in partnership with Our gross carbon footprint for 2016 was 682 kilotons CO2e (704 CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), the goal of the RE100 kilotons CO2e in 2015). Our gross carbon footprint includes all campaign is to have 100 of the world’s most influential GHG emission categories in Scope 1, 2, as well as selected businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. categories of 3 as outlined in figure 1. Our net carbon footprint is calculated by reducing purchased renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets from our gross carbon footprint in the Upstream Emissions (Scope 3) respective reporting period. Only selected upstream emissions such as business flights, paper consumption, and co-locations of data centers are Direct Emissions (Scope 1) directly measured and hence included in our corporate target. The additional upstream emissions products and services or Consumption of fuel for our company cars remains the single grey energy of our buildings are based on an estimate.

In 2016, we our upstream emissions including these estimates are continued to enhance our car policy by linking emissions caps to responsible for about 15% of SAP’s total carbon footprint. efficiency improvements of the automotive industry. In addition, we focused on greater shifts in commuting habits.

This average is calculated We continued offsetting carbon emissions for business flights in by adding the FTEs at the end of each quarter and then dividing 2016. In addition to avoiding overall business flights, we began the result by four. to offset selected business flights in the second half of 2015. This offset effort resulted in a compensation of 90 kilotons of CO2e in 2016. Greenhouse Gas Footprint We define the GHG footprint or carbon footprint as the sum of all greenhouse gas emissions measured and reported for SAP, including the compensation with renewable energy or offsets. SAP’s preparation of the GHG footprint is based on the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard of the World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development. This approach conforms with the requirements of GRI G4 indicators EN3, EN4, EN15, EN16, and EN17. Reporting Principles SAP reports our net greenhouse gas emissions according to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 and the location-based method. The recently introduced market-based method is an amendment to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 and will be considered starting 2017. For 2016 we continue to apply the location-based emissions instead of a dual reporting (location and market based). In 2016 we updated our emissions and extrapolation factors for the categories stationary combustion facilities, corporate cars, corporate jets, business flights, rental cars, train travel, business trips with private cars, employee commuting as well as paper General Information About consumption, leading to a 10% downward impact on SAP’s 2016 Environmental Non-Financial gross CO2 emissions. Indicators Organizational Boundaries Boundaries SAP defines our organizational boundaries by applying the operational control approach as set out in the GHG Protocol. Our boundaries take two different perspectives: SAP as a company, which includes all our legal entities and operations Operational control is established when SAP has the full and supply chain, and SAP as a solution provider enabling our authority to introduce and implement its operating policies.
