The index score is a key tool in driving changes in behaviour in the business units as well as providing comparable scorecard data and monitoring progress towards oneand five-year targets. The total Group sustainability measurement score for the year FY2017 was 81% (FY2016: Woolworths SA 85%). We had set 80% as a benchmark for good performance and are pleased to complete the current phase of our targets with a score above that benchmark. The past 10 years have not been easy as we have sometimes not met targets on specific indicators – either because they were potentially unrealistic or due to change in business focus, but each of these instances has been a valuable learning opportunity. However, steady progress has been made over the lifetime of the Good Business Journey programme, and the targets have been well integrated into our strategy and balanced scorecards. The scores per factor are shown in the graph below. 120 100 97 93 96 88 88 89 87 82 84 80 61 60 40 20 0 Economic Governance Social Transformation Environment KEY: 2017 2020 WHL 12 / 2017 GOOD BUSINESS JOURNEY REPORT 2017 GOOD BUSINESS JOURNEY REPORT / WHL 13 14 Home SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REPORT C E LE B R ATI N G TE N YEARS O F O U R GO O D B US I N ES S J O U RN EY Our Good Business Journey (GBJ) was launched in April 2007. with WWF-SA has continued to deliver innovative solutions At the time, a strategic platform such as this was the first of its around water, agriculture, fishing, food waste and other kind in South African retail.

Our social development strategy is not only aligned to our core business strategy, but also to the developmental priorities of the countries in which we operate, and the challenges they face. In a developing world context, these challenges are increasingly exacerbated by economic and climatic pressures that often serve to increase the cost of living, stretch or diminish access to basic resources, and increase inequality. These challenges only serve to decrease the resilience of those individuals or communities and reduce the likelihood of breaking out of the poverty cycle. In Australasia, David Jones and Country Road Group focus their community investment activities around the causes that resonate with their colleagues and customers, with some commonality in the areas of health and wellbeing, empowerment, and social services.

As a result, we make it our business to help customers lead better lifestyles by providing a variety of healthier food options to support a multitude of dietary needs. We also know from our customer research that our customers’ family health, security, and happiness are a top priority, so we ensure that customers are able to make informed buying decisions by promoting awareness and providing labelling to ensure transparency in how we communicate the nutritional content of our food. Emotional health, security, and happiness are a top priority for customers and employees and there has been an increase in the number of people managing stress-related and mental health issues in recent years. While customer wellness is a key strategic focus area for us, we also recognise that the health, safety, and wellbeing of our workforce is at the very heart of our operations. We therefore take the time to understand physical and mental health challenges facing our employees, and assist by offering support and care programmes.

This is not only because of potentially compromising labour relations issues, but also as a result of growing awareness of the social and environmental impacts that our products may potentially carry. To WHL, ethical sourcing means building meaningful value-sharing relationships with stakeholders and suppliers to ensure that the products we source are in accordance with our exacting requirements, and that they are created in safe facilities, by workers whose human rights are protected and are paid a fair wage. Supply chain transformation and transparency is thus a key component of our Good Business Journey strategy. Due to the complexity of our supply chains, a partnership-based approach in necessitated, where we can leverage against best in class standards, certifications and expertise over the long-term to achieve our goals.

These initiatives include, improved tracking around important issues such as temporary and contract workers, worker health and safety, and collective bargaining through better auditing and systems (e.g. SEDEX) as well as David Jones’ internal engagement training around Ethical Sourcing Awareness. In addition, the past 12 months has also seen an increase in the traceability of raw materials, particularly in David Jones’ Classic Collection, which uses cotton from the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI). Importantly for both Country Road Group and David Jones, the use of BCI cotton has also enhanced the ability to trace cotton all the way back to the farm. case study: TRENERY ARTISAN PROJECT As part of its summer collection, Trenery partnered with a studio in the West Bengal region of India to produce a unique range of hand-block printed designs using traditional khadi cotton. The six-piece, limited edition capsule included sleeveless shirt dresses and relaxed tops for women and a short-sleeved shirt for men using authentic, handmade textiles, while supporting the work of artisans at the Tharangini studio. The technique of making these patterns is so intricate – it can take up to 10 days to engrave the wood blocks. Each piece has its own unique character because the printing process is done by hand. The pieces honour the traditional methods of spinning and weaving cotton. Tharangini studio in Bangalore was founded in the 1970s by artist Lakshmi Srivathsa and is now run by daughter, Padmini who heads a team of artisans, including master block printers, wood block carvers and organic colour experts. The studio’s philosophy is to employ and upskill as many craftspeople as possible, with senior artisans mentoring outreach groups to inspire a new generation of artisans.

Given that a high proportion of the environmental impact resulting from our operations is linked to the farming and processing of products that we sell, we make it a priority to work together with our suppliers on a long-term basis to minimise these impacts and positively influence the environmental and social outcomes of doing business. WHL and our suppliers are dedicated to selling products that cause minimum harm to the natural environment. Working with private label suppliers to improve farming and husbandry practices among our suppliers as well as the broader network of upstream farmers, we can help to improve soil health, protect water supply, restore biodiversity, support rural livelihoods, help communities adapt to climate change, and ultimately help ensure we produce sufficient food and raw materials to meet the needs of our customers. Our potential impact is strengthened through partnerships, so we work with a range of organisations such as WWF-SA, Food Animal Initiative, Better Cotton Initiative and Leather Working Group, to drive further progress against responsible sourcing goals and to develop strategies to reduce the impact of our operations.

We rely on a steady and clean supply of water across our entire value chain to grow, process, and manufacture our clothing and food products, as well as to ensure the wellbeing and safety of our employees. The on-going drought in South Africa has illustrated the critical interdependencies of the economy, society, and the environment on the availability and quality of water resources. It has also provided an opportunity to focus further on the activities across our own operations and supply chain that will lead to increased resilience in the face of future climate shocks. We also recognise that farming is a major water user in South Africa, and therefore Woolworths has a responsibility to promote water conservation and ecosystem protection beyond our own operations. We continue to look deeper into how we can contribute to the resilience of others, including our suppliers and communities, through collective action initiatives and promoting sustainable production methods. In achieving this we will require continued close collaboration with suppliers and key strategic partners such as WWF-South Africa, the National Business Initiative and the United Nations CEO Water Mandate, to which Woolworths is a signatory. This section presents our communication of progress against the mandate’s core focus areas.

Water usage increased markedly at our distribution centres last year year due to new traywash techniques required for hygiene purposes. We are in the process of developing recycling solutions to mitigate this increase. Given the serious drought, and the Western Cape of South Africa officially being declared a disaster zone in early 2017, significant resources have been applied in the course of the year to address business continuity risks in the face of severe water restrictions. We have invested considerable efforts in engaging with our workforce in water savings and have also revised cleaning processes to minimise unnecessary potable water consumption, and developed emergency contingency plans. In line with WHL’s strategy, David Jones continues to focus on the roll-out of smart water meters into stores and distribution centres, given the importance of water efficiency and drought resilience to the Australian community. These smart meters provide water usage data in real-time, helping with the detection of leaks to reduce water usage and potential loss or damage.

As climate change tightens its grip on the natural environment, deploying new strategies for this ‘new normal’ becomes a business imperative. Through our efforts, we continue to reduce our energy consumption, carbon emissions, and waste to landfill across our value chain. We are also working closely with our clothing and foods suppliers on innovative ways to ensure that going forward, our products are produced from factories that are efficiently using natural resources. In Australia, the release of the Independent Review into the Future Security of the National Electricity Market and announcements by Federal and state governments have started to provide some greater certainty in respect of the transition to renewable energy and other low-carbon forms of electricity generation over time, but these policy settings will take some time to be formalised and then materialise into investment decisions.

There has been growing pressure for companies to innovate towards circular economy models to address resource wastage and maximise efficiency. In addition, an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food produced worldwide (around a third of all food) and the resources used to produce it are going to waste each year. Given the context of hunger and poverty, particularly in Southern Africa, there is an imperative to reduce food waste across value chains. With this in mind, it has become increasingly important for us to ensure the responsible production and consumption of our products and packaging. Customers continue to give us lots of feedback in terms of their expectations around packaging and the use of plastic. This not only puts pressure on us as a retailer on a sustainability journey, but also creates an opportunity for developing more innovative, closed-loop solutions.
