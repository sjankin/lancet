But we are also convinced that sustainability is the key to transforming these challenges into opportunities. We see these as both a responsibility and an opportunity to shape our business in harmony with society’s requirements and those of our customers, employees, investors and partners. In this Corporate Responsibility Progress Report 2016/17 we report about our key performance indicators and target progress, as well as our progress report on the United Nations Global Compact Principles. In the publication Corporate Responsibility 2016/17 Compact we additionally use examples to illustrate how sustainability is embedded in our day-to-day business activities. METRO C ORPOR ORPORA S REPORT 20 PROGRESS ATE RESPONSIBILITY PROGRES 2016 16 / 17 2 Key performance indicators KEY PERFORMANCE INDIC INDICA ATORS The chapter “key performance indicators” provides information about METRO’s sustainability performance in the form of key performance indicators (KPIs). It is divided into figures showing the company’s economic performance, staff-related KPIs, key indicators regarding the “sustainable operations” area of responsibility, which covers the responsible use of resources, key indicators for the “sustainable procurement” area of responsibility, KPIs on sustainable consumption and social engagement. REPORTING PERIOD The reporting year is the same as the METRO financial year, that is from 1 October to 30 September. Key performance indicators are reported for the previous 3 financial years. Reporting of the climate protection target also includes the target’s reference year, 2011. The figure for the reference year relates to the period from 1 January to 31 December 2011. A different reporting period is used in this case because METRO changed its financial year from the calendar year to the 12 months from October to September in 2013. APPROA APPRO ACH T TO DA OD ATA C COLLE OLLECTION CTION AND REPORTING The key performance indicators reported are based on data that is gathered using various internal reporting systems. As a rule, this data is systematically recorded for each sales line and each country every quarter, in some cases every month. The KPIs are based on data collected for METRO as a whole, that is for all of the stores, back offices and warehouses and for the head office in Düsseldorf. It is necessary to extrapolate and estimate consumption data for some KPIs in cases where the primary data available is incomplete. This applies to the KPIs on sustainable operations. The greenhouse gas emissions relating to purchased goods and services, assets and leased assets which are reported in accordance with Scope 3 are modelled because recording primary data for these is highly complex. The modelling is based on the KPIs regarding METRO’s economic value added and an economic input-output model that draws on the economic flows of goods and services. The selling space figures used as a basis for the KPIs are averages for the year. As a general rule, the KPIs include the data for all locations and their respective employees. The KPIs we report for work-related accidents and continuing professional development do not currently cover all employees. We do not have the relevant data for all sales lines and organisational units in proper quality. We report work-related accidents for the German METRO companies. The KPIs for continuing professional development include all companies except for a few service companies. We show sales in the area of sustainable consumption exclusively for our German sales lines Real and METRO Cash & Carry Germany. All of the sustainability KPIs have been audited by KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. DEVIA DEVIATIONS TIONS FROM PREVIOUS REPORT REPORTS S With the Progress Report 2016/17, METRO presents a report on its achievements in the area of sustainability for the first time. There are therefore no deviations from previous reports.

Included are the emissions from electricity, heating and cooling energy consumption, also counting upstream chains and grid losses, refrigerant emissions from commercial cooling and air-conditioning, fuel consumption by company cars, in-house paper consumption for advertising material and office purposes as well as business trips. Explana Explanation: tion: We aim to reduce our specific greenhouse gas emissions by 50% between 2011 and 2030. In concrete terms, this means that we want to cut our emissions per m2 of selling space from 369 to 184 kg of CO2 equivalents per annum. Between October 2016 and September 2017, METRO generated 296 kg of CO2 equivalents per m2 of selling space. The significant decline in emissions compared with the reference year 2011 can essentially be attributed to: Measures to reduce consumption relating to energy, company cars, paper and business travel, and to reduce emissions caused by refrigerant loss General technical and scientific developments as reflected by the adjustment of the emission factors used to calculate CO2 equivalents.

Explana tion: In absolute terms, METRO drew 6.0 million m3 of fresh water in the reporting period. Water is primarily used for cleaning Explanation: and sanitary facilities. In addition to this, water may be used for storing, transporting and selling food, for example for keeping live fish or making ice to chill fresh fish. At the group level, we measure and monitor the amount of water which the company draws from the public drinking water supply. The public drinking water supply is the only source from which we draw significant amounts of water. As our locations do not consume a significant amount of water, we assume that the volume of wastewater is the same as the amount of fresh water. All wastewater is fed into public sewers. We do not monitor the quality of the wastewater ourselves as this is not relevant given the usage described above.

The amount of waste is made up of waste for disposal, for recycling or heat recovery, and hazardous and organic waste. The recycling rate is the amount of waste for recycling and heat recovery plus organic waste as compared to the overall quantity of waste. Explana Explanation: tion: The volume of waste in absolute terms amounts to 392,792 t. This can be broken down as follows: Waste for disposal (70,080 t) Waste for recycling or heat recovery (250,071 t) Organic waste (63,259 t) Hazardous waste (9,383 t) When we calculate the recycling rate, we do not take hazardous waste into account because we cannot systematically record the way in which it is treated (recycled or disposed of) in all of the countries in which we operate. However, based on information from several countries, most of the hazardous waste is also recycled. In reality, the recycling rate is therefore higher.

The result “improvements needed” was understood as a passed audit. Under the new measurement system, a portion of the previous “improvements needed” results was assigned to the categories “C” (passed audit) and “D” (failed audit). This adjustment resulted in a lower share of producers with a passed audit in the financial year 2015/16. Definition: Status of all the producers in defined risk countries in which METRO Sourcing has import goods manufactured based on the assessment of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI), and of producers that manufacture own brands or own imports in the areas of clothing, shoes, toys and consumer durables for the METRO sales lines. Producers that have passed the audit can demonstrate their successful compliance with the BSCI standard or an equivalent social standard system by presenting a certificate awarded by an independent third party. Explana Explanation: tion: Producers that do not pass the audit must demonstrate improvement through a follow-up audit within 12 months. Since 1 January 2017, METRO Cash & Carry and Real are imposing more stringent requirements on suppliers: new suppliers are accepted only if they can show at least one passing audit result. For current suppliers, a transition period of 2 years applies. The key performance indicator relates to all the factories of which we are made aware by our suppliers.

Driving sustainability campaigns. Measure METRO prepares and distributes internal and external ongoing communications relating to the wider topic of METRO and sustainability throughout the year. A good example is the UN World Water Day celebrated by our company on 22 March 2017 at its head office in Düsseldorf and 20 METRO countries around the globe. In the future, METRO will shine the spotlight on this and other important international sustainability days, throughout our administrative offices and sales outlets. Our company also conducts sustainability workshops within our business units and the national subsidiaries in particular. METRO also frequently hosts sustainability events, such as a Sustainability Week in our head office and Sustainability Days in 16 METRO Cash & Carry national subsidiaries. Sustainability also plays an important part in our annual employee survey METRO Voice. The survey is conducted among employees at 25 METRO Cash & Carry national subsidiaries, 10 service companies and METRO AG.

By subscribing to the United Nations Global Compact, we have committed ourselves to continuous improvements in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anticorruption measures.

It was not part of our engagement to review product and service related information, references to external websites and information sources, as well as future-related statements in the Report. As shown in the section social audits for own imports, certifications on manufacturing facilities of suppliers in 2016/17 were conducted by external certification firms mandated by METRO to ensure compliance with the environmental, social and health standards of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). The reasonableness and accuracy of the conclusions from the performed audit / certification work was not part of our limited assurance procedures. Management Management’’s R Responsibility esponsibility The legal representatives of METRO are responsible for the preparation of the Report and the determination and presentation of the information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. METRO applies the principles and standard disclosures of the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Scope 1 and 2) and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard of World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development, supported by internal guidelines (further: Reporting Criteria). This responsibility of the legal representatives includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the reported information and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures which are reasonable under the given circumstances. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the information in a way that is free of intended or unintended – material misstatements. Independenc Independence e and quality as assur suranc ance e on the part of the auditing firm We are independent from the Company in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set out in legal provisions and professional pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance with these requirements. Our audit firm applies the legal provisions and professional pronouncements for quality assurance, in particular the professional code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW QS 1), both in accordance with the International Standards on Quality Control, published by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Pr Practitioner actitioner’’s R Responsibility esponsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed within a limited assurance engagement on the abovementioned information. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410: “Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements” of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). These standards require that we plan and perform the assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance whether any matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that above mentioned sustainability information published online at www.metroag.de/cr-progress-2016-17, for the period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017, has not been prepared, in all material respects with the aforementioned Reporting Criteria. We do not, however, issue a separate conclusion for each sustainability disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement, the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures: Interviewing employees at Group level in order to gain an understanding of the process for determining material sustainability topics and the respective boundaries of METRO. A risk analysis, including a media search, to identify relevant sustainability aspects for METRO in the reporting period. Evaluation of the design and implementation of systems and processes for the collection, processing and controls of the selected sustainability performance indicators, including the consolidation of the data and the documentation of these activities.

Evaluation of the overall presentation of the quantitative and qualitative information on the sustainability performance in scope of our assurance engagement. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and the evidence received to obtain limited assurance, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information in the Corporate Responsibility Progress Report 2016/17 of METRO, published online at www.metroag.de/cr-progress-2016-17 for the business year 2016/2017, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
