Control activities Control environment The primary purpose of control activities is to prevent and identify at an early stage significant financial reporting errors so that they can be addressed and rectified. Control activities, both manual and automated, take place both at general and more detailed levels within the Group. Routines and activities have been designed to manage and rectify significant risks associated with financial reporting as identified in the risk analysis. Corrective measures, implementation, Information and Follow-up documentation and quality assurance take place at a Group, subsidiary or process level, communication depending on the nature and affiliation of the control activity. As with other processes, the relevant head is responsible for the completeness and accuracy of control activities. Recent years have seen an in-depth analysis carried out on the processes and control structures in Group companies. This has resulted in a more systematic approach to identifying financial risks and financial reporting risks, as well as documentation of controls as to how such risks are to be prevented and identified. The controls are adapted to each unit’s work Control activities Risk assessment processes and systems structure, and these are evaluated through self-assessment supplemented with monitoring and review by internal audit. This way of working has been implemented in a system covering the entire Group which is used when verifying the reliability of financial reporting. During 2015, work started on merging this way of working and system in the acquired company Rautaruukki and this work continued in 2016. The Group has a joint consolidation system where all legal entities report. This provides sound internal control of financial reporting. Control activities are carried out at all levels across the Group. For example, there are established Controller functions which analyze and follow up deviations and forward reports in the Company.

SSAB 2016 BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT GRI REPORT FINANCIAL REPORTS 2016 SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH SUSTAINABILITY DATA GRI CONTENT INDEX 3 As a result of the materiality assessment, SSAB identified the following aspects as being material. Material efficiency Material efficiency means making more out of less material, resulting in increased efficiency in the use of natural resources. The production of iron and steel creates a range of residuals. Recirculating ferrous SUSTAINABLE OFFERING material back into the steelmaking process reduces the need for virgin raw materials. This, in turn, Potential of SSAB´s products and solutions, including high-strength steels reduces CO2 emissions and saves costs. Material that cannot be recirculated internally can be processed and sold externally to create new revenue streams while reducing CO2 emissions by substituting natural There are significant environmental benefits to be gained when upgrading to high-strength steels. Since highresources in other industries. For example, blast furnace slag enables the cement industry to significantly strength steels are stronger than ordinary steels, less steel is needed to produce a specific steel application. reduce their CO2 emissions. Increasing internal recirculation of residuals and external sales of byThis reduces the emissions from steel production. “Moving applications,” such as vehicles, excavators and products will lead to reduced waste and less material will be sent to landfill. cranes made of high-strength steels, have less weight, which in turn cuts fuel consumption or increases their payload. Stronger steel also means extended product lifetime, thereby also reducing emissions. Recycling Customer satisfaction A critical element in reducing carbon emissions originating in the steel lifecycle is to optimize steel recycling. Steel is almost unique in its capacity to be infinitely recycled without loss of properties or performance. Customer satisfaction is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or exceed Steel is today the most recycled material in the world. customer expectations. In a competitive marketplace, customer satisfaction is a key differentiator and key element of business strategy. Today, various aspects of sustainability – product lifecycle approach, Competence and leadership development materialand energy-efficient processes, and a responsible value chain – are increasingly important It is critical for a company to attract, develop and retain people with the right competencies and mindset. parameters impacting overall customer satisfaction. To do this, it is important to work actively with performance dialogs between managers and employees, SUSTAINABLE OPERATIONS management reviews and succession planning, leadership training programs, employee development programs, and diversity training and inclusion. Health and safety Diversity Steel production includes exposed and dangerous environments. This is why it is extremely important to have a strong focus on health and safety to minimize the risks of accidents. This responsibility One of the most important challenges today is to engage, retain and attract employees with the right encompasses company employees and contractors, as well as visitors to SSAB sites. skill sets. The creation of a more diverse workforce with different competences, experiences and backgrounds, and a workplace where everyone has equal opportunities, will lead to a stronger company Emissions from steel production culture and help to achieve better results. Coke and coal are used in blast furnaces to reduce iron ore in the production of crude iron/hot metal. Today, it is RESPONSIBLE PARTNER impossible to produce steel without generating CO2 emissions. The process, which has been used for centuries, has been continually developed and improved to become highly efficient, and the residual energy is recovered Anti-corruption/Business ethics in the form of district heating and electricity production. Scrap-based steel production emits significantly less In today’s globalized world, anti-corruption and business ethics have become increasingly important CO2. Since there is not enough scrap available for recycling to meet the demand for new steel, ore-based steel for companies. Failure to address corruption, bribery and other issues related to business ethics will production using blast furnaces is still needed. Today, the scrap-based steel production meets 30% of the global have negative impacts on the company’s reputation and brand. Anti-corruption and ethics at SSAB are demand for new steel. governed by SSAB’s Code of Conduct and the SSAB Anti-Corruption policy. Energy efficiency Labor/human rights in the supply chain Energy efficiency is aimed at reducing the amount of energy required to produce products and provide Today, companies are increasingly expected to take responsibility, not only for labor and human rights services. Steel companies can reduce costs by finding alternative energy sources that create less in their own operations, but also within their supply chain. This includes evaluating supplier risks and emissions, by using less purchased energy and by feeding surplus energy into the grid. From a lifecycle suppliers´ ability to address labor and human rights, including no use of child or forced labor, a healthy perspective, this also creates positive effects and saves natural resources, thereby reducing CO2 and safe work environment, etc. Conducting risk assessments and supply chain monitoring through selfemissions. assessment questionnaires, audits and other follow-up systems are important tools, in addition to the SSAB Supplier Sustainability policy. Financial and operational performance SSAB believes that managing its business in a sustainable way will increase SSAB’s possibilities to deliver strong long-term financial and operational results. That is why financial and operational performance is not included in one of the three focus areas, but rather should be seen as the outcome of performing well in all three areas.

These include general political and economic conditions affecting the steel markets. Many of these factors can impact SSAB positively or negatively. Positive development or proper management of a risk can lead to opportunities and value creation. OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT SSAB has prioritized identifying and analyzing risks, as well as deciding how they are to be addressed. Responsibility for the long-term, overall management of strategic risks is dictated by the company’s delegation policy, namely from the Board to the CEO and from the CEO to the leaders of each division and subsidiary. Consequently, most of the Group’s operational risks are managed by each respective division, but coordinated across divisions when necessary. The leaders of each division and subsidiary performs a yearly review of risks in connection with the strategy process. The findings are presented and discussed at a SSAB Board meeting. The Group Legal function is responsible for global risk management, assessing insurable risks. The Group risk manager is functionally responsible for the Group's risk management work and works with each divisional risk manager to optimize the work from a group-wide perspective. The Group’s treasury function is responsible for managing financial risks. For many years, SSAB has had an internal audit unit which, among other tasks, identifies risk areas and, based on a risk analysis, conducts internal controls followed by recommendations for improvements within these areas. The internal audit unit reports directly to the Audit Committee. For full information about the Group's internal audit function, see the Corporate governance report.

A cycle, such as in products and raw materials. The sensitivity to business continuous focus on developing niche products will enable SSAB to maintain and strengthen its position in cycle fluctuations is also influenced by the high percentage of fixed costs relation to its competitors. due to the large capital expenditures that characterize the steel industry. Another way SSAB reduces sensitivity to the business cycle is by focusing on the company’s home markets, namely North America and the Nordic region. In these markets, SSAB strives to be the customers’ supplier of choice by offering short delivery times, superior quality and close, long-term relationships. SSAB also offers value-added services based on its industry-leading know-how in the field of high-strength steels, offering customers the ability to create innovative solutions. SSAB works closely with customers or at one of its many research facilities to develop these innovative solutions. SSAB also works to cut costs and increase flexibility in its operations in order to lessen the effects of downturns in the business cycle. With the acquisition of Rautaruukki, SSAB is exploring even more possibilities to cut costs across the company. POLITICAL DECISIONS SSAB operates in many countries and is therefore affected by both SSAB participates in national and international industry organizations in which the monitoring of relevant events country-specific and international regulations related to general tax and plays an important role.

One focus area for SSAB is environmental and energy legislation, with the EU’s emissions trading system being of critical importance for SSAB’s operations. In this area, SSAB acts via industry organizations and directly in explaining the importance of emissions allowances regulations and their impact on SSAB. Since steel production takes place in both Europe and the USA, exposure to various trade barriers has been reduced.

However, since the price of iron ore is set on the world market, it is in principle the same regardless of supplier.

Currency ﬂow 2016 SEK m Currency risks: SSAB’s currency exposure largely relates to the translation risk regarding net assets of foreign subsidiaries. This exposure is hedged through borrowing in foreign currency, so-called equity hedge. Exceptions are made in the case of small amounts, e.g. for equity in foreign sales companies. The objective with the equity USD hedge is to minimize the translation impact on the net debt/equity ratio. The Swedish krona (SEK) is the base EUR currency. In order to manage the transaction risk, most of the commercial currency flows which qualify for hedge accounting (at present purchases of coal and iron ore in USD and sales in EUR) are hedged. Major investments CAD decided upon in foreign currency are hedged in their entirety. Other commercial currency flows that arise in connection with purchases and sales in foreign currency are short term in nature and thus no hedging takes GBP place; instead, they are exchanged on the spot market.

Assessment of fair value of financial instruments Management of capital The classification takes place hierarchically on three levels based on the input data used in valuing instruments. The Company’s capital management is aimed at ensuring that the operations can continue to be conducted and On level 1, listed prices on an active market are used, e.g. stock exchange prices. On level 2, observable market generate good return for the shareholders. Since the Group's operations are dependent on the business cycle, data regarding assets and liabilities, other than listed prices, is used, e.g. interest rates and return curves. On the target is to maintain a long-term net debt/equity ratio of around 30%. level 3, the fair value is determined based on an assessment technique which is based on assumptions that are not based on prices or data that are directly observable. The fair value assessment of the financial instruments In order to maintain or adapt the capital structure, dividends may be adjusted, share buybacks or redemption in SSAB is based on data in accordance with level 2 except electricity derivatives, which fair values are based on may take place, or new issues or divestments of assets may take place in order to reduce liabilities. listed market values and thus classified on level 1. The net debt/equity ratio decreased during the year, primarily due to the rights issue 2016. At year-end, the net Financial assets consist largely of other non-current receivables and are valued at the amount which is expected debt/equity ratio was 34 (52)%. to be received following an assessment of bad debts. Derivative instruments are valued at fair value, calculated with established valuation models based on observable market data. At year-end, the derivatives were valued at SEK 423 (285) million as financial assets and SEK -634 (-753) million as financial liabilities. If full netting had been applied the derivatives had been booked at SEK 156 (60) million as financial assets and SEK -528 (-528) million as financial liabilities. Accounts receivable are reported in the amount which is expected to be received following an individual assessment of bad debts. There is no concentration of credit risks, since the Group has a large number of customers spread throughout the world. Other current interest-bearing receivables consist of restricted cash with a term to maturity of less than 12 months. Fair value is estimated at the acquisition value. Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and bank deposits with short terms to maturity, and the fair value is estimated at acquisition value. Non-current interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of loans that are not subject to hedge accounting and are valued at amortized cost. Loans subject to hedge accounting are valued and reported at fair value. Fair value has been calculated based on the interest rate for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year. Current interest-bearing liabilities are valued at amortized cost. Fair value has been calculated based on the rate of interest for outstanding terms to maturity as applicable at the end of the year. Accounts payable are reported in the amount which is expected to be paid and are valued at acquisition value.

Under these circumstances, it is of course extraordinarily Tibnor: A need to start writing down goodwill should arise only if the estimated discount rate before tax, difficult to make an assessment as regards future earning capacity and thereby an assessment of the fair value which was applied to the discounted cash flows, was more than 3.1 (5.2) percentage points higher than of assets with indefinite useful lives.

In the event the company fails to satisfy the criteria as regards workforce size and minimum wages, no grant will be received at all. PENSION BENEFITS A large part of the Group’s pension obligations with respect to white collar staff are benefit-based and insured on a collective basis with Alecta. Since it is not possible at present to obtain information from Alecta regarding the Group’s share of the obligations and managed assets, the pension plan taken out with Alecta is reported as a contribution-based plan. The funding level reported by Alecta at the end of the year does not indicate the existence of a deficit; however, it is not possible to obtain any detailed information from Alecta regarding the amount of the pension liabilities. The Group’s benefit-based plans at the end of the year amounted to SEK 1,679 (1,647) million. The obligation is sensitive to, among other things, interest rate changes and pension increase growth assumptions. Sensitivity in the most critical parameters is described in Note 13. INVENTORY Inventories are affected by assumptions and estimates regarding product costing, application of the Lower of Cost or Market method and estimates of obsolescence. SSAB’s inventories at year end amounted to SEK 15,001 (12,691) million, where of SEK 190 (457) million were valued at net realizable value. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Provision for bad debts is based on assessments of the customers’ payment ability and, by their nature, are difficult to estimate. The item has been the subject of special assessment and, compared with the preceding year, the provision for bad debts was increased by SEK 22 million to SEK 308 (286) million, thereby representing 4.1 (4.7) % of outstanding accounts receivable.
