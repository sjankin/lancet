Reducing Congestion and Enhancing Environmental Performance The company is working actively to improve urban environments and with ITS air quality. An automobile’s fuel efficiency depends not just on the car’s own capabilities but also on the driving environment and the way it is driven. Nissan is using Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and actively working to create infrastructure that will help to improve the traffic environment. Under commission from Japan’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Nissan worked with the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport beginning in 2010. In the Chinese capital, the company conducted tests of a dynamic route guidance system (DRGS) using IT terminals and eco-driving support to alleviate traffic congestion in the city. In one experiment, around 12,000 resident drivers in Beijing’s Wangjing district used Portable Navigation Devices with DRGS and ecodriving support. Results from the experiment, which lasted around one year, showed that DRGS cut travel time by 5.1% and increased fuel economy by 7.6%. Enabling drivers to avoid congested roads led to the dispersion of traffic flow, enhancing overall speed within the area. Furthermore, by helping users cultivate better driving habits, eco-driving support increased fuel CORPORATE CARBON FOOTPRINT MINIMIZATION economy by 6.8%. A simulation conducted at the same time estimated that if 10% of all In a world that is often said to be carbon-constrained, reducing CO2 traffic in Beijing used DRGS, travel speed throughout the city would emissions is a task to be tackled by all companies.

G4-EN1/G4-EN2/ Other: 87% G4-EN27/G4-EN28 Recycling Nissan has defined a long-term goal of maintaining global usage of these natural resources at 2010 levels through 2050. Toward this end, Nissan is presently researching ways to increase the recovery rate further in order to reclaim and reuse valuable materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). As of fiscal 2016, company Automotive Shredder Residue to Landfill Ratio Based on the Automobile Recycling Law in (%) calculations showed that Nissan had achieved a recovery rate of 99.7% in Japan. Japan, Nissan calculated the ratio of landfill to 15 From the early development stage, Nissan considers the use of highly recyclable materials and residue after removing ferrous and nonferrous makes structural improvements for ease of recycling. Since the Note, launched in 2005, all new models metals from ELVs. Nissan achieved a zero landfill have achieved a 95% or greater recyclability rate based on the national regulations on ELVs in regions ratio in fiscal 2016 by enhancing recycling 10 such as Europe, Japan and Korea. capability through the acquisition of additional facilities that comply with the law. 5 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 (FY) GRI G4 Indicators G4-EN2/G4-EN27 NISSAN MOTOR CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2017 139 CONTENTS INTRODUCTION CEO MESSAGE NISSAN’S CSR STRATEGIES NISSAN’S CSR MANAGEMENT RENAULT-NISSAN ALLIANCE CSR DATA THIRD-PARTY ASSURANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE & ENVIRONMENT SAFETY PHILANTHROPY QUALITY VALUE CHAIN EMPLOYEES ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION INTERNAL CONTROL PRODUCT INDICATORS—ELV PROGRAMS RESULTS OF NISSAN GREEN PROGRAM 2016 ELV Programs Targets set for four key initiatives under NGP2016 were fully achieved. Nissan has joined forces with other automotive companies to promote the recycling of ELVs through dismantling and shredding. In fiscal 2016, the Key Focus Area NGP2016 Target NGP2016 Results program in Japan achieved a final recovery ratio for ELVs of 99.7% (actual Zero-emission vehicle Achieve number-one global Achieved number-one penetration market share cumulative sales and market value), at the same time reducing the amount of automotive shredder residue share (ASR) related landfill and incineration disposal to zero based on the Fuel-efficient vehicle Improve CAFE by 35% from Improved by 36.5% (achieved calculation method provided by the Japanese government. expansion FY2005 in FY2014) This program consists of three phases: First, any Nissan ELVs entering Corporate carbon footprint Reduce CO2 emissions of global Reduced by 22.3% (achieved minimization corporate activities by 20% in FY2014) the dismantling process are recycled, including flat steel, cast aluminum, (t-CO2/vehicle, vs. FY2005) bumpers, interior plastic parts, wire harnesses and precious rare earth metals. Natural resource use Increase recycled material usage Achieved rate of over 25% Second, specific items such as lithium-ion batteries are collected individually minimization ratio per new vehicle by 25% and directed to a dedicated recycling process. Third, residues from the dismantling process are shredded and collected at a dedicated facility. Since 2004, Nissan and seven other Japanese auto manufacturers have Activities for Zero-emission Vehicle Penetration promoted this facility to recycle ASR. Aligned with the Automobile Recycling In addition to promotional efforts to expand penetration of the 100% electric Law in Japan, this serves as an integral part of a system to recycle ASR Nissan LEAF, Nissan has developed technologies, such as LEAF to Home effectively, smoothly and efficiently.

This network of Authorized Treatment Facilities was developed for individual Activities for Expanding Fuel-efficient Vehicles countries in collaboration with contracted dismantlers, contracted service In addition to technological advances including variable compression ratio providers and governments to be aligned with the European ELV directive. engine and CVT improvement and vehicle weight reduction, Nissan has introduced a broader lineup of hybrid vehicles, as well as promoting the penetration of the e-POWER powertrain that is equipped in the new Note. Activities for Minimizing Corporate Carbon Footprint Nissan has introduced higher-efficiency equipment and manufacturing processes, energy-saving measures, and the use of renewable energy such as that generated from biomass gas and wind power. Activities for Minimizing Natural Resource Use In collaboration with business partners, Nissan has collected steel and aluminum scrap generated during manufacturing and end-of-life aluminum wheel rims for reuse in new vehicles. In addition, Nissan developed a new electric motor that requires just 40% as much dysprosium as a conventional motor, and is currently implementing it in the Nissan LEAF.

The energy use data of each site is based on invoices from suppliers, which are multiplied by a CO2 emissions coefficient publicly available for each production site. ■ CO2 emissions resulting from employees’ commutes: Calculated based on the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard. Specifically, the annual CO2 emissions resulting from each employee’s commute are calculated using a standard unit of measurement announced by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of the Environment, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. This figure is calculated on the basis that employees working at Global Headquarters commute by bus and other employees use cars that are vehicles designated by Nissan, based on the data they submit when applying for transportation allowances. This is multiplied by the number of employees at each facility or office. ■ CO2 emissions from the use of sold products: Calculated using the average regional CO2 emissions per vehicle multiplied by estimated average lifecycle mileage and multiplied by fiscal 2016 sales volumes. The average CO2 emissions for the use phase (including direct emissions only) per unit are calculated for each of our main regions (Japan, U.S., EU and China) and extrapolated from average emissions of these markets for other markets. The Sustainable Mobility Project (SMP) model issued by the International Energy Agency was used to determine estimated average lifecycle mileages. ■ Scope 3 emissions figures are estimates subject to varying inherent uncertainties. ■ Waste generated from production sites of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in Japan: Calculated based on Nissan internal standards. The discharged waste is based on data from truck scales at the sites or data reported by disposal contractors. All discharged waste within the sites concerned is targeted. However, nonsteady and irregular generated waste, waste generated in canteens, waste from permanently stationed companies at the sites, waste generated by external vendors and waste from construction are excluded. In addition, materials recycled in-house, used in reproduction (reused by Nissan) or recycled (as salable, valuable materials) are not categorized as generated waste. ■ Water input from production sites of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in Japan: Calculated based on Nissan internal standards. Water input is the water withdrawal amount according to billing meters or company meters installed on site. The water withdrawal amount includes drinking water (tap water), industrial-use water, underground water (spring/well water) and rainwater or the like.
