EXPECTED OUTCOME: Our seminar was just a drop in the ocean because individuals and businesses in Nigeria still employ child labourers as house helps and cheap labourers. All tiers of government, labour unions and the UNGC should create many more awareness on the fact that businesses should ensure the effective abolition of child labour. PRINCIPLE 6: Businesses should eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. TOP MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT: The employment policy of El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited forbids gender, race, tribal, religion or HIV status discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 9 PRACTICAL ACTIONS TAKEN: El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited has under its employment qualified and dedicated male and female employees from the various tribes and religions of Nigeria.

ENVIRONMENT: PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. TOP MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT: El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited's corporate policy includes support for a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. As in the past year, the board of El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited noted with dismay the very abject environmental challenges that the immediate society and planet earth faces with the following: (i) Discharge of dangerous fumes from factories, petroleum natural gas flaring, disused and poorly maintained automobiles, generators and spare parts all over Africa; (ii) Sawdust smoldering in the several thousands of sawmills spread all over Nigeria and Africa; (iii) Poor waste management, especially the improper dumping and burning of dangerous toxic radioactive, electronic, chemical, drug, industrial and domestic wastes in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa. PRACTICAL ACTIONS TAKEN: In November and December 2016, we re-organized road shows in Ilorin to create awareness on the need for businesses in Ilorin, especially sawmills and old tyre sellers, who daily fumigate their 10 neighborhoods, to support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and stop their pollution. PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION: We made T-Shirts and Face-Caps and distributed to students and jobless youths who joined the road show campaign. Each participant went home with a Hamper basket filled with beverages and information on Clean Environment. Honourable Ibrahim Olanrewaju Orire, the Supervisory Counselor on Health of the Ilorin West Local Government Council was briefed by the CEO of El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited and received our plea that he should to use his good office to END THE FUMES! MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES: By observation. EXPECTED OUTCOME: The fumes are still emitted. It is unfortunate. PRINCIPLE 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. TOP MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT: In year 2016, the management of El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited decided to do a follow-up to the 2015 awareness about the need for the environmental responsibility of the Saw millers, mechanics, vulcanizes and waste disposers who are responsible for the un-ending fumes. PRACTICAL ACTIONS TAKEN: El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited re-organized a seminar titled: STOP FUMIGATING YOURSELVES AND OTHERS! on January 5, 2017 at the auditorium of the College of Education, Ilorin. The Goal of the seminar was to promote greater environmental responsibility b y t h e s aw m i l l e rs , v u l c an i z e rs , m e ch an i cs an d w as t e d i s p o s e rs . 11 PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION: The target audience: saw millers, vulcanizes, mechanics and waste disposers were invited and promised a bottle of soft drink if they attend the seminar. The event recorded 720 attendees. They agreed that they are responsible for the environmental pollution of the sawmill area and said that there is no alternative waste disposal option for the waste they generate by government; The problem is compounded by the allowed indiscriminate felling and lumbering of economic trees all over the forest region of Nigeria, especially at night. Trees from such illicit sources form the pool of raw materials for the smolder emitting sawmills. It appears that environmental laws are not enforced in Nigeria. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES: Residents of the saw mill area, Ilorin, Kwara state, Nigeria, as well as those of similarly affected residential areas where sawmills are located all over Nigeria and Africa stand the risk of contacting life threatening respiratory-tract infections and lung cancer. It was apparent that those responsible for the pollution are now aware that there are health hazards associated with their activities. EXPECTED OUTCOME: To stall the indiscriminate abuse of the environment globally, all UNGC registered businesses should on their own, undertake similar initiatives in all their spheres of endeavor to promote greater environmental responsibility. PRINCIPLE 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. TOP MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT: El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited encourages the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies by Nigerians. PRACTICAL ACTIONS TAKEN: It is top management's policy for year 2016 to source for environmentally friendly mining and mineral beneficiation technologies that can help Nigeria to develop the 34 different solid minerals deposits all over Nigeria. 12 El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited tried as much as possible in year 2016 to help boost the solid minerals sector of Nigeria, West Africa and elsewhere in Africa by introducing as many private and public decisions makers to our partners: Zenith Mining and Construction Equipment Manufactures . The intention is to get them to procure mining and minerals beneficiation equipment that will boost their economies and individual incomes. PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTATION: El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited sent out letters, e-mails, called and SMSed prospective clients, giving details of financial and other economic benefits of the procurement of the equipment to the society and prospective clients. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES: Several new stone crushers were bought and installed by Nigerians in year 2016 showing that more jobs and wealth will be created. EXPECTED OUTCOME: Nigeria's crude petroleum dependent economy will be productively diversified very soon. Crime rate will considerably reduce. Peace, tranquility, progress and political stability will prevail in Nigeria. ANTI-CORRUPTION: PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. TOP MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT: The board of El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited designed the company's policies in such a way as to vehemently work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

This COP will be shared with El-Yah-Agla Nigeria Limited's stakeholders through the usage of various tools. Our stakeholders are staff, external experts, shareholders, clients and partners.
