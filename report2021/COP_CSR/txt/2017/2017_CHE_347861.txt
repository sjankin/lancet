The Group is engaged in:  Oil and Gas Exploration and Production  Promotion and development of regional infrastructure projects in Africa In the nineties crude oil trading was the core business of the Petrolin Group but later on the Group moved to the upstream sector and into other ventures in Africa. Although based in Switzerland, the Group is deeply engaged in Nigeria, South Africa, Benin, Togo, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, the DRC, Burundi, Malawi and Zambia, in a wide spread of interests including upstream hydrocarbons sector, telecommunication, real estate, aviation and infrastructures. 3 In Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, Petrolin Group is active through participation in assets operated by first class oil companies. In Nigeria, the Group owns: 9.71% interest in Niger Delta Exploration and Production Plc, (www.ngdelta.com) operating, through its subsidiary NDPR Ltd, two marginal oil fields, Ogbele and Omerelu, located respectively in onshore blocks OML 54 and OML 53. 40% interest in ND Western Limited, (www.ndwestern.com) a company holding 45% interest in OML 34, an onshore producing license 12.45% interest in Seplat Petroleum Development Company, (www.seplatpetroleum.com) a Nigerian company listed both on the London stock Exchange and on the Nigerian Stock Exchange.

In the promotion and development of regional infrastructure projects in Africa, Joint development agreements between the Republic of Benin and its neighbours led the authorities of Benin, in consultation with those of Niger, to promote an infrastructure development programme based on the “backbone” concept devised by Mr. Dossou-Aworet, Petrolin Group’s founder. In this context, the Petrolin Group has formed PIC Network Limited, a new subsidiary which has undertaken all preliminary studies, at its own expense. These studies have persuaded the Republic of Benin’s to support a regionally integrated and cohesive transport infrastructure scheme (the “Backbone Project”). Implementation of the Backbone Project will ensure a stable, balanced and attractive legal, financial and fiscal framework to attract local, regional and international investors. To this end, the Republic of Benin and PIC Network Limited have entered into preliminary agreements to create a Public-Private Partnership with an initial core group of African and international investors and stakeholders. As the promoter and coordinator of the Backbone Project., PIC Network is now inviting interested parties public and private, national and international players to join the venture. The Backbone Project proposed by PIC Network Limited includes the coordinated development of a number of major infrastructure projects for the sub-region, to wit: 4  The construction and exploitation in the Republic of Benin of a new deep water port in Sème-Podji, located on the Nigerian border  The construction and exploitation of a dry port as a multimodal logistic platform  The construction and exploitation of a new international airport in Krake on the border between Nigeria and Benin  The rehabilitation and exploitation of the existing railway line Cotonou-Parakou, the construction and exploitation of new railway lines from Parakou to Niamey (Niger) and the extension to the port, the new bi-national airport and the connection with the Nigerian railway network  Various ancillary and related infrastructures Except for the Dry Port at Parakou, which is almost completed, the four other components of the Backbone project are still under study. REPORT TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT: A) HUMAN RIGHTS : Since 1994, Petrolin Group has been actively engaged in humanitarian and social activities in Africa. The most salient strength of the Petrolin Group in the realm of HSE is the Group’s “Fondation Espace Afrique”, a NGO recognised as a public utility organisation by the authorities of the Canton of Geneva (Switzerland) in 1996 and by the Republic of Benin’s government in 2004. (www.f-espaceafrique.com) A portion of Petrolin Group’s profits is earmarked as a contribution to help improve the social conditions of disadvantaged rural populations in Africa. These funds have allowed Fondation Espace Afrique to build boarding schools, clinics and provides free education and medical care in African rural communities The objectives of the foundation are as follows:  To work for the humanitarian and social development of the African continent in panAfrican perspective for the reduction of poverty,  to promote the autonomy and self-sufficiency of African populations,  to preserve and develop African traditions, knowledge and expertise,  to foster the active participation of the African private sector in Africa’s development,  to encourage partnerships between international development practitioners and players  and to instil a spirit of cooperation that goes beyond clan and cultural barriers. 5 Fondation Espace Afrique finances and operates projects and initiatives in Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Gabon, Congo, Nigeria, Burkina-Faso, South Africa as well as projects at the PanAfrican level. 6 Pictures of the CIEVRA (Center for Experiments and Valorisation of African Resources) created by Fondation Espace Afrique in the Benin Republic to develop the autonomy of rural populations through implementation of organic farming, agro-food and health projects In 2016, Fondation Espace Afrique has carried on with projects it conducts by itself or in parnership with other organizations (financing schools, offering scholarships for students, etc).

Gender equalities and skill management are key in this respect. During the reporting period, Petrolin Group has received no grievances or complaints from employees or others in relation to potential labour rights violation, nor was the Group involved in any labour rights incidences. C) ENVIRONMENT : As mentioned above, the Petrolin Group is engaged in  Oil and Gas Exploration and Production  Promotion and development of regional infrastructure projects in Africa as an integral part of its ongoing diversification strategy In Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, Petrolin Group is active through participation in assets operated by first class oil companies namely: 7 Niger Delta Exploration and Production Plc, ( www.ngdelta.com) ND Western Limited, ( www.ndwestern.com) Seplat Petroleum Development Company, (www.seplatpetroleum.com) Surestream Petroleum Ltd, (www.surestream-petroleum.com) Apart from economic or financial reasons, in choosing these companies to invest in, Petrolin Group was taking into consideration the human rights, corruption/transparency and environmental positions of said companies. Among several examples which can illustrate the commitment of Petrolin Group’s partners to develop environmentally friendly production methods, we can quote NDPR Ltd which was recently selected for an award recognising its significant contribution towards global gas flaring reduction by the World Bank Group and the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR). In the promotion and development of regional infrastructure projects in Africa, With regard to environmental considerations, the Petrolin Group obtained in December 2016 a certification of conformity with environmental regulations of the Republic of Benin for the Group’s new deepwater port at Sème-Podji. 8 The “Backbone Project” promises will improve conditions with respect to the environment in the following ways:  Realisation of the rail component extension from Parakou to Niamey via Dosso will reduce pollution engendered by truck transport which, at present, is the only means for shippers to convey freight from the sea to the West African hinterland (Niger, Burkina Faso and Northwest Nigeria).  Realisation of the bi-national airport to serve the Cotonou and Lagos Metropolitan areas which will afford passenger access by rail as well as improved highways, will reduce emissions engendered by existing highway traffic congestion around the existing single Lagos international airport. 9  Realisation of the deep water port at Sémè-Podji will reduce pollution presently caused by truck and ship congestion (demurrage) at the existing ports of Lagos Metropolitan Area. D) ANTI-CORRUPTION : Being installed in Switzerland and partnering often with reputable large companies in its projects, Petrolin Group has adopted, from inception, a code of business conduct covering internationally recognised standards for anti-corruption. Petrolin Group has also developed a guidance on its expectations of the behaviour, in any circumstances, of its employees, business partners, contractors and suppliers. The guidelines on gifts, avoidance of corruption and conflict of interests have been presented to all its employees. 10
