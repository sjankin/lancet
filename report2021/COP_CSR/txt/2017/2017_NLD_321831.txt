In addition to the economic and geo-political risks, we also contend with regulatory risks – in the form of both MiFID and We will remember 2016 as a challenging year; notwithstanding the Basel 3.5/4.

Broadening our shareholder base Technology We have made significant progress in increasing the liquidity of The impact of technology on all our businesses is profound. our stock and in reducing the concentration risk of our shareholder In the past, the main preoccupation of our industry (and base. After a successful secondary market offering, we now have a ourselves) was with efficiency gains from a midand backwell-diversified shareholder base, both geographically and in office perspective. But what we see now on a daily basis is that terms of types of investors. We are well aware of the importance the combination of data-based and digital technology is of long-term shareholders and the need (the necessity, in fact) to driving a revolution at the front end: the client interface. align the interests of all our stakeholders. We see this alignment Client behaviours have also undergone a sea change, and we as critical to the process of enhancing the value of the franchise. expect this to continue. It is therefore vital for us to invest in technology and re-train our staff for an increasingly digital Strategy update world. We see this as an opportunity to drive the productivity Prior to the secondary market offering, we provided the market of our organisation. with a strategy update. While there were no changes to the strategic direction of the company – to be a pure-play wealth Beyond technology, we are also making investments aimed at management firm – we felt that an assessment was both necessary deepening our understanding of human behaviour in a digital and healthy, and that this was an opportune moment to make one. world, and of the evolution of trust in this context.

Van Lanschot Jaarverslag 2015 This change reflects our fundamental belief in the single proposition Thank you to our shareholders: a pure-play wealth management franchise. We believe that when the interests of our clients, shareholders, The rebranding will focus on re-naming the group while retaining employees and society at large are reconciled, it is to the the individual brands for specific client segments, whether private benefit of all – and, in particular, to sustainable long-term or institutional. While our three centuries of heritage is a source value creation. In this context, I would like to thank all of great pride, our identity also needs to reflect the ways in which employees of the firm for their hard work, diligence and focus. we have changed. It has not been an easy journey, but one that was necessary to create a sustainable future. While the journey continues, The new name is also a reflection of our culture of cooperation, the palpable benefits are visible to all. in which people go the extra mile to get the best results for their clients. These are top-notch professionals, people who relish ’s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 8 March 2017 challenges and who know how to meet very high expectations of integrity, quality and client focus. The services we offer our clients are grounded in thorough market knowledge, extensive experience and a clear, long-term view on economic developments. This is highly specialist knowledge, which depends entirely on the quality of our people and how they work together. Their commitment, teamwork and hard work underpins everything we do. ‘The power of one’ also expresses our fundamental belief in the Karl Guha role of the individual, deeply embedded in society, to make a Chairman of the Statutory Board difference for the better. This is reflected at every level in the company, and is all about empowerment and taking responsibility for one's actions. While we take no political position, we champion all causes that directly promote stability, accountability and individual responsibility. We believe that we have an obligation to do so in the context of the society in which we operate. Stakeholder value It might be rather unusual to write about a stakeholder valuebased approach in a letter to shareholders. However, given the recent change from a predominantly Dutch ownership to a more international shareholder base, we feel that it is both prudent and necessary to introduce it here as a theme. We believe that it is important for a company to find a social purpose, to address the often asked question: ‘Is what I do every day relevant to society?’ Enabling individuals to answer this question – and by doing so to find a purpose bigger than merely self-interest – is an essential aspect of empowerment in a corporate setting. Our raison d’être as a firm rests on the creation and preservation of wealth for our clients and for society. And wealth generation is essential if we are to successfully sustain our society – or what the Dutch call de samenleving. Strategy 9 Strategy To enable us to help our clients achieve their business, personal Our knowledge and experience, our track record and our personal and social goals, we have opted to position ourselves as a approach set us apart from the competition in our selected market specialist, independent wealth manager. Our mission is to segments and offer exciting growth opportunities. We strive to preserve and create wealth for our clients. achieve our objectives in harmony with all our stakeholders, and thus to make a contribution to society.

We contribute to a positive business climate by annual reporting guidelines such as those drawn up by the enabling entrepreneurs to invest and to take risks.

Global Reporting Initiative Communicating transparently on our policy and results is an Compliance with external guidelines and benchmarks is no easy important element of corporate social responsibility. Only then task can external stakeholders assess our performance effectively. At Van Lanschot Kempen, we aspire to comply with key guidelines on Our report therefore follows the guidelines set out by the Global corporate social responsibility while also aiming to do even better on Reporting Initiative (GRI) – the international standard for CSR external sustainability benchmarks.

For more information, see corporate. Since the financial crisis and the rapid emergence of new technology vanlanschot.nl/responsible/external-assessment. companies, banks have seen their popularity with young talent decline. Tighter regulation makes it harder for banks to act swiftly – like fintech start-ups, for instance. It has become increasingly difficult to get the pick of the crop to opt for a financial sector career, particularly in areas of scarcity such as digitisation. Trends in online and mobile technology are moving rapidly and we are becoming ever more dependent on scarce knowledge and experience in these areas. Van Lanschot Kempen Foundation So can we persuade talent that working for a financial institution We set up the Van Lanschot Kempen Foundation (VLKF) means you are right at the cutting edge of digitisation and that you in 2016.

What our stakeholders expect 21 Sponsorship Arts sponsorship is an integral part of our market positioning as a wealth manager. The support we give to the arts, artists and museums helps to both preserve and expand our cultural heritage. Van Lanschot has been an official partner of the new entrance space at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 2015. We also launched our Van Lanschot Art Prize in 2015. The award is presented each year to a contemporary artist whose work best conveys the spirit of the age to future generations. Mirjam Offringa was the winner in 2016, with her video artwork Contact. Two sponsorship deals were signed via Evi, with the Amsterdam Student Rowing Club Nereus and with the football club Koninklijke HFC, focusing on support for coaches. Kempen & Co’s sponsorship activities are in keeping with its brand and positioning. It supports a variety of cultural, community and sporting initiatives in the Netherlands, including our role as principal sponsor of the Nereus rowing club and of the Pinoké hockey club in Amstelveen. We identify with the mentality of top sportspeople, with their focus on outstanding performance in a highly international and competitive field. We also sponsor the Holland Festival – an international event for theatre, music, dance, opera, film and the visual arts in Amsterdam. 22 Unburdening clients Healthcare professionals are typically driven by their love of what they do and have hardly any time or energy for things like debt reduction and wealth creation. They need sparring partners, someone they can trust – and that’s where we come in. Our guidance covers all stages of the life of a healthcare company or professional, every step of the way. Doctors are increasingly becoming facilitators, patients are getting more of a say, technology and higher life expectancy are changing the demand for healthcare while at the same time there’s a massive push to cut the costs of healthcare. We understand the impact of all these developments, and our clients are keen to hear our views. That’s where our discussions typically begin, and it isn’t until later that we translate wishes into possibilities. Because that’s what it’s really all about: financially unburdening our clients. While I understand the importance of putting clients first, to me it sounds too impersonal and procedural – thinking in terms of our clients’ interests isn’t about ticking a box. And so I’m more than just a manager: I have my own portfolio of clients. It’s important to me to be there for our healthcare professionals when it really matters. And of course that also means after I’ve left the office; flexibility is part and parcel of financial services.

More than most, our clients need mortgage products specifically tailored to them – and we make sure our offering helps them achieve their goals. Social relevance matters a great deal to me. That’s why I’ve taken on treasurer duties with Internationaal Danstheater and the mugmetdegoudentand theatre group. It makes me happy to be able to draw on my financial knowledge in a different way and to contribute to the community outside the bank. I feel very fortunate that my Van Lanschot position is equally relevant. Under the current rules, for instance, it’s hard for first-time buyers to get a mortgage. We offer our clients the opportunity to stand as guarantor for their children and so give them a chance to buy. The children are the owner-occupiers, and the home is in their name. It’s one way of passing on financial capacity to the next generation. And of course there are other ways for the bank to make a social contribution. At the end of 2015, 12 Dutch financial services companies, including Van Lanschot, signed the climate statement of the Dutch Banking Association. The statement pledges transparency about the climate impact of lending and investment. Having taken this pledge, it makes sense for us to incorporate energy saving advice in our mortgage products and so contribute to reducing carbon emissions.

Private Banking 36 We actively involved our clients in responsible and sustainable investment once again in 2016, partly through a survey to discover how they rate the quality of the information we provide. The survey results show that our clients view responsible and sustainable investment as an important subject on which they would like to be kept informed. We responded by further enhancing our communication in this area and paid even more attention to the results of our engagement efforts. Impact investing added to Charity Service Van Lanschot rolled out the Charity Service for its clients three years ago. The service broadens and deepens our role as a wealth manager and is intended to advise our clients in the field of philanthropy. Since then, we have seen a growing interest on our clients’ part not only in philanthropy, but also in social entrepreneurship and impact investing. We responded in 2016 by expanding our Charity Service to include an impact investing element. We use personal advisory discussions to determine our clients’ wishes and needs in terms of social impact and then help them choose the most appropriate donation or investment strategy. The Charity Service once again organised a variety of philanthropy and impact investing sessions in 2016, including several in conjunction with Ashoka (see page 35). Van Lanschot also played host in September 2016 to the first Dutch meeting of the European organisation Philanthropy Impact. For more information, see vanlanschot.nl/charity-service.

We can’t run after them and coax them back, because we don’t know who they are. I manage the team in charge of developing new applications; we deliver new software about every three or four weeks – we’re constantly developing. As one of the first employees to join the Evi team, I must say that, over the years, we’ve managed to retain our habit of consulting and deciding fast, as well as our entrepreneurial mindset. It still feels as if we’re running our own company. Maturing also means that efficiency has become even more important: in 2016, our sales team moved from ‘s-Hertogenbosch to join the rest of the Evi team in Amsterdam. This has brought together all disciplines on a single floor. We’re no longer a start-up, but I do hope we can remain as flat an organisation as ever, with short communication lines and rapid decision-making. Clients can sense these dynamics and choose us for precisely this reason. Accessible at all times, that’s our key strength. Clients use our online platform and apps, but can also contact our experienced advisers for answers to all their questions on wealth.

I don’t own a crystal ball, of course, but I’m pretty good at realistic assessments. And I read what my counterparts at other banks or organisations say, although I tend to develop my own views. After all, it’s essential to have a distinct voice in this hugely competitive market. To do my job, I don’t rely on my gut feeling, I analyse the data we economists call leading indicators. We look at a range of different scenarios and communicate our views to our clients honestly and fairly. There’s lots of variety in my job and I really don’t know on Mondays what the rest of the week will bring. Our clients, by contrast, don’t like surprises and I try to keep these to a minimum through clear and timely communication. I previously worked for the government and I get real energy from the fact that things at KCM are not at all slow-moving.

Van Lanschot Jaarverslag 2015 44 Temporary corrections just a stone in the road I’ve been responsible for Kempen Orange Fund and Kempen Oranje Participaties Fund since 2005, focusing on Dutch small and mid-caps and on Dutch and European minority holdings respectively. We’re a small team of specialists responsible for analysis, portfolio management and long-term engagement. Every team member has their own specific knowledge and experience. Let me mention just two: Erwin Dut headed up equity research for many years and Michiel van Dijk is highly experienced in valuing stocks. I know all listed small-caps investee companies inside out, and often for quite a bit longer than their own CEOs. I get inspired when focusing on a niche market, drilling really deeply into what makes it tick. I’ve been with Kempen for nearly 25 years, and started in the dealing room. Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t believe in switching jobs every two years. Besides, Kempen has changed an awful lot over time and this is anyway a very dynamic line of business. That said, the essence of what we do has stayed the same: identifying long-term trends at companies in equity markets that can be exceedingly volatile. A temporary correction is a mere stone in the road, we shouldn’t allow it to get to us. The company’s quality and long-term earnings capacity – that’s what matters.

Without Staalbankiers the AuS of Private Banking would remain unchanged (79%) in 2016.

In addition, in 2016 Van Lanschot Kempen signed up to a joint Sustainable Development Goals Investing (SDGI) Agenda, an initiative by the financial sector aimed at making a maximum contribution to the realisation of the SDGs by pooling strengths and collaborating intensively with De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB).

We draw on our network and a range of platforms to get them the best possible price. Investors increasingly have access to a huge array of alternatives, including passive investing and robo trading: we need to stand out for our fundamental knowledge and in-depth relationships. Over the years, I’ve grown from a curious student trading sprinters and other investment products in my spare time into a full-time trader. Fundamental and technical knowledge has taught me to gauge the markets and allows me to really help our clients. At Kempen, every day feels like a championship match: we have to be at the top of our game, never flagging and always able to think many steps ahead. The best teams tend to feature both hard-working defenders and lazy strikers. I myself was a top player at the Amstelveen hockey club Pinoké. A mid-fielder gives assists to other players, but also does defensive work, which compares really well with what I do at Kempen. That little bit extra materialises when we all value each other for our individual qualities and commit those qualities fully. Bringing out the best in yourself and in others in a dynamic, go-getting environment – it’s fun and highly energising.

Prijzen Awards As in previous years, we ended the year under review high in the rankings website in the various categories of the Extel Survey, finishing second in Benelux Trading & Execution, taking the number-one slot in European Real Estate based on corporate CO2 votes and coming third in this category based on client votes. In addition, several analysts, sales traders and traders secured a top-five position in the individual ranking, three of them at number one. This demonstrates yet again the high level of attention that Kempen Securities devotes to quality, something that is visibly appreciated by both clients and companies. At the SRP Structured Products & Derivatives Awards 2017, Kempen & Co was honoured as Best Distributor in the Regional category (Netherlands) for the third year in a row, while also scooping an award in the Best Performance category for the second year running. 52 Entrepreneurial and ambitious spirit As one of the professionals in the European Real Estate team at Kempen Corporate Finance, I work on a really diverse range of projects, both in mergers & acquisitions and in the field of equity capital markets. It’s an exciting and rewarding role, as we’re called on to give strategic and financial advice to our clients – mostly CEOs and CFOs – at different stages of their company’s lifecycle. I studied at HEC (École des Hautes Études Commerciales), a well-known business school in Paris. After spending six years at Unibail-Rodamco, where I learnt how the real estate industry works, I moved to the Netherlands. Kempen offered me the opportunity to join the European Real Estate team, on the investment banking side. I was attracted by Kempen & Co’s positioning as a specialist bank in real estate that can leverage a broad investors network. What I really like about Kempen is the kind of people I work with, the entrepreneurial and ambitious spirit. There’s quite a few people here who excel at sports, which is no coincidence: like corporate finance, sport is about winning, and both require endurance. Sport has an important role in my life, too – it helps me manage my energy efficiently and to relax. I have my black belt in judo and also enjoy yoga and horse-riding.

We make sure that all systems are running properly and develop functionalities based on the wishes of our colleagues and (indirectly) the requirements of the regulators.

Capital management Over the course of 2016, we made further progress with our Compliance risk capital strategy. The Common Equity Tier I ratio (phase-in and Our Compliance department helps to ensure that our staff including net profit retention) increased from 16.3% at year-end adhere at all times to legislation, internal regulations and our own 2015 to 19.0% at year-end 2016. The fully loaded Common code of conduct. Non-compliance with legislation may result in Equity Tier I ratio stood at 18.6% (2015: 15.4%) and the capital significant reputational damage and/or financial losses.

As in previous years, the reduction Compliance department plays a key role in safeguarding the in Corporate Banking’s loan book exposures was the main integrity of our operations. contributor to the strong growth in solvency ratios, although in 2016 the ratios also reflected improvement in the underlying credit Both domestic and international laws continue to increase in quality. With a Common Equity Tier I ratio of 19.0%, volume and complexity. We need to constantly appraise whether Van Lanschot Kempen is well ahead of its target range of 15-17%. our processes and procedures remain compliant with changing laws and regulations. Risk and capital management 65 Due to the planned reduction in the loan book, we expect the solvency position to strengthen even further. With this excess capital position, Van Lanschot Kempen is entering the next phase of its strategy. Excess capital will be redistributed to shareholders within the regulatory boundaries that apply. We pursue a solid capital position and also critically examine the composition of our capital position and funding mix. To this end, we closely track the latest market developments and new regulations. In November 2016, we successfully placed a €50 million Tier 2 capital instrument. This placement further diversifies the capital base and strengthens Van Lanschot Kempen’s bail-in buffer, providing more flexibility in our capital strategy. Although the requirements have not been finalised, MREL and TLAC bail-in measures are expected to bring additional requirements. At this point in time, Van Lanschot Kempen almost complies with these expected requirements. In the future, resolution planning measures could increase MREL requirements; we expect more clarity on this in 2017. Regulator De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) periodically assesses banking entities through the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) and subsequently sets SREP requirements. For Van Lanschot Kempen, DNB requires a SREP minimum Common Equity Tier I ratio of 14.2%. This requirement aims to cover not only Pillar I risk types but our entire risk profile. Factoring in the changing nature of our balance sheet, DNB has also imposed a capital requirement in nominal terms. This nominal capital requirement is more dynamic and may deviate from the relative SREP requirement. At its current 19.0%, our phase-in Common Equity Tier I ratio well exceeds the SREP requirement at this point. The Basel III leverage ratio stood at 6.9% at year-end 2016 (year-end 2015: 6.1%), which is high compared with other Dutch banks. The minimum leverage ratio required under Basel III is 3%, but it is not yet clear what the requirement will be for banks in the Netherlands. Our leverage ratio is substantially higher than the minimum, even if the requirement for Dutch banks were to be set at 4%. That said, the run-off of our corporate loan portfolio should contribute to a further gradual upturn in the leverage ratio.

The consultations with the Works Council were constructive as usual. In addition, Jeanine Helthuis took an introductory meeting with the Works Council in May 2016 in view of the Council’s changed composition. 71 Putting clients’ interests first I received extensive guidance when still a trainee, but here, in my first real job, I really have to show the stuff I’m made of. It’s a responsibility I welcome. I’ve joined the Intensive & Preventive Management team, which identifies our clients’ credit risks. At Intensive Management we get together with our clients to find solutions to help them catch up on payment arrears. At Preventive Management we draw on a predictive model to flag clients we might need to warn if there’s a real possibility of payment arrears going forward. Indicators that put us on high alert are less money coming into an account and people rapidly depleting their savings to pay regular outgoings. We’d like to prevent our clients getting into trouble, so we contact them proactively, fully aware that we don’t always know the full story. That’s one reason we try not to lay down the law to our clients; we encourage them to think about their financial situation and take action themselves. Putting clients centre stage sounds good, but could also be misinterpreted to mean doing whatever clients want us to do. Of course we take on board their desires, but their possibilities are just as important – and these two aren’t necessarily always in sync. More important than putting clients first is to put their interests first.

Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 Property, Plant and IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets that revenue reflects a pattern Transactions of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business The amendments to IFRS 2 focus on the effects of vesting conditions on (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction, the consumed through use of the asset.

Annual Improvements to 2012-2014 Cycle IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Changes to standards concern: The IASB published a final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments in July 2014, incorporating all phases of the financial instruments project and IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Opreplacing IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement erations (changes in methods of disposal) and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new Assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of either through sale requirements for classification and measurement, impairment and hedge or by distribution to owners. The amendment clarifies that changing accounting. IFRS 9 applies for annual periods beginning on or after from one of these disposal methods to the other would not be considered 1 January 2018. Retrospective application is required, but comparative a new plan of disposal, rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is figures are not mandatory. Early application of earlier versions of IFRS 9 therefore no interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5.

For financial assets where there is no significant IFRS 15 was published in May 2014 and in April 2016 amendments were deterioration in credit quality since initial recognition, a provision is issued to address guidance on implementation.

The difference between Stages 2 and 3 is transferring goods or services to a customer. The standard also specifies the recognition of interest revenue. Under Stage 2 interest revenue is how to account for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the calculated on the gross carrying amount, while under Stage 3 interest costs directly related to fulfilling a contract.

Summary of significant accounting principles 103 To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually. Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are subject to uncertainty. Acquisitions In the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items which are not traded on an active market. Actuarial assumptions of provisions The pension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations. These calculations make assumptions regarding elements such as the discount rate, future trends in salaries and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty. See Note 20, Provisions.

The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship in the statement of financial position. between Van Lanschot and the entity. Among other things, Van Lanschot takes into account existing and potential voting rights.

In making this assessment, a distinction is made between substantive and protective rights.

Van Lanschot consolidates interests in investment funds if it has power over the investment fund and is exposed to or has rights to variable income stemming from its involvement and is able to use its power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot and the investment fund. Van Lanschot takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.

These internal models are also in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, non-controlling used to determine the required capital that has to be set aside for interests and shareholdings which appear on the company statement of absorbing unexpected credit losses. As such, the models, the use of these financial position of Van Lanschot Bankiers. We use the simple riskmodels and the model governance have to adhere to strict requirements weighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). shares. In this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk The CRR distinguishes three approaches for determining the required weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial capital: the standardised approach (SA), the foundation internal ratingsinstitutions which cannot be deducted from equity because they fall below based (F-IRB) approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) the regulatory threshold.

The standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various characteristics such as client type, loan Other loans and advances type, collateral type, and external rating. Under F-IRB, banks are allowed to The risk-weighted assets of the other portfolios (i.e. excluding retail, use internal estimates of the probability of default (PD) in determining non-retail and equity) is calculated on the basis of the standardised the required capital. The credit conversion factors for determining the approach. exposure at default (EAD) and the loss given default (LGD) are prescribed. Under A-IRB banks are allowed to use own estimates for PD, EAD and 2.4.1 Model governance framework IRB models LGD. The PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one The model governance framework for IRB models is part of the overyear, the EAD is defined as the bank’s expected exposure at the time a arching Credit Governance Manual.

The main aim of the model monitoring and validation process – Qualifying revolving retail exposures up to €40,000; is to reduce model risk, which can be caused by inadequate models or – Other retail exposures up to €2,000,000; incorrect use of models.

Different approaches are used for retail and non-retail granted in the Netherlands. A client’s rating is a decisive factor in the loans to determine the risk profile of the portfolio. assessment and pricing of customised loans. The rating is also used to enhance insight into the loan portfolio and to monitor its quality. Retail portfolio We have developed a rating scale for the rating models. The highest possible The quality of the retail portfolio (see description in Section 2.4) is determined rating is class T, followed by classes A to F.

Business risk earnings-at-risk scenarios was extended to two years. According to the Business risk can be defined as the threat to our results or equity resulting earnings-at-risk analysis, the most adverse scenarios are: from failure to respond (adequately) to changes in environmental factors, – Increased competition for client savings, resulting in higher rates or from incorrect strategic decisions.

Interest rate risk within limits. Interest rate risk is a bank’s exposure to adverse interest rate movements. When interest rates change, the present value and timing of future cash The long-term interest rate risk is addressed by using the economic value flows also change. This in turn changes the underlying value of a bank’s approach, which looks at how movements in interest rates impact the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and hence its value of the bank’s assets and liabilities. The main tool used in the economic value. Changes in interest rates also affect a bank’s earnings by economic value calculation is duration analysis. The duration of the altering interest-sensitive income and expenses, affecting its net interest bank’s equity indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on income. Interest rate risk consists of: its economic value. During 2016, duration of equity was controlled by – Repricing risk, which is related to timing differences in the maturity ALCO within a bandwidth of 3.2 to 4.7 years. Due to the low interest rate and repricing of assets and liabilities. The impact of repricing risk (or environment, customers’ appetite for loans (particularly mortgages) with gap risk), which depends on the extent to which rate shifts occur in long-term fixed interest rates remained strong. a parallel way along the yield curve; – Yield curve risk, which arises from changes in the slope and shape of The resulting upward effect on duration was mitigated by engaging in the yield curve (non-parallel shifts); interest rate swaps. The implementation of a new IT system for managing – Optionality risk, which relates to embedded options in client interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) resulted in significant products, for instance the right to partly prepay mortgages before improvements with respect to the control of IRRBB exposure on a maturity or the right to withdraw deposits at any time; forward-looking basis. – Basis risk, which occurs when a hedging instrument reprices under slightly different conditions than the corresponding balance sheet The duration of four years at year-end 2016 implies the value of item (for instance, a floating rate mortgage that reprices based equity would fall by 3.9% (€58.9 million) if there were a parallel rise on one-month Euribor versus a swap that reprices based on of 100 basis points in interest rates. In the event of a parallel fall in three-month Euribor). interest rates of 100 basis points, the value of equity would rise by 4.1% (€62.3 million). At year-end 2015, this sensitivity was €82 million. We pursue a prudent interest rate risk policy which takes into account The calculation of the economic value of equity is based both short-term and long-term interest rate risk. The short-term interest on discounting future cash flows. Whereas previously we discounted rate risk is addressed mainly from an income perspective (earnings-atall cash flows based on a risk-free rate (represented by the swap curve), risk). This involves an analysis of the interest income under a range of in the fourth quarter of 2016 the impact of product-specific spreads interest rate scenarios. In 2016, the earnings-at-risk scenarios were was included in the discounting method. This has resulted in a lower recalibrated, taking into account the current low interest rate economic value of equity, and thus in a lower absolute impact of environment, as well as other factors. In addition, the horizon of the interest rate changes.

Derivatives Hedge accounting is also used for other derivatives where changes in their contracts are recognised at face value, because changes in interest rates market value impact on the result on financial transactions. relate to the face value, not the market value which forms the valuation basis for these contracts. Tables 6.B and 6.C show Van Lanschot’s We hold a Pillar II capital buffer for interest rate risk. This capital sensitivity to interest rate movements based on the contractual interest requirement is determined by looking at the negative impact on the rate maturities of the respective line items. Savings and current accounts market value of equity in a number of historically extreme adverse do not have fixed terms. Therefore, the balances of non-maturing interest rate scenarios. The impact on the market value of equity is instruments are mapped to the variable category.

A valuation technique is used in which at least one input that has a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation is not based on observable market data. A significant effect on the instrument’s valuation is considered to be present when the unobservable input accounts for at least 10% of the total instrument’s fair value and exceeds a threshold of €50,000.

Van Lanschot N.V. is a Dutch banking institution operating in the segments private banking, online wealth management Evi, asset What we have audited management, merchant banking, corporate banking and other We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2016 activities. The Group comprises of several components and of Van Lanschot N.V., Den Bosch (‘the Bank’). The financial therefore we considered our Group audit scope and approach as statements include the consolidated financial statements of set out in the scope of our group audit section. We paid specific Van Lanschot N.V. and its subsidiaries (together: ‘the Group’) attention to the areas of focus driven by the operations of the and the company financial statements. Bank, as set out below. The consolidated financial statements comprise: We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing – the consolidated statement of financial position as at the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 31 December 2016; In particular, we looked at where the Executive Board made – the following statements for 2016: the consolidated subjective judgments, for example in respect of significant statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and equity and cash flows; and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. – the notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In the section ‘summary of significant accounting principles’ of the financial statements the Bank describes the areas of judgment The company financial statements comprise: in applying accounting policies and the key sources of estimation – the company statement of financial position as at uncertainty. Given the significant estimation uncertainty in 31 December 2016; impairment of loans and advances to the public and private – the company statement of income for the year then ended; sectors, fair value measurement of financial instruments, the and valuation of the deferred tax asset and the provision for – the notes, comprising a summary of the accounting policies compensation of SME interest rate derivatives in accordance with and other explanatory information. the “Uniform Recovery Framework”, we considered these to be key audit matters as set out in the key audit matter section of this The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the report. Besides the key audit matters, other areas of focus were preparation of the financial statements is EU-IFRS and the the Bank’s IT systems, risk management, goodwill and intangible relevant provisions of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for assets, remuneration and pensions. the consolidated financial statements and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code for the company financial statements. Our audit procedures related to the IT environment reflected a combination of controls testing and performing substantive audit The basis for our opinion procedures. Where possible and considered relevant for our We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including audit, we tested the operating effectiveness of IT general controls the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those (‘ITGCs’) and application controls. standards are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’ of our report. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by management that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Independent auditor's report 240 We ensured that the audit teams both at Group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for the audit of a bank. We therefore included specialists in the areas of amongst others IT, accounting and valuation of financial instruments, employee benefits and tax in our team. Furthermore, the Bank has an internal audit department (‘Group Audit’) that performs operational, compliance and IT audits. The audits performed by Group Audit did not directly affect our audit and as a result we did not make direct use of the work of Group Audit. However, we evaluated together with Group Audit the outcome and results of their audits and included relevant risks and/or developments in our risk assessment and audit plan. The outlines of our audit approach were as follows: Materiality – Overall materiality: €4.25 million which represents 5% of profit before tax. Audit scope – We conducted our audit work primarily in the Netherlands. – Site visits were conducted to Belgium and Switzerland. – Audit coverage: 96% of consolidated total assets, 99% of total revenue and 94% of profit before tax. Key audit matters – Impairment of loans and advances to the public and private sectors – Fair value measurement of financial instruments – Valuation of the deferred tax asset – Compensation of SME interest rate derivatives in accordance with the Uniform Recovery Framework Materiality the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the The scope of our audit is influenced by the application of individual financial statement line items and disclosures and to materiality which is further explained in the section ‘Our evaluate the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements’. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, for the financial statements as a whole as follows: together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine Overall Group materiality €4.25 million Benchmark applied 5% of profit before tax Rationale for benchmark applied We have applied this benchmark, a generally accepted auditing practice, based on our analysis of the common information needs of users of the consolidated financial statements. On this basis we believe that profit before tax is the most important metric for the financial performance of the Bank, its use is deemed to result in an adequate level of materiality. We also considered other benchmarks that are of great interest to stakeholders (including CET1 capital) and concluded that materiality based on those benchmarks would fall within the range of overall materiality based on profit before tax. Component materiality To each component in our audit scope, we allocate, based on our judgement, materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between €0.53 million and €4.25 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality. Independent auditor's report 241 We also take misstatements and/or possible misstatements into the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The Group audit account that, in our judgement, are material for qualitative team visited the Belgian and Swiss operations and local reasons. component auditors given the significance of these components. We agreed with the Supervisory Board that we would report to The Group consolidation, financial statement disclosures and a them misstatements identified during our audit above €212.5 number of complex items (including the items addressed below as thousand as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our key audit matter) are audited by the Group engagement team at view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. the head office. The scope of our group audit By performing the procedures above at components, combined Van Lanschot N.V. is the parent company of a group of entities. with additional procedures at Group level, we have obtained The financial information of this Group is included in the sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot N.V. information of the Group as a whole to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Group audit focussed on the financially significant components: F. van Lanschot Bankiers N.V., Kempen & Co N.V., First year audit considerations Van Lanschot Belgian Branch (BE), FvL Bankiers Switzerland (CH), Prior to becoming the Bank’s auditors in 2016, we developed Van Lanschot Participaties B.V. and AIO II B.V. For components our transition plan starting in August 2015. We carried out a Van Lanschot Belgian Branch in Belgium, FvL Bankiers Switzerland comprehensive process of understanding the strategy of the in Switzerland and AIO II B.V we instructed component auditors Bank, its business, its environment including internal controls and that are familiar with the local laws and regulations to perform IT systems, and the way this impacts the Bank’s financial reporting the audit work. and internal controls framework. Additionally, we carried out a review of the predecessor auditor’s files and discussed the All six components were in full scope (ISA 600) and were outcome thereof to confirm our understanding of the opening subjected to audits of their complete financial information. balance sheet and internal controls within the Bank. Based on these procedures, we have prepared our risk assessment and audit In total, in performing these procedures, we achieved the plan which has been discussed with the Executive Board and the following coverage on the financial line items: Audit Compliance Committee. Total assets 96 % Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional Profit before tax 94 % judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial Revenue 99 % statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Executive Board, the Audit Compliance Committee and the Supervisory Board, but they are not a comprehensive reflection of None of the remaining components represented individually all matters that were identified by our audit and that we more than 0,2% of total group assets, 1% of revenues and 4% of discussed. We described the key audit matters and included a profit before tax or revenues. For those remaining components summary of the audit procedures we performed on those we performed, among other things, analytical procedures to matters. corroborate our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatements within those components. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion Where the work was performed by component auditors, we thereon. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters determined the level of involvement we needed to have in their or on specific elements of the financial statements. Any audit work to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate comments we make on the results of our procedures should be audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on read in this context. Key audit matter How our audit adressed the matter Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors Our audit procedures included an assessment of the overall governance of See note 8 to the financial statements for the disclosures of loans and the credit and impairment process of the Bank and the testing of advances to the public and private sectors including impairments, the operational effectiveness of the internal controls directly related to: paragraph 'Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private – the identification of impairment triggers; sectors' of the summary of significant accounting principles and subsection – the parameters and data applied in the impairment models, including 2 of the risk management paragraph containing the disclosures in view of the governance around the models and the model validation and credit risk. testing; and – the review and approval by management on the outcomes of the The gross loans and advances to the public and private sectors amount to individual impairments and the impairment models. € 9.786 million, the total impairment as at 31 December 2016 amounts to € 162 million, consisting of an amount of € 60 million for impaired We determined that we could rely on these controls for the purpose of our mortgage loans and € 102 million for impaired loans. audit. Independent auditor's report 242 We consider the impairment of loans and advances to public and private For impairments for individually identifiable impaired loans and advances, sectors a key audit matter as management applies judgment in the we paid attention to the update of the application which is used to identify determination and recognition of these impairments. As the loans and and to calculate impairments for these individual items. We assessed the IT advances are significant to the financial statements, a change in controls around this application and determined that the calculations are assumptions may have a material effect on the financial statements. in alignment with the requirements of IAS 39. The impairment of loans and advances to the public and private sectors We substantively tested for a sample of the loans and advances the consists out of two different components: judgmental elements such as: – impairments for individually identifiable impaired loans and advances – classification as performing or non-performing loan based on the (‘individual items’); and (non)existence of triggering events; – the model-based impairments for incurred but not reported losses – nature and accuracy of the expected future cash flows based on the (‘IBNR’). source from which the cash flows arise; – the accuracy of the applied discount rate taken applicable latest The judgmental elements included in the impairment for individual interest rate; and identifiable impaired loans and advances are: – the valuation of the corresponding collateral based on appraisal – timely identification of impairment triggers; reports and other external information. – expected future cash flows; – the discount rate; and We found no material exceptions in these tests. – the value of the corresponding collateral. For IBNR losses, the Bank applies a model for the recognition and The subjective elements included in the model-based IBNR concern: calculation of this impairment.

IBNR losses, by assessing the accuracy of the applied PDs and LGDs based on reconciling these to the outcomes of the calculation model and by These subjective elements are based on historical data. performing sample testing the source data of the LIP. An area of focus in our assessment has been the accuracy of the LIP and actual incurred losses used as inputs for the expected loss. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sector. We evaluated compliance with disclosure requirements from EU-IFRS and the appropriate reflection of the Bank’s exposures to credit risk. In our view the recognised impairments of management were within a reasonable range of outcomes in the context of the overall loans and advances and the related uncertainties and sensitivities as disclosed in the financial statements Fair value measurement of financial instruments Our audit included testing of the Bank’s internal controls with respect to See notes 2, 4, 5, 6, 15 and 18 to the financial statements for the the governance over models, financial instrument deal capturing, source disclosures of the financial instruments valued at fair value and subsection data management and the valuation of financial instruments. 10 of the risk management paragraph in the financial statements: 'fair value' that contains the fair valuation policies, its disclosures and the split For each type of financial instruments, we tested the outcome of of financial instruments to level 1, 2 and 3. management’s valuations of the level 2 and 3 financial instruments by: – assessing the appropriateness of the classification as either level 2 or The total asset value of financial instruments measured at fair value as per 3; 31 December 2016 amounts to € 2.341 million and the total liability value – testing the appropriateness of the settings within the valuation amounts to € 1.233 million. models used with market practices; – comparing on a sample basis the observable input data with The fair value measurement of financial instruments consists of: independent data sources and externally available market data; – financial assets and liabilities held for trading; – evaluating the inputs and models used in determining the – derivatives; unobservable inputs; and – financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value through – independently re-performing, on a sample basis, management’s profit or loss; and valuation using the tested data in our own valuation tools, based on – available-for-sale investments. external data sources where available.

There is limited judgment the level 2 and 3 financial instruments measured at fair value and verified involved in the fair value valuation of these instruments. compliance with disclosure requirements from EU-IFRS.

Given the inherent subjectivity in the valuation of reasonable and acceptable range of outcomes. level 2 and level 3 financial instruments, we determined this to be a significant matter for our audit. Independent auditor's report 243 The fair value measurement of the level 2 and 3 instruments are determined based on comparable values and with the use of net present value models, option models or the net intrinsic value of the underlying investment. In addition, for certain level 3 instruments, the Bank used market and transaction multiples in the valuation. The inputs to these models consist of both contractual data, observable external market data and/ or unobservable data. The assessment of the unobservable data comprises a higher risk as the determination of those data requires complex models and judgment by management. The nature of the financial instrument drives the model and data used. Valuation of the deferred tax asset Management provided us with a breakdown of the historic losses by year See note 12 to the financial statements for the disclosures of the deferred and by legal entity of Van Lanschot Group and the composition of the tax asset and the paragraph 'Tax assets and liabilities’ of the summary of carry-forward deferred tax asset relating to tax losses. significant accounting principles. Together with our tax specialists, we verified that historical data included The total amount of deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2016 amounts in the breakdown are in accordance with the tax declaration(s) and/or any to € 40 million. other relevant information. A proportion of the deferred tax assets of € 24 million relates to the carry We also assessed that the carryforward deferred tax asset for tax losses forward losses of the Bank in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Of the total deferred tax asset € 8 million (being a carry forward loss of € 32 million) We tested management’s valuation of the 31 December 2016 deferred tax should be offset against fiscal profits before 31 December 2018. asset for tax losses, by: – assessing the recoverability through agreeing the forecasted future Given the significance of the deferred tax asset, the limited period to carry taxable profits with the approved management forecast per fiscal forward the losses and the dependency on fiscal profits needed to be in a entity; position to recognise such losses, the valuation (recoverability) of the – challenging the approved management forecast for feasibility and deferred tax asset for tax losses is highly subject to management estimates, historical accuracy (this also includes that assumptions used within the and we consider the valuation of this deferred tax asset to be a significant management forecasts are acceptable within the relevant tax regime, matter for our audit are reasonable, are consistent with those used elsewhere by the Bank, for example in the impairment testing); – considering the local expiry periods together with any applicable restrictions in recovery for each individual jurisdiction; and – reviewing the sensitivity analysis as performed by management. We assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures relating to the deferred tax asset and verified compliance with disclosure requirements from EU-IFRS. In our view the recognised deferred tax assets are within a reasonable range of outcomes. Provision for compensation of SME interest rate derivatives in We evaluated the process that the Bank has in place to ensure the accordance with the “Uniform Recovery Framework” completeness and accuracy of the compensation of the clients that are in See note 20 to the financial statements for the disclosures of the scope of the framework.

The portion of the profit remaining after the distribution on Class C preference shares and transfer to the reserves will be at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, providing that no further distributions shall be made on Class C preference shares.
