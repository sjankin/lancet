In this context, 2016 was an excellent year for Fluidra. We consolidated the growth path that we initiated two years ago and carried on with the development that has characterised our group since it was founded. We have continued recovering efficiency and profitability levels, consolidating and settling our fundamentals. During 2016, we proved our ability to increase yields in a more positive environment compared to previous years. Once again, we demonstrated the financial strength that our group has. Organic growth was solid and consistent throughout the year. Our presence in southern Europe’s markets showed very positive trend with double-digit growth, and it is also worth noting Australia’s excellent performance consistently displaying high growth rates. In general terms, all of our markets maintain positive trends, except for a few minor markets such as China. This performance is especially noteworthy when considering the uncertainties that had haunted the markets in the previous twelve months: the UK’s vote to leave the European Union; the presidential elections in the United States; the political turmoil in Brazil and Italy; and oil price volatility. A year of investment In 2016, following our philosophy of expanding and consolidating markets, we invested in growth. Growth in Europe, together with the change in logistic model, led us to expand our facilities in Trace Logistic in order to further develop our service and branch model in this region. The deployment of the new branch model (cash & carry), which allowed us to lighten the weight of our capillarity in southern Europe, is based on the centralisation of upstream stocks in the supply chain seeking to improve the level of service and support the implementation of a more efficient delegation model throughout the region. We made a significant investment in Australia to absorb the growth in this area, by moving to a new plant with greater capacity and simultaneously consolidating central logistics. We also invested to accelerate our Waterlinx integration plan, the leading South African company we acquired in August 2015. The analysis made prior to the purchase, which accounted for the plans of the South African management team and the implementation of Fluidra’s best practices, provided us with an opportunity to improve both in terms of production and the logistics system. In this regard, we 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 14 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 Letter from the President B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v erna nc e 2016 A nne x e s carried out the consolidation of both the different production plants and the logistics central warehouses. Both new sites in Australia and in South Africa are rented, so we only incur in investments directly related to our operations. “All these investments are part of our strategy which includes geographical penetration, product portfolio, growth and improvements in efficiency and profitability” In July, Fluidra acquired 70% of Sibo B.V.’s capital, a leading Dutch swimming pool and water facilities company (water gardens and natural pools or bio-pools) with a strong retail presence in Benelux and Germany. With this acquisition, we are positive that we will have more access to different northern European markets, a potential market of about 50 million euros per year, with over 230,000 residential pools installed and a commercial pools inventory of about 5,000 units. Besides, SIBO is a global leader in bio-pools, that is, biological or natural pools, an eco-friendly trend booming in northern Europe. Although this type of pool represents slightly less than 2% of the total inventory in this European region, it is gaining momentum exponentially as a highly environmentally friendly alternative. 15 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 Letter from the President B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v erna nc e 2016 A nne x e s “We were awarded two major projects in Southeast Asia: 2017 Taipei Summer Universiade and 2018 Asian Games” Thanks to the work of our commercial pool business consulting division, we were awarded two major projects in Southeast Asia: 2017 Taipei Summer Universiade (award worth EUR 5 million) and 2018 Asian Games Jakarta (for EUR 4 million). Both contracts are examples of the extensive capabilities of our group in the world of swimming pools and wellness. We have continued to innovate in new, more efficient and environmentally friendly products, such as Internet of Pools (Fluidra Connect), LumiPlus Design, the Neolysis process, AstralPool Mac, the range of Viron pumps or the large FreePool project that will be a watershed in indoor public swimming pools. Every year, we allocate around 1.5% of our consolidated sales to R&D&i, and these products and developments are the result of this investment. We seek solutions to the needs of our direct customers and so that the end user of a pool or wellness installation can get the most from the pool, making it more sustainable, efficient, increasing the time of enjoyment and at the lowest possible cost. Annual figures Fluidra’s sales at year-end 2016 stood at EUR 713.3 million, 10.2% higher than in 2015. The financial recovery of Spain, France, Australia and other mature markets, along with our restructuring efforts and strong financial discipline and a solid balance sheet enabled us to close this financial year with EBITDA growth of 19.1%, reaching EUR 86 million, which represented a 12.1% EBITDA margin on sales, higher than that of 2015 which stood at 11.2%. The company’s net profits stood at EUR 24.1 million, an increase of 85.2% compared to the previous year. In terms of balance sheet, the excellent performance across all items comprising net working capital should be noted. At the end of 2016, it stood at EUR 184 million, representing a net working capital to sales ratio of 25.8%. Free cash generation to the income statement was EUR 27.4 million. Net Financial Debt (NFD) reached EUR 156.6 million at the end of 2016. The multiple of NFD / EBITDA stood at 1.8, below 2.2x in 2015. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 16 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 Letter from the President B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v erna nc e 2016 A nne x e s 2016 was an excellent year. Markets welcomed our strong performance throughout the year. All in all, completing our 2018 Strategic Plan, the investments made throughout the year and the growth of our business in mature markets led to a 38% increase in Fluidra’s value in the markets, setting the closing price in 2016 at EUR 4.32 per share, while share liquidity increased alongside trading growth. Strategy for the future 2017 got off to a good start, on the back of the year just ended. And that gives us the certainty that the current year will be better for both Fluidra and the international economy as a whole. We have flexibility and financial strength, and a team of great professionals who are fully committed to this project. Therefore, we will continue working hard to achieve our profitability and efficiency goals, gaining market share in mature markets and aiming to become leaders in markets and in product categories in which we are not yet leaders. “We will continue working hard to achieve our profitability and efficiency goals, gaining market share in mature markets and seeking to lead those in which we are not the leading company” We focus on implementing our strategy, which is based on: • Showcasing swimming pool & wellness. • Ensuring our product categories penetrate in all countries in which we have a presence to increase our shares and leading position. • Implementing best practices that will allow us to increase our efficiency and profitability ratios. . Our commitments We will continue to uphold and increase our commitment to society and the environment, as well as to all our stakeholders, that is, within the framework of a truly sustainable economy. We will also continue to develop products and roll out projects that provide efficient, cutting-edge solutions to our customers. 17 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 Letter from the President B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v erna nc e 2016 A nne x e s This year, we established the Fluidra Foundation with the main objective of promoting responsible and sustainable use and enjoyment of water as a natural and essential resource for humankind, taking advantage of the group’s knowledge of water resources. Led by Joan Planes, founder and honorary president of Fluidra, the activities of the Fluidra Foundation are aligned with two basic commitments: a social commitment to projects aimed at accessibility, awareness and education on water use, and a cultural commitment focused especially on promoting music. In an effort to become leaders in sustainability and efficiency, our aim is to preserve water, a resource essential for life that is ever so scarce. The principles of the United Nations Global Compact inspire of our ethics and social responsibility. That is why we renew our commitment to the initiative for yet another year, as well as to these values as a guide on how to develop and walk towards a sustainable management. We want to be a global group offering sustainable and efficient pool solutions and applications. A leading company in the Pool & Wellness sector worldwide. Water is our world and our future.

Services and management The last link in Fluidra’s value chain is the provision of management services and functions both with regard to Group companies and also to customers and end users services so that in this way it may come full circle in the water business. In order to optimise the Group’s resources and allow each unit to focus on its specific part of the business, Fluidra offers shared services to centralise accounting and finance duties through the Shared Service Centre, as well as providing legal and tax services, marketing, auditing and human resources from the headquarters in Sabadell (Barcelona).

Two proposals in relation to the contents of the report were received through this channel: to incorporate direct feedback from customers (which has been taking place since 2014) and increased coverage of information, which is fulfilled in this report (see section About of the report) and which has plans to expand year after year until it reaches 100%. No key issues or problems were raised as unresolved or requiring attention during the dialogue between the company and the various stakeholders throughout the year. How Fluidra is perceived from the outside In response to the 2016 Reporta Report, which analyses the quality of information and of the reporting of those companies listed on the Spanish continuous market, Fluidra continues to climb positions in the ranking of assessment reports. In the last report, Fluidra entered the Top 10, ranking eighth, becoming once again the top company in terms of reporting quality outside Ibex-35, improving its score by 6.9 points, which allowed it to climb 14 positions. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 28 4 Strategy Market environment 30 Strategic priorities 33 Priorities and financial objectives 35 Future outlook 37 29 Market 4.1 environment Xavier Tintoré Corporate General Manager The world is going through a period of great uncertainty marked by many changes: the UK decided to leave the European Union; there is a new president in the United States; and Europe has major upcoming elections in key countries in 2017. Alongside these geopolitical movements, global GDP growth forecasts for 2017 are lower than those achieved in 2016.

Outlook in Spain The International Monetary Fund (IMF) continues to rely on the Spanish economy and the forecast launched in the last quarter of 2016; Spain is still the fastest growing economy in the entire Eurozone. After a year of political uncertainty, Spain has managed to form a government and the agreements are expected to materialise soon, both in terms of budgetary and deficit control to meet the requirements of the European Union, as in the measures to create jobs and maintain attractive and sustainable levels of future GDP growth. The set of leading indicators confirms the good performance of the Spanish economy and predicts a positive 2017: the number of members of Social Security and private consumption is on the rise, the price index of commodities is also positive, car sales and new mortgages have gone up and bank lending to households is increasingly growing. Uncertainties in Europe and in the US The hike in economic activity in the whole of the European Union has been positive, while Italy generated some uncertainty: the results of the referendum and the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mateo Renzi, which can translate into a few months of high volatility, compounded by negotiations between Britain and the European Union for the quick implementation of Brexit. Besides the impact these facts may have on the stock market, the region will be keeping an eye on inflation, employment levels, the price of oil, the rise of populism in both ideologies, terrorist threats, immigration and international geopolitical unrest. In this scenario, the implementation of the European Central Bank policy should serve to calm down the stock markets in both Europe and other international markets. In early 2017, the United States became an unknown player, as expectation rises to see how President Donald Trump runs and implements his policies and how they will affect global growth. 31 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l Strategy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 Anne x e s Disparity in GRO W T H EURO Z ONE emerging markets Despite an apparent slowdown, the structural reforms the government is implementing 1.5-1.7 in China to modernise the economy point towards a positive trend.

GRO W T H GD P C H INA 6.9 % 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 32 Strategic 4.2 priorities Fluidra presented its 2018 Strategic Plan in 2015, which is its roadmap for profitable growth. The construction of new pools in 2015 reached a turning point after several years of decline originated with the onset of the 2008 crisis, while forecasts pointed to a gradual improvement. In 2016, the number of existing pools in the world was approaching 15.6 million and the number of new pools grew approximately 330,000, which attests to the recovery of the sector. Fluidra’s business model allows it to benefit from recurring revenues from the existing pool park, as well as from the recovery of newly built pools. The company estimates that 70% of the business is related with the maintenance and care of the pool park and the remaining 30% with new construction. The group’s international expansion has made it possible to develop a network covering almost all of the world’s park pools, excluding the United States. The 2018 Strategic Plan consists of three main pillars: focus, penetration and best practices. Fluidra has placed its focus on the Pool & Wellness sector, it has increased its market penetration through its international subsidiaries and it has implemented best practices in key areas such as sales, manufacturing and logistics in all countries where it operates. 2018 Strategic Plan Focus on Pool Market & Wellness penetration Best Practices 33 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l Strategy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 Anne x e s Focusing on Pool & Wellness allows Fluidra to strengthen its position as sector leader worldwide. Fluidra’s strategy is to deploy its business model and product policy internationally to meet the demand of each market. This represents, for both residential and commercial swimming pools, the introduction of new, more efficient products which provide added value to the user, with a clear commitment to innovation. Fluidra will concentrate its efforts on deeper penetration in markets where it already has a presence. The goal is to gain market share using the company’s extensive product portfolio. The company identified six Best Practices within the organisation, in key areas which are being transferred to all countries where it already operates and to all business areas of the company.

The turnover of EUR 713 million and the growth achieved place Fluidra closer to the target set for 2018. In addition, this higher volume is making it possible to reach higher EBITDA levels, which also bring the company closer to achieving the plan’s targets. The ratios of working capital use are already better than those established for 2018, which proves the rigour employed in the company’s capital management. These indicators forecast that Fluidra can anticipate by one year the achievement of the 2018 Strategic Plan. Fluidra expects to continue with its profitable growth which combines organic and inorganic growth, maintaining financial strength of the group with net debt below 2x EBITDA, providing a payout to shareholders of around 50%. 35 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l Strategy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 Anne x e s INVICTUS PROJECT The INVICTUS Project, which began in 2014, is a new operational model which aims to align all Fluidra processes with a global perspective and focus its efforts on tasks that add value. The aim of the project is to continue competing at the highest level in an increasingly demanding multinational environment, and be the best option for customers, exceeding their expectations. INVICTUS’ keys to achieve the above are process standardisation, Information Technology system integration and the creation of a common database for the whole company. During 2016, INVICTUS had three major progresses: start of activies in the first sales company (Fluidra Portugal), in the first manufacturing company (Metalast) and the creation and start of activities of Fluidra Global Distribution. Fluidra Global Distribution The mission of Fluidra Global Distribution is to centralise into a single location the purchase and supply of commercial enterprises, both for third-party suppliers and own factories of the group, with the aim of providing a better service to customers and becoming their best choice, through simplifying the model, standardising processes and improving stock control, the order book and commercial assistance provided. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 36 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l Strategy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 Anne x e s Future 4.4 outlook The new CSR Master Plan proposes 32 goals, 54 measures and 60 actions, all to be developed between 2017 and 2020 2017-2020 CSR Master Plan In 2016, we worked on defining the new CSR Master Plan with 2020 as a deadline, thus aligned with the Corporate Strategic Plan.

In this respect, the directors are required to observe the following performance standards in all cases: • The directors must notify the Board of Directors of the existence of conflicts of interest, and refrain from attending and participating in any deliberation affecting the issues in which they may have a vested interest, directly or indirectly, through related third parties. Any resolutions that may affect their status as directors, such as their appointment or removal from the Board of Directors or other similar ones, are excluded from the obligation to refrain. • The directors may not use the Company’s name or act in their capacity as directors to carry out transactions on their own behalf or for related parties. • The directors may not directly or indirectly carry out professional or commercial transactions with the Company unless the conflict of interest is reported beforehand and the Board approves the transaction. • Transactions that are performed as part of the Company’s regular course of business and that are of a habitual and recurring nature may be carried out providing the Board of Directors has issued a general authorisation to do so. The internal regulations of Fluidra sets performance criteria of directors in case of conflicts of interest • The directors must disclose direct or indirect participation that either they or any related parties carry out in other companies whose purpose is the same as, or similar or complementary to that of the Company. • Similarly, the directors may not participate, either on their own behalf or on behalf of others, in companies whose business activity is the same as, or similar or complementary to the type of business activity carried out by the Company; may not hold offices as directors or executives of companies that compete with the Company, with the exception of the posts they might hold, if applicable, in a Group company, unless expressly authorised by the Shareholders at their General Meeting, without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 227 to 229 of the Companies Law. • The directors may not make use of Company assets or use their position in the Company to obtain an economic advantage unless they have paid an appropriate compensation. • The directors may not benefit themselves or on behalf of a related party from a business opportunity of the Company, unless it has previously been offered to the Company and the latter has waived its right to do take it. • Conflicts of interest involving the directors must be included in the report. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 50 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s Governance Committees [ G 4 38 ] Audit Committee The Regulations of the Board of Directors stipulate that the Audit Committee, appointed by the Board of Directors, is formed by a minimum of 3 directors, exclusively non-executive directors, two of whom, at least, must be independent directors, and one of whom is to be appointed taking into account his/her expertise and experience in accounting, auditing or in both. The members of the Audit Committee, and particularly its Chairperson, must be appointed taking into account their expertise and experience in accounting, auditing and risk management, as well as their expertise, skills and experience with regard to other Committee tasks. In any case, the Chairperson must be an independent director to be replaced every four years, with the possibility of being re-elected after one year from the date of replacement. At present, Fluidra, in compliance with the provisions of its internal regulations, has an Audit Committee consisting of 4 members, two of whom are independent, its Chairperson being one of the two independent members. The last change in the composition of the Committee, adopted on 1 December 2015, was the acceptance of the resignation of Mr. Juan Planes Vila as a member thereof and as a result of his resignation as director of the Company. Main duties include: • Monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control of the Company and in particular the Financial Reporting Internal Control, internal audit and risk management systems, including risk analysis for environmental matters. • Reviewing the Company’s accounts, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and the appropriate implementation of accounting principles. • Supervising compliance with the audit agreement, ensuring that the opinion regarding the Financial Statement and the main contents of the auditing report are drawn up clearly and accurately, and evaluating the results of each audit. • Reviewing compliance with the Internal Code of Conduct and Regulations of the Board.

There is also an additional remuneration for those Directors who are part of any of the Board Committees, namely the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee and the Appointments and Compensation Committee. The maximum remuneration amount that Fluidra can provide its Directors for such items is determined by the General Shareholders’ Meeting, under the condition that the amount is a reflection of the effective professional performance of the same and of the benchmark with the market. A benchmark study on the remuneration of Fluidra’s directors compared to the Spanish market to objectify their compensation took place in 2016. In compliance with the international recommendations of Good Corporate Governance (proxy advisors), in 2012, it was decided to dissociate the remuneration of the Board from the performance of the organisation through variable remuneration, so there is currently no variable concept in the remuneration structure of the Board [G 4 5 2 ] , except the Executive President, who, together with his management team, have part of their remuneration linked to various economic performance indicators, and also to the strategic management objectives of company. (For additional information see p. 23 of the Regulations of the Board of Directors). Annually, the Annual Report on remuneration of directors is subjected to a vote of the General Shareholders’ Meeting; this report includes information about the remuneration policy of the Company for the current year and for future years, a comprehensive summary on how the remuneration policy was applied during the previous financial year and the breakdown of the individual remunerations earned by each of the directors. In the last General Shareholders’ Meeting held on 3 May 2016, the item on the agenda concerning the advisory vote of the aforementioned Annual Report on remuneration of directors (Item 5) was adopted with 88,622,517 votes in favour, that is, 99.9995% of the votes, representing 78.6857% of the share capital. [G 4 -53] As for the wage gap between the highest paid member in the group (Executive President) and the average of the workforce in 2016, a ratio of 15 times was established. Wage increases in the group are set annually based on performance evaluation of individuals.

The first inspires and defines the day to day conduct of all employees of Fluidra and the second works as guidelines for social responsibility and sustainability in the supply chain. People Values The Code of Ethics is a reflection of the values and principles that should guide the conduct of all companies which belong to the Fluidra group. The Code of Ethics was created by Fluidra in 2008 and was last updated in 2015. Its implementation is binding on all persons and directors of the Fluidra Group, regardless of the position or role they hold (including administrative bodies, managerial positions and other supervisory bodies), ensuring a responsible ethical behaviour and compliance with the law. The Code of Ethics does not replace or abrogate the existing legislation in each country or at the international level, whether in terms of administrative, civil, criminal, labour or commercial law, or the internal company regulations or binding collective agreements. Fluidra encourages all its members to consult with their supervisors, or with the Committee set up to promote the use of the Code of Ethics or through the Confidential Channel, on any situation in which they may have questions about whether their own actions or that of third parties could infringe the ethical principles established. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 56 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s Commitments acquired through People Values With society and Human Rights: commitment to respect the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With employees and governing bodies: commitment to implement and enforce existing labour laws, and create work environments where respect, equality and safety prevail, with particular emphasis on promoting transparency and fighting corruption and money laundering. With stakeholders: commitment towards respectful behaviour and vocation to serve shareholders, consumers, suppliers, public authorities and competitors. With the environment: commitment to environmental preservation and respect for the balance of natural systems, geared towards minimal and rational use of resources and in-depth knowledge of applicable regulations. With current legislation: commitment to ensure that the company and its employees comply with current laws and regulations and to promote compliance thereof. 57 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s So that the ‘People Values’ Code of Ethics is not just a mere declaration of intent, there are several mechanisms that disseminate, promote and ensure its implementation and enforcement, namely: the Ethics Committee, the Confidential Channel, a training activity and a disciplinary system when failing to comply with the law and ethical principles. Ethics Committee The Ethics Committee consists of the Human Resources, Internal Audit and Legal divisions. The Ethics Committee receives, examines and responds to inquiries, complaints or allegations raised by employees, customers, suppliers or others. All requests or communications regarding incidents are handled with confidentiality and respect for all parties involved. The Ethics Committee reports to the Audit Committee, the governing body reporting directly to the Board of Directors. C o n f i d e n t i a l C h a n n e l [G4-5 8 ] The Confidential Channel is available on the corporate website, at Fluidra’s intranet in the Living Fluidra section and by email at peoplevalues@fluidra.com, which is available to all employees, customers, suppliers or other stakeholders. Through an online form or via email they can make inquires, ask for advice or report an incident. All communications are handled confidentially and care is taken when making any 9 decision always respecting the people involved. In 2016, nine queries were recorded through this channel. Once examined and evaluated, they did not lead to complaints on human rights violations, corruption or discrimination. [G 4HR 3. G4HR 12, G4SO5] There have not been any cases of violation of the rights of indigenous peoples. [G4-HR8 ] Confidential Training Channel consultations Fluidra conveys its ‘People Values’ Code of Ethics to all employees through a compulsory online training course, or attending training sessions where a physical copy of the document is handed out. The aim of this courses is to inform all employees about Fluidra’s values and reflect on the importance of ethical standards that will help them in the development of their daily activities. In addition, as permanent support for dissemination and clarification of doubts, a number of posters have been created and hung in several of the group’s facilities. They also created several links that lead directly to the Code of Ethics or the Confidential Channel, both from the corporate website www.fluidra.com, como desde el portal de noticias www.livingfluidra.fluidra.com and from the intranet. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 58 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s Suppliers’ Code of Ethics The actions of suppliers and providers of materials operating outside the scope of the group’s internal control are monitored by Fluidra. To this end, Fluidra has implemented a Supplier Code of Ethics since 2011 which is specific to its supply chain. The provisions of this Code are present in the approval process of new suppliers, their membership is automatically implemented by the general clauses in all corporate agreements. For those cases where there is no explicit agreement, an informative clause in the ordering system was included in 2015. In addition, a specific section containing the Supplier Code of Ethics has been created on Fluidra’s website. Thus, any supplier can check it at any time, even before starting a commercial relationship with Fluidra. Fluidra is aware that in addition to the commitment made by suppliers, it is necessary to implement control measures. In this sense, Fluidra is working to establish during next year protocols for action and appropriate follow-up to the high variability and types of providers.

Furthermore, the Corporate Compliance Programme contains the roles appearing in the Ethical Framework section of this report, with some other important roles worth noting: • Compliance Coordinating Committee: This committee is composed of the Sales and Operations General Manager and by Human Resources, Internal Audit, and Legal Counsel representatives. Its main functions are: (I) to ensure that the Compliance Programme is properly developed, (ii) to promote the development of policy standards and procedures, (iii) to collaborate on any necessary research to support the Ethics Committee. • Policies, rules and procedures: It refers to the regulatory body that defines and specifies the lines of conduct to be taken by employees of Fluidra Group. The group is developing new policies, rules or procedures that apply to all workers. A section on the intranet called “Policies and Procedures” has also been created. It contains all regulations that employees must follow. • Training plan: Fluidra is developing a training plan to ensure that all employees are given sufficient training in all areas applicable to them, especially in relation to those areas where there is a greater risk of committing crimes. Programme implementation Fluidra has developed an implementation plan of the Corporate Compliance Programme in the different group companies. The implementation shall be performed gradually, in stages and levels. The implementation plan will begin in Spain, Australia, the USA, France and the UK throughout 2017. External validation In September 2016, an external auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers) issued an expert report certifying that Fluidra S.A. has a reasonable control environment to prevent crimes which imply criminal liability to the legal person. That is, Fluidra has a Corporate Compliance programme. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 60 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s Risk management [G4-14, G4-44, G4-45, 5.4 G4-46, G4-47] The efficient management of potential risks is essential for proper development, The analysis of achieving objectives and the future plan of any company.

Committee for supervision The duties of the Audit Committee regarding Risk Management include: and approval • Identifying the different types of risk (strategic, operational, financial, legal, reputational and accidental), including –among financial and economic risks– contingent liabilities and other off-balance risks. • Identifying the measures in place to mitigate the impact of identified risks, should they materialise. • Verifying and monitoring the Corporate Risk Map as a tool to identify, manage and follow up on risks with significant impact on the Group’s objectives. The different risks are identified and assessed based on an analysis of the events that may trigger them. The assessment is performed using metrics that calculate likelihood and impact. Existing controls are put in place in order to mitigate such risks and any additional necessary action plans are implemented if the above controls are deemed insufficient. Through this process, which is conducted annually and coordinated by Internal Audit, the Company’s Risk Map may be outlined. The map provides the most significant risks, along with the main variations from the previous year, which are then presented to the Audit Committee for discussion and approval. 61 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s The definition of the scale of severity and the scale of likelihood is performed according to qualitative and quantitative criteria. Once critical risks are identified and reassessed, the Company’s senior management officers devise specific measures, appointing those in charge of their implementation as well as the time frames allocated, so as to mitigate the risks’ impact and likelihood, while reviewing the current controls in place on such risks. The analysis of risks, controls and measures to mitigate their impact and likelihood is presented annually to the Audit Committee for supervision and approval.

In 2011, Fluidra acquired Aqua group, a leading company in the world of robotic pool-cleaners with presence in the US and Israeli market. Growth forecasts and penetration in the US market have not reached the levels initially expected. Likewise, the value in use of the cash-generating unit resulting from the acquisition of Aqua group does not cover the value of the net assets and goodwill assigned, so an impairment in the Goodwill resulting from the purchase ensued reducing it to EUR 1.5 million.

Following the outcome of the referendum on the membership to the European Union held in the UK on 23 June 2016, there have been immediate consequences such as the devaluation of the pound sterling. Although we find that Fluidra’s operations in the UK have grown at double-digit in local currency, there is a drop in sales value and investments (assets and liabilities) when consolidated in EUR, while no significant impact has been observed at the moment thanks to the actions taken by Fluidra’s Management team. The company continues to monitor both the UK’s economy and the market and competitors to act in an appropriate manner given the current uncertainties. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 62 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy Corporate Governance 2016 A nne x e s Table of main risks I [ G 4 45 ] Monitoring of and response plans for Fluidra’s main risks.

The evolution of the turnover has been very positive on European markets, although it has been affected by the devaluation of the pound sterling. In the rest of the world, growth has also been remarkable, slowed only by China and supported by the acquisition of Waterlinx in South Africa, by the sales growth in the US and the strong performance 713.3 in Australia. M€ By business areas, the main player of the good performance of the figures is residential pool, which has increased in sales by 16.4%, together with 13.6% of the water treatment family. To contextualise the sales figures, we must take into account three events occurred during the year: the impact of Waterlinx, acquired in July 2015; the acquisition of Sibo in 2016, which has contributed EUR 7.5 million ; and disinvestment in November 2016 in Calderería Plástica del Norte, whose sales in December 2015 stood at EUR 0.2 million.

The improvement in EBITDA reflects a net profit attributable to the main company of EUR 24.1 million, almost double the EUR 13 million of 2015, which represents 3.4% on sales. In 2016 investment in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted, compared to 2015, by EUR 2.4 million , reaching a total of EUR 29.2 million. The growth is mainly due to an industrial reorganisation process launched in Australia and South Africa, as well as the implementation costs and licenses of the Invictus Project.

Commercial Pool: Engineering projects In 2016 Fluidra signed, among many other installation projects, two projects with which it strengthens its presence in Asia and its commitment to growth in Commercial Pool through the sale of engineering solutions, one of the growth drivers of the Strategic Plan. Fluidra won the tender for the design, supply and installation of the Olympic and training swimming pool for the 29th Summer Universiade championships to be held in Taipei (Taiwan) from 19 to 30 August 2017.

Following the publication of the year-end results in late February 2015, the shares rocketed in the stock market marking a clear trend for the whole year. At the end of May, coinciding with the celebration of MedCap Forum organised by BME in Madrid, the shares posted new highs in the stock market reaching a verticality that far from scaring investors, led them to trust even more in the growth potential of Fluidra. The share price suffered ups and downs throughout the year, both on the back of the news and the results published by the company, and the contagious effect of the general stock market movements and the markets in general. However, the level of EUR 4 per share underwent a strong consolidation. At year-end, as a result of a particular transaction of an investor, the share price dropped during several sessions, but quickly regained and exceed the level of EUR 4 per share.

At this moment of positive developments within Fluidra, it is essential to develop human resources policies that 4,336 bolster the business and add value to it, while meeting the training and development needs of people within the organisation, seeking mainly to strengthen the initiative and fostering the creativity of our team in order to successfully carry out Fluidra’s projects. It is worth mentioning the Group’s effort to maintain the level of quality employment, with a high percentage of staff with permanent contracts. In 2016, the percentage Average of permanent staff was still 93% of the aggregate workforce according to the report. workforce Fluidra continues to prioritise the hiring of staff based locally with regard to the geographical areas where the workplaces are located. In 2016, organisational changes to further adapt the organisational structure of the workforce to the growth strategy under the 2018 Strategic Plan were implemented. Part of the sales growth plan comes from acquisitions. Halfway through 2016, a company in northern Europe called SIBO was acquired, based in the Netherlands.

The average age of Fluidra’s workforce is close to 41 years of age. The age range with % the largest number of employees is 30-45, representing 53% of the total. [G4 L A1 ] There were a total of 328 staff redundancies throughout the year according to the report, of which 16.5 % were people over 45 years of age (of whom 22.2 % are women). In 2016, the rate of structural rotation (permanent staff ), including amortised and unamortised redundancies, stood at 4.7%, significantly lower than last year, which indicates that the company is growing in terms of employment. [G4 L A1 ] As for the minimum periods of notice for operational changes, there is no specific agreement with workers thus current legislation is applicable in each centre. [G4 L A4 ] Organisational Structure In order to adapt the organisation to the growth targeted by the company, during 2016 the so-called G-30 governing body remained operational. This body consists of key directors who implement the 2018 Strategic Plan. When analysing the age pyramid of our staff we see that the group Millennials represents 11.6 % of the total. This group compels us to rethink our policies to further adapt them to the interests and expectations of the group. Remuneration policy In 2016, the alignment of the remuneration system for the group of managers called G-100 began, incorporating the overall results of the group within the annual incentives system. The management policy by salary level, which helps improve internal equity and wage external competitiveness for remuneration matters, continued to be implemented. For yet another year, the minimum wage of newly recruited staff stood at around 30% above the minimum wage set for Spain in 2016, using as reference the lowest salary at Fluidra’s Spanish companies that represent most companies included in report.

In 2016, the number of companies with flexible remuneration came to a total of 22 (Spain), namely 95% of all the companies covered. This year, the percentage of adherence has increased significantly after having extended the programme to all the workforce, with 25% of employees taking out some type of product; health insurance being one of the most sought-after benefits.

This is the reason why Fluidra’s HR promotes the creation of their brand as a benchmark employer in the major markets where it operates. In addition, most employment proposals are launched through internal channels to enable employees to grow professionally. In 2016, the use of the new Predictive Index (P.I.) tool was adopted with the aim of finding and promoting talent.

The scope was expanded in 2016 to reach more people in the organisation. The system assesses both individual targets and key competencies for each role. In order to help new arrivals, a face-to-face training programme took place to introduce them to the system and to take advantage of the annual assessment process called One 2 One. In 2016, 37.8% of the workforce included the report had participated in this programme, with a 21.4% increase in the number of assessments over the previous year.

The forecast for 2017 is to implement the remaining two modules: Selection and Connection. The objective of this platform is to help managers streamline their team of collaborators and the employees have their own employee portal. During 2017, the platform will continue to be implemented in other companies outside Spain.

Training Managerial Skills courses Programme During the year, the Managerial Skills Programme for two groups of managers –one Spanish and one international– and middle managers continued. The same programme also kicked-off for middle management, in which two groups participated in 2016. This programme received very positively feedback from the participants. Business School This programme aims to improve the performance of Fluidra’s sales team and is based on three pillars: • Product knowledge through online courses. • Improved business skills with face-to-face sessions and experiential training. • Individual coaching for business managers. In 2016, the training course “Sales Skills” was provided to five commercial groups: one in Asia, one in Germany, one in the Middle East and India and two in Spain (Bilbao and Barcelona). As a result of this, 12% of Fluidra’s sales team has already been trained.

The Group companies’ policies on quality, safety and the environment place particular emphasis on the prevention of occupational hazards. In 2016, participating companies developed different training methods in safety and prevention. While commercial and corporate service companies have placed more focus on prevention of risks in offices and firefighting, training, industrial companies’ training has revolved around issues more specific to their commercial activity, namely courses on safety in freight transport, safety in the use of raised platforms, safety for work at heights and the use of electric pallet trucks, emergency planning, first aid, as well as conducting health and safety campaigns on their premises. In addition, an information and prevention policy whereby the results on accident monitoring and on internal safety inspections are notified through information boards has been implemented. 95 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 | Human Resources A nne x e s Each Group company in Spain has its own Risk Prevention Plan which provides regular risk assessments suited to its activity and job positions, and provides the necessary training to all staff, both internal and external. Prevention plans are usually rolled out through an external prevention service which is implemented by the Prevention coordinators, the Prevention delegates and the Health and Safety Committees of each company. Thus, proper detection and control of risks as well as compliance with prevention plans and monitoring of the corrective measures being implemented are ensured. As for the staff relocated abroad, although the international mobility policy does not make specific reference to risks, diseases and serious accident training, it provides information and advice on these issues in a specific and direct manner. Employees who travel frequently have emergency health insurance policies and those in longterm assignments abroad have health insurance policies that cover medical contingencies for the duration of the stay. Equality, diversity and work-life balance Fluidra has an equality and diversity policy that contains the objectives, principles and responsibilities at the corporate level. In addition, each company adapts the general guidelines to its specific reality to its own processes and regulations. There are, for example, various Group companies that have their own Equality plans such as Fluidra Comercial España and Fluidra S.A. The goal for the coming years is to establish a Corporate Equality Plan linked to the Equality and Corporate Diversity Policy based on Fluidra’s S.A. Equality Plan. These policies ensure equal treatment between men and women, not differentiating between employees who perform the same functions and according to categories and positions. During 2016, records show that 47 and 30 people went on paternity and maternity leave respectively, all of whom returned at the end of their leave. [G4L A 1 3 ] Fluidra seeks to help its employees achieve work-life balance within a positive work environment and it does so by implementing measures tailored to the needs of the organisation and the staff. All employees enjoy the rights enshrined in the applicable labour regulations on flexible working hours, maternity leave, paternity leave and other labour rights.

Therefore, innovation is one of the fundamental pillars of the future strategy of the company, designed to identify and meet current and future customer needs as well as those of its stakeholders, through costeffective, efficient and sustainable innovation. In 2016, Fluidra invested 1.5% of total sales in R&D&i. Fluidra’s innovation model uses technological and market exploration to identify challenges and opportunities for innovation. Creativity and the generation of ideas enable opportunities in terms of knowledge which is protected or in specific projects that move on to the development stage, to finally be transformed into products and/or solutions that meet the needs of our customers. Monitoring the performance of products in the market is, in turn, an important source of information that feeds the different phases of the model.

Just as Fluidra strives to improve the quality of its products, it should also reduce time to market and improve business impact. This is a project that began in 2016 with three pilot cases and will continue during 2017 and 2018 until its implementation across all Fluidra Centres of Excellence and Technical Centres. 101 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 | Innovation A nne x e s One of the projects rolled out in 2016 was the review of the Strategic Plan for R&D&i to adapt it to the future needs of Fluidra.

External collaborators Another key element of the innovation structure is the extensive network of external collaborators made up of technology centres, universities and companies specialising in technology, among others, making it possible to promote the development of new products and solutions, to enable access to the latest technologies. Similarly, the participation of Fluidra in clusters such as the Catalan Water Partnership or sports industry cluster Indescat, and the Cluster for Advanced Materials (MAV) encourages contact with companies and related entities and bolsters innovation as well as the development of new products and solutions.

Activities and workshops As part of its goal of becoming the most innovative company in its industry, Fluidra promotes activities and workshops which use tools that foster creativity, identifying opportunities and challenges so that new solutions, products and services can be created. Specifically, a workshop to identify macro trends that may significantly impact the company’s business has been conducted, with the aim of exploring opportunities for innovation that can give birth and identify new innovation projects. Another activity that was launched during 2016 is to involve society in Fluidra’s innovative process. To this end, we have set in motion a contest called “Inventem el Futur de les Piscines” (Inventing the Future the Pools) which consists in involving educational centres in the innovation of the company. It specifically aims to foster creativity in primary education students and the innovation skills of vocational training students. Different educational centres have been selected, most notably those centres that are part of the Xarxa d’Escoles Creatives (Creative Schools Network), whom have been presented with an innovative challenge related to the needs of the company. In the first phase, the challenge is presented to primary schools so that the teams of students suggest ideas related to this challenge. In the second phase, the ideas selected are passed on to the teams of students from vocational training centres who will turn them into product proposals to be presented to Fluidra for evaluation.

An example of this effort is the construction of a facility in Poltank that will allow all Fluidra companies that may be interested to test and verify that the filters meet the European standard EN 16713, which defines the filtration requirements for residential pool, and demands that the filter performance is measured, among other parameters. For over 14 years, Fluidra has actively participated in various standardisation committees in which the different rules that apply to the sector and affect both the product and the facilities are discussed and defined. A project for Industrial Doctoral Students was launched in 2016 jointly with the UPC’s CIM Foundation, and with the support of Catalonia’s Department of Economy and Knowledge development of a design methodology for manufacturing in-demand high-variability pieces with additive technologies. Throughout 2016, several pilot projects were developed, which have involved different Fluidra Centres of Excellence with the aim of proving the feasibility of integrating Additive Manufacturing technologies, both in production processes and in product development. Among the projects that have been initiated, it is worth mentioning those related to the following: • Rapid tooling: design and manufacture of moulds and tools for short ranges and mould validation. • Rapid manufacturing: design and manufacture of final parts of low demand, complex geometry parts and product customisations. 105 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 | Innovation A nne x e s In recent months, Fluidra has continued the process of improving usability, energy efficiency and reducing noise level in its range of pumps, with solutions already applied in KIVU and Victoria Plus Silent. The product improvements are the result of working with new materials, using the latest plastic that allow better dimensional stability, and use of mechanical and hydraulic calculation programmes by finite element, reducing friction and failures due to dimensional errors. Similarly, Fluidra continues to work closely with engine suppliers to improve the product and use new technologies in drives, as well as in quality control processes. Thanks to its redesign processes, Fluidra has managed to increase the energy efficiency of the pumps by up to 15%. [G4EN 7] Industry 4.0 Fluidra has started the path towards Industry 4.0: integrating Additive Manufacturing technologies, along with digitisation and intensive use of internet, among other technologies, which will lead to smarter and more eco-friendly industrial plants and processes, and to supply chains and markets that are much better interconnected. Protection of Intellectual Property (IP) From corporate R&D&i monitoring and scouting of technology are coordinated together with the management and protection of the portfolio of intangible assets (patents and trademarks), and training for the different CoEs on issues concerning the protection of such intangible assets throughout the value chain. For the development and launch of new products, the group has implemented a number of internal processes that incorporate the review of the potential risks of infringement of third party rights. In addition, regular monitoring of the specific technologies that are of interest to the group as well as those of the main competitors are carried out for any possible IP protection application that may be relevant. The group also has various internal processes such as creation and alignment of policies so that group policies are aligned to the legal changes regarding trade secret regulations. Fluidra has a Trademark Committee, consisting of the heads of marketing, communication and intellectual property who meet once a month to discuss the strategy for the group’s trademarks, optimising the current portfolio and other issues related to trademarks and domains. In 2016, there were no litigation or sale bans against Fluidra products.

The year was marked by a decline in world prices of listed commodities (oil, gas, metals), especially in the first few months of the year. However, other factors such as the gradual recovery of demand as well as the OPEC agreement in November which limited oil production, have raised the price of these commodities. For example, the price of the Brent barrel rose from $ 28 a barrel in January to $ 56 a barrel in late December. Likewise, electricity and gas prices followed a similar trend, decreasing for the first three months of the year to reach all-time lows in March-April, then rebounding gradually the rest of the year.

The new supplier supplies type A green energy, certified by the Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia (National Commission on Financial Markets and 38 Competition) from 100% renewable sources, to the 55 supply points of the group in Spain, which will contribute significantly to reducing the carbon footprint of the % Fluidra group in the coming years. In terms of energy, Fluidra has continued to improve the efficiency of most plants and consumption points of the group in Spain, where energy consumption growth was below production growth. This improvement is the result of the measures and investments implemented from energy audits conducted in 2014. As a key milestone for 2016, Royal Decree 56/2016 on energy efficiency, forced companies that met certain volume and consumption requirements to conduct energy efficiency audits. Fluidra, as a business group, fell within the specific conditions of the Royal Decree, and so met all required energy audits to cover 85% of total consumption. The implementation of the Group’s policy on vehicles continues to generate reductions in emissions as the vehicles with maturity in the financial year are renewed for vehicles with lower emission levels than the previous ones. Improving the sustainability of the vehicle fleet is one of the points to be addressed within Fluidra’s CSR Master Plan. An important aspect worth highlighting in 2016 is that, from the agreements with the corporate travel management company, the group incorporated in the calculation the carbon footprint emissions attributable to Fluidra as a result of the movement of its employees. Purchase and approval policy Fluidra has continued to develop the suppliers policy in line with the commitments of honesty and integrity that define the group.

Due to environmental legislation demands, some of the Group companies must submit Waste Reduction Plans on packaging to the regional authority’s competent body. Among the measures implemented to minimise the environmental impact generated by the product, the following stand out: • Reduction of the amount of single-use packaging waste on the market, increasing the proportion of recyclable packaging in relation to non-recyclable ones and using, –as far as possible– recycled materials and containers whose physical properties or characteristics provide for recovery and recycling. (Sacopa) • Reusable plastic boxes replacing cardboard boxes and internal transport of components between warehouses (Prelast, Cepex). • Reuse of wooden pallets of raw materials for internal use. (Poltank, Cepex) • Reuse of cardboard boxes that are received with equipment from suppliers and customers which are used to pack and ship. (Idegis, Cepex) • Reduction of the packaging size (cardboard, etc.). (Manufacturas GRE). • Increasing the number of boxes per pallet in the shipments of some items. (Manufacturas GRE).

Similarly, other companies reuse water for production purposes, these waters often come from water for cleaning equipment, water recovered from decanters or press filters, among others (Inquide) or they reuse the water for pool testing (Manufacturas GRE). • Inquide reuses water for cleaning machinery for production, water from decanters, water recovered from the press filter Wastewater Treatment Station (WWTS) and water from the evaporation plant (condensed). In 2016, water consumption was reduced given that only 2,800 hours of work were completed at ATCC compared to 3,900 hours of work in 2015. • Following the saving and environmental sustainability policy of the company, ATH has a water tank with a pressure pump to perform hydraulic tests on the product. With this initiative, ATH achieves estimated savings for each hydraulic test of around 150-300 litres. • Poltank continues to perform consumption checks to detect leaks. • Cepex reused decalcification water for toilet cisterns. • Although there were leaks in some of the circuits this year (Prelast) as well as an increase in consumption (Cepex), this has not significantly influenced the final result, which has been reduced. Inquide, located in Monzón, is the only Group company that holds a special system of surface water intake from the Ebro river basin for sanitation, domestic and industrial use. Industrial demand for the Ebro basin is 470 Hm3, of which 258 correspond to industries not connected to municipal networks. During 2016, Inquide channelled 0.0279 Hm3 representing 0.0059%. During 2015, it channelled 0.0399 Hm3, which represents 0.0084%. This decrease is due to the fact that working hours at the ATCC plant were 2,800, compared to 3,900 hours of work in 2015.

Hence, the company provides a questionnaire to the readers of this Integrated Report to assess its usefulness and suggest improvements. You may access it on the following link: Rate this report http://bit.ly/Survey_Integrated_Report_2016 With regard to the assessment of the past 2015 Integrated Report, the response level has been below expectations. In general terms, respondents have expressed a highly satisfactory assessment, which encourages us to follow along the same lines and continue to develop. As for the question as to whether Fluidra is well positioned compared to other listed companies in relation to the quality of the report, the answers were affirmative in all cases.

From the perspective of vertical integration, we define groups of companies based on: • Production companies, whose aim is the manufacture of finished products from raw materials. • Commercial and logistic companies, which specialise in distribution and placing the finished product on the market. • Service and management companies, which support Group companies and, in some cases, other companies outside the scope of Fluidra. From a horizontal integration perspective, Fluidra companies are defined based on their sector of activity: plastics, chemical, metallurgical, glass, product assembly and technology, commercial, transport and logistics and management services companies. Due to this complexity, in order to determine the materiality of Fluidra, a comprehensive approach must be adopted. This year, Fluidra carried out a study among its stakeholders in order to further analyse the materiality of the group. The process consisted of a round of random surveys to shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees and associations in the social field: a total of 500 were sent with a response rate of 28%. The study focused on aspects related to the environment, the economy, good working practices and decent work, human rights, society and product responsibility. The questionnaire was distributed as follows: firstly, respondents were asked on the degree of relevance they gave to certain aspects, in particular within each of the major areas of sustainability; secondly, they were asked to indicate whether they thought that Fluidra should take more measures in its action on specific issues in each area. From the score of those issues that the stakeholders identified as highly relevant, along with the corporate valuation of the material aspects for the Fluidra Group, a threshold of 50 points was established to determine the material aspects reflected in the materiality table next to the score matrix of the issues analysed. 2016 INTEGRATED REPORT 158 M ai n fi g u r e s fo r 2 0 1 6 L e t t e r f ro m t he P re s i d e nt B u si n e ss mo d e l S t ra t e gy C o r p o r ate G o v e rna nc e 2016 Annexes Mat eriality table Aspect Topic Section Economy Economic performance Results for the year Economy Acquisition practices Results for the year Environment Materials Environmental management Environment Energy Environmental management Environment Water Environmental management Environment Emissions Environmental management Environment Effluent and waste Environmental management Environment Regulatory Compliance MA Environmental management Environment Transport Environmental management Environment General MA Environmental management Environment MA assessment of suppliers Suppliers Environment Complaint mechanisms in MA Environmental management Work Employment Human Resources Work Employees-Management Relationship Human Resources Work Health and safety at work Human Resources Work Skills and training Human Resources Work Diversity and equal opportunities Human Resources Work Equal pay for women and men Human Resources Work Assessment of Internship in Sup.
