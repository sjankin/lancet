This impressive growth inevitably increased its impact on the economy and the society rapidly. At the same time, INTRALOT seeks to match its business growth with intensive efforts to implement and promote responsible operation practices, committed to implement a long-term strategy of Corporate Responsibility, in order to address its impact and support the Company’s ultimate goal to serve its Stakeholders and create value for them. One of INTRALOT’s primary objectives is to ensure the integrity of the products and services offered and to enable players and the society to make informed and responsible choices. To this end, the Company adheres to Responsible Gaming international standards and principles and offers secure, reliable and transparent products and services to gaming markets around the world according to the Responsible Gaming Framework Certification for Associate members by the World Lottery Association (WLA) for its global lottery operations, as a result of INTRALOT’s products and services and sound Responsible Gaming practices adopted and implemented. I am very pleased to say that we have come a long way since INTRALOT published its first Corporate Responsibility Report in 2011. As INTRALOT embarks on its 5th year of Corporate Responsibility reporting, the Company strives to ensure that the focus for its Stakeholders is directly linked with its strategic priorities. It is my hope and belief that the present Report will improve INTRALOT’s practices related to Corporate Responsibility and benefit from feedback we will receive from all Stakeholders. SOKRATIS P. KOKKALIS Chairman, INTRALOT Group Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 5 Message from the CEO Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 6 The gaming industry undergoes rapid changes, as regulatory frameworks evolve to eliminate illegal activities while new technologies create new consumer trends, requirements and opportunities. The expansion of the regulated market has a direct impact on the increase of social benefits deriving from the dividends collected for good causes by the vast majority of INTRALOT clients. In this environment INTRALOT maintained solid business performance facilitated by the Company’s robust international presence and its commitment to innovation. The Company continued its successful business strategy within 2015, based on its focus to incorporate consumer trends, new communication and delivery channels to its products and services portfolio, as well as foster new partnerships for responsible and sustainable growth. As a global leader in the gaming industry, Corporate Responsibility constitutes a fundamental corporate principle for INTRALOT, which embraces its operations and influences its activities and initiatives to address economic, environmental and societal issues. In order to continue and remain transparent, the 5th Corporate Responsibility Report places a higher emphasis to conduct a structured and systematic Materiality Analysis. Through this procedure, INTRALOT was able to holistically examine issues related to its responsible operation, ensure that the Report focuses on the most important issues and set its commitments. In addition to this, the Report ratifies the company’s commitment for sustainable leadership while promoting the UN Global Compact principles. INTRALOT has prepared its 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report according to the Global Reporting Initiative’s G4 Guidelines. Through the Report, which constitutes the compass that reveals where the Company is at the moment, INTRALOT describes both its qualitative and quantitative achievements, as well as areas where it has to strive further, in order to fully meet its planned objectives. Among others within 2015, the Company:  Addressed 11 Stakeholder groups.  Communicated the Code of Conduct to 100% of its employees.  Informed 100% of its employees about Responsible Gaming principles and policies.  Employed 100% of its employees with permanent employment contracts.  Increased the number of participants in customer training programs by 235%.  Generated over €1 billion of shared value for its Stakeholders at Group level, with €77 million being in Greece. I am confident that the present Corporate Responsibility Report will signal and accelerate necessary improvements in the Company’s reporting practices and responsible operation. Therefore, the Report aims to evoke discussion and feedback that is necessary to take INTRALOT’s performance to the next level, in order to coordinate the measures and commitments already undertaken even more effectively in the next years and continue focusing on the issues that are of particular relevance to the Company and its Stakeholders.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 8 The Gaming Industry The gaming industry appears to have sustainable future growth prospects, as regulatory initiatives fuel the global gaming market’s growth. In order to meet the increased spending demand, regulators have liberalized gaming markets (mainly in internet and mobile), privatized state-owned lotteries and introduced measures to tackle illegal gaming. The gaming market addressed by INTRALOT includes lottery games, sports betting, horse racing, gaming machines, interactive gaming and other activities, such as bingo, without including casinos and Native American gaming. The following table displays the GGY (Gross Gaming Yield) in each segment, according to data from Global Betting and Gaming Consultancy (CBGC), which provides consultancy, data and market reports for the global gaming industry.

Amounts in billion US dollars Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 9 Lottery games are the most traditional gaming segment and have historically attracted the largest number of players. The segment is estimated to have contributed 31.2% of the total global gaming market in 2015 (US$134.2 billion), supported by a shift towards operations outsourcing and privatization. According to GBGC’s forecasts, the segment is expected to grow at slightly below historical levels, with South and Central America as the primary expansion drivers. At the same time, the betting segment, which is estimated to have accounted for 14.1% of the global gaming market in 2015 (US$60.8 billion), is also expected to grow at near historical levels. According to the 2013 GBGC Global Gambling Forecasts, 8.9% of the total global gaming market activity (US$38.3 billion) is estimated to have been performed online, which includes betting (48.4%), casinos (18.9%), poker (12.3%), state lotteries (11%), bingo (6.4%) and skill and other gaming (3.0%). The global online market has recently benefited from growing sales in connected electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablet PCs. As a result, the share of mobiles as an online channel is expected to increase, since there is growing demand for mobile sports book and interactive betting. However, not all jurisdictions are on the same stage of their development cycle and are, therefore, subject to their own distinct dynamic. The main drivers of the development cycle include:  The introduction of stable and clear regulatory regimes, which have proved to favor operators and provide additional security to players. The various regulatory initiatives aim to improve the gaming perception as an entertainment activity, taking into account Stakeholders’ interests, wider private operators’ involvement and consumers’ interest in entertainment and chance to win.  The product innovation, which is evident from the attention to players’ end-to-end experience. As a result, new business models and products focus more on the growing consumer demand for entertainment, personalization of game offerings and content, as well as data mining and customer analytics. Gaming providers aim to deliver a unified customer experience by converging land-based and interactive channels, as a result of the technology convergence and customers’ desire for an ‘all-in-one’ gaming platform.  The market’s liberalization, which is often reflected in the legalization and opening of a new market, such as the online gaming market. As a result, legal operators and consumers operate within a regulated environment.  The privatization of activities, which represents a significant opportunity for private operators, due to the increasing trend from governments to outsource their lotteries’ operation or management. It must be noted that state-run lotteries contribute to approximately 78% of global lottery sales (including instant tickets and excluding KENO) at the moment, with privately managed or licensed operators accounting for the remaining.

Due to the nature of the industry, gaming companies are exposed to certain risks, which can be outlined below: RISKS IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY Source Level of Risk Political and regulatory environment in each jurisdiction, especially concerning decisions on behalf of governments that can affect financial performance, public procurement and licensing rules or High processes Increased regulation that may be required due to the potentially negative publicity associated with High problem and excessive gaming Legal framework and legal risks associated with the national and international legislation, regarding issues such as minors’ protection, violation of jurisdictional prohibitions, money laundering, fraud and High corruption Impact from illegal gaming activities to the regulated industry’s revenues High Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 26 Source Level of Risk Conditions of the macroeconomic environment, which directly affect business aspects such as credit, High interest rates and foreign exchange rates Volatility of players’ spending on gaming entertainment High Constantly changing taxation schemes in various jurisdictions Moderate Diversity of social, cultural and religious profiles of the population in foreign countries Moderate Possibility that participation in games may result into a pathological addictive behavior, with severe Moderate personal, economic and social consequences RISKS in the GAMING INDUSTRY Security issues that may arise from online threats towards online and interactive gaming Moderate Conditions within the supply chain, regarding aspects such as product quality, labour and human Moderate rights Environmental impact of operations, regarding consumption of materials for hardware production Moderate and energy consumption for production and business operations The gaming industry is a sector under intense public and regulatory scrutiny, where companies have to demonstrate sound corporate governance practices and extensive compliance. Since the industry must address serious issues such as money laundering, corruption and bribery, as well as gaming addiction and its social repercussions, INTRALOT deals with these issues proactively, through effective monitoring and security systems, which go beyond the minimum legal requirements and set the example for other companies. Opportunities Despite the risks and challenges that the gaming industry faces, there are also favorable circumstances that arise within this evolving landscape and gaming companies have to be able to leverage for their advantage. These opportunities include:  The steady progress to liberalize the online gaming markets in Europe and worldwide.  The trend towards enhanced private business participation in lottery operations through privatization initiatives, private management schemes and concession agreements.  The increasing embrace of sports betting from Lotteries and Governments.  The proliferation of interactive technologies and their applications to the gaming industry.  The integration of gaming channels and products and the ability to build omni-channel customer relationships.  The rise of the mobile technology and the exponential increase of smartphones penetration.  The particular attention devoted to issues such as Responsible Gaming policies, practices to protect vulnerable groups, security mechanisms and prevention of fraud. Technology and technological innovation are the main factors that drive disruptive change in the gaming industry, as gaming channels and products rapidly expand, new gaming channels emerge and gaming companies require increased integration. Within this new technological and regulatory context, the gaming market is increasingly competitive and gaming companies are required to invest in technology and demonstrate their compliance beyond the provisions currently set out by regulatory authorities, in order for them to gain or retain competitive advantage. The gaming industry is driven towards new business models, where strong player focus will be a key element of success, as players increasingly seek more sophisticated gaming entertainment through innovative and branded gaming content, personalized services and increased interactivity. INTRALOT Group is both capable and well equipped with operational know-how, cutting-edge gaming technology and human capital to seize opportunities, while mitigating any potential risks within this rapidly evolving environment. The Group focuses on lottery and betting (product strategy), while targeting emerging markets around the world and strengthening its presence in Africa (strategy per region). Moreover, INTRALOT Group has captured the market trend towards mobile sales channels and incorporates mobile features in its portfolio since 2014. The Group aims to further utilize mobile technology, in order to cover Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 27 the needs of players and retailers, as well as optimize the customer’s lottery experience. Therefore, product strategy in the following years will focus more on players’ needs and issues such as mobility, diverse gaming content and an innovative player engagement platform. 5.

Collaboration Award The Company is particularly honoured when its employees are rewarded for their efforts to excel in their work and support the Company’s priorities and objectives. In 2015, INTRALOT’s Head of Public Relations and CSR was awarded with the ‘Collaboration Award’ by the Public Gaming Research Institute (PGPI), along with counterparts from IGT and Scientific Games, for their vision, breakthrough initiatives and actions to forge creative collaborations, which contributed to the great success of Government Lotteries. This award serves as recognition of their efforts and commitment, as well as their ability to effectively collaborate with other industry professionals to benefit the entire gaming sector, towards a common vision: to create a networking platform where people from the gaming industry would share their knowledge, experience and ideas and ultimately inspire the lottery community.

Relevant industry related analyses by international organizations, such as the RobecoSAM’s Sustainability Yearbook for the ‘Casinos & Gaming’ sector. d. Regulatory environment. 2. Analysis of these issues in terms of associated Risk, according to the significance of the economic, social and environmental impacts that the Company’s activities, products and operations either have or could have. 3. Identification of Stakeholders’ expectations, through the analysis of their views as a result of relevant surveys that have been conducted (e.g. Customer Survey) and the indirect input from the departments which interact with each Stakeholder group. 4.

Board of Directors Upholding Corporate Governance Principles The responsibilities of the Board of Directors are clearly defined by the Company’s Articles of Association and the Internal Regulations Charter. Based on these, the purpose of the Board is to continuously enhance the long-term economic value and to safeguard corporate interests. The Board is responsible to approve the overall long-term strategy and operational goals and decide on all aspects related to management, assets and business objectives, without limitations (excluding aspects decided by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting). Name Position Executive Non-Executive Independent Sokratis P. Kokkalis Chairman  Constantinos G. Antonopoulos Vice Chairman  Antonios I. Kerastaris Member (CEO)  Konstantinos S.

The Board of Directors consists of a minimum of seven to eleven members elected by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting, which also determines the term of their service. At its majority, the BoD is comprised of nonexecutive members (including at least two independent non-executive members), while a legal entity may also be elected to the Board.  At the moment, there are no processes for consultation between Stakeholders and the BoD on economic, environmental and social issues. However, it must be noted that there were no critical concerns communicated to the BoD within 2015.  Nominations for the Board are made on merit, using objective criteria. The names of BoD members submitted for election or re-election are accompanied by sufficient biographical details, the Board’s view on the independence of the proposed Board members (in accordance with the independence criteria set out by the respective legislation), as well as and any other relevant information to facilitate an informed decision on behalf of the shareholders.  The Chairman is responsible to lead the Board, determine the agenda and effectively conduct Board meetings and meetings with the majority shareholders to discuss matters pertaining to corporate governance. Additionally, the Chairman is responsible to ensure that BoD members are informed in a timely manner, effectively communicate with all shareholders (especially those holding significant stakes and have long-term perspective, whose views are communicated to the BoD) and fairly address all shareholder interests.  The Group CEO is responsible for the Company’s strategy, its vision and values, as well as its operations at local and international level.  BoD members are prohibited to assume any role or activity that creates or appears to create conflict between corporate interests and personal interests, such as holding board or executive positions in competing companies, without the permission of the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting.

In addition to fixed and variable remuneration pertaining to the executive members (including the corporate stock option scheme) other incentives such as medical and life insurance, corporate car along with extra benefits are granted.  Remuneration for non-executive members reflects the time expended and their responsibilities, while it is not directly related to corporate performance, in order to encourage top management to take business risks.  The remuneration for executive members is pre-approved by the BoD following the Remuneration Committee’s recommendations. The remuneration of non-executive members is pre-approved by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting, as determined by legislation. Final approval for the executive and non-executive members’ remuneration is granted by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting.  The Board of Directors announces all amounts and all other benefits paid to each BoD member or to Company’s Directors within the previous two years at the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting, following the request of shareholders representing 1/20 of the paid up share capital, unless the BoD refuses to disclose information with due cause, which is recorded.  INTRALOT cooperates with international consultancy agencies in the field of Compensation and Benefits research and monitors relevant reward trends, in order to enable a fair, objective and competitive reward strategy.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 47 Business Continuity and Crisis Situation INTRALOT has established the Business Continuity Planning and Testing Guide and implements a business continuity plan, in order to address potential interruptions to business processes, minimize the impact caused by disasters and recover from loss of information assets to an acceptable level, through a combination of preventive and recovery controls. Within this context, INTRALOT follows the below principles of recognized international security standards:  The ‘Code of practice for information security management’ of ISO/IEC 27002 regarding business continuity management.  The World Lottery Association Security Control Standard.  The principles of BS 25999-1 ‘Business continuity management – code of practice’.  The guidelines of NIST Special Publication 800-34 ‘Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems’.

It must be noted that 40% of INTRALOT’s operations were analysed for risks which could result to a cease of operations by the Internal Audit Unit in 2015, compared to 50% in 2014. According to a formal corporate procedure, INTRALOT has established the RED Team (Chief Level Emergency Response Team) and the ORANGE Team (Group Director Level Emergency Response Team) and has defined the necessary actions to respond to a crisis situation or any event that could be harmful to INTRALOT’s reputation and operations, such as legal disputes, accidents, fires or disasters that could be attributed to the Company, according to following 5-scale impact classification:  Critical (international long-term negative media coverage; failure to achieve long-term strategic objectives): RED Team, ORANGE Team and ERM Team (Enterprise Risk Management) are contacted and Group Chief Executive Officer coordinates RED Team.  Major (national long-term negative media coverage; failure to achieve medium-term strategic objectives): RED Team, ORANGE Team and ERM Team are contacted and Group Chief Executive Officer coordinates RED Team.  Moderate (national short-term negative media coverage; failure to achieve short-term strategic objectives): ORANGE Team and ERM Team are contacted and Group Chief Operations Officer and Group Chief Legal & Compliance Counsel are informed.  Minor (local reputation damage; no strategic impact): Group Corporate Affairs Director, Global Operations Group Director and ERM Team are contacted.  Low (local media impact; no strategic impact): situation is resolved locally and reported in monthly reports to the Headquarters. Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 48 Upholding Information Security INTRALOT has established clear processes to manage practices, tools and activities necessary to prevent, detect and react to information security incidents. The information security processes applied aim to protect information assets regardless of how the information is formatted or whether it is in transit, being processed or stored. All information is classified according to three classifications levels:  Confidential – high sensitive information (e.g. financial information, system and game configuration, business critical statistics or game data).  Restricted – information of medium criticality (e.g. corporate internal operation documents and manuals).  Public – no security requirements (e.g. information gathered from the Internet). Any kind of information and all corporate documents either in hardcopy or in electronic form are required to display their classification level, as a means to communicate their criticality and INTRALOT has set specific rules regarding the following information handling for each one of the above classification levels:  Oral communication  Transmission  Storage  Information in physical form The Company provides specific guidelines to all employees, in order to minimize information security business and personal risk, which include instructions on the following:  Device security  Passwords  Protection against malicious code  Physical security  Unauthorized use of security mechanisms  Email and internet security Furthermore, the Company has developed detailed rules and guidelines related to information security for specific departments or user groups (such as the Human Resources Department and the Public Relations Department, Project and Technical Managers, Code Designers and Developers, ICT Department and Service Desk), which respective employees must read and comply with their provisions. Report a Security Incident or Event All employees are obliged to report any security incident (defined as any violation of the Information Security Policy which has impact on the business) and security event (defined as any violation of the Information Security Policy which has no impact on the business) through a digitally signed e-mail to the members of the local security function and security@intralot.com for INTRALOT and describe the incident or event in detail. In case employees do not have access to corporate email at that time, they can file their report through telephone and send an email as soon as possible. At all times, they are obliged to follow the appropriate security guidelines and do not disclose security information incidents to unauthorized persons at any circumstances. Within 2015, there were no security events reported by employees, either by email or by telephone according to the respective procedure. Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 49 Combating Corruption The Company implements an integrated framework to detect and dodge corruption, which includes the following three procedures:  Management controls and Internal Control measures  Financial Control, Security, Quality, Risk Management and Compliance  Internal Audit Within the context of this framework, INTRALOT controls its business units for risks associated with corruption, following standard internal auditing procedure, with regular audits planned by the relevant auditing departments.

In case of confirmed incidents of corruption and in accordance with Internal Regulation Charter, the Company reserves the right to proceed to relevant administrative and legal measures, which include dismissal or legal prosecution, depending on the incident’s scale and severity.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 54 Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 55 5. RESPONSIBLE GAMING 1. Overview Responsible Gaming is a concept according to which gaming operators, technology and software suppliers and associated service providers need to ensure that their products and services provide a fair and safe gaming experience that enables players to be protected from the adverse consequences of gaming. Whether players buy a lottery or scratch ticket, place their bets, play bingo or on a gaming machine or casino game, players have to view their activity as a form of entertainment in a balanced way. Thus, Responsible Gaming means that operators must aim to keep their games and gaming services profitable and reliable while, at the same time, ensure that all steps are taken to eliminate excessive behavior and protect vulnerable groups, which include:  Individuals under legal age of play.  Individuals of low income.  Retailers, lottery employees and contractors.  Individuals with a gaming addiction. Ensuring a fair  Individuals with other psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse and alcoholism. and safe gaming  Individuals with a family history of problem gaming.  Individuals not aware of risks of problem gaming. experience for Players and offering Customers the highest standards of responsible gaming operation Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 56 The Rising Need for Responsible Gaming The rising need for Responsible Gaming has emerged due to a changing gaming environment, especially within the last few years, since:  Online gaming has changed the traditional Points of Sale.  Gaming is more accessible with the proliferation of new media, such as internet, smartphones, tablets and mobile applications.  There is increased availability of different games and gaming services, as well as increased sports betting advertising. It is important that anyone who participates in games of chance understands the possible risks of the entertainment that they are buying and how they vary from one type of games to another. Players must make their choices based on aspects of the game or the gaming service, know and accept the odds and never overestimate the chances of winning or try to recover losses by persisting to game beyond their means. Besides being an ethical and a regulatory requirement, Responsible Gaming is a business imperative for gaming companies that protects the regulated business reputation and market share and has gained increased importance for society and Stakeholders. Companies are required to comply with applicable legal and regulatory Responsible Gaming frameworks and implement specific protection measures and procedures. RESPONSIBLE GAMING APPROACH As an Associate member of WLA, INTRALOT abides by the WLA Responsible Gaming Framework, whose purpose is to integrate the Responsible Gaming Principles into the day-to-day operations of the member lotteries. The Framework consists of:  The 7 Responsible Gaming Principles, to which WLA members commit themselves:  Meet their objectives while protecting their customers’ and vulnerable groups’ interests and, at the same time, uphold their respective commitments to defend public order within their own jurisdiction.  Ensure their practices and procedures reflect a combination of government regulations, operator selfregulation and individual responsibility.  Develop their practices concerning Responsible Gaming related issues on the fullest possible understanding of relevant information and analysis of documented research.  Work with Stakeholders to share information, develop research and promote Responsible Gaming as broadly as possible and encourage a better understanding of the gaming’s social impact.  Promote only legal and Responsible Gaming in all aspects of their activities, including development, sale and marketing of their products and activities and make reasonable efforts to ensure their agents do the same. Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 57  Provide information to public in an accurate and balanced manner (e.g. regarding marketing, gaming and the associated risks), in order to enable individuals to make informed choices about gaming activities within their jurisdiction.  Monitor, test, and revise as appropriate the activities and practices related to Responsible Gaming and publicly report their findings.  The 10 Responsible Gaming Framework program elements are described below: RESPONSIBLE GAMING FRAMEWORK PROGRAM ELEMENTS Element Description Identify, understand and integrate interests of decision-makers, decision Stakeholder Engagement influencers and other society members into key Responsible Gaming related business decisions and Responsible Gaming program development.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 58 INTRALOT Group recognizes that a Responsible Gaming approach has to incorporate and govern all business activities and operations, in order to safeguard the interests of players and the community in general. Therefore, the Group implements a series of projects and activities to guarantee the development of Responsible Gaming standards, according to the principles and framework of the WLA, both as a licensed gaming operator and a technology provider, as presented below: RESPONSIBLE GAMING FRAMEWORK FOR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS (WLA Associate Members) As a licensed Lottery operator in its own right, the Group develops its Responsible Gaming Program on the basis of all 10 elements of the WLA Responsible Gaming Framework.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 68 Minimizing risk before launching a new game The Group is aware that a critical aspect of its operations is to ensure appropriate game design with embedded Responsible Gaming characteristics, as well as to monitor its games’ impact on the market in which they are offered. To this end, the Group implements regular Social Impact Assessments to minimize risk before launching a new game, based on the following approach: SOCIAL IMPACT As an integral part of its game design process, the Group launched the iRGD tool (INTRALOT Responsible Gaming Designer) in 2014, a novel Responsible Gaming Assessment tool created in collaboration with its research partner Athens Information Technology (AIT) and independent international scientists.

Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 69 iRGD TOOL IMPLEMENTATION CONTEXT 5. Remote Gaming Imposing data protection controls An imperative requirement from INTRALOT Group is to implement control procedures, in order to safeguard the games’ security and ensure their reliability.  For draw games, the Group utilizes proven IT mechanisms and security measures, which virtually eliminate the possibility of hacking and/or manipulation of information submitted to the customer’s central system. At the same time, prior to publicly broadcasting the games’ draws, an appointed bailiff representing the players, controls the wagers’ closing and is also responsible to monitor the draws.  For instant games, the Group implements a set of security mechanisms and controls, in order to randomly allocate winnings to tickets and prevent any ‘localization’ of winning tickets. Protecting players in online gaming INTRALOT Group is committed to cultivating a remote gaming environment that respects and upholds the principles of Responsible Gaming. As new gaming activities are developed, there is a growing concern on behalf of society that online gaming may enhance the adverse consequences of problem gaming, especially since the internet literally brings gaming right into a player’s home. Therefore, the Group ensures that its products and solutions for remote gaming platforms feature the necessary characteristics that are required to protect players and monitor their participation in remote gaming channels. Remote gaming platforms: In order to meet its obligations and act in a responsible way towards players and the society, the Group focuses on deterring dependency or non-desirable behavior through its online gaming activities. In particular, the Group’s remote gaming platforms feature some of the industry’s leading practices, as they:  Require that all players have to register, in order to participate to games provided by operators.  Follow strict security standards regarding player registration and monitor of player behavior.  Players can verify their age and information such as home address and personal Tax Identification Number, either via the system’s online interface (where players are requested to submit a copy of identification documents, such as personal identity card, driver’s license, passport, a public utility bill or a bank statement) and verified by a third party or offline by authorized personnel (e.g. retailers) and standardized procedures.  Provide the ability to freeze a player account and do not permit any further online gaming, in case the player’s age is not verified after the first deposit or player registration.  Comply with the relevant legislation regarding protection of personal data.

It must be noted that for players who repetitively exclude themselves (e.g. five times) across a certain period (e.g. one year), the exclusion becomes definitive.  The definitive exclusion, where players can definitively exclude themselves from participating to some games.  Players can review their limits at any time and can increase or extent them only after a specified cool off (or temporisation) period has elapsed, in order to ensure that players have the time to set back.  Lottery operators can set limits for all players (e.g. maximum spending or time limit above which players cannot go) or set default player limits, which are applied by default if the player does not specify one.  Players can opt to close their accounts immediately.  Include self-assessments questionnaires for players who are concerned about their gaming behavior. Responsible Gaming Pre-Commitment System: In gaming industry, pre-commitment systems introduce restrictions on electronic gaming machines (EGMs), in order to prevent players from spending more money than they originally intended. The INTRALOT Group includes a Player Pre-Commitment System in an EGM monitoring system, having developed the Responsible Gaming Module for its iGEM Monitoring System, which is used to monitor, manage and control large networks of EGMs. The Responsible Gaming Module follows the latest gaming standards and best gaming practices. Players can register via web or in any gaming venue and get a player card with credentials to access their account, which allows them to set personalized game limits or self-exclusion options. The system also allows the use of anonymous player cards for pre-commitment purposes, in case players wish to play anonymously, and offers various options to players, including: Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 71  Selection of either a Voluntary Scheme (where non-registered players can play in EGMs) or a Mandatory Scheme (where player cards from registered players with player-set limits are necessary to activate the games).  Support of Anonymous or Named Registration: either or both options can be active at any installation, but the Named Registration may offer additional services, such as game history reporting and option to re-activate an account, in case players lose their card and/or credentials).  Configuration to stop game play when a limit is reached or to allow game play after that limit, either with warnings or with no warnings.  Access to real-time information about the players’ gaming activity before and after the set limits.  Set fully configurable limits that can be activated or deactivated, such as financial loss, play duration and bet amount, applicable on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.  Display of configurable warning messaging and warning levels.  Access to self-assessment questionnaires available via website, in order to measure their risk level (on an ascending scale from green, yellow, orange, to red) of excessive gaming behavior.  Links to resources and organizations engaged in Responsible Gaming and problem gaming As a result of the Group’s practices, in 2015 there were no complaints regarding breaches of player privacy and losses of player data and no relative fines were imposed by the respective authorities.

Identifying Gaming Habits The Group has designed two questionnaires, which are provided to lotteries, in order to identify gaming habits and indicate if a player experiences issues with his/her gaming habits: a short questionnaire with 3 questions and a detailed questionnaire with 9 questions. If a player scores above a specific threshold on the short questionnaire based on the scoring methodology, they are advised to continue with the detailed one. Both questionnaires are based on the 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 77 6.

However, due to the highly competitive Italian market, payout was approximately 1.5% higher compared to 2014, thus adversely affecting its profitability.  In Morocco, INTRALOT Maroc increased the agents’ network efficiency and enhanced its communication campaigns’ effectiveness, which lead to a turnover increase, despite a progressive ban to marketing activities.  In Turkey, Inteltek managed to increase its revenues (even in euro terms, despite the depreciation of the Turkish Lira), due to the fact that the sports betting market in Turkey is still growing and the significant investments in technology and marketing activities on behalf of the online agents to support their further expansion.  In Jamaica, the Supreme Ventures Limited (SVL) increased its sales in 2015, due to the completed upgrades to sports betting and lottery platforms, being the only company offering numerical games in the country, while its profitability was further supported by reducing operational expenses and their allocation to revenue generating activities.  In Malta, MALTCO Lotteries’ revenues decreased compared to 2014, due to the positive effect of the FIFA World Cup on sports betting sales within the last year. However, profitability increased compared to 2014, due to the effective payout management (especially in numerical games) and optimizations regarding Cost of Sales.  In Azerbaijan, Azerinteltek’s sales decreased compared to 2014, due to the worsening macroeconomic environment that is negatively affecting the gaming market in the country. However, the upgrade of the sports betting platform, the introduction of a new game (Horse Racing) and the full utilization of Euro Cup 2016 are expected to support Azerinteltek’ s growth in the forthcoming year.  In Bulgaria, Eurofootball’s revenues significantly improved in 2015, as the market welcomed a newly launched game (Virtual Football) that increased the subsidiary’s market share.  In Peru, Intralot de Peru’s sales largely increased in 2015, as a result of its wide product portfolio, network expansion and sports betting products maturity in the market.  In Argentina, Tecno Accion and Tecno Accion Salta managed to deliver higher results, both in terms of revenue growth and profitability, despite the poor macroeconomic conditions in the country.  In United States, INTRALOT Inc. increased its revenues due to the successful launch of the VLT monitoring system in Georgia and the successful renewal of its contracts in New Mexico and Montana on better terms than the previous ones.  In Australia, the Group managed to substantially increase its revenues due to the successful introduction of the voluntary pre-commitment scheme (PCS) in Victoria, as well as the support to the state lottery in Western Australia (Lottery West) to revamp its retail network. The Group aims to improve the products and services offered and develop new technologies that will allow to further expand its operations in existing markets.

While environmental protection is a particularly important aspect for most industries, the gaming industry can be considered as of relatively low impact to the environment. Most of the industry’s impact can be attributed to the use of various energy sources and natural resources for business Supporting operations, as well as the consumption of materials for hardware production and product packaging.

It must be noted that within 2015:  There were no incidents with environmental impacts on local communities.  There were no complaints about environmental impacts filed through formal grievance mechanisms, no prosecutions or legal actions for environmental issues and no fines or non-monetary sanctions for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations were imposed by the respective authorities. SOCIAL CAUSES supported by the GAMING INDUSTRY Corporate Responsibility Report 2015 | 103 Society Support According to data from the European State Lotteries and Toto Association (European Lotteries EL), the umbrella organization of national lotteries operating games of chance for the public benefit, the 74 EL members within 2015:  Returned approximately €24 billion back to society, as revenues generated by Lotteries are returned to the State budgets and support social causes, such as sports, arts and culture, scientific research, education and the environment.  Employed approximately 27,550 full-time employees on average, without including the almost 20,000 people employed by the Organización Nacional de Ciegos Españoles (ONCE) in Spain, who are persons with disabilities selling the tickets and are also full-time employees.  Have created over 413, indirect full-time work positions.

Transition to Cloud INTRALOT steadily progresses towards environmentally friendlier IT solutions, as it expands the use of virtualized environments and cloud solutions for certain IT and development services, in order to replace standalone servers. As a result of its NEFOS (Novel, Extensive, Flexible, On-Demand, Secure) cloud solution successful roll-out, which is already for new corporate-wide applications and IT services, INTRALOT’s IT Department has moved the testing of new software configurations, as well as development and consolidation of production servers to the virtualized environment. As a solution that integrates internationally adopted practices and standards on Information Security for cloud computing in the gaming sector, the NEFOS cloud solution significantly reduces INTRALOT’s environmental footprint, since it reduces energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions and allows significant cost savings for the Company. Within 2015, INTRALOT replaced 68 physical servers by migrating to virtual infrastructure, and achieved significant energy savings, as indicated below. The migration was supported by low-power new servers, who feature high processing power.
