United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Message from our Chairman and CEO November 2017 The United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals provide a critical roadmap to meeting the many challenges facing the world and securing a socially and environmentally sustainable future. We believe the business sector is uniquely positioned to advance the agenda of The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in its commitment to being a leading catalyst of this transformation. IFF’s sustainability strategy – centered on the concept of the circular economy – was designed with these same important goals in mind. We have already made significant progress in each of the three platforms of our strategy, and will continue to do so in the years to come. As a signatory to the UNGC since 2015, we see this forum as a valuable opportunity to engage with and learn from thought leaders and other forward-thinking companies. We reaffirm our support of the UNGC Ten Principles and will continue to embrace the principles throughout our business globally. Our commitment – to high standards of integrity and demonstrating respect for our partners, communities and the environment – is unwavering. Our 2016 Sustainability Report, issued at the end of March 2017, serves as our Communication on Progress (COP). The report details our progress in the areas of human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption, is externally assured, and meets the G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines “Core” option. A GRI G4 Content Index, cross-referenced with the UN Global Compact principles, is located at the end of the report. This COP expresses our commitment to transparency along this journey. We are proud to be recognized for our sustainability progress and look forward to a future of limitless possibilities.
