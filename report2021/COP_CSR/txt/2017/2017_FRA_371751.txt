The result is a holistic experience, on the outer boundaries of technological innovation and emerging science. Based on a bioclimatic architectural design, the building no longer serves just as shelter, but instead communicates with its occupants, adjusts to its surroundings and participates in its changing activities, so as to form an organic whole. Users are no longer defined by where they are, what they do or what they are a part of. They organize their activities as they see fit, interact with each other regardless of location, and live and work in a virtualized environment. The building infrastructure is equipped with multiple intelligent sensors, connected to digital platforms and big data applications, in order to perform complex tasks and proactively manage issues without any human input. When completed in 2025, SPIE is proud to be the Dutch Windwheel contributing to this ambitious in the port of Rotterdam experiment, based on an will offer the vision of two overarching commitment to gigantic, 174-metre high glass preserving the environment. and steel rings seemingly floating on the sea.

To carry them out, it relies on SPIE to manage Facilities in its 55 buildings, covering around 110,000 sq.m. When SPIE’s contract was renewed in late 2015, Véronique Grégoire was very pleased, because she needed some clearly defined services. “We have electrical, mechanical and air conditioning systems that require advanced skills to keep them running smoothly. And we need people who are knowledgeable about all kinds of Facilities, to improve their operation. And lastly, there’s compliance, which has to be regularly monitored.” For the CNES, these services are missioncritical, in that they support programmes where the slightest failure of the electrical or air-conditioning systems could be disastrous, as Véronique notes in a compelling example: “When sending a WITH SPIE, probe into space, a loss of power could prevent it from communicating with the space system.” This means that SPIE has WE’RE TAKING CARE to be ready for any eventuality, with teams assigned on-site during launch campaigns.

SPIE was chosen to upgrade the stadium’s video surveillance, fire alarm and intrusion prevention systems, which are now interconnected via a single, high-performance network. Previously in charge of closed-circuit television (CCTV) operations for North Lanarkshire’s public spaces, where she gained extensive experience in deploying large scale, multi-use, wireless networks, Emma Walker is now head of North Lanarkshire Leisure, the organization responsible for the management and operation of all of the sports and leisure Facilities in the county, which includes the 8,000 capacity Broadwood Stadium. In her opinion, the most difficult part of the project awarded to SPIE was having to rethink the whole system. “You can actually use the network for more than one purpose,” she explains. “So for me it’s not just about public space CCTV. It’s what else we can use that network for. And that’s WITH SPIE, where we need to be creative.” SPIE made an initial commitment to develop WE’RE IMPROVING a network that’s flexible, resistant and reliable. “To meet the required standards, it’s critical that the CCTV and the fire and intruder alarms are OUR PUBLIC all linked throughout the stadium,” she notes.

UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AT INSA LYON. A NEW WORLD WITHOUT BORDERS THINKING ABOUT THE IoT 40 INSPIRATION / 2016 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE In recent years, the Internet has metamorphosed into a vast network of connected devices, known collectively as the Internet of Things (IoT), which is acting as a powerful business driver not only for the digital industry but also for the entire manufacturing sector. Today, the IoT’s infinite potential is prompting widespread debate about the technical challenges, social changes and economic issues arising from its deployment. Fabrice Valois shares with us his expert thoughts on the subject. WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT enabled people to travel farther and faster, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IoT? and to invent machines; then Gutenberg’s The IoT means putting the Internet printing press in 1400, which made it easier everywhere – in devices (electrical outlets to spread knowledge; and now the Internet, to manage power use, smartphones to which has freed us from the notions of time manage lighting and music), in people and distance.

SPIE is supporting carbon emissions by 75%, stabilizing this development in every segment, including electricity use and developing circular hydropower, biomass and geothermics. economy solutions. As a major source of regional development solutions, SPIE offers a wide range of expertise to drive this process forward. THE WAY FOSSIL FUELS ARE USED IS CHANGING DRAMATICALLY At a time when the European Union is seeking to limit the impact of fossil fuels on the environment, SPIE is helping to optimize their use and management with such processes as VOC filtration systems for oil & gas installations and gas pipeline automation systems. Valeco, France Near Rodez in the Aveyron region, SPIE spent nearly eight months working on a new solar power plant built on former mining slagheaps rehabilitated by Valeco. The project involved the installation of ten 1-MVA inverters, 120 LV distribution boxes, and 36,980 photovoltaic modules of 315 Wp each, as well as the use of 1,849 solar trackers to optimize power generation. 57 INSPIRATION – ENERGIES THE ENERGY TRANSITION Experiencing a disruptive model The global energy sector is being transformed ELECTRICITY AND GAS OPERATORS at an ever quicker pace under the combined ARE INCREASING CAPACITY impact of regulatory change and disruptive Decentralized power generation continued technological and digital innovation. to have a rising impact on transmission and The energy transition is now an integral distribution networks in 2016, led by the driver of another form of development and growth in renewable Energies and user reconfigured services, in which SPIE intends services, such as electric mobility.

See the Energy Efficiency brochure. 59 INSPIRATION – ENERGIES In this fast-moving environment, the nuclear power landscape is gradually being reconfigured with the emergence of European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) plants, like the ones in Flamanville in France and Hinkley Point in the United Kingdom. At the same time, as a stakeholder in this long-term process, which will see the arrival of a new generation of safer, more costeffective reactors in France by 2030, SPIE intends to capitalize on its experience and expertise in general electrical contracting for existing power plants. For instance, the Group is involved in electrical contracting projects at the Flamanville EPR, where it has installed EDF, France more than 2,000 km of electric cables EDF has awarded SPIE a new four-year contract to maintain rotating (60,000 connections) and in the new machines at its nuclear power plants in Chinon and Belleville. contract from EDF’s Plant Engineering, Decommissioning and Environmental Division (DIPDE) for work on complex instrumentation-control and automation projects at current nuclear power stations. #  hilippe Sasseigne, Executive Vice President, P Nuclear Power Generation, EDF Post-Fukushima upgrade projects to “It’s all about improving plant safety and getting improve plant safety continued apace it right the first time, which is why training equipment throughout the year.

THE OIL & GAS MARKET IS TRYING TO REBUILD As oil prices dropped below $30 a barrel in January 2016, the oil & gas industry continued to drastically restructure operations over the year, with deep cuts in both operating expenses and capital expenditure. The situation prompted SPIE to deploy a number of market initiatives, in particular to transfer as much business as possible to the less exposed downstream sector. CEA, France SPIE is assisting the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in maintaining its infrastructure, refurbishing its sensitive equipment and decommissioning obsolete Facilities. In 2016, two major contracts were awarded to maintain power distribution systems and to renovate the fire detection and emergency power systems for the Phénix reactor at the Marcoule nuclear site. 60 INSPIRATION / 2016 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE VISION FACILITATING THE ENERGY For example, SPIE has broadened its TRANSITION WITH TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES THAT IMPROVE THE WAY ENERGY IS PRODUCED, presence in the Gulf States, where refining PROCESSED AND TRANSPORTED. and petrochemical services are in growing demand.
