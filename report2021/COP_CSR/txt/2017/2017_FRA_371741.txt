CREATING EFFICIENT, INNOVATIVE ENVIRONMENTS Today, building design is integrating new systems, such as web-based lighting management, indoor geolocation systems, presence detectors and EV charging points, that are profoundly transforming how facilities are used. In the Paris La Défense business district in 2015, for example, SPIE installed indoor radio coverage in the Tour Neptune and the Tour One, which will be the new head office of the Allianz insurance group. We already provide multi-technical maintenance services for Tour One, which has been certified to French HQE® standards. The challenge for the new project was to ensure that the radio waves reached even the most enclosed workspaces.

In Germany, for example, the national Energiewende project calls for citizens and communities to get increasingly involved in locally generating electricity from renewable sources. SPIE is helping to move this process forward by enabling regional participants to capture all of the benefits of these new energies. In western France, we built five solar fields that are remotely managed thanks to fully featured video surveillance, intrusion detection, access control and SCADA systems.

This will entail more than 20,000 tasks to be performed on each unit by EDF employees and contractors, such as SPIE Nucléaire. With up to 4,000 people working on-site at the same time, we expect the Paluel power station to be as busy as the EPR construction project in Flamanville. All of these aspects demand heightened attention to safety and security, as well as an extensive managerial presence on the ground. TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A SERVICES CONTRACTOR LIKE SPIE? Clearly, our service partners are key performance enablers for us. First of all, I expect the SPIE Nucléaire teams to share our challenges and our values. The Paluel power station has defined ten standards concerning its safety and security rules.

Some countries are moving faster than others, according to their culture. Switzerland remains cautious, but the general trend is inevitable. Joseline feels that this is in fact an advantage for SPIE, which enjoys a convergence of expertise from each of its units. “There are still great things to develop and synergies to build,” she says mischievously, as if the adventure has only just begun. 71 INSPIRATION ETHICS Belgium SPIE Belgium Inspired by DANIEL MERCIER Infrastructure Division Manager Watch the interview. ETHICS After starting as a project manager, Daniel Mercier moved up the ranks at SPIE Belgium to become Infrastructure Division Manager. Along the way, he has formed some strong opinions about business ethics. 72 Inspiration / 2015 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE W hen you ask him about his interest in business ethics, Daniel Mercier smiles and notes that most people would agree that honesty is the best policy. But the problem is that companies are faced with aggressive competition, which means that contracts are sometimes awarded in ways that are SPIE’s eight rules of ethical business conduct blatantly unfair. To resist these practices, you need strict rules based on a zero tolerance policy. Our ethical principles handbook defines eight EMBEDDED IN OUR SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION fundamental rules of Like other companies, SPIE has addressed this challenge holisbusiness: compliance with tically, by gradually deploying a panoply of measures “to put host country legislation; our ethical house in order,” says Daniel.

There’s also the protection of private data, a hot topic in the digital society. In the end, the degree of ethical behaviour becomes a marker of sustainable improvement across the organization. “Through their contacts with us, customers quickly realize that our employees feel good at SPIE.” Nevertheless, Daniel recognizes that there will always be shady areas, which is why he wants to embed this commitment deep in our corporate culture. “During the induction process, somebody presents our ethical vision to new hires, who are asked to fill out a questionnaire or participate in a role-playing game,” he explains. This concerns everyone, from the boardroom to the shopfloor. “A lot of meetings are organized to enable people to talk about these issues and contact the Ethics Committee if they have any doubts,” he notes with satisfaction. Ethical practices are not only about doing business, they are an integral part of an ambitious continuous improvement process for the entire organization. 73 INSPIRATION TRANSFORMING THE COMPANY DEPLOYING NEW BUSINESS MODELS To address the changes now under way, SPIE is counting not only on its digital transformation, but also on the development of an agile, collaborative culture leveraging all the strengths of its networked organization. One example of this process is the participation of young SPIE employees in the international POC21* innovation camp outside Paris, which brought together eco-inventors to share the innovative energy-related technologies that will shape the world of tomorrow.

During the year, SPIE Ouest-Centre earned ISO 50001 certification, a highly demanding energy performance standard that we would like to extend to other subsidiaries, in energy procurement, fleet management and corporate building design.

She doesn’t even respond when men treat her with that kind of attitude, because they wouldn’t understand why. 83 INSPIRATION COMMITMENT On 25 April 2015 a severe earthquake hit Nepal.
