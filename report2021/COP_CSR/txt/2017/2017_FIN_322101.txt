We have paid a lot of attention to deve­ loping our customer relationship management in recent years, and these efforts are now bearing fruit. Significant investments in strategic focus areas Our largest transaction in 2016 was the acquisition of six properties in the Forum block in Helsinki. The transaction included the Forum shopping centre and office premises. The properties have a total leasable area of nearly 77,000 m2, of which some 48 per cent is retail space, 41 per cent is office space and 11 per cent is storage space and other utility space. In line with Sponda’s strategic focus areas, the acquisition increased the share of office and shopping centre properties in our property portfolio and saw us focus even more strongly on Helsinki’s central business district. At the same time, the company acquired more shopping centre expertise. Sponda’s expertise in shopping centres has seen it become a very significant player in the industry, and this position will only grow stronger in the coming years. The development of the Ratina shopping centre in Tampere has progressed on schedule and will be completed in spring 2018. The pre-let rate for the new shopping centre section under construction in Ratina has already reached approximately 55 per cent and the pre-let rate for the whole complex now stands at approximately 45 per cent. 4 Sponda Annual Review 2016 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW The share of prime areas in Sponda’s office property portfolio grew thanks to the office properties included in the Forum acquisition as well as one newly completed Our largest transaction in property.
