Since the beginning of 2014, we have been introducing thinner plastic bottles (1-Liter, 0.3-Liters, and 0.5-Liter) to the Myanmar market. By reducing the grams of plastic for both the water bottles as well as the cap, we are using fewer raw materials thereby reducing the environment impact of our business both in sourcing as well as in waste. Even though we incur the risks associated with introducing thinner bottles in a market that is used to thick, sturdy bottles, we stick to our commitment of reducing environment impact of our business. We take upon the responsibility of educating the public over time. In the middle of 2015, we introduced 5-Liter bottles that also use less plastic than our competitors. At the end of 2016, we introduced the new 1-Liter bottle. Best quality technology is being used by reducing the use of crude petroleum oil which is the raw material for plastic and prevention of the natural resources which is a support for conservation of the environment. We produced the 1-Liter thinner bottles not only distribution to market to get profit but also giving knowledge of reducing plastic to save the environment. Our company follows and practices The environmental Conversation Law laid down in The Republic of the Union of Myanmar. At company, all the departments are connected with local network and we distribute the internal orders, meeting minutes, internal instructions, etc. with email or office outlook instead of copying paper. When we do print, we use both sides of paper and submit our recyclables to appropriate. Our first priority is not only to safe the people but also our environment. The Extinguishers are also placed at the every corner of the room and the safety trainings are also given to employees.
