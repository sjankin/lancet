2016 SUSTAINABILITY COMMUNICATION 2016 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Dear Stakeholder, Technicolor has been at the forefront of the transition from analog to digital media communications over the past decade and is now well placed to benefit from strong growth across multiple platforms and industry segments. Ensuring the sustainability of this growth remains a high priority for my entire leadership team. Our Drive 2020 strategic plan was launched in 2015 with strategic acquisitions which were successfully integrated in 2016. Another foundation has been our longstanding adoption since 2003 and renewed commitment every year to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, notably through our Charters on ‘Environment, Health and Safety’, ‘Ethics’ and product environmental Whitepapers. More specifically, Technicolor policies prohibit the use of child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and slavery in its operations and its supply chain and require its suppliers to comply with our standards. The resulting governance processes have helped to place Corporate Social Responsibility at the heart of our business approach and ensure that commercial needs are appropriately balanced with those of local communities, the environment, our business partners and of course our employees. 3 High on the CSR agenda, Data Security, one of the strong expertise of the Group since its beginnings, remains key to our business long-term sustainability. Cybercrime has a capacity to jeopardize operations and long-term relations of trust established with our partners, our customers, our suppliers, our employees. The Technicolor Security Office (TSO) issued a new Data Security policy. The TSO team was reinforced, more talents were hired, and a global awareness and training campaign for all our employees was launched. A formal Data Protection Policy issued by the Technicolor Ethics Compliance Committee governs legal compliance under the Data Protection EU Directive. An independent Data Privacy Officer is also registered with the French CNIL. Our Connected Home division integrated CSR in its quality policy, and joined the non-profit Electronics Industrial Citizenship Coalition (EICC) as an applicant member in 2014. Over the past two years, the business demonstrated its ability to implement the EICC Code of Conduct throughout the supply chain and has been recognized as a full member by EICC in 2016. For the fourth time in a row, a full external audit of our social, environmental and societal information reporting took place, involving more than 20 stakeholders within the organization across multiple countries. Accurate information is vital for the continued progress of our sustainability agenda and the data in this report is a key input to leaders across our business making operational decisions on a wide variety of important topics. Our commitment to align our reporting to the Global Reporting Initiative framework relies on diligent data harvesting processes, and audits help us retain focus year after year. Employee health and safety remains an important focus, demanding continuous vigilance and innovation to ensure we do everything possible to keep our employees safe. We have also continued our core initiatives to drive eco-design principles into all our products and manufacturing processes and move closer to carbon neutrality, bringing benefits for both customers and the environment.

We use these to guide us to business success as well as sound environmental stewardship and to ensure that we act responsibly. One Culture As part of our sustainability drive, we establish and Our Values nurture partnerships aimed to improve our long-term business outlook. Three principles guide our actions as we seek to fulfill our social responsibilities: Understand and Take into Account Diligent Stakeholders’ Sustainability Expectations Describes the meticulous attention to detail Technicolor delivers to its customers whether in delivering the best rendering of a film or in delivering a great user experience in a set-top box.

Throughout the Company this translates into integrity technicolor.com in business principles and practices, continuous efforts to make more efficient use of resources and an ongoing 62924 Values poster large.indd 1 3/11/10 5:21 PM drive for carbon neutrality. We want our suppliers to adopt the same sustainability values as ours. We support our customers’ sustainability efforts by developing new generations of sustainable products and services. Technicolor also plays an active role in communities where it does business by encouraging educational initiatives and by supporting local community relationships and programs. Technicolor has been a Member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. For more information about the United Nations Global Compact, please visit: http://www.unglobalcompact.org and have access to Technicolor Communication on Progress. Technicolor’s Global Compact Communication on Progress is an integral part of this Sustainability Report. Communicate CSR Goals and Initiatives to Stakeholders We pledge to deliver concrete, demonstrable proof of our social responsibility practices and achievements. We provide facts and figures to give stakeholders the information they need to understand, analyze and compare our actions with those of similar organizations. Always an inspiration, we are adapting Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting standards to our disclosures. We are including a GRI G4 Content Index at the end of this report to guide readers to relevant information in our Annual Report or our Sustainability Communication Report. We are publishing the GRI Content Index ‘In Accordance’ with the GRI G4 Guidelines – Comprehensive option. We aim to keep adapting our Sustainability Communication in the future to meet GRI new framework. Take the Future into Account in Decision-making We are committed to progressively integrate corporate social responsibility (CSR) data and criteria into business processes across the organization, to ensure that all decisions take CSR considerations into account. In this way, sustainability becomes part of how we do business. As part of our commitment, we link product and service lifecycle aspects and impacts to their greater societal context, constantly striving to enhance all of our stakeholder relationships. 9 GRI [G4-32] Now more than ever, corporate social responsibility is a business imperative. The more successful companies are those that integrate societal, environmental and economic reflection in how they do business thus reinforcing the links with all their stakeholders. At Technicolor, we know it is in everyone’s interest to contribute to the sustainability of the communities we serve and in which we operate. Didier Huck, Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Affairs 3R  ECENT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ACHIEVEMENTS Ethics The Code of Ethics, governs Technicolor’s business decisions, actions, and displays the fundamental values we practice in our day-to-day activities. As part of Technicolor’s effort to ensure that employees are familiar with the Code of Ethics and related policies, such as the Whistleblower Policy, the Anti-corruption Policy or the Sourcing Ethics Policy, numerous training programs were implemented by the legal compliance team in concertation with the Ethics Compliance Committee (ECC), including both in-person, WebEx and online courses. These training initiatives were continued through 2015 and 2016, including training courses focused on the EU Competition-Dealing with Competitors, anti-Corruption and bribery regulations and policies, and preventing sexual harassment. The Technicolor Data Protection Policy governs legal compliance aspects. It was revised after the Safe Harbor Framework was invalidated by the European Court of Justice in October 2015. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Technicolor, its staff, contractors, suppliers and other people working on its behalf comply with any applicable 10 provisions of the Data Protection EU Directive where and when appropriate, as well as with any applicable other legislation when processing personal data. People Product Management Academy plays an important role in the Gateway and Set-Top-Box Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) support HR provides to managers in the Group.

Community involvement Technicolor focuses its involvement in community initiatives on digital artists’ education. In addition to its support to the Training Academies, the Group supports other educational initiatives to give opportunities to young talent to access to studios and to develop their skills: training students in schools, donating equipment, one week work experience, paid summer internship in VFX studios, supporting third party digital artists schools (India). The Group supports also the India Foundation for the Arts to help advanced projects of cinematographers. It also continues to support activities in various environments relating to the world of film: launching festivals for new talent, supporting charities, and developing new experimental technologies or supporting joint initiatives with students to foster product and service innovation. CSR Management Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is managed at the highest level within Technicolor. CSR is formally represented at the Executive Committee level by the Executive Vice President for Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility, Fabienne Brunet, reporting directly to the CEO. Executive Committee members evaluate and authorize new company CSR initiatives, review progress and provide supervision in all related domains. 11 Reporting to the Executive Vice President for Human Resources and Sustainability, a Corporate Social Responsibility Department, headed by Didier Huck, Vice President for Public Affairs & Corporate Social Responsibility, has been in existence since 2007. The CSR Department holds broad authority to propose and coordinate CSR policy implementation and operational deployment. The department benefits from strong senior management support as well as assistance from Technicolor’s Human Resources, Sourcing and Environment and Health & Safety network. Technicolor’s Code of Ethics and related policies guide and support our employees each day in accomplishing the Company’s business objectives with ethical integrity. Sophie Le Ménahèze, Ethics Compliance Committee Secretary 4E  THICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES Ethics Compliance Committee The Technicolor Code of Ethics, which was first introduced in 1999 and last updated in November 2014, constitutes the foundation for the Company’s core ethics values and practices. It governs Technicolor’s business decisions in our day-to-day activities and has been distributed to all Technicolor employees. It is available on the Company’s intranet. The ECC, created in 2006, is responsible for all ethical issues related to the Group’s activities. In 2016, the ECC’s members were: Fabienne Brunet (Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility), Didier Huck (Vice President Corporate Social Responsibility & Public Affairs), Guillaume Litvak (Internal Audit Director), and Sophie Le Ménahèze (General Counsel, Financing and EMEA Corporate Legal Affairs). Didier Huck serves as the Chair of the Committee and Sophie Le Ménahèze as the Committee’s secretary. The ECC reports directly to the Audit Committee. In 2016, the ECC met three times. An ECC Ethics Training Subcommittee makes recommendations to the ECC concerning training on the Code of Ethics, Whistleblower Policy and related issues. Appointed by the ECC, subcommittee members can include non-ECC members. The Ethics Training Subcommittee may also take steps to implement training, as directed by the full ECC. 12 Ethics Programs and Initiatives Whistleblower Policy Over the last few years, amongst other Ethics training The revised Technicolor Whistleblower Policy, launched courses, members of the finance community comin May 2006, is designed to make it easier for employees pleted the Global Financial Fraud Prevention course. to share questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints During that same time, online training courses focused about financial, accounting, banking or anti-bribery on the EU competition-Dealing with Competitors, matters with an appropriate person. anti-corruption and bribery regulations and policies, and Pursuant to this policy, any bona fide claim that an preventing sexual harassment.

Combined, these training sessions involved more than 10,000 employees for the period 2010-2016. GRI [G4-56; G4-57; G4-58] [G4-DMA Anti-corruption] Anti-corruption Policy The comprehensive Technicolor commitment to prevent corruption, formalized in our Anti-Corruption policy, seeks to not only comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations like the UK Bribery Act and the French Criminal Code, but to avoid even the appearance of questionable conduct in connection with Technicolor operations. In 2012, the policy was revised to recognize additional countries with laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption. In 2016, the Compliance teams of Technicolor have been working on preparing another update to the policy, to be issued in 2017, in order to take into account regulatory changes in certain countries. Data Protection Policy and Governance In 2014, The Ethics Compliance Committee published a new Corporate Policy on Data Protection, which was subsequently revised after the Safe Harbor Framework was invalidated by the European Court of Justice in October 2015. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Technicolor, its staff, contractors, suppliers and other people working on its behalf comply with any applicable provisions of the Data Protection EU Directive where and when appropriate, as well as comply – as appropriate – with any applicable other legislation when processing personal data. The policy applies regardless of where the data is held, i.e. if it is held on Technicolor-owned equipment or outside Technicolor property (for example by a subcontractor). 13 In addition, an intragroup agreement based on the Standard Contractual Clauses Controller to Controller approved by the EU Commission has been signed in 2016 by all Technicolor parties in order to protect EU personal data transferred within the Technicolor Group outside of the European Union. Furthermore, an independent “Correspondant Informatique et Liberté” (Data Privacy Officer) was named and registered with the French CNIL. An independent administrative authority, the CNIL mission is to protect personal data, preserve civil liberties and accompany innovation by helping companies integrate personal data requirements within their technological developments. The role of the Data Privacy Officer is to independently ensure the internal application of the French national data protection legislation, to keep a register of personal data processing implemented in the Company, and to ensure that the rights and freedoms of the data subjects are unlikely to be adversely affected by the processing operations.

To adapt to our new strategic focus and market context, we re-examined basic issues: what leadership skills are necessary to meet our new strategies and goals? How do we align our values with our vision and strategy to ensure that everyone is heading in the same direction? These questions provided the basis for a wide-ranging assessment of our ability to fill business-critical positions, now and in the future, including comprehensive succession planning. Since 2010, we have been operating a new organizational model around three main axes: > Strong partnership with Business; > Global centers of expertise; > Regional Human Resources competence centers, reinforced with HR site leaders. We also capitalized on our approach to performance management. The ambition is to ensure that expectations are clearly established and that individual results are well managed, in terms of both measurable outcomes and behaviors. In the context of Drive 2020, we also make sure that employees are engaged in the Company’s future and will develop the right skills to face coming challenges. 19 The worldwide employee performance management system, known as STEP (System for Technicolor Employee Performance), was designed as a people development tool: in addition to traditional business objectives evaluation, it includes assessments based on Company values and associated behaviors as well as a plan to sustain employee development. 2016 saw a further consolidation and stabilization of the programs initiated in the previous years. People development projects cover a broad range of needs and issues: >C ontinuous Process Improvement for our Performance Evaluation System and Interconnection with our Talent Review: • Address succession plans; • Risk analysis for key positions; • Risk identification and minimization initiatives; • Develop human capital at all levels of the organization; • Job architecture. > Development of Key Capabilities through: • Identification and development of key functional and technical skills; • Leadership Development Program; • Programs to reinforce people and performance management skills. > Enhanced Cooperation between Divisions and Functions through Internal Networks: • Management Networks; • Management Academy. GRI [G4-LA10; G4-LA11] [G4-DMA Training and education] Technicolor priorities in Talent and Development in 2016 were reviewed to support the implementation of the Drive 2020 new strategic roadmap. In addition to our leadership development and management development programs, several actions were undertaken to ensure the coherence of learning and development investments with the execution of the plan. These actions have included a broad and deep analysis of all the training needs and investments in the Group and a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of jobs and competencies that are key for the execution of the plan, allowing to prepare specific competencies development projects. As an immediate result of these actions, a special focus was given to the topics of innovation, change management and enterprise agility through the creation of new programs and the reinforcement of these topics in existing programs. The Human Resources Management Committee meets bi-monthly. Internal audits are conducted periodically to measure and evaluate progress for ongoing initiatives. 3.1 Major People Development Projects Management Networks 20 The Group Management is organized around two principal bodies: the Executive Committee (EXCOM), and the Management Committee (MCOM). The Executive Committee is placed under the authority of the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and comprises Senior Executive Vice-Presidents and Executive Vice-Presidents in charge of Technicolor’s major businesses and of the principal corporate functions (Finance, Human Resources, Communication). The Management Committee includes the Executive Committee Members as well as leaders of Technicolor’s main functions and business operations. Its responsibilities are to ensure achievement of the Group’s objectives and to provide leadership across Technicolor. Management Academy Job Architecture The Management Academy plays an important role In order to respond to evolving business needs and in the support HR provides to managers in the Group. provide the foundations for a number of HR programs, After a pilot period during which sessions were delivered an update of the Technicolor job architecture has been both internally and externally in the U.S., UK, France and conducted in 2013. Operational managers and HR Belgium in 2014, we evolved the program in 2015 to a teams from all regions have worked together to build truly “bootcamp” for management capabilities at group a consistent framework throughout the divisions and level and in 2016 five sessions of the new program were geographies. delivered: 4 days of collaborative training sessions were As a result, a lean and standardized reference document delivered in UK, U.S., Canada and India, impacting 76 covering all jobs in the Group is now available.

GRI [G4-LA10; G4-LA11] [G4-DMA Training and education] Resource and Development Plans After a pilot phase in 2013, all the divisions and functions now monitor their Resource & Development Plan. The ambition is to provide each division or function with a comprehensive HR roadmap that is fully consistent with the business needs and strategy evolutions. These plans that rely mainly on the existing HR processes and tools are built by Human Resources business partners hand in hand with their business leaders. They aim at identifying HR priorities for the future and detail specific HR action plans to support the business evolutions: hiring policies, evolution and mobility, learning and development priorities and training plans, and all HR-related actions that could support the business transformation. As part of these plans, a comprehensive work has been initiated to identify the evolutions of key jobs. This work includes a review of the mission and responsibilities of jobs as well as the set of competencies that are necessary to achieve excellence in the execution of these jobs. A set of customer facings, R&D and research jobs were the first to benefit from this initiative. A series of learning tracks were designed to ensure the development of crucial competencies and give new perspectives on the evolution of execution in key jobs. Linked with the learning tracks, professional accreditation programs were designed to recognize the level of competencies and achievements of the employees that have followed the tracks. 21 The accreditation program launched in 2012 is now available for 8 jobs, representing 274 persons enrolled at end of 2016: Product/Service Line managers, R&D Project managers, Customer Project managers, Solution Architects, Customer Technical Support, New Product Introduction managers, Product Quality Assurance and Project Sourcing managers. Incumbents of these jobs who have completed all the learning tracks designed for their jobs can be candidates to be accredited in. More than 11,000 hours of training were delivered in this program since it started in 2013. One “Training and Development program” also addresses the specific needs of four key roles identified as critical throughout the Resource and Development Plan process (ex: Producers, Customer Service, Sales, and Heads of Departments). These roles benefit from specific curricula that are defined at job level and delivered internally or externally. The objective is to improve employee engagement and develop and maintain excellence on specific skills that will drive innovation and customer engagement and support the growth of the business in the future. The MPC Academy also supports globally the efforts to develop excellence in our skills and jobs: this program can be defined as an endeavor to bring in raw talent freshly graduated from University and provides training to prepare them to work on shots; it targets graduate level artists who are recognized as high potential but yet to show a full level of competency. Participants benefit from 8 to 12 weeks of training while being paid, followed by 12 months of employment. This program impacted 317 artists in three locations in 2016 (Bangalore, Vancouver, Montreal) – representing 131,736 hours of training. For more details on this program, see section C.3.1 of this report. GRI [G4-LA10; G4-LA11] [G4-DMA Training and education] Talent Review and Leadership Development As we strongly believe that our talents constitute the backbone of Technicolor, a yearly Leadership Talent Review process is conducted in all divisions and corporate functions. The process involves managers at all levels of the organization as well as the members of the Executive Committee and of the Management Committee in the identification of employees with the right level of potential and performance to integrate the Group’s talent pool. The members of this talent pool are eligible to benefit from dedicated leadership development trainings, activities and events during the year. Further to the 2016 Talent Review, the total talent pool represents 9.2% of the exempt population of the Group. Members of the Leadership talent pool were led to assess their competencies through a 360 evaluation against the leadership profile as expanded to innovation and entrepreneurship in 2013. Individual Development Plans were drawn and executed from the conclusions of this assessment. HR Business Partners or coaches were assigned to each member of the talent pool to guide and support the execution of the Individual Development Plans and the development of leadership competencies. The Leadership Development programs included workshops on “Leadership & Influence” where members of the talent pool reflect and learn how to take action not only on their leadership development but also on 22 recognizing and fostering talents of others. These workshops took place in Paris and Los Angeles and gathered participants from all geographic regions. Our support to our employees who have been identified as able and willing to take some group level leadership positions (Group High Potential) has been updated in 2016 to stick to the needs of the Drive 2020 new strategic plan. To do so, we have designed and implemented a Learning Expedition. The purposes of this new program were to raise awareness of future leaders on one key topic for the Company and to prepare them to act and work as one future team. GRI [G4-LA10; G4-LA11] [G4-DMA Training and education] HR Development An HR development program was created in 2011 to reinforce the people development capabilities of HR Team Members and to support the development of skills aligned with Technicolor vision, values and strategy. This initiative has been continued in 2016, and 14 people are fully trained and can operate as internal coaches for High Potentials. Cooperative Programs in R&D In the field of research, emphasis is put on cooperation with educational institutions, public research bodies and other companies to keep the technology pace. During 2016, 13 cooperative programs involving academics were running, involving European as well as overseas educational institutions and public research bodies. In addition, Technicolor contributes actively to several technology clusters, including at the governance level, where it operates R&D activities and has 23 established strong relationships with neighboring educational institutions in close proximity to Technicolor research locations such as Stanford University and Berkeley University (California), and Inria (France). GRI [G4-LA10; G4-LA11] [G4-DMA Training and education] 3.2 Training The objective of Technicolor training policy is to ensure the development of competencies and capabilities are aligned with the Group’s strategy and, simultaneously, support employee’s growth and development. Training priorities are set based on the evolution of existing jobs and technologies, on the identification of new capabilities to develop and on the individual needs of employees in terms of job performance and/or of professional evolution. The creation of specific learning tracks per job has been encouraged in each division, resulting in an optimization of training resources and in an increased number of training opportunities. In order to ensure the same quality level as well as alignment and consistency, development programs regarding Leadership, Management and Technical or Functional skills are coordinated at corporate level. To do so, Talent & Development Center of Expertise supports business heads and HR Business Partners in all aspects regarding Learning and Development. HR Business Partners coordinate the building and monitoring of the Development plans at division or function. Training is implemented locally by the HR Competency Centers who are in charge of ensuring training actions are optimized between the divisions and that training complies with all local regulations. 24 The Technicolor training policy is implemented at three levels: >C  ompany-wide >D  ivisions or Fonctions Technicolor provides development programs for the When updating their Resource and Development Company’s talent pools in order to develop leadership Plan, divisions and functions define training objectives capabilities, reinforce management implication, for the year to come, that will be implemented by local consolidate management skills and meet cultural Human Resources managers on site; integration challenges. Talent pools include executives, high potential employees and other employees with key identified experience and skillsets; > S ites Local HR managers are responsible for training plans that address individual needs as expressed during Objectives/ Performance assessment reviews. As part of this process, each employee discusses and defines specific development plans with his or her manager, including training. They are also in charge of ensuring training initiatives comply with local regulations. Local management tracks consolidation and follow-up. Overall training initiatives offered in 2016 encompass 302,683 hours of training. Additional training hours of informal on the job training activities and discussion groups having taken place in 2016 are not reported.

Based upon the Towers Watson methodology, reinforce our position as a worldwide technology leader overall remuneration policy is structured around flexible, in the media and entertainment sector. Remuneration competitive compensation elements, fixed and variable, policy is tailored to fairly recognize and acknowledge each driven by market best practices as well as the Company’s employee’s contribution to the success of the company. objectives for long-term value creation. Salary benchmarks are reviewed annually with the help of salary surveys which compare general market salary data Each Technicolor unit is free to recognize the potential and with Technicolor salaries. encourage the development of its people according to: >C  ompetitiveness Comparisons with market benchmarks for total compensation in peer companies enable Technicolor to offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring that the Company continues to attract and retain high potential talent in the international marketplace; 25 > E quitable Approach Technicolor remunerates employees on an equitable basis in each of its geographical locations, in line with local standards. Remuneration policy is set according to the Group’s “broadbanding policy” based on each employee’s level of responsibility, experience and contribution to the Company’s success. Remuneration of senior executives is centralized to ensure an appropriate level of governance and consistency and ease international and crossbusiness mobility; >B  usiness and Skills Focus The remuneration of professionals, engineers and managers is a sound, market-driven policy and ultimately administered to stimulate business performance. A substantial part of the total remuneration package is composed of variable elements which drive a performance culture and support the Company’s strategy. These variable elements are meant to stimulate, recognize and reward not only individual contribution, especially innovation and risk-taking, but also and in particular, solid and consistent Group and Divisions performances. At constant currency rate exchange (end 2016) and at constant population of employees (all employees present both in 2015 and in 2016), the evolution of the base salary payroll mass (without variable elements and social contributions paid by the employer) between 2015 and 2016 increased by 4.08%. 3.4 Collaborative Tools Following a demand for increased online collaboration expressed in employee surveys, Technicolor’s Intranet, my.technicolor, was designed to modernize the way our employees work together around the world. My.technicolor offers an enhanced user experience, thanks to: >A personalized homepage with widgets; >A n optimized search engine; >A n intuitive navigation; >C ollaborative tools including Lync; >T he possibility for anyone at Technicolor to contribute to wikis according to their domain of expertise; >C ommunities of interest (mini sites) pertaining to locations, business activities, projects or any other topic; >A new look & feel. 3.5 Working Time Management & Absenteeism Working time is managed according to the needs of Technicolor’s various business activities in both the parent company and its subsidiaries. The Group complies with regulatory obligations and contractual commitments in terms of working time in each country in which it operates. Through various working time management tools, the Group ensures employees do not exceed legal 26 thresholds and are appropriately compensated for any overtime according to their employment agreement. However, a large part of Technicolor’s workforce is exempt and paid a flat rate for a number of days worked per year: worked days are then monitored. Part time and remote working are authorized on a case-by-case basis according to the Group policies and depending on the occupational requirements. At the end of 2016, Technicolor has about 350 part time employees working less than 5 days per week. Over the year, part time employees working at least half time represent 97% of part time employees and part time employees working at least the equivalent of 4 days per week (80% of a full time worker’s time) represent 45 to 50% of part time employees. French “intermittent” contracts are not considered as part time employees. Some activities of Technicolor experience seasonal peak workloads (such as DVD Services) and require significant interim and temporary workers to support client requirements, mainly in the distribution and warehouse sites, in addition to overtime. These seasonal workers are typically directly hired over a period of a few months (temporary) or contracted through a third party labor services company (interim), while overtime for long-term employees is more achievement-related and is used to complete very time-limited peak activity (manufacturing or project development achievement). Interim workers are not included in the year end Group headcount figures, as they are not employees of the Group. The main countries employing seasonal workers are the United States, Mexico, Canada, and to a lesser extent Australia, and Western Europe. Production Services activities such as visual effects, animation and post-production are mainly project based driven activities and rely for a significant part on fixed-term contracts (including “Intermittents” contracts) to be able to adapt team skills mix, experience and size to the requirement and the timeline of the productions, as this is the common rule in this industry. Overall, seasonal interim workers represent about the equivalent of 6,250 full time jobs, while at the peak they may more than double the number of workers present on the relevant sites. Fixed-term contracts and “Intermittents” represent the equivalent of about 2,600 full time jobs across the Group activities. Across Technicolor, total overtime represents about the equivalent of 700 full time jobs. Working time is managed in the Group’s various sites via software such as ADP, Punchout, Kronos, Sisnom and Casnet. There are also some additional manufacturing related tools that track working time such as ScheduAll, Laserbase and CETA. Absences are generally defined on an annual basis in terms of holidays, vacations, personal and family medical leave or other possible unplanned absence such as jury duty, as described by bargaining unit contract, employment contract, or regulation. Throughout the year, each employee categorizes any absence according to its definition, and all absences are subsequently reviewed and approved inside the applicable working time tracking software solution. The average rate of employee absenteeism for sickness and unauthorized absence at the Group level in 2016 was 2.6%.

With a workforce distributed across Asia/Pacific, Europe and the Americas, business activities in more than 30 countries, and acquisitions of companies with diverse business cultures, Technicolor must be able to recruit and retain the most talented candidates from a broad range of disciplines and experiences. Technicolor’s policy is to provide equal employment opportunity without regard to race, gender, religion, national origin, age, or disability status. End of 2015, a global plan for Diversity and Inclusion was launched. The objective of this plan is to improve globally our processes to ensure that practices are not discriminatory at any stage in the Group, but also to promote a mindset of 27 openness and inclusiveness globally and a willingness to bring support and assistance to persons or groups who may be under-represented compared to their regional demographics. The 4 key areas of the plan are gender diversity, disability, aging, and ethnicity. Early in 2016, additional awareness sessions were held in-person with the senior leadership team and also with the HR leadership team. After that, a learning experience focused on reducing and mitigating unconscious bias was offered to the HR leadership team on a pilot program basis with a duration of about four months. The majority of the participants completing the learning experience achieved long term reduction in unconscious bias partnered with decisionmaking tools that assist to combat unconscious bias during critical decisions, as with recruitment and hiring. The next step is to roll out this learning experience to an additional leadership group within Technicolor. Principle of Non-discrimination Non-discrimination and equal employment opportunity policies, based upon the Ethics Charter and locally augmented according to specific legal requirements if needed, including the anti-harassment policy, are implemented at all Technicolor sites. In several countries, managers and supervisors are provided Legal awareness training sessions about anti-harassment and non-discrimination. Several initiatives continued or were launched in 2016: > In France, the “generation contract” initiative to enhance employment of juniors and maintain employment of seniors continued; > In the UK, equal opportunities policy is part of the employee handbook and of the induction for all new starters; > In India, practice was developed to make provision for mutually agreeable extension of employment for senior workers, past the national retirement age of 58. The Bangalore operation also provides a written document concerning local community conditions and advice for new workers moving in from other areas. Partnering with Oxfam India, the Technicolor team supported 18 local teams in the 2016 Trailwalker “Walk for Equality” event, with walks of 50 and 100 km over three days, while also staging a checkpoint along the route for support and hospitality during the 3-day event. GRI [G4-LA12] [G4-DMA Diversity and equal opportunity] [G4-DMA Equal remuneration for women and men] [G4-DMA Labor practices grievance mechanisms] [G4-DMA Non-discrimination] In addition to the role of the management, detection of discrimination cases also relies on the whistleblower policy allowing any employee to confidentially disclose their situation or the situation of a co-worker, without fear of publicity or adverse reaction. Such cases are reported to the Ethics Committee and investigated with the Audit team. Some countries implement in addition an official trust person or advocate for employees if there is a discrimination issue. Overall, about less than twenty-five cases of discrimination and harassment were reported in 2016. Gender Diversity A first program was launched in 2014 under the sponsorship of the EXCOM, in order to better balance gender diversity and increase the ratio of women in business roles, management levels and leadership pipeline. Actions were put in place through a full range of processes and progress continued during 2016: > F our women are now members of the EXCOM, representing 33% of the total number of members. At Management Committee level, five women are now members, reaching 40% of the total number of members; >A  recruitment policy was adopted to encourage gender diversity in senior management positions: 28 Technicolor requires recruitment and personnel search professionals worldwide to ensure that the curriculum vitae of at least one qualified woman is included in every list of finalists submitted for open senior management positions within the Company; > L eadership talent criteria are adapted to secure equity between men and women in leadership positions; gender diversity is integrated in divisions Talent review, which outcomes are presented to EXCOM, including dedicated action plans as needed; In addition, initiatives to promote gender diversity are encouraged locally in India, France, the UK and Poland: > In India, the local Women’s Network continued to build momentum and several specific events were held during the year 2016 such as one week of Women’s Day celebration, 2 Women’s Discussion Circle sessions, awareness sessions on sexual harassment, an awareness session about cervical cancer, and a safe travel to home program was launched that provides transportation and personal escort to women working late to ensure they arrive home safely. Technicolor India also developed outreach information and activity at other entity locations such as JAIN school of animation, ICAT Design and Media College, the Asian Institute of Gaming and Animation, Yellow Tree Academy, and the Maya Academy of Advanced Cinema, all with the idea to attract more women to join Technicolor. Also, women were actively encouraged to participate and to present their papers to the Grace Hopper celebration of women in computing that is India’s largest Gathering of Women Technologists; > In France, an agreement has been reached early 2016 about “Gender Equity”. It includes compensation alignment between men and women, with a dedicated budget, training for managers to appreciate gender diversity, training to support women in developing their leadership and promoting their career; GRI [G4-LA12; G4-HR3; G4-HR12] [G4-DMA Diversity and equal opportunity] [G4-DMA Equal remuneration for women and men] [G4-DMA Labor practices grievance mechanisms] [G4-DMA Non-discrimination] > In the UK, Technicolor continued its engagement with Women in Film & Television Network by continuing to sponsor the Creative Technology Award Category for the 2016 Women in Film and Television Awards. Technicolor continued to attract and retain female talent: with the focus on work-life balance and the engagement with our flexible working policy, we had a 42% increase in flexible working request from 2015 to 2016; > In Poland, women candidates make up at least 50% of the short list for any open permanent position, and the industrial operation actively manages lifestyle expectation concerning shift duration, physical capability, onsite restaurant offerings, and social events. Women are represented in the same proportion as employment for the site’s stakeholder representatives committee, which reviews operational changes and provides input to management. Employment and Integration of Disabled People Depending on national legislations, legal requirements to integrate disabled persons or to hire a specified number or percentage of disabled employees, and thus the definition of a disabled employee, may strongly vary, or may not even exist. Also, labeling, categorizing, or making a record of an employee as disabled may be legally prevented in certain countries or subject to the individual authorization by each concerned employee who may refuse. Therefore, 29 statistics cannot reflect the reality with accuracy. However, beyond the legal requirements when they exist, Technicolor strives to adapt our working places, including factories, to provide equal employment opportunities with no discrimination against disabled people with regard to hiring, training, allocation of work, promotion, or reward, and seeks to eliminate employment barriers and to accommodate disabled employees. In that regard, employment of disabled is part of our non-discrimination policy, and Technicolor has been and continues to be willing to integrate different needs including modified duties, adapted hours, and adapted workspaces. > In France, agreements were signed with labor representatives in support of Technicolor’s ‘Mission Handicap – France’ program, which was launched during the second half and focuses on four critical aspects: increase recruitment of persons with disabilities, provided their competence is in line with the position requirements; encourage job retention and career development of employees with disabilities; develop knowledge and expertise on disability within Technicolor through training and coaching; and increase the use of disabled people from service providers – companies employing people with disability have now been specifically contracted to subcontract dedicated tasks; > In Canada, Technicolor policy recognizes and promotes the hiring of persons with disability; > In Australia, Technicolor partnered with a disability employment agency to hire employees with disabilities, and initial placements were made, progress is on-going; > In the UK, the Mill has partnered with Mencap, a charity, to support Mencap’s initiative to bring seventy young people with learning disabilities into seventy different companies for a week of professional work experience; > In Poland, Technicolor extended effort into families of workers who care for children with disability, providing increased benefits to the family via the worker in these cases. GRI [G4-LA12] [G4-DMA Diversity and equal opportunity] At Technicolor, relations with labor unions and employee representatives are conducted on the basis of constructive dialog and mutual respect. Discussions and negotiations take place at European level with the Technicolor European Works Council and at national level with national or site Works Councils. Fostering such relations is critical to the development of an inclusive working environment and the overall success of the Company Aude Goulon, Human Resources Competence Center for Europe, India & Asia Pacific 5DIALOGUE WITH LABOR UNIONS Under the terms of an agreement with union organizations in Europe, the members of the Technicolor European Works Council meet several times each year. The Council, which consists of union representatives or members of works councils in European countries, addresses topics of a transnational nature. The Council is informed of Technicolor’s European operations in respect of personnel, finance, production, sales, and research and development, and their impacts upon employment and working conditions. It is also informed of major structural, industrial, commercial changes as well as organizational transformations within the Group. In 2016, the Council met twice.

An effective occupational health and safety program, as defined by Technicolor, looks beyond specific requirements of law to address all hazards. Our health and safety programs aim to identify potential risks and take appropriate prevention and severity reduction measures. Accident and injury prevention programs focus on local, site-specific health and safety work groups. Work group members help ensure workplace safety analysis, improvement of written programs and procedures, and training. They also help prevent mishaps stemming from potential physical, chemical, biological and ergonomic risks through inspections and audits, systematic analysis of accidents and incidents, and implementation of corrective measures as needed. 6.1 Managing Health & Safety Corporate EH&S policies and guidelines establish requirements and provide guidance for working safely. They are periodically revised, and augmented when deemed necessary (recent additions provide First Aid or Working Alone guidance). At local sites, programs and initiatives have been implemented to ensure that Technicolor meets its legal 31 responsibilities and operates in a responsible manner by identifying risks and taking action to eliminate or at least minimize health and safety hazards. Translated into six languages, the EH&S Charter is available on the Group’s Intranet, and is displayed at each industrial site. Employee health and safety initiatives were undertaken at many Technicolor sites in 2016, including: > Medical examinations; > Ergonomic assessments; > Vaccination campaigns; > First-aid training; > Wellness programs. In 2016, Technicolor experienced a 5.5 % increase in work-related injury and illness incident rate (number of recordable injuries and occupational illnesses per 200,000 hours worked) from 0.91 in 2015 to 0.96 in 2016. The work-related lost workday incident rate (number of recordable lost workday injuries per 200,000 hours worked) increased similarly to 0.46 in 2016. We are committed to achieve annual reductions in the injury rate at our worldwide operations. More information on our approach to tracking annual progress can be found in section B.3 “EH&S Goals and Progress” of this report. GRI [G4-DMA Occupational health and safety] 6.2 Training People to Enhance Safety Technicolor understands that, because each employee can impact EH&S efforts and performance, it is critical that each employee be provided with appropriate tools, resources and knowledge. EH&S training programs develop awareness and skills that enable employees and contractors to perform their jobs in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and policies and to prevent accidents and reduce risks. Training programs, evaluated during the corporate EH&S audit process, are a core ingredient in the EH&S performance measurement process. In 2016, about 22,990 hours of documented training were provided on a wide variety of topics, from environmental and safety compliance and protection, injury prevention, emergency preparation and response, to occupational health. 6.3 Health & Safety Performance and Progress Assessment Launched more than a decade ago, the Technicolor Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) corporate audit program 32 helps ensure that industrial locations comply with corporate EH&S policies and guidelines as well as applicable EH&S laws and regulations. The audit program has also proved a valuable tool for increasing EH&S awareness throughout the organization, identifying best practices, sharing successful initiatives, creating opportunities for diverse approaches to problem solving, and connecting our EH&S personnel to broader aspects of our multi-faceted business. As part of our objective of auditing each industrial location at least every three years, six locations were audited in 2016. As a result of these audits, potential improvement items were identified and evaluated, and more importantly, appropriate action plans were developed.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 1COMMITMENT TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT Climate change remains one of the world’s most pressing sustainability challenges and Technicolor is committed to environmentally responsible business practices. Technicolor understands that consistent, universally applied standards help each site meet local requirements. Standards also provide a base to encourage people at each location to go beyond local regulatory requirements. This approach has been formalized in the Technicolor Corporate Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) Charter, which provides a framework to manage and foresee environmental risks. We track a wide range of environmental data at 52 worldwide sites, including waste management (total waste generated, landfilled and recycled), energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuels), water consumption, air emissions (greenhouse gas emissions), main materials used and process wastewater effluents. A table showing the 52 sites and a description of our tracking methodology is featured in the “Our Performance” 34 section included at the end of this report. 2REDUCING ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT EH&S principles and concerns affect all Technicolor Local personnel, supported by local EH&S Committees, activities.

GRI [G4-EN6] [G4-DMA Emissions] [G4-DMA Overall] The implementation of Eco-design and sustainable product development methodologies is a key factor in reducing negative environmental impacts associated with production processes. Over the past years, Technicolor has placed sustainable engineering and production processes at the forefront of its agenda which not only benefits the environment but also serves to drive innovation and quality improvement. Geneviève Pinvidic, Connected Home, Head of Engineering 7ECO-DESIGN AND LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT 7.1 Connected Home: A Longstanding Commitment to Eco-design Technicolor started to implement Eco-design guidelines in 2008 and has long taken a positive stance towards environmental issues in the development, manufacture, use and ultimate disposal of its products. As long ago as 1992, we established our own EH&S charter, committing to conduct our business in a safe and environmentally responsible manner everywhere we operate. Our Business Units rigorously observe international standards, such as the ISO 14000 series and especially ISO 14062, which integrates environmental considerations into design and product development.

This calls for reliable Clearly, good “green” design is important to everyone. methodologies and tools. 7.3 Eco-design Methodology Eco-design is an activity that integrates environmental considerations into product design and development without compromising quality and performance over the entire lifecycle of the product. It therefore includes all environmental regulations and specific environmental product requirements including customer expectations. International Standard ISO/TR 14062 covers practices and methodologies relating to the integration of environmental considerations into the product design and development process. It describes examples of inputs and outputs for each phase and the tools that need to be applied accordingly from conception through to market launch. For each product lifecycle state (planning, conceptual and detailed design, testing and prototyping, product market launch, product review, etc.), the actions to be performed to design a product have to be compliant with the product’s target environmental specifications. This eco-design methodology has been merged with ETM (Earlyto-Market) process methodology, which is the Technicolor-specific product development process deployed across the Connected Home division’s development sites and which is compliant with above ISO/TR 14062 international Standard. GRI [G4-EN7; G4-EN27] [G4-DMA Products and services] [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] 7.4 Eco-design Principles and Tools To support the eco-design process, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools are needed to identify and measure the environmental impacts of a product over its entire life (i.e. from the cradle to the grave). LCA is standardized in international standard ISO14040 (Environmental Management, Analysis of Life Cycle). Technicolor’s Connected Home activity has selected the Environmental Information and Management Explorer (EIME) tool which is considered to be the reference LCA evaluation tool for electronic and electrical equipment. It measures environmental impact indicators such as global warming (i.e. CO2 footprint), water eutrophication, resource material depletion, etc., which allow Technicolor to evaluate, compare, improve and communicate product design and environmental performance more effectively.

Technicolor implemented eco-design for all newly developed product families as early as 2008. Based on Technicolor knowhow, current objectives relating to gateway and set-top box are set to provide contributions to European and US energy efficiency initiatives such as the EU Code of Conduct for Digital TV, EU Code of Conduct for Broadband Equipment, EU Voluntary Agreement for Complex Set-top Boxes, US Voluntary Agreements for STBs and Small Network Equipment. Technicolor also provides key contributions to product energy related regulations. 7.8.1 Deployment of 801/2013 across Technicolor Products Technicolor has actively contributed to the completion of the European 801/2013 regulation on the associated guidance document providing practical guidance on the implementation of the regulation in networked products and in 2016 to its revision. 801/2013 regulation establishes eco-design requirements related to standby and off mode, and networked standby, electric power consumption for the placing on the market of electrical and electronic household and office equipment. The requirements in the amended regulation take effect in 5 steps from 2010 to 2019 including 45 tier 2015 (as from January 1st, 2015) and tier 2017 (as from January 1st, 2017). In 2015, all Set-Top Boxes (STBs) and Gateways (GWs) have been made compliant with the 801/2013 tier 2015. In 2016, the challenge was to make all products compliant with the 2017 targets. Even if Technicolor has a deep understanding of the regulation and is able to identify, for each product, the relevant solution to make the product compliant, those targets were really challenging to meet. Compliancy with those 2017 targets has in fact implied deep changes of the software and sometime of the hardware. All opportunities to save energy have been kept to make the product compliant. The main issue came from the regulation which has established power target which does not take into account the provided functionality, and also from some inconsistencies of the regulation which have to be corrected in on-going revision of 801/2013. However, compliancy with tier 2017 was a good opportunity to identify and deploy, when needed, various and innovative solutions. It was also a good opportunity to identify what should be corrected in the future revision and also the change in hardware and software product design to reach the compliancy at minimum cost and workload. GRI [G4-DMA Public policy] [G4-DMA Customer health and safety] [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] 7.8.2 Technicolor Product Eco-design Main Trends Year after year, it became apparent that the best approach to reduce energy and non-energy impacts of products was to propose more compact devices by: > Selecting last generation chipsets having a higher level of integration, characterized by a lower power consumption, using less natural resources, in particular critical metal; > Using smaller electronic cards – thanks to improved integration characteristics of chipsets. The use of smaller electronic cards appears to be the most efficient way to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing, distribution and End of Life (EOL) phase: smaller electronic cards mean less plastic material for product and power supply, mean smaller packaging with less material, mean less weight to transport, and mean less material to process in EOL treatments. But this approach also might have some environmental drawbacks. As the enclosure becomes smaller, the temperature of the box increases and demands larger cooler to evacuate the heat. To this day, eco-design options exist to further reduce the environmental impacts of products but their implementation may be refrained from current business context as illustrated below: 46 > Use of recycled material or less impacting material is limited due to customer requirements in terms of material type, aspect, and color; > Ban of substances that are known to have a negative impact on health or the environment such as phthalates, halogenated flame retardants, PVC material, and their replacement by better alternatives is virtually impossible in a highly competitive market environment where price remains a key differentiator along with functionalities and box aspects; > This issue can only be solved by an amendment of existing regulation requesting the partial or total banishment of these substances.

The topics covered by REACH training sessions have included: REACH information to involve suppliers in the data collection, information on chemicals used to provide to suppliers (manufacturers and importers of chemicals), the authorization process linked to annex XIV, the restriction conditions laid out in annex XVII and the Classification, Labeling & Packaging directive (Dir. 2008/1272/EC). 8.5.2 REACH Initiatives Substances and preparations used, contained and embedded in our products (both purchased products and finished goods marketed in Europe) are closely monitored through our Supply Chain. This monitoring includes the identification of SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) pursuant to the Candidate List, banned substances as 52 listed since May 2009, restricted substances (Annex XVII) as well as substances subject to authorization (annex XIV). Some of our products may contain more than traces (i.e. more than 0.1%) of some of the 173 hazardous chemicals categorized as Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) by REACH. We have begun communicating to our direct clients so as to comply with this REACH obligation pursuant to article 33. Internally, a REACH governance program was set up in 2009. In line with our corporate policy, REACH program management, through REACH network members, are implementing processes to comply with requirements directly applicable by the Business Divisions, such as: > Customer communication process; > Safety data sheets management process; > Controls management process; > Supplier data collection and management; > Uses information for suppliers; > Classification, labeling and packaging of substances (pursuant to Dir. CLP n° 1272/2008); > REACH audits management. Additional processes have been set up in the Sourcing Department, such as the creation/qualification of new components as well as supplier selection and follow up. 8.5.3 REACH Judgment of the European Court of Justice The REACH Regulation provides that, where a chemical substance ‘of very high concern’ for health or the environment because, in particular, of its carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic properties is present in a concentration above 0.1% of the mass of an article, the producer or importer must, in principle, notify the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Similarly, the supplier must inform the recipient thereof and, on request, the consumer of the article. GRI [G4-14; G4-PR3] [G4-DMA Materials] [G4-DMA Compliance] [G4-DMA Public policy] [G4-DMA Customer health and safety] [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] In 2011, a note sent by the Commission to the Member States and a guide published by ECHA specified how the regulation is to be applied as regards substances of very high concern included in articles. In essence, with regard to articles incorporated in goods, those documents provide that the duties to notify and provide information laid down in the regulation apply only if the substance of very high concern exceeds 0.1% in the entire article. By its judgment delivered on September 10, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union recalls, firstly, that the regulation defines the concept of ‘article’ as ‘an object which during production is given a special shape, surface or design which determines its function to a greater degree than does its chemical composition’. However, it does not contain any provisions specifically governing the situation of a complex product containing several “simple” articles. Consequently, there is no need to draw a distinction between the situation of articles incorporated as a component of a complex product and that of articles present in an isolated manner. In those circumstances, the Court rules that each ”simple article” incorporated as a component of a complex product is covered by the relevant duties to notify and provide information when a substance of very high concern is present in a concentration above 0.1% by weight in each such ”simple article”. The Court rules disagree with the interpretation of an ‘article’ as described in the guidance documents produced by the ECHA in 2011. 53 The ECHA guide was planned to be available in 2016 but is still being adapted. For the time being, Technicolor is following the ECHA Guidance documents as published in 2011. 8.6 Energy-related Products ErP (previously EuP) Directive The European Union’s Energy-related the adoption of implementing meaCompanies that join this VIA must Products (ErP) directive (2009/125/ sures (as an indicative list, twelve broad ensure that 90% of their products EC) aims to improve the energy effiproduct groups will be considered with comply with set energy consumption ciency and environmental performance no major direct impact on the Technilimits.

The telecom and multimedia industries have taken steps to achieving a standardized interoperable protocol allowing the transport and delivery of data, voice and content on a single network. This is known today as “triple” (video, voice and data) and “quadruple” (video, voice, data and mobility) play. Based upon these developments, experts have considered that convergence could be extended to the home network in order to support various needs such as home automation, home security and e-health. Since 2009, Technicolor chaired the French association welfare services with the constraints that such services “Agora du Réseau Domiciliaire” which brings together can impose on the network. It is reasonable to imagine key industry and SME players around the concept of many other types of services which are currently not the “smart home” market. The purpose of the Assofeasible due to the silo-like organization of the different ciation was to foster and support any initiative industry sectors fixed and mobile telecomthat could contribute to the opening and munications and multimedia set in place development of this ‘smart home’ market some ten years ago. through complementing existing stanAgora published a white paper stating dards, the introduction of consumer the importance of having a single 56 protection labels, the development home network or common open of technologies and associated ecoplatform regardless of whether systems as well as through suitable wired or wireless via which products regulation and relations with public are interconnected and any services authorities.

Agora energy and traditional home automation but also has also identified the need to have engineers and techencompasses the safety and security of persons and nicians trained to design, operate and maintain this type property including preventive and curative health and of network and associated products and services. In addition and in practice, Agora has built a Smart ‘Sweet’ Home prototype with underlying common platform. This common demonstrator has been built in 2012 to illustrate and develop usage scenarios and was upgraded in 2015 with the state of the art product technologies and services, showing advanced solutions which further reduce ‘silos’ with first ‘domocompatible’ labeled products and services. Members of Agora are keen to emphasize the association’s European credentials. Many members are part of standardization initiatives both in Europe and further afield which is of obvious benefit to those both within and outside the association. Moreover, members of Agora are part of global alliances such as AllSeen. The 2015 prototype was by the way implementing the AllJoyn open protocol developed by that Alliance. The association’s proposals included recommendations on optimum transport layers and ideal technology configurations to be deployed thus making it easier to use and manage devices and networks as well as facilitating the delivery of a myriad of services to the home. In this way, the Agora initiative helped to ensure that the benefits to people and the environment of services such as telecare, home security and power and water consumption controls, for instance, are realized as soon as possible. GRI [G4-DMA Public policy] 10FULFILLING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES 10.1 Acquisitions To identify and understand potential environmental contamination, Technicolor reviews sites prior to acquisition and upon closure. This process not only helps limit financial liability, but also enables us to understand the type and level of support required to ensure that our corporate policies and guidelines are effectively implemented. Once acquired, sites are expected to comply with Technicolor EH&S policies and guidelines, including, for example, development of sound management practices for chemicals and waste. 10.2 Environmental Clean-up Spending on environmental remediation clean-up projects totaled approximately € 1.77 million in 2016. Soil and groundwater contamination was detected at TCETVT, a former manufacturing facility in Taoyuan, Taiwan, that was acquired from General Electric in 1987. In 1992, the facility was sold to a local developer. Soil remediation was completed in 1998. In 2002, the Taoyuan County Environmental Protection Bureau (“EPB”) ordered remediation of the groundwater 57 underneath the former facility. The groundwater remediation process is underway. EPB and TCETVT continue to negotiate over the scope of that work. Technicolor has reached an agreement with General Electric with respect to allocation of responsibility related to the soil and groundwater remediation. GRI [G4-DMA Environmental grievance mechanisms] Sustainable supply chain management is integral to robust corporate citizenship. To ensure that our guidelines and policies are well understood and respected, Technicolor proactively engages with key electronics manufacturing partners and conducts regular audits to assess compliance with environmental and social regulations and practices on a worldwide basis. Mung Siung Mu, Sourcing Manager, Supplier Quality Assurance China C. EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS 1RESPONSIBILITIES TO SUPPLIERS Delivering products and services to our customers involves numerous external supply chain partners. We aim to fulfill our social responsibilities and ensure that our values are respected throughout. Beyond raw material and component purchasing, the main areas where Technicolor subcontracts production and services are the manufacturing of set of boxes and gateways (96%), and part of the logistics of the DVD services in Europe (35%). In addition, to manage seasonal peak workloads within DVD services, Technicolor uses contracted labor services to provide additional workforce on packaging and distribution sites in America, where site headcount may double during the peak season. To ensure supply chain CSR compliance, we audit our suppliers, promoting progressive labor and social standards, environmental protection and fair business practices. The Technicolor Supplier Ethics Program: 58 > Ensures that Technicolor suppliers respect our policies and program requirements > Promotes economic and social welfare through the improvement of living standards and support for non-discriminatory employment practices. Technicolor actively seeks suppliers with similar interests and ethics commitments. Suppliers are expected to adhere to these basic principles: > Tolerate no discrimination and encourage diversity; > Promote best working conditions; > Use no child or forced labor; > Protect peoples’ health, safety and the environment; > Support employee development; > Respect fair market competition; > Strive to be a good corporate citizen; > Respect consumer and personal privacy; > Avoid potential conflicts of interests.

Connected Home Quality Management System With an emphasis on continual improvement, the Connected Home Quality Management System encompasses both pro-active and reactive quality control. At its core lies the objective of enabling employees to achieve the highest possible levels of quality in their work, ensuring that customer quality assurance is always under control, any necessary improvements identified and implemented and customer satisfaction thus continually strengthened. Quality also helps reduce costs: high-quality products and services have lower warranty repair costs. That explains why we include quality as a key element in our product development and maintenance policy and guidelines, which outline the entire design and manufacturing process. We track progress through a combination of internal and external assessments and measurements, which ensure best practices are shared across the Division, areas needing improvement highlighted and non-conformities solved. Internal audits make it possible to continuously improve business processes and product development while minimizing problems and risk. Various quality certifications from independent third parties boost quality management efficiency and effectiveness and help ensure that Technicolor meets stringent internationally recognized standards. Conformity to the ISO 9001: 2008 standard helps foster a culture of continuous improvement while increasing customer confidence in our products and services. 62 ISO 9001 increased efficiency and productivity for customers Thanks to the deployment of our quality management and suppliers, improved conditions for workers, system, most of our Connected Home sites are certified, economic development, and a cleaner environincluding those in Issy-les-Moulineaux and Rennes ment for local communities; (France), Edegem (Belgium), Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shangai and Beijing (China), Indianapolis and Law>M  ission: To deliver these benefits through a renceville (USA), Manaus (Brazil), Monterrey (Mexico), shared approach to implementing the EICC Code Chennai (India) and Sydney (Australia). of Conduct.

GRI [G4-15; G4-PR5] [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] Customer Satisfaction Survey One of the most important ways of identifying possible improvements to our products and services portfolio is the customer satisfaction survey which covers the entire Technicolor worldwide customer base. The goals of this survey are to measure customer satisfaction with the Group’s products and services, better understand customer expectations and their perception of the Company and take any remedial measures identified as being necessary. The programbased survey enables customers to provide rapid feedback on program deployment (Early-To-Market) and product quality including meeting customer specifications and timing.

The system structure and attention to customer expectations as highlighted in the customer satisfaction survey enable Technicolor quality management to embed awareness of quality in all organizational and operational processes at all levels of the Company with a view to achieving the highest possible quality in both products and services. GRI [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] Continuous Process Improvement (CPI) at Technicolor DVD Services is a constant effort to improve how we can do our work better. Its importance is based on the fundamental belief that the vast majority of operational problems are process-based rather than people-based. Technicolor’s approach is to rigorously determine root causes of issues and design and implement process improvements that are proven to address problems via evaluation of results. A structured approach to CPI based on prior year experience, allows DVD Services to materially improve its quality and associated environmental, health and safety standards on an annual basis. John Town, DVD Services, Head of Technology & Quality 2.4.2 DVD Services As the world’s leading optical disc manufacturer, Technicolor places the highest priority on the quality of its products and services. The DVD Services division, which specializes in high-volume production and full turnkey services, provides complete supply chain management services for Hollywood studios, software publishers, game publishers and independent rights holders. In 2016, Technicolor sold a total of 1,552 billion DVD, Blu-rayTM and CD discs and has annual capacity to produce in excess of 3 billion discs, allowing the flexibility to respond to the seasonal demand for packaged media. Operations are supported by approximately 10.5 million square feet of dedicated replication and distribution space, with unique capability for the timely delivery of discs to more than 40,000 locations. Global Network A global network of quality experts manages the division’s quality policies and practices, including supply chain challenges. Quality network members consist of experts located at each site, supervised by regional U.S. and international personnel and a worldwide coordinator reporting directly to the head of the division. The members of an independent Continuous Improvement Program team help ensure constant improvement in quality processes. 65 Improving Quality and After-sales Service Customer Satisfaction Surveys The DVD Services division maintains an ongoing dialogue with major customers through: > Regular face-to-face meetings on overall performance; > Weekly/monthly/quarterly KPI reporting; > Quarterly performance scorecards; > Service level agreements with measurement criteria for most customer contracts.

It includes rules that structure activity and clearly connect each customer and supplier to a specific flow path. The 5S Visual Shop Floor Management system helps simplify the work environment, reduce waste, improve quality and enhance safety. CPI and Best Practice Sharing Best practices, identified through Best Practice Sharing Workshops, ISO internal / external process audits, are shared within the Technicolor Continuous Improvement Program. In 2015-16, major focus was placed on significant footprint/re-structuring changes in packaging and distribution centered around the addition of new clients/business and the ongoing consolidation of US-based activities. Numerous ‘Continuous Improvement’ projects were implemented that were derived from structured review of DVD Services Quality including identifying a Top 10 list of opportunities to improve customer experience via process improvements. Weekly discussion and collaboration sessions are conducted between WW site-based QA Leadership under the guidance of SVP Quality. 66 The CPI approach adopted is to identify areas of opportunity and target specific problems. Solutions are generated through brainstorming among the QA Leadership team and formulating procedures that can be deployed at all locations. Further weekly meetings are used to discuss execution and measurements of success. 3COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 3.1 Educational Initiatives Technicolor focuses its involvement in community initiatives on digital artist education. MPC Academy is an educational initiative of the Group to help bring new talent into the visual effects business. It is an in-house finishing school. We hire candidates with some education in a specialty within our field, and train them up to the level where they are ready to work on feature film visual effects. Growth in the Montreal, Vancouver, and Bangalore studios comes with a large demand for talent. The educational institutions in these areas do not graduate talent with the necessary skill sets in the quantity demanded by the industry. In response, MPC (The Moving Picture Company) decided to be proactive and started this initiative to develop our own talent. We created in-house training space with industry standard equipment in Montreal, Vancouver and Bangalore. We offer paid employment for a one-year contract where they will spend from 8-12 weeks in full time training. Those who graduate transition into their department where they work on feature films. GRI [G4-SO1] [G4-DMA Training and education] [G4-DMA Local communities] [G4-DMA Product and service labeling] Our first Academy run in our Canadian studios was in the autumn of 2014 and in our Indian studio, mid 2015. The start of 2016 brought our fifth run in both the Montreal and Vancouver studios, and our third run in Bangalore. The departments we have trained for are compositing, lighting, FX, digital matte painting (DMP), animation, roto prep and match-move. Since this project began, MPC has trained 284 artists globally. The project has been a success and continues to be a central part of our talent strategy in Canada and India. It represents an excellent opportunity for young people in the communities in which we operate to break into the film visual effects business. It is challenging to get a chance to work in visual effects and the MPC Academy opens the door and provides this opportunity. It is an investment not only in our own future talent, but in the communities where we operate. Access is not limited to the national citizens, but open to talent around the world, wherever they come from. We have welcomed Academy students from Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, Columbia, Indonesia, China, Japan, Korea, together with India, North America and Europe. Hundreds of young people, who may not otherwise have been given a chance, have been provided an opportunity to join our creative community. They have the support of a full time trainer in the department they are preparing for, and they are given detailed feedback along the way so they understand what they need to do to succeed. The majority of those hired into the Academy have graduated and gone on to complete their first year contract. After a year, many have received subsequent contracts from MPC and others have gone on to work for our competitors. We see that as a validation of the success of the Academy. Visual effects is a show-based cyclical business. 67 Artists tend to be contract-based and work at a variety of companies on different projects. We believe that since we took a risk and invested on emergent talent and created an excellent experience for their entry to the business, that they are likely to return to MPC because of the loyalty inspired. Overall, this program allows us to contribute to local economies and employment, and can help grow a larger available talent pool for the industry cluster. We aim to source all of our future junior talent in compositing, lighting, FX and DMP in Canada from Academy graduates. Our heads of department have expressed satisfaction with their performance and we have many cases of Academy graduates performing well above expectations. We see this as a partnership between the Group and local education establishments make the countries we work in attractive to creative talent. To this end, further steps are being taken to better prepare students while they are still in school. We have held events in both Montreal and Vancouver to invite the local colleges and universities to MPC and offer our help to better prepare their students to work in visual effects. Subsequent events have been held in Montreal including an “educator’s week” in January 2016 to provide hands on training for educators in our studios using our tools. MPC Academy represents both a central strategic talent initiative and a way for the Group to give back to the community. It helps bring social and economic benefits to the cities we work in as every Academy student will need to live, travel, eat and play in their communities. As these communities become recognized as great places for creative talent it will attract new work and companies as well as stimulate other spin-off businesses. It is a great example of a win-win situation where doing the right thing is also good business. GRI [G4-SO1] [G4-DMA Training and education] [G4-DMA Local communities] 3.2 Local Initiatives and Impacts on Local Communities Manaus, Brazil Started in 2010, Technicolor’s reforestation program in Manaus involves the planting of acai berry trees renowned for their ability to absorb greenhouse gases in deforested areas of the Amazon. In this way, program participants not only contribute to tackling deforestation which is responsible for 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions but also help raise the awareness of fellow employees and residents as regards the importance of preserving natural resources and how we all play an important part in the fight against global warming. 2013 saw about 5 000 seedlings of the species planted in the area covered by the program. Manaus also received the Certificate of Partner of Nature Company Seal at the 7th Latin American Conference of Environmental Conservation in 2013. This Seal is awarded to companies that commit to minimizing impacts on the Environment, and to implementing socio-environmental measures. 68 The Manaus site is also harvesting rainwater and is sharing the part that it does not use with the community via redirection pipes the site paid for. It also organized a Dengue vaccination program awareness campaign.

Bangalore also organized and participated in an Oxfam trail walk event to fund rural development projects. Other Sites The Brampton site organized three charity events in the year in support of sick kids hospital, Canadian cancer society, and the Heart and stroke foundation. New York MPC participated in local charity collections; and made tours and presentations at various schools. Montreal MPC organized clothing donations to a local hospice as well as food drives for local shelters. The Mikros site in Paris organized projections for employees of the film “Tomorrow” which explores the landscape of new initiatives around the globe to make the world more environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive. Mikros also partners with the Gan foundation for the cinema where it provides post production services within a fixed envelope to winners of a yearly prize created by the foundation in favor of first or second 69 feature films.

In 2016, worldwide energy use was approximately 1,633 tera joules, an increase of about 45% compared with 2015, driven mainly by acquisitions. Of the total energy consumed, 88.6% was in the form of electricity (of which 16.8% was from renewable sources), 11.2% was in the form of fossil fuels, and 0.2% was in the form of purchased steam. When compared to total revenue, average energy intensity was 0.334 TJ/ M€ across the business in 2016. (2) N on-industrial sites reported water consumption for the first time in 2010. Their usage represented approximately 15% of total 2012 consumption. It represented 20% in 2016. In 2016, water consumption at the Technicolor reporting locations increased by about 56% versus 2015 to 709 thousand cubic meters, driven mainly by acquisitions. When compared to revenues, average water consumption rate was 0.144 km3/M€ across the business in 2016. (3) H azardous waste generally includes most waste chemicals, fuels, oils, solvents, batteries, fluorescent light bulbs, or items such as cleaning materials or containers that may have come into contact with hazardous materials. (4) S ix of our industrial sites use water in their industrial processes. To measure the impact of effluents after treatment and before discharge into the environment, we took into account 100 substances considered “priority pollutants” by both the European Union and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Based upon these lists and information received from the sites regarding the parameters they are required to monitor and report on, 13 pollutants were identified as listed by the EC, the EPA, or both. For reporting year 2016, the amount of effluents discharged was 115 thousand m3 and the total estimated amount of discharged priority pollutants was 126 kilograms. (5) C ommitted to customer satisfaction and continual improvement in products and services, Technicolor tracks the performance of its business units and segments compared to competition. We measure the entire customer relationship, to highlight strengths, weaknesses and expectations. We identify key satisfaction drivers to understand what is most important to customer satisfaction. We spotlight areas needing improvement to develop the most appropriate solutions. For the 2016 period, Technicolor plans to conduct a new customer survey in 2017.

Given the diversity of our operations, environmental impacts vary by location, thus not every location is required to report on each of the established metrics. The Corporate EH&S Organization has identified key information that is tracked and reported. This information includes utility consumption, waste generation, recycling and disposal, air emissions and water effluent from the identified locations. To ensure the timely and consistent reporting of information from our worldwide locations, Technicolor has developed its own electronic reporting system. This system serves as a vital tool for identifying and acting upon trends at the reporting site, business unit, regional and global levels. The reporting locations provide required data through the electronic system on a monthly and annual basis, depending upon the information provided. Data is organized and consolidated globally and is communicated to all appropriate stakeholders.

Data Verification: Data reporting requirements, and data collection and consolidation systems are developed by the Corporate EH&S organization and are communicated to locations through each of the Regional EH&S groups. Each location is responsible for developing internal systems for the collection of required data and reporting that data to the Regional EH&S group. The Regional EH&S groups review the submitted data for accuracy and work directly with the locations in their region to clarify and when necessary, resolve inconsistencies. In addition, the location’s data are reviewed during scheduled Corporate EH&S audits. GRI [G4-6] B. PERFORMANCE REVIEW 1CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT An independent, not-for-profit organization which deals with climate change, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) has become the global standard for carbon disclosure methodology and processes. Technicolor has been responding to the CDP since 2008. You can consult Technicolor’s responses to CDP at: www.cdproject.net/en-US/Results/Pages/Company-responses.aspx?company=19100 2EIRIS EIRIS is the leading global provider of independent research into the social, environmental and ethical performance of companies, providing comprehensive research and benchmarking on more than 2,800 companies to retail funds, banks, charities, and other stakeholders. EIRIS is a signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Investment. Technicolor replies every year to the EIRIS questionnaire. 3GLOBAL COMPACT 75 Technicolor has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003. Technicolor business practices and principles, in terms of ethical standards, safety and environmental initiatives and fair business practices, meet or exceed the goals embodied in the UN Global Compact initiative. The Company submits each year a Communication on Progress (COP) as part of its support and engagement in favor of the Global Compact. For the latest annual update on Technicolor initiatives and the UN Global Compact, please visit: www.unglobalcompact.org/ New for 2016, the table featuring the year’s actions and results with regards to human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption, is included in the present report and an integral part of Technicolor’s Global Compact COP (see following pages). 4GRI Technicolor follows the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines, a worldwide reporting framework on sustainability, to structure its economic, social and environmental reporting. The Group committed in 2013 to publish this information according to GRI3.3.1 Guidelines for the 2014 reporting period. For 2015 and 2016, Technicolor has prepared its Sustainability Report ‘In Accordance’ with the GRI G4 Guidelines – Comprehensive option. The Group submitted the reports for the GRI Content Index Service, and GRI confirmed the accuracy of the GRI G4 Content Index. The G4 Content Index points to particular pages both in the Annual Report of the Group, which is externally verified in compliance with French law, and in the Sustainability Report, which is not externally verified. Both reports include GRI Disclosure labels (for example [G4-3], [G4-EN1], [G4-DMA Compliance]) that help readers locate the information that they are looking for and contribute to give more control over the transparency and integrity of the Group’s sustainability data. You will find hereafter the GRI G4 Content Index including standard disclosures clustered into six categories (economic, environmental, labor practices and decent work, human rights, society, and product responsibility).

Other WebEx and online training courses focused on the EU Competition-Dealing with Competitors, anti-corruption and bribery regulations and policies. The Americas population has received training on anti-bribery, competition, anti-corruption, business communications, addressing employee concerns, fraud prevention. In-person and WebEx trainings took place in Paris and Atlanta in 2016 (notably targeting the Legal group), focusing on the prevention of TECHNICOLOR anti-competitive practices, on anti-corruption and bribery regulations and policies, and data protection. 2016 Actions and Results In addition, several in-person trainings took place in Mexico, India and China on various aspects of the Company’s Code of Ethics. Combined, these training sessions involved more than 10,000 employees from 2010 through 2016; The comprehensive Technicolor commitment to prevent corruption, formalized in our Anti-Corruption policy, seeks to not only comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anticorruption and anti-bribery regulations like the UK Bribery Act and the French Criminal Code, but to avoid even the appearance of questionable conduct in connection with Technicolor operations. The policy was revised in 2012 to recognize additional countries with laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption. In 2016, the Compliance teams of Technicolor have been working on preparing another update to the policy, to be issued in 2017, in order to take into account regulatory changes in certain countries.
