January 25, 2017 Ant√≥nio Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 LETTER OF COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS (COP) Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm that Reelcause, Inc. continues to support the principles of the Global Compact on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Now more than ever we face the responsibility of dedication to the Global Compact and undivided commitment to its principles, our stakeholders and the public. In the last 12 months Reelcause Inc. co-supervised a Public Private Partnership that is teaching orphans in developing countries the value of art as a way of dealing with trauma. The art the children create is used to create designs for products that will begin being sold nationally in the US in the Spring of 2018. Royalty revenue from sales goes to a trust fund that benefits all of the participating children, not just the children whose designs are used. To help break the cycle of poverty, 85% of the royalty income goes directly to the children when they reach the age of 18 and find it necessary to leave the orphanage. Now they will receive a check as well as a handshake. Reelcause Inc. will continue to help advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals, and we further commit to report on progress one year from now per the Global Compact COP policy. Kind Regards, Michael Jacobson CEO, Reelcause, Inc.
