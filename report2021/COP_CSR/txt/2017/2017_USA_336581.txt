Why Employee Health and Safety Matters Our business depends on the health and safety of our employees, our customers and our neighbors worldwide. Our health and safety goals, investments and continuous improvement efforts speak to our fundamental commitment to our stakeholders. Governance To drive a culture of safety, we have a global Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Policy and regional EHS policies for all facilities. The seven-member Global Safety Skills Team comprises leaders from our four major regions (North America; Latin America; Asia Pacific; and Europe, the Middle East and Africa) plus representatives from our Land Management, Global Packaging Accessories and Flexible Products & Services business units. The team reports to our group and division presidents. We also have an EHS management team that provides support to our manufacturing operations and safety committees at each plant. Safety committees are comprised of facility-level management and laborers. We escalate any safety compliance tasks that our employees do not report as complete in our compliance management system through our chain of command and ultimately to the CEO if compliance goes unaddressed. To ensure the integrity of EHS management and compliance with all policies, laws and regulations, we conduct third-party audits of our facilities every two years. To ensure contractor safety, we have a Contractor Safety Policy and contractor safety training. Our aspirational goal will always be to achieve zero medical incidents. To this end, we work to lower our Medical Case Rate (MCR*) by at least 10 percent year over year. * MCR, or Medical Case Rate, measures the number of recordable injuries per 100 full-time employees in a 12-month period. EMPLOYEE HEALTH & SAFETY We reduced our MCR by 20 percent from 2015 to 2016. Performance Chairman’s Safety Employee Health and Safety Excellence Award We honor each manufacturing, warehouse and distribution 2 MCR* LWCR** facility that achieves a MCR of less than one and an EHS audit 1.8 score of 90 percent or greater with the Chairman’s Safety 1.86 Excellence Award.

In 2016, we expanded the program from North America to our Latin American operations. Of the 270 Medical Case Rate managers that participated in 2016, 152 are from our Latin American operations. We proudly announce that in 2016 we achieved our lowest MCR in the history of the company, with 58 percent of facilities achieving a MCR less than one and 52 percent of facilities achieving a MCR of zero. We achieved this record safety year through the placement of more safety resources in our regions and consistent safety messaging. The average number of safety 73% training hours for Greif production employees in 2016, up from 14.4 in 2015. In total, Greif production employees received 214,888 hours of Reduction in MCR since 2007, safety training. improving from 3.51 to 0.96. As industry safety programs have evolved to emphasize risk elimination rather than injury response, companies have seen a commensurate reduction in injury rates. Despite this reduction, the rate of serious injuries and fatalities (SIF) in the industry has changed very little. While incident rates for SIF have decreased at Greif, we pay close attention to Commitment-Based Safety the lessons learned in the industry. Therefore, Greif formed a SIF Global Workgroup in 2016 to investigate research Our Rigid Industrial Packaging & Services North America surrounding SIF events and ways to advance our own Commitment-Based Safety program, launched in program for addressing them. As a result, Greif will launch a 2015, continued to mature in 2016. In daily meetings, new Life Changing Event and Fatality (LIFE) Program in 2017. employees identify personal risks associated with their role, verbally evaluate their safety performance, rank their safety performance and make personal commitments to take responsibility for their actions. Why Energy and Emissions Matter When we produce our products efficiently, our bottom line improves, we reduce emissions that contribute to climate change and we gain a competitive advantage with our customers. Governance We primarily manage our energy and emissions through our Global Energy Team and business unit-level management. The Global Energy Team, consisting of 12 employees representing engineering management; plant operations; real estate; factory maintenance; energy management; manufacturing; quality management; production maintenance management; business unit management; environmental, health and safety management; and technical management, is responsible for applying the Greif transformation plan in the context of energy efficiency. They work with business unit leaders to create an annual energy road map detailing how each business unit will reduce energy consumption. In 2016, the team developed our 2020 energy-reduction and emissions-reduction goals. The Global Energy Team will work with the business units in 2017 to craft roadmaps to reach these 2020 goals. We consider energy efficiency as a factor in capital expenditure decisions. 10 percent reduction in energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of production, from a 2014 baseline.

Total does not include 246,000 metric tons of CO2e from biogenic sources SmartWay is an organization administered by the U.S. government and designed to encourage businesses to manage logistics in an environmentally responsible way. Transportation organizations who join SmartWay aim to voluntarily achieve improved fuel efficiency. Greif’s SmartWay-approved carrier base accounts for 71 percent of miles traveled. SmartWay certification continues to be part of our new carrier certification process.

In total, 54 customers have used the tool so far, strategy and best practices. 11 of which are among our top 20 customers globally. WASTE Why Waste Matters Part of Greif’s transformation plan is to attack waste—reducing operational waste, packaging waste and waste to landfill. Achieve 90 percent waste diversion from landfills for all Adopting a waste-reduction mindset drives efficient North American facilities business practices, results in less shipping and offsite transport and generates cost savings. Since 2012, we have saved more than $457,000 through efficient packaging practices and reduction of offsite transport. Not only is this beneficial for Greif, it is beneficial for our people and our planet. Governance In 2016, we established a zero-waste team consisting of representatives from each North American business Achieve 90 percent waste diversion from landfills for all unit. These representatives set a waste baseline for each facilities globally facility and are accountable for their business unit’s waste management performance. Senior managers, facility managers and line managers are holding teams accountable for reducing waste, and environmental health and safety personnel help manage hazardous waste at the facility level. We invest capital in waste reduction and Kaizen-type events are held regularly throughout the facilities to engage employees and generate waste reduction ideas. Waste management is factored into our senior management’s annual Eight of our North American facilities achieved waste performance reviews. Looking forward, we plan to diversion from landfill of 90 percent or greater, four of expand these efforts to our international operations. which achieved 100 percent diversion from landfill.

This family of products incorporates polyethylene derived from sugarcane. A team from our Brazil operations initiated a project to reduce the weight of plastic bottles without reducing the mechanical properties required by the filled product. The result is the innovative DoubleGreen Mono/ COEX bottle, a one-liter plastic bottle that is 28.5 percent lighter than its predecessors, reducing product costs and preventing waste. In 2017 we will analyze waste at our Riverville, Virginia, paper mill and determine options for reduction, reuse or recycling; pursue fiber drum reuse; and continue to work with the U.S. Business Council for Sustainable Development and others to find beneficial reuse programs for our waste streams. Why Enhancing Livelihoods Matters Greif believes in giving back to the communities in which we live and operate. The ways in which we give back are determined by our employees at a local level. In past ENHANCING years, we have led efforts to bring water backpacks to those in need in developing countries. This work will continue under the direction of Partners for Care. packH2O® Program LIVELIHOODS Management Developments Launched in response to Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake, packH2O is an economically viable, ergonomic, light, collapsible and sanitary solution to potable water transportation and storage. From 2010 through 2016, we distributed approximately 224,000 packs, positively impacting an estimated 1.1 million individuals across 42 countries. Going forward, Partners for Care will take the lead in distributing packH2O and providing training to the local communities on sanitation and the use of packH2O water backpacks. Greif will move from a manufacturer to licensor to bring about more direct involvement from the organizations we support.
