Thank you for your continued patronage of the Dai-ichi Life Group. With the birth of Dai-ichi Life Holdings, Inc. on October 1, 2016, the Dai-ichi Life Group shifted to a holding company structure. Following our New Foundation via demutualization and listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in April 2010, we have named this shift to a holding company structure the second stage of our New Foundation, as our entire group pulls together to gain even faster growth. We will continue our philosophy of Customer First that we have had since the founding of Dai-ichi Life in 1902, and continue to be By your side, for life for each of our customers, no matter how the times may change. To ensure this, we must continue to engage in greater innovation, to contribute to community development and to greater peace of mind and better lives for people in various different regions, by achieving sustainable growth and value creation at each of our group companies. We look forward to your continued support of the Dai-ichi Life Group in the future. Meaning of continuing to stand By your side, for life Continuing to stand By your side, for life. It means that we will continue to change ceaselessly, with the aim of becoming the best for customers and society. Looking back on our history of more than a century, we have continued to grow, while creating value, by walking the best path, always thinking of customers first. This policy of the Dai-ichi Life Group, to pursue our business and in so doing to create value for our customers and society, is expressed by us as DSR, which stands for Dai-ichi's Social Responsibility. Taking the initial D from Dai-ichi we wish to express our distinct concept, which goes far beyond the usual framework of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Today, we need to respond to sweeping changes more agilely than ever before, since we are doing business in the modern age when the environment is evolving with unprecedented speed. We will continue to make innovative changes endlessly by polishing our own strengths through the practice of DSR Management. „ªù„ªû 0HVVDJHIURPWKH3UHVLGHQW D-Ambitious , the medium-term management plan the Group is proceeding with Based on this DSR management, the Dai-ichi Life Group is engaged in realizing sustained value creation with the Group's Medium-term Management Plan D-Ambitious covering fiscal years 2015 to 2017. Our focus will be on our three growth engines, namely the domestic life insurance business, the overseas life insurance business and the asset management business, to extend our advantages in every business field, aiming at further growth and breakthroughs. Our recent transition to a holding company structure underpins the expansion and diversification of our business at the global level, while seeking to optimize our group growth strategy and strengthening our governance. Four Ds of the Basic Strategy * ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) is an effort to increase capital efficiency and corporate value by formulating strategies according to profits, capital and risks, taking into account the types and characteristics of the risks. „ªù„ªü 0HVVDJHIURPWKH3UHVLGHQW Medium-term management plan: Initiatives for fiscal year 2016 and after Currently the financial and economic environments in Japan and overseas are undergoing sweeping change, including slower economic growth in emerging countries and the introduction of the negative interest rate policy in Japan. However, the growth strategies of the Dai-ichi Life Group are evolving without interruption. In the domestic life insurance business, we are leveraging our group synergy on an even higher level through our three domestic life insurance company structure, which consists of Dai-ichi Life, Dai-ichi Frontier Life, and Neo First Life, to provide the optimum products and services to meet diverse customer needs through the most suitable channels. In the overseas life insurance business, our aim is sustained growth utilizing the specific strengths of our companies in North America and the Asia-Pacific region. Furthermore, as initiatives to make the three growth engines stronger and more flexible, we will strengthen alliances, undertake new strategies to actively utilize innovation, and create more growth opportunities. Through our comprehensive business alliance with Japan Post Insurance Co., Ltd., we expect the respective strengths of our vast range of businesses to complement and combine with each other to contribute to the development of local communities in Japan by improving the quality of products and services, and to contribute to the development of the communities and economies of overseas countries through the penetration and spread of our high-quality life insurance. In the Asset Management business, in October 2016, one of our Group companies integrated its strengths and resources with the Mizuho Financial Group to make a new start as Asset Management One Co., Ltd. The Asset Management One, one of the largest asset management companies in Japan, aims to become the number one asset management company in Asia, ranking with leading global asset management companies by strengthening its investment capability, product competitiveness and sales capability, while taking in funds around the world by drawing on all of their networks. „ªù„ª† 0HVVDJHIURPWKH3UHVLGHQW In addition, we will make a Group-wide effort on the highest priority strategic issue with so-called InsTech, our initiative to create innovations unique to the life insurance business in terms of both the insurance business and technology for the sake of the future insurance business. In each domain of healthcare, underwriting and marketing, we will be engaged in the creation of newly added value utilizing the latest technologies. Lastly Setting a new mediumto long-term vision of ‚ÄúPeace of mind. In communities and around the world‚Äù as an objective for 2020, the Group aims to become an insurance group that continues to be selected by people around the world. To realize this mediumto long-term vision, the Group will unite in its determination to continue to innovate, by refining its own strengths through the practice of DSR Management, while maintaining what we have preserved since our founding.

The issues and their severity vary by region. Dai-ichi Life leverages its strength of having approximately 1,300 unit offices and approximately 40,000 Total Life Plan Designers in all 47 prefectures across Japan to solve issues facing each region. In the health field, we have concluded cancer awareness agreements with local governments in 41 prefectures (as of June 2016) under which Total Life Plan Designers provide health and medical information to increase the number of people screened for cancer. In addition, amid a sharp rise in households comprising only elderly, we concluded agreements aimed at preventing the isolation of elderly so that elderly can live with peace of mind in communities where they have called home for so long. We have established a system under which a Total Life Plan Designer cooperates with the local government whenever he or she notices something out of the ordinary with an elderly household. Furthermore, employees who have taken the Dementia Supporter Development Class and gained knowledge for deepening their understanding of dementia also carry out activities to deal with patients with dementia. Other than that, we have established a cooperation system with local governments in a wide range of fields, including promoting work-life balance for companies and employees and activities to alert them about bank transfer scams. We have concluded a comprehensive partnership agreement with Hokkaido, Yamagata Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture and Mie Prefecture (as of June 2016) and conduct a host of activities in response to various issues of each region. Going forward, we will continue working to solve local issues together with local governments.

Furthermore, given the serious shortage of after-school care programs, referred to as the barriers of first grade and fourth grade, in recent years, we have also been making efforts to invite after-school day-care centers* since 2016. In addition, since 2013, the Dai-ichi Life Foundation has been providing subsidies to newly established daycare and nursing facilities for purchasing playground equipment and other items with a view to providing children quality daycare. Besides that, the Group is making concerted efforts for full-scale operation by initiatives such as continuous support through employee volunteer activities at the facilities it invited and subsidized, and collaboration and support with local governments to leverage throughout Japan successful examples of our advancement of female employees and activities to promote work-life balance. The measures taken by the Group to deal with the declining birthrate, which also affects the life insurance business, aim at striking a balance between its core business and solving social challenges, such as contributing to improving business revenue including real estate rental revenue and stemming the falling birthrate. Going forward, the Group will comprehensively utilize its various resources to more effectively tackle issues. * This initiative is the first of its kind in the life insurance industry in Japan (according to our research).

Initiatives for InsTech The Dai-ichi Life Group coined the term InsTech as a name for its initiatives to create innovation unique to the life insurance business from both Insurance business and Technology perspectives and makes Groupwide efforts to promote InsTech as a top-priority strategic issue. As part of this effort, we analyze medical big data and other information, including information of approximately 10 million customers held by Dai-ichi Life, which leads to the development of further risk-segmented products and promotion of health of subscribers. This enables us to push ahead with development of new products that contribute to healthier and longer lives. In August 2015, Neo First Life developed the non-smoker discount rider as the first initiative in the hope of supporting efforts to quit smoking, which is one of the elements in promoting health. In March 2016, Neo First Life developed the health discount rider as the second initiative in the hope of helping many customers live healthier and longer through improvement and maintenance of the health condition of those with chronic illnesses. At the same time, Neo First Life started new services that lead to healthier and longer lives through initiatives promoting the health of customers, including providing the benefit of allowing policyholders to use the recipe site, Tanita Employee Cafeteria, free of charge for six months as a service promoting the health of policyholders and a hospital charge prepayment service as a benefit payment service.

We believe the Group's social responsibility is to enhance the sustainability of Japan's social security system by promoting public health. To this end, the Group takes initiatives that contribute to promoting health of people in local communities as well as engages in health management while deeming it important to promote the mental and physical health of employees. External Initiatives (for Customers and People in Local Communities) Basic Policy The Dai-ichi Life Group offers peace of mind through its primary business of life insurance and also takes various initiatives to extensively support customers and the public in promoting health from the position of complementing the social security system. Our Vision We aim to have the healthy life expectancy being extending by providing timely health-and-medical information and cooperating with local governments in promotion activities for preventing the three major illnesses and dementia and so on. In addition, we aim to solve national-scale problems such as stabilization of the social security system and suppression of medical expenses. The healthy life expectancy means average number of years that a person can expect to live a healthy and independently life in both mind and body. Extending the healthy life expectancy and shortening the difference between the average life span and the healthy life expectancy means to realize a longer and healthier life. „ª†„ªù ,QLWLDWLYHVIRU+HDOWKŸú*URXS6XVWDLQDELOLW\DQG0DWHULDO,VVXHV * Reference: The Committee on Regional Public Health Services and Health Promotion, Health Science Council of MHLW (October 1, 2014) Specific Initiatives Provision of information in cooperation with professional medical organizations and local governments We have concluded agreements with professional medical organizations and local governments of 41 prefectures (as of June 2016), and the Group's employees provide customers throughout Japan with the latest health and medical information.

Remuneration of officers Basic policy The basic policy on decisions regarding the remuneration of company officers is as follows. Maintain the transparency, fairness, and objectivity of officer remuneration. Use performance pay to strengthen incentives for improving business performance. Achieve accountability by paying remuneration in accordance with the degree to which company performance indicators chosen on the basis of management strategy are achieved to share returns with shareholders. Use remuneration rates at other comparable companies (based on industry type) as a benchmark when determining specific remuneration amounts to decide whether the amounts are appropriate. In this case, take account of the level of remuneration paid to other company officers and employees and to officers and employees at other companies in industry associations to which Dai-ichi Life belongs. Policy on officer remuneration amounts and how to choose methods for calculating these amounts Officer remuneration for company directors (excluding directors on the Audit & Supervisory Committee and outside directors) is made up of a base amount, an amount tied to company performance, an amount tied to department performance, and remuneration in the form of stock options.

Policies and Regulations Our Internal Control Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group includes basic matters concerning the development and management of a group compliance system. Under this basic policy, matters such as the basic approach to the promotion of group compliance are outlined in Basic Compliance Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group, and specific approval and reporting systems as well as the management method are outlined in Compliance Regulations for Dai-ichi Life Group. In addition, the Company has established the DSR Charter as corporate action principles to continually meet the expectations of customers, society, shareholders, investors and employees for the purpose of contributing to the building of a sustainable society. Organizational Systems The Company is endeavoring to develop and strengthen its compliance system as a Group, taking into account the attributes of each group company, by establishing a Compliance Unit. In addition to regularly convening to monitor the status of group companies, the Group Compliance Committee is developing a system under which it receives reports on important matters concerning compliance from each company and consults with the Executive Management Board, the President, and the Board of Directors as required. The Group is also taking appropriate actions as a Group, such as providing guidance and support to enhance the compliance framework of each group company. The Company has also established a hotline within Dai-ichi Life Holdings (in the Compliance Unit) and a consultation service (with outside lawyers) in accordance with the Whistleblower Protection Act to act as a channel through which employees from the Group can directly report and consult on compliance matters. The Company operates these systems with full respect for privacy so that those who duly blow the whistle or consult are not subject to unfavorable treatment resulting from their whistleblowing or consultation. „ª¢„ªü ,QWHUQDO&RQWUROŸú*RYHUQDQFH Compliance Promotion At the Dai-ichi Life Group, group companies set out annual plans such as a Compliance Program in accordance with the issues identified for each fiscal year and take initiatives for each issue based on such plans, as well as check the status of execution appropriately and revises issues to promote compliance in a plan-do-check-action (PDCA) cycle.

We are committed, on a company-wide basis, to improving soundness through the management and control of the financial base, including risk volume and capital. We have also established a crisis management system and a risk management system to respond to catastrophes and large-scale disasters in addition to our everyday risk management system. Policies and Regulations Our Internal Control Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group and Basic Internal Control Policy include our basic philosophy and policies regarding risk management. The approach used to manage each type of risk is developed in line with our series of Basic Risk Management Policies. In addition, each of the risk management regulations and standards is translated into practical rules, following our series of Basic Risk Management Policies. Organization To ensure the integrity and appropriate conduct of the group, the risk management unit coordinates and implements group-wide policies for risk management in accordance with the group risk management guidelines. The risk management unit also plays a central role in monitoring and controlling the status and integrity of risk management across the group, while also seeking to improve how risk management is exercised. There is also a group ERM committee that sits regularly to formulate risk management policy, monitor compliance, and conduct studies aimed at improving how risk management is exercised. The audit unit assesses the effectiveness and appropriateness of this risk management infrastructure. An audit committee conducts audits of all aspects of risk management at the group, including management personnel. ‰àú1 Risk Management Unit coordinates with other units as appropriate. ‰àú2 Dotted frame shows the entities which Audit & Supervisory Committee makes instruction to, and receives reporting from. ‰àú3 Audit & Supervisory Committee and Internal Audit Unit coordinate with each other. „ª¢„ª° ,QWHUQDO&RQWUROŸú*RYHUQDQFH ERM The Dai-ichi Life Group conducts enterprise risk management (ERM) whereby it undertakes its business activities based on business plans, capital strategy, and similar that reflect the current situation regarding capital, risk, and profits. The risk management unit assesses the suitability of business plans, capital strategy, and similar formulated as part of ERM, and also seeks to improve group risk management while also controlling capital, risk, and profits in an appropriate manner based on the presence, nature, and characteristics of risk through activities such as setting and managing margins for risk. The Dai-ichi Life Group controls the integrity of the group through activities such as consolidating different types of risk and making capital provision on an economic value, book value, and regulatory basis. The management of risk on the basis of economic value is conducted using embedded value (an indicator used by life insurance companies to represent corporate value) and coherent risk assessment techniques. To identify and evaluate aspects that are not captured by the model-based quantification of risk, stress testing is conducted using worst-case scenarios based on possible future events or actual past events, such as financial market panics or large natural disasters. This is then used as a basis for analyzing the factors that influence the integrity of the organization and reporting the results to the board of directors, executive management board, and others, and for considering and implementing management and financial measures and ways to improve monitoring of market and other conditions as required. Crisis Management System The Company has a Group Crisis Management Policy and is pursuing a variety of crisis management responses by comprehensively identifying and managing the Group‚Äôs crisis management status as well as developing a crisis management promotion system in normal times to prepare in advance for preventing crises and for reducing risks in preparation for expected crises. Specifically, we work to avert crises by proactively detecting concerns about a crisis and instructing and alerting group companies and units, in addition to requiring group companies to report events that may cause a crisis. In addition, in times of a crisis, we rapidly establish an initial response system, including a communication system, in order to promptly respond and accurately collect information during a crisis and to implement responses to resolve the crisis in cooperation with group companies. „ª¢„ª¢ ,QWHUQDO&RQWUROŸú*RYHUQDQFH Ensuring Appropriate Operations at Group Companies Dai-ichi Life Holdings focuses on monitoring the supervision of decision making by the Boards of Directors and operational execution at group companies and confirms the status of operational execution.

We prepare an internal control report which verifies that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, based on the results of assessments of the effectiveness of internal control regarding key processes related to financial reporting and financial report preparation system, and submit this report together with the annual securities report. In addition, to confirm the effectiveness of the internal control report, an internal control audit is conducted by an independent auditor.

Policies and other rules on keeping information safe The group's internal governance policy stipulates the core requirements for implementing practices that ensure the safekeeping of group information. This policy serves as the basis for the policy on group information safekeeping, the stipulations of which include the philosophies underlying the safekeeping of group information, and the rules on group information safekeeping that stipulate more specific approval and reporting systems and other management practices. In order to deal with the increasing ingenuity of cyber-attacks, we have set out Group Rules for Handling Cyber Incidents. Organizational infrastructure for information safekeeping Dai-ichi Life has established practices under which important matters relating to keeping information safe are dealt with by the Group Compliance Committee. An information safekeeping group has also been established within the compliance unit to provide a permanent organization for handling the safekeeping of information at group companies. In addition to providing advice and support as needed based on considerations such as the business activities of each group company and the quantity and nature of the information they hold, this information safekeeping group is also involved in implementing appropriate management practices for information safekeeping at these companies. The internal audit unit conducts regular internal audits of how well these measures are operating and reports their findings to the board of directors and executive management board. Implementation of information safekeeping practices In accordance with the laws of the relevant countries, Dai-ichi Life Group has established the policies for the safekeeping of information by introducing security measures where needed and appropriate in order to prevent leaks, loss, or tampering with personal information.

The Dai-ichi Life Group is fully committed to halting the development of any relationships with these forces in all of its transactions to prevent any damage from occurring. Policies, Regulations, etc. Associated with the Handling of Antisocial Forces In accordance with the Group Basic Policy on Handling of Antisocial Forces based on the Group Basic Internal Control Policy, which establishes basic approaches and policies to halt the development of any relationships with antisocial forces in order to prevent any damage, the Company has established Group Antisocial Forces Handling Regulations, strengthening its unified Group-wide stance towards eliminating antisocial forces. Systems for Handling Antisocial Forces The Company has designated the General Affairs Unit to be in charge of streamlining and strengthening systems to block the development of any relationships with antisocial forces or to prevent damage that may occur, taking into account the attributes of each company, in daily operations and has given guidance and support as required in taking an appropriate response as a group. The Group Antisocial Forces Handling Committee convenes regularly to monitor the status of group companies and receives reports on initiatives to eliminate antisocial forces from group companies as Group-wide responses. The Company has made preparations whereby in the event business with an antisocial force is identified, the matter is reported to a director or other officer in a timely and appropriate fashion and efforts are made to promptly cut off the ties in question. Top management is also appropriately involved through procedures including regular reporting to the Board of Directors concerning the handling status of efforts to sever ties with antisocial forces. In addition, to ensure that we have no relations with and to prevent damage related to antisocial forces, the Company is permanently committed to developing close cooperative systems with external specialist organizations, such as local police offices, the National Center for the Elimination of Boryokudan (Organized Crime Groups), and lawyers. „ª£„ªú ,QWHUQDO&RQWUROŸú*RYHUQDQFH Organizational Structure for Severing Relations with Antisocial Forces and Preventing Damage „ª£„ªù ,QWHUQDO&RQWUROŸú*RYHUQDQFH Internal Audit To ensure the financial soundness and appropriate business operations of the Group as a whole, the Internal Audit Unit of Dai-ichi Life Holdings conducts internal audits to assure that internal control framework and activities of the Group are appropriate and effective. The measures and practices necessary for ensuring effective internal audit have been put in place, including those for maintaining the independence of the Internal Audit Unit. Policies and rules Dai-ichi Life Holdings has stipulated the core philosophies and policies for internal audit in Internal Control Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group and Internal Audit Policy for Dai-ichi Life Group (the Internal Audit Policy ). Dai-ichi Life Holdings has also established Internal Audit Regulations for Dai-ichi Life Group in accordance with the Internal Audit Policy to define the principles of internal audit and to effectively and efficiently implement all the activities relating to Group‚Äôs internal audit. Organizational structure Dai-ichi Life Holdings has set up the Internal Audit Unit as an independent organization to ensure its effective checking function to other organizations. The Internal Audit Unit verifies and assesses the appropriateness and effectiveness of internal control framework and activities of the Group, identifies flaws, provides advice for improvement and reports to the Board of Directors, Executive Management Board, etc. on the results of internal audits.

With this background, in May 2014 Dai-ichi Life announced its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), a UN framework for the UN and corporations to achieve sustainable growth. We will continually endeavor to develop employees who always think of others and take action in any situation based on a correct understanding and awareness of human rights. In addition, respect for human rights constitutes the management foundation of companies, and we will aim to become a company rooted in the value of respect for human rights in the pursuit of human happiness. Dai-ichi Life established the Dai-ichi Life Human Rights Declaration (Three Pillars of the Human Rights Declaration) in 1986. We also included matters concerning human rights in the Code of Conduct for employees in order to improve the awareness of employees towards human rights. Dai-ichi Life Three Pillars of the Human Rights Declaration 1. Dai-ichi Life respects basic human rights and makes efforts to foster freedom under the rule of law, equality, and a spirit of mutual aid. 2. Dai-ichi Life works to create employees that are not only corporate citizens, but first and foremost outstanding members of society. 3. Dai-ichi Life works to educate human resources so that they can correctly understand the corporate social responsibility and act accordingly. Dai-ichi Life's Code of Conduct (Excerpt) Employees shall make efforts to have a correct and deep understanding of human rights in general and to respect basic human rights as they fulfill their day-to-day duties.

Human resources support companies, and it is vital to persistently and repeatedly take initiatives aimed at promoting human rights awareness of employees in order to deepen each employee's proper understanding and awareness of human rights issues and tie these into daily activities. Although human rights issues are wide-ranging, we strive to promote human rights awareness on as many occasions as possible, including training by affiliation targeting all employees as well as training for Human Rights Awareness Committee members, and training for newly hired employees particularly focusing on anti-discrimination against Burakumin, promotion of normalization, harassment prevention, and promotion of understanding of LGBT. In fiscal 2015, we conducted training to promote understanding of LGBT for all employees for the first time. Also in fiscal 2016, we set up the LGBT contact point for employees in establishing a system that allows employees to consult about anxieties and concerns related to work. We believe such support that enables each employee to engage in lively participation leads to respect for the diverse values of employees. We will seek to become a company that boosts productivity and achieves sustainable growth by firmly incorporating the value of respect to human rights into corporate actions through promotion of human rights awareness to employees. Human Rights Awareness External Initiatives Initiatives for Customers Dai-ichi Life takes various initiatives for diverse customers while cherishing the value of respect for human rights. Please see Dai-ichi Life's website for details. LGBT-Friendly (Japanese) External Activities Dai-ichi Life is a member of the Tokyo Industrial Federation for Human Rights, and also actively participates in workshops held by government agencies and organizations in an effort to contribute to human rights awareness within the company. „ª£„ª† 6WDNHKROGHU&RPPXQLFDWLRQ Stakeholder Dialogue The Dai-ichi Life Group's Basic Approach The Dai-ichi Life Group holds a stakeholder dialogue every year to provide opportunities for two-way dialogue between outside experts and internal officers and employees as a means of reflecting various stakeholders' opinions in the Group's business activities. We invite experts in a wide range of fields and reflect their opinions and assessments in the Group's business activities taking into account the latest social conditions, with a view to taking high-quality initiatives. * The company name, the affiliation and position of employees and outsiders are at the time. „ª£„ª° 6WDNHKROGHU'LDORJXHŸú6WDNHKROGHU&RPPXQLFDWLRQ To Strengthen Governance -Initiatives at Dai-ichi Life Group and the Roles of Outside DirectorsWe spoke with Mr. George Olcott, an outside director of Dai-ichi Life, about efforts to strengthen the governance of Japanese companies and Dai-ichi Life and the role of outside directors. Outline of the Stakeholder Dialogue Theme To Strengthen Governance -Initiatives at Dai-ichi Life Group and the Roles of Outside DirectorsStakeholder George Olcott, Outside Director * The affiliation and position are at the time when the dialogue was held for producing Annual Report (published in July, 2016). „ª£„ª¢ 6WDNHKROGHU'LDORJXHŸú6WDNHKROGHU&RPPXQLFDWLRQ Q. Changing governance practices in Japan has recently been drawing considerable attention. How do you evaluate the governance of Japanese companies in general and that of Dai-ichi Life? A. I think that the governance reforms of Japanese companies are moving things in a better direction. In the past, a serious problem with Japanese boards emanated from the fact that the board consisted almost entirely of internal directors. As most important decisions relating to the company‚Äôs strategy and investments had been made separately at the executive board, the board of director‚Äôs role was merely to rubber stamp these decisions. Today, however, the culture of external oversight over the decision-making process is becoming more embedded thanks in large part to the introduction of the Corporate Governance Code. The introduction of two or more outside directors is spreading thanks to changes to the listing rules of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The increase in the number of outside directors from two to five in the previous fiscal year at Dai-ichi Life is a good example of its governance reforms. I believe that this has improved the transparency and objectivity of decision making. On the other hand, care needs to be taken in the selection of outside directors. A diverse and balanced board is essential for the promotion of objectivity and avoidance of bias. Outside directors should raise questions about agenda items from various perspectives and question the company executives until they are convinced that proposals made by executives are truly for the benefit of all stakeholders, but particularly shareholders. I think that through this process, management as a whole will move in the same direction. The outside directors of Dai-ichi Life are well balanced, including a lawyer, an experienced investment banker and a person with experience in financial authorities. Dai-ichi Life has a foreigner and two women. Although outside directors are not specialists in the life insurance industry, there is active debate at the board and we express opinions from our various perspectives based on our careers and other experiences. Q. What are your views on the role of an outside director? A. The role of an outside director is not to direct the strategy of the firm or make specific proposals at the board. The main responsibility of outside directors should be to ascertain that the company has clearly set a vision and mission, that this vision and mission makes sense and will increase corporate value and that it has the strategies to realize its vision and mission and the resources to support those strategies. Without full participation in the formulation of the company‚Äôs long term objectives and strategies, it is difficult for outside directors to make sense of the company‚Äôs investment plans and proposals, and to make a meaningful contributions when, for example, a specific M&A proposal is debated at the board. Therefore, it is also very important to hold discussions about not only individual projects, but to hold regular and thorough discussions on mediumto long-term strategies. Checking that the company has effective risk management systems and proper internal controls is also an important role. Q. What are other key governance issues for a global company? A. Among listed Japanese companies, the number of female outside directors has increased quite sharply in recent years, from 150 in 2001 to 816 in 2014. That number is still considerably lower than in almost all other OECD countries. However the number of foreign outside directors is still shockingly low and has barely increased, rising from 232 to only 274 out of approximately 40,000 directors of listed Japanese firms in the last 15 years. Diversity is still a major challenge facing Japanese companies, given the role of outside directors to bring diverse perspectives to board discussions. I also think that there is still considerable scope to reflect the voice of shareholders and investors in the management of Japanese companies in general. In the United Kingdom, there is a lead outside director, and a key role of the lead outside director is to have a clear understanding of how shareholders view the company. The lead director therefore needs to keep in close touch with institutional investors. Japan may not yet be ready for this system, but there are still many Japanese companies that do not give feedback on the results of IR activities, including those overseas, to the board of directors, and I think that this is an issue they should address. At Dai-ichi Life, board members receive regular updates on IR activities in Japan and overseas and it is important for the board of directors to continue to hold discussions where the expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders are truly reflected. I believe that Dai-ichi Life will enhance its international presence in the future. The more that presence increases, the stronger the governance system that will be required. It is important that the company continues its efforts to strengthen governance. Stakeholder Dialogue „ª£„ª£ Specific Initiatives Collection of opinions and requests through various contacts with customers The Dai-ichi Life Group works to improve our products and services by proactively collecting opinions and requests through various contacts with customers such as Total Life Plan Designers (sales representatives), contact centers (call centers), insurance shops (consulting counters), our website, and agents.

In addition, the explanation of management by our executives has been well received by customers. We are intent on continuing enhancing the roundtable conferences and reflecting the feedback therefrom in improvements to our business operations. Customer Satisfaction Survey At Dai-ichi Life, we conduct a customer satisfaction survey to measure the degree to which we are attaining our goal of Maximize Customer Satisfaction, as set forth in our basic management policy.

We will continue understanding customer satisfaction and use our understanding for initiatives aimed at further improving customer satisfaction. „ª£„ª§ Advisory Committee for Business Quality At Dai-ichi Life, we established the Advisory Committee for Business Quality in 2006 as an advisory board to the Quality Assurance Promotion Special Committee for receiving opinions from a consumer-based perspective. More specifically, we consult with the Advisory Committee for Business Quality on issues discussed at the Quality Assurance Promotion Special Committee, with the opinions obtained reflected in improvements to our business operations.

We will continue visiting the National Consumer Affairs Center of Japan and push forward efforts to build a relationship of trust in the community. Seminars and Exchange Events for Managers At Dai-ichi Life, we hold events for managers throughout Japan with a view to providing information to corporate customers (managers) and helping them resolve management issues. Specifically, we hold seminars where specialists from inside and outside the company give lectures, as well as exchange events aimed at exchange of information and business matching among managers. We will continue planning and holding events tailored to the needs of society and communities in an effort to not only improve corporate customer satisfaction but also contribute to the revitalization of local economies and industries. „ª£„ª• &RPPXQLW\DQG6RFLHW\Ÿú6WDNHKROGHU&RPPXQLFDWLRQ Specific Initiatives Collaboration with External Organizations The Dai-ichi Life Group carries out various activities by working with external organizations in order to contribute to the community and society. Specifically, we conduct blood donation activities for employees with the Japan Red Cross, charity sales promotion events to employees with local welfare facilities and organization as the exhibitors, and volunteer awards in conjunction with the Japan Philanthropic Association in order to further enhance social contribution activities of employees. Going forward, we will pursue contribution activities that are needed by the community and society by incorporating external perspectives through close collaboration with external organizations. Blood donation activities for employees Dialogue with Outside Experts At Dai-ichi Life, we regularly conduct dialogues by outside experts and the company's executives in order to utilize various opinions from stakeholders in management. We will continue making efforts so that we can steadily fulfill our social responsibilities and grow by asking about opinions and requests concerning business activities overall and using such information to improve day-to-day activities as much as possible. Stakeholder Dialogue for Fiscal 2015 Partnership with Local Governments At Dai-ichi Life, we assist local communities in resolving the challenges they face by concluding partnership agreements tailored to local governments using our strength of having branch offices throughout Japan. We have established cooperative relations with local governments in a wide array of fields, including cancer awareness agreements under which we mainly provide health and medical information for raising the cancer examination rate and agreements on activities to check up on elderly residents that support the safe living of the elderly. Going forward, we will continue pushing ahead with partnerships with more local governments to support community revitalization.
