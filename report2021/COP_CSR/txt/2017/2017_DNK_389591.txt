Our vehicle fleet solutions business, Copenhagen Global, continues to grow and now forms the backbone of our overall business in terms of financial turnover. We keep adding partnerships to our portfolio of products and services in order to offer our customers a one-stop shop for their land, sea and air fleet solutions. Our motto is “cradle to grave”, meaning that we not only sell or lease a vehicle or boat, but that we also maintain, repair and dispose of it. Our business model for both Copenhagen Global and Copenhagen Contractors is and always will be that of a facilitator and broker – bridging the gap between reputable manufacturers and customers. By being able and skilled to work in remote and hostile locations we add value to both our business partners and customers. We go where others are unable to in order to best support our customers – from Somalia in the south to Iraq in the East. Supporting international organisations and national governmental bodies worldwide with products and services from cradle to grave remains our core business focus, but during the coming year we will rewrite the overall strategy for our company, denoted “Copenhagen Group 4.0”.
