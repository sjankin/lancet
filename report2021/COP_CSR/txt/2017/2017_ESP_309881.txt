The European Commission work group created for this purpose therefore continues to implement a BACKLOG of projects to be carried out in the short and medium term focusing on key sectors to drive competition and potential growth in the European Union, especially with regard to research and development, the digital economy, energy and transport infrastructure, social infrastructure and the environment. Among other actions, the new actions outlined in the European rail transport plan are taken into consideration. Spain, with five corridors crossing the entire country, is to be one of the main beneficiaries. The network, which will criss-cross the country’s territory, should be completed before 2030, and is expected to receive a total investment of 49,800 million euros, of which at least 10% will be covered with EU funds. The Central Corridor will link Algeciras to France through the centre of the peninsula; the Atlantic-Mediterranean Corridor will run from Lisbon to Valencia; a branch of the corridor will run from Portugal to France, crossing the Castille plateau and the Basque Country; the Mediterranean Corridor will link Algeciras to Murcia, Valencia, Catalonia and the French border; and another corridor will run from the Cantabrian Sea to the Mediterranean, linking Bilbao to Valencia and passing through Pamplona and Zaragoza. 18 Sacyr 2015 Integrated Report Picasso Tower Seville, Spain 19 3 Business model and operating environment 3 Business model and operating environment 3.1 Mission, Vision and Values VALUES Excellence Rigor, Talent, Passion MISSION BACKLOG of 26,845 million euros To develop complex infrastructure projects and services that contribute to improving Innovation citizens’ quality of life, Imagination, Creativity, Courage providing opportunities for 191 personal and professional R&D projects development for our employees and creating value for our customers, partners and shareholders Team spirit Trust, Collaboration, Loyalty +22,000 +2.7% employees than in 2014 VISION To be a leading group with Integrity an international focus that Honesty, Transparency is seen as a benchmark 0 in developing innovative, cases of noncompliance with high-value projects, the Code of Conduct that grows steadily and profitably, providing quality employment opportunities for our employees while being environmentally friendly Adaptability Resilience, Pragmatism, Austerity -34% debt reduction with regard to 2014 22 Sacyr 2015 Informe Integrated Integrado Report Organisational Chart Chairman AND CEO Manuel Manrique Cecilia sacyr sacyr CONSTRUCTION CONCESSIONS José Mª Rafael Orihuela Gómez del Río Uzal sacyr valoriza iNDUSTRIAL Fernando Pedro Lozano Sigüenza Sainz Hernández General General General Manager General INTERNAL Secretary of Manager of Strategy Manager of AUDIT Sacyr Executive Corporate and Corporate Finance DIRECTOR Committee Development Aquilino Miguel Heras Carlos & General Dolader Víctor Mijangos Pravia Manager of de Ávila Rueda Gorozarri Martín Legal Services Elena Otero-Novas Miranda 23 3 Business model and operating environment 3.2 Business model CONSTRUCTION CONCESSIONS ¿WHAT IT IS?
