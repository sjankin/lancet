Although this was not on the mine property, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has asserted jurisdiction over the matter. MSHA’s assertion of jurisdiction is being reviewed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission. 2 The figure previously reported for 2015 also included engagements through social media for one of our sites; extracting these engagements gives an average engagement per day per site of 35.

to quantitative performance indicators and other data, Kinross believes our approach to addressing key stakeholder issues is an important gauge of our performance. Our 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report (pages 64-71) provides a comprehensive review of the most significant stakeholder issues facing our operations and projects. Significant developments since that report include: PARACATU, BRAZIL Quilombolas Work is ongoing for a land donation proposal made to the Amaros community. Meanwhile, in 2016 the São Domingos community reviewed and approved the social investment plan proposed by Kinross. Kinross has partnered with that community on several projects, including construction of a community centre; a biscuit factory providing employment for local women; cultural programs; and an environmental monitoring station, among others. Trespassers Kinross has continued to apply human rights principles in all aspects of security operations in response to recurring incidents involving trespassers entering industrial areas to attempt to steal gold from flotation tailings. Trespassing in this area is an inherently dangerous and high risk practice due to the confined space of the tailings pipeline. Kinross has implemented numerous physical barriers to impede access to this industrial facility. Given community concerns about the overall crime situation in the city, Kinross is also working with local stakeholders to pilot programs focused on teaching life skills to youth. Community Health The latest round of scientific studies on the potential human health effects related to the presence of arsenopyrite in the ore mined at Paracatu were published in early 2016, and confirmed previous findings that the overall health risk is low and comparable to cities in Europe and the U.S. Detailed information, including copies of the studies themselves, is available at http://arsenio.kinross.com.br/en/ National Contact Point (NCP) A mediation process regarding allegations of damage to houses as a result of vibration from mining activities was successfully concluded in late 2016. The final report produced by the NCP can be found at http://www.pcn.fazenda.gov.br/assuntos/english/final-statements. MARICUNGA, CHILE Maricunga Wetlands In response to Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente (SMA) resolutions alleging pumping from groundwater wells has impacted wetlands located 7 km downgradient of the mine’s water supply wells, Compaiña Minera Maricunga has submitted legal and technical arguments and reports by experts on wetland vegetation and analysis of long-term satellite imagery and groundwater hydrology criticizing and challenging the evidence relied upon by the Chilean agencies. While to date there has been no ruling on the technical facts of the case, a judicial decision concluded that the SMA’s sanction was enforceable, and in response, the Company placed the mine into suspension at the end of July 2016. The Company had previously planned to suspend mining in Q4 2016 due to other capital priorities in its global portfolio. As a result, approximately 300 employees were retrenched after the mine was placed into temporary suspension. The legal process is ongoing. 08 KINROSS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 2016 SUPPLEMENT STA K E HO L DER IS S UE S UP D AT E (CONTINUED) LA COIPA, CHILE Phase 7 Permitting In October 2016, a local Colla community challenged the approval of the Declaration of Impact to Environment (DIA) permit for La Coipa’s Phase 7 project. The Court of Appeals rejected the legal challenge on January 13, 2017, and the plaintiffs did not exercise their right to appeal. As a result, there are no ongoing legal actions. Of note, representatives of three other local Colla communities had filed legal actions and documents with the same court, rejecting the arguments made by the first indigenous community in its October filing. KETTLE RIVER-BUCKHORN, U.S.A. Water Quality An Administrative Order (AO) issued in July 2016 has been stayed while other associated court decisions are pending. Further details are available in the 2016 Annual Information Form (page 64). SUNNYSIDE GOLD CORPORATION, SILVERTON, COLORADO Remediation In September 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed the so-called “Bonita Peak Mining District,” including areas impacted by Sunnyside Gold Corporation (SGC)’s operations and closure activities, on the National Priorities List pursuant to the U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERLCA). SGC has challenged portions of the CERCLA listing in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and is contesting liability. The Silverton Caldera is highly mineralized, and acid rock drainage and poor water quality were prevalent long before the advent of mining. The Silverton Caldera also hosted dozens of mines and mills between the 1870s and 1985, but SGC was only formed and acquired the Sunnyside Mine in 1985 and was involved in operations from 1986 until 1991 using modern techniques and under the modern era of environmental regulation. For additional detail, see the 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report (page 123) and the 2016 Annual Information Form (pages 87-88). TASIAST, MAURITANIA Illegal Mining In 2016, there was a significant influx of people onto Kinross concessions looking for gold. Although this did not impact mine operations, there were a number of injuries and other incidents among these artisanal miners, and extensive environmental impacts in the areas with the most activity. In October 2016 the Government of Mauritania mandated that all artisanal miners demobilize from the area, which occurred peacefully. Since then, artisanal miners continue to access Kinross concessions clandestinely, usually at night. This work is dangerous. Kinross ambulance, paramedics, and Emergency Response Teams have been deployed on several occasions to provide support as requested by local authorities. Workforce As previously reported, in June 2016 operations were suspended due to the Mauritanian Ministry of Labor’s decision to prohibit certain expatriate employees from working at site due to allegations of invalid work permits. The Company and the Government of Mauritania resolved the expatriate work permit issue as part of reaching a mutually acceptable “Mauritanization” plan to increase the number of local workers who have the necessary skills and experience to work at Tasiast, a requirement under Mauritanian law. Tasiast resumed normal mining and processing activities in August 2016 and a new collective agreement was signed in October 2016. Kinross and the Government maintain regular meetings to review progress on the “Mauritanization” plan. 09 KINROSS 2016 CR DATA TABLES KINROSS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 2016 SUPPLEMENT 2016 2 01 6 CORPORATE R E S P O NS I B I L I T Y DATA CO R PO R AT E RESPONSIBILITY D ATA TABLES TAB LES Aggregate Corporate Performance Data1,2,3,4 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Ore Processed (Tonnes) 142,889,000 117,113,000 135,285,000 150,251,000 145,445,000 Attributable Gold Production (Gold equivalent ounces) 2,789,150 2,594,652 2,710,390 2,631,092 2,617,813 Safety5 (100% basis) Lost-time Injury Frequency Rate 0.10 0.04 0.05 0.08 0.08 Fatal Injuries 0 0 0 0 2 Total Reportable Injury Frequency Rate 0.35 0.33 0.38 0.43 0.56 Environmental General (100% basis) Number of Regulatory Actions 1 4 0 8 2 Fines (US$) 0 7,600 116,000 107,000 273,000 Number of Major Spills 0 1 1 6 5 Energy/Greenhouse Gas Total Energy Consumption (Gigajoules) 19,817,000 16,571,000 16,291,000 17,435,000 16,619,000 Direct Energy Consumption (Gigajoules) 13,312,000 10,826,000 10,262,000 11,058,000 10,727,000 Indirect Energy Consumption (Gigajoules) 6,505,000 5,745,000 6,029,000 6,377,000 5,892,000 Energy Consumed per Tonne of Ore Processed (Megajoules/Tonne) 139 141 120 116 114 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 and 2)6 (Tonnes CO2e) 1,568,000 1,351,000 1,372,000 1,337,000 1,244,000 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Scope 1 and 2) per Tonne of Ore Processed (Kilograms CO2e/Tonne) 11.0 11.5 10.1 8.9 8.6 Water Use7 Total Water Withdrawn Groundwater (m3) 17,743,000 11,306,000 11,859,000 10,860,000 8,465,000 3 Total Water Withdrawn Surface Water (m ) 17,727,000 12,639,000 16,759,000 20,756,000 14,507,000 Total Water Withdrawn Precipitation Captured (m3) 26,826,000 24,537,000 34,440,000 51,823,000 13,574,000 3 Total Water Withdrawn Salt/Brackish Water (m ) 2,726,000 3,026,000 4,206,000 5,671,000 6,120,000 Net Changes in Water Storage8 (m3) 11,387,000 5,040,000 15,137,000 30,686,000 (9,462,000)n/r Total Water Discharged Groundwater (m3) 4,814,000 2,025,000 2,244,000 2,096,000 1,709,000 Total Water Discharged Surface Water (m3) 4,712,000 4,857,000 3,542,000 3,040,000 2,790,000 Total Water Consumed 9 (m3) 44,109,000 39,585,000 46,341,000 53,288,000 47,628,000 Water Consumed per Tonne of Ore Processed (Litres/Tonne) 309 338 341 356 327 Recycled Water Percentage (%)10 82 81 83 82 78 Significant Materials Use Diesel Fuel (m3) 339,400 257,000 241,000 260,800 261,000 Heavy Fuel Oil (m3) 4,400 18,000 19,000 10,000 12,000 Cyanide (Tonnes as CN) 38,400 34,200 31,800 27,100 33,000 Lime (Tonnes) 168,800 161,800 222,700 189,000 192,000 Blasting Agents (Tonnes) 80,545 60,600 51,500 77,000 72,000 n/r = not reported 1 All figures are reported from continuing operations unless otherwise noted. 2 All figures are reported based on Kinross’ percent of ownership (Chirano 90% and Round Mountain 50% for years 2012-2015). Figures for Round Mountain for 2016 are reported at 100% following the acquisition of the remaining 50% not already owned. 3 Figures shown are rounded and may not add up due to rounding. 4 Aggregated data from 2012-2013 includes La Coipa. 5 Frequency rates in all safety data are for 200,000 hours worked and represent data for both employees and contractors. 6 Scope 3 emissions for 2014 were 208,079 tonnes CO2e . 7 Because of the remote location of most operations, municipal water use is minimal and not reported. 8 Kinross began tracking this indicator in 2012. 9 The methodology consists of total water withdrawn less discharges and changes in on-site water storage. 10 In 2014, Kinross modified the Water Recycling calculation. Water Recycled Percentage is the water recycled as a percentage of the sum of the water consumed plus recycled. Data for 2012-2013 has been revised according to the improved methodology. 2016 DATA TABLES 1 10 KINROSS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 2016 SUPPLEMENT KINROSS 2016 CR DATA TABLES Aggregate Corporate Performance Data 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 Environmental (continued) Wastes Mineral Wastes Waste Rock Mined (Tonnes) 201,289,000 129,401,000 98,563,000 135,466,000 174,043,000 Tailings Produced (Tonnes) 71,369,000 68,047,000 73,628,000 83,251,000 86,064,000 Non-Mineral Wastes Hazardous Waste Disposed On Site (Tonnes) 486 377 492 497 462 Hazardous Waste Disposed Off Site (Tonnes) 616 601 579 616 2,434 11 Non-Hazardous Waste Disposed On Site (Tonnes) 10,500 9,586 9,485 16,824 22,313 6,255 Non-Hazardous Waste Disposed Off Site (Tonnes) 792 1,985 2,865 3,567 1,642 Recycled Wastes (Tonnes) 14,700 13,329 9,622 12,239 11,942 Non-Mineral Recycled Wastes 11 (Tonnes) 0.103 0.114 0.071 0.081 0.083 Non-Mineral Wastes Disposed Off Site (Tonnes) 0.010 0.022 0.025 0.028 0.028 Non-Mineral Wastes Disposed On Site (Tonnes) 0.077 0.085 0.074 0.115 0.046 12 Land Status (100% basis) Total land disturbed and not yet reclaimed at beginning of 14 reporting year (ha) 17,390 13 15,615 15,118 14,855 9,140 14,228 Land newly disturbed during reporting period (ha) 640 528 554 448 740 Land reclaimed during reporting year (ha) 249 46 57 185 113 Total land disturbed and not yet reclaimed at end of reporting year (ha) 17,781 16,097 15,615 15,118 14,855 Protected Habitat (ha) 5,569 4,396 7,801 7,791 7,774 11 Non-mineral recycled wastes includes oil that is burned on Kinross' sites for heating.
