Example of final supplier evaluation: GEMACO GROUP Belgium France Germany Italy Poland Spain Switzerland The Netherlands United Kingdom China Hong Kong – USA Mexico © Gemaco Group 2017 Communication on Progress 2017 – Page 12 / 19 Independent Supplier Auditing As one of our strategic key focus within QA and CSR is to provide reliable and transparent information to our partners, clients and stakeholders, we work closely together with international partner Institutions to cover the supplier audit aspect of our supply chain. In this context, the Gemaco group is member of the BSCI initiative, Sedex and Ecovadis. All companies strive to provide their clients a transparent audit protocol. Please find on the following paragraphs some information about how these organisations work and how they ensure that out manufacturing partners meet the standards as defined by the United Nations Global Compact. BSCI – Business Social Compliance Initiative To continue to shape our objectives in the area of CSR, Gemaco is a member of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). BSCI is a part of the Foreign Trade Association (FTA), an organization that promotes the values of the free world and sustainable business. Along with more than 1000 members in Europe, we are working on improving working conditions, human rights and environment in high-risk countries where our products are produced. By a jointly monitor system our suppliers are assessed on the requirements on basis of the BSCI code of conduct. By signing up the manufacturers, important improvements can be created in the area of CSR. How it works: The main suppliers of every product group are approached with a questionnaire to see what certificates and quotations are already in their possession. If they are already BSCI registered, we can immediately check their status and information. If not, the procedure towards a registration starts when the manufacturer signs the code of conduct. With the questionnaire and statement signed, we can decide to present the manufacturer for an audit. This audit is carried out by one of the 15 independent audit agencies, also responsible for the SA 8000 audits. Based on this audit, a report about each manufacturer is made. If a factory meets the requirements they will get an entry in the BSCI registry. This entry is valid for 3 years. After 3 years there needs to be a new audit carried out, commanded by Gemaco. If a factory does not meet the requirements, they will get a ‘Corrective Action Plan’ (CAP), based on BSCI guidelines. Gemaco is responsible for the implementation of the CAP by the factory.

GEMACO GROUP Belgium France Germany Italy Poland Spain Switzerland The Netherlands United Kingdom China Hong Kong – USA Mexico © Gemaco Group 2017 Communication on Progress 2017 – Page 13 / 19 SEDEX Supplier Ethical Data Exchange SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) is a member-organization for companies that have committed to a sustainable improvement of ethical behavior within the supply chain. CSR is not only about operational guidelines but also about empowering suppliers and other members of the supply chain to promote sustainable production and services. SEDEX offers a platform to track and exchange developments and improvements in sustainable production. Furthermore, SEDEX offers a safe database to administrate, share and report efforts with main scope in labor practice, health & safety, environment and business ethics. Due to our membership at SEDEX our partners and customers have the possibility to track our efforts and developments concerning sustainable supply chain on a validated platform. Within the SEDEX program the SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) guidance provides a set of audit procedures and best practice examples based on which suppliers are audited. Basis for labor practice and human right principles are set by ILO (international Labor Organization) Guidelines and Recommendations: The SMETA guidelines provide a standardized procedure that allows customers, shareholders and partners to work with a standardized procedure that makes efforts comparable and leads to a high-quality assessment of several supply chain elements. Audit reports are followed by corrective action plan (CAP) providing detailed information for companies on how to improve working and environmental conditions. Besides guidance for ILO based working practice and conditions the SMETA guidelines consist of a standardized time table for company audits, recommended number of to be interviewed working staff and requirements for training and experience for the auditors. SMETA provides two different levels of audits. SMETA-2 pillar Audits covering the areas of labor practice, working conditions and health & safety. SMETA-4 pillar Audits are covering additionally the areas of environmental practice and business processes. For companies ordering products produced within a SEDEX audited production facility the following documents are made available by the Gemaco Group: SMETA-Audit Report: Detailed audit report about the production facility including assessment of the production facility, interviews with staff members and general assessment of working conditions such as remuneration, working hours and safety measures. The Audit report is dispatched to the clients in full detail. Corrective Action Plan Report (CAP): The CAP report provides a list of findings by the auditing party. Those findings, mostly deviations from the SMETA guidance and principles, are presented to the management of the audited production facility with clear instruction on how to resolve the issue, who must resolve the issue and by when the issue must be resolved. The CAP report also gives clear instruction to the producer how to prove that an issue has been resolved. The CAP report is dispatched to the client in full details.

We are continuously promoting efforts to reduce the impact on our environment within the company under the environmental management system mentioned above. These activities are now becoming company-wide activities, beginning with global warming prevention, achievement of zero-emission and reduction / recycling of packing materials. Many of these efforts relate to our Far East production sites so we need to start at the production stage with reducing the impact on the environment as stated in the ISO14001 environmental management system. We support prohibition of Substances of Concern (SOC) starting from “RoHS directive 2000/53/EC”, “76/769/EEC” and “Law Concerning the Examination and Regulation of Manufacture, etc of Chemical Substances”, domestic low and conformity with the “Europe REACH directives EC/1907/2006.” are additional environmental milestones. In view of the circumstances, Gemaco established the “Gemaco Green Purchasing Guidelines” to facilitate activities in two main domains: the development and implementation of an environmental management system and subsequently the elimination of SOC in materials. Specific guidelines to get our “Environmental declaration” into action are: 1. Aim to save and use limited sources efficiently. 2. Promote to save energy in all corporate activities, fulfil the responsibility for prevention of the global warming. 3. Change ozone-unfriendly substances to protect the ozone layer. 4.
