The Group is proud of the success it made in this area. Since the introduction of a systematic measurement in 2008, significant improvements have been made. After an increase in work-related lost time accidents (LTA) in fiscal year 2014/15, additional measures were successfully launched and have led to an improvement in workplace safety in Schaffner’s plants in Asia and North America. Thus, the number of accidents in the Asia region fell from seven to one LTA in fiscal year 2015/16. In North America again zero lost time accidents were reported. Unfortunately, in Europe the measures taken did not result in a reduction of LTA. Actions to remedy the current situation are in preparation. To further enhance workplace safety, the following additional measures were put in place at the locations affected:  Supervisors are conducting a daily “safety wake-up call” before the start of every shift and after every shift break.  If an event occurs that poses an elevated risk to employees' health and/or safety, production is halted immediately and all employees are called together. They are informed of the circumstances of the incident and the appropriate measures for accident prevention.  Additional safety training is conducted in the departments involved. In addition, designated safety weeks are planned, going into effect by February/March 2017.  Regular risk assessments are conducted in accordance with the OHSAS 18001 standard.  When relocating machinery to a new site, the entire equipment being moved is tested to the local safety standards. Safety rules, protective devices and warning signs are adjusted to the national standard.  The safety compliance declarations on all machinery are regularly inspected.  The planned introduction of a safety award is intended to raise safety consciousness. The award, which is to be given out regularly at the annual company parties, requires being accident-free for the preceding three years.

Exact figure Group's headquarters we will report after one year of measuring. The reduction of the CO2 footprint goes hand in hand with the reduction of energy consumption. Reduce CO2 emission Schaffner’s goal is to significantly cut carbon dioxide emissions and to be a role model for such efforts. To accomplish this, the Group launched a project to study its global potential for emission savings and plan the necessary investment. The findings to date showed that most of the CO 2 emissions are generated by materials transport, manufacturing plants, logistics hubs and the Group’s headquarters. Based on the analysis, further emissions reduction investment is being planned and implemented. As well, employees are being sensitized to the need to reduce energy consumption and to be prudent stewards of the available resources. Transportation With production centers in Asia, Europe and the USA, the Schaffner Group is able to manufacture its products in close proximity to customer delivery locations, thus substantially reducing shipping costs. Over the years, Schaffner has reduced the share of air freight in favor of sea freight. The associated CO2 emissions (per unit of weight and distance transported) were substantially lowered. Schaffner is aiming for a further significant reduction in CO 2 emissions in the coming five years through continuous optimization of processes and the increase in the share of sea freight. In fiscal 2014/15, the proportion of air freight increased again, as customer projects are demanding ever shorter delivery times and more flexibility. New approaches to this challenge are planned. 21.04.2017 UNGC COP Team Luterbach 3I5 Schaffner Group I Nordstrasse 11 I 4542 Luterbach I Switzerland P +41 32 681 66 26 I F +41 32 681 66 30 I www.schaffner.com Development CO2 Emission in % for intercontinental Transportation 120% 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% 2007/2008 2008/2009 2009/2010 2010/2011 2011/2012 2012/2013 2013/2014 2014/2015 2015/2016 The calculation is based on the airand sea freight transportation mix of the fiscal year 2007/08 and capacity neutralized. Production The activities aimed at cutting down CO2 output in the Group's plants are bearing fruit. Awareness of the link between CO2 emissions and global warming was further raised. Training events highlighted the negative consequences of the greenhouse effect, thus encouraging employees' understanding and engagement in order to help achieve large effects through many small measures taken. Despite a rise in automation, the CO2 emissions from production plants have successfully been stabilized. The optimization programs are steadily maintained. Energy consumption continues to be monitored in line with the GRI reporting guidelines for relevant aspects focusing on UNGC principals number 7,8,9 and 10.
