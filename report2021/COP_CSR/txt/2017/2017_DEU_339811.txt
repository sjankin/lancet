Chief Executive Oﬃcer 4 | UN Global Compact 2017 | VS Vereinigte Spezialmöbelfabriken The 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, within the scope of their inﬂuence. Principle 2 Businesses should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4 Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5 Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6 Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Principle 8 Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9 Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The United Global Compact is based on ten universally-recognized principles. These principles pertain to four areas: human rights, working standards, environmental protection and the ﬁght against corruption. On the basis of these principles, the UN Global Compact pursues the vision of an inclusive and sustainable global economy as a strategic initiative for companies.

Private citizens feel the beneﬁts of the Energiewende when they pay their energy bills. In the case of electricity, however, 25% percent of the electricity costs in the private customer segment will have to be spent on ﬁnancing the Energiewende for energy producers, energy suppliers and grid operators. Among other factors, German companies are affected by the decision to initiate the Energiewende by means of the so-called energy service law. This requires all companies of a certain size or with a certain turnover to audit and certify their energy use by January 1, 2017 in accordance with applicable European standards. If this deadline is not met, heavy ﬁnes were to be imposed on the offending companies. As a result, VS introduced a normative energy management system in accordance with DIN EN ISO 50001.
