In 2016, the initiative reached an average of 2.7 In 2016, we further intensified these efforts and strengthened our relations kilometers travelled per liter of fuel. The result is a 17% improvement from January with the academic community by resuming our participation on the Companies 2014, when the program was launched, when consumption stood at 2.30 kilometer for the Climate platform of the Center for Sustainability Studies (GVces) of the per liter. In 2016, 6,717,511 km were traveled on 2,605,966.23 liters of fuel. Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV). We also got involved at the regional level through Agenda 21, an action plan adopted by governments and civil society that targets all areas in which human activities affect the environment by participating on the CO2 / Km program’s forum in Guarujá. 1,03 Emissions 1,01 Greenhouse gas emissions are measured by TEUs handled in the port operations, 0,99 by pallets handled in the logistics operations and by kilometer traveled in road 0,97 transportation. All results are reported in kilograms of CO2. In 2016, direct emissions amounted to 27,591.01 tons of CO2e (carbon 0,95 equivalent) while emissions from energy purchases amounted to 3,033.17 tons of CO2e. The total volume of 30,624.19 was 0.3% lower than the 30,720.46 tons of 0,93 CO2e emitted in 2015. 0,91 We registered a reduction in our emissions per TEU handled due to the optimization of our operations and the consequent decrease in diesel consumption 0,89 per movement. We ended 2016 with 15.22 kgCO2e / TEU handled, down 5.6% 18 January 18 March 18 May 18 July 18 September 18 November 19 January 19 March 19 May 19 July 19 September 19 November 20 January 20 March 20 May 20 July 18 September 20 November 23 December from the 16.13 KgCO2e/TEU handled registered in 2015. Meanwhile, our emissions per pallet handled fell from 1.10 KgCO2e to 0.7 KgCO2e. In road transportation, the indicator fell from 0.96 KgCO2e per kilometer traveled to 0.95 KgCO2e per kilometer traveled. 33 Environment The Sustainable Driver program is part of the Green Fleet Program, which since 2014 has accounted for a reduction of 8.25% in gas emissions per kilometer traveled. The program includes investments in fleet modernization, a process called Green Purchase. (Please see GRI Supplementary Information for tables with direct, indirect and total emissions per company unit). Water In the full year, the Company’s water consumption rate in cubic meters per employee was 1.7, which is 5.6% lower than the 1,78 rate found in 2015. In volume, the 84,748-cubic meter total water consumption was 4.2% lower than in the previous fiscal year. To maintain the downward pace of this indicator, we seek innovative solutions, such as the reuse system installed at Clia Santos, where rainwater is captured, treated and used to wash machinery at the unit. Two years ago, we also adopted dry washing for road transportation vehicles and equipment, a measure that saved 5.9 million liters of water by end-2016. Compared to conventional washing, dry washing a truck, for example, saves 1,500 liters of water. Since the initiative’s launch, 3,924 washes have been performed. (Please see GRI Supplementary Information for tables on water consumption by company unit and by source). Solid Waste In 2016, we dedicated efforts to creating the Solid Waste Management Program and in parallel focused on the Procurement Department, which involved reviewing all destination agreements and analyzing the possibility of developing, by end-2017, a composting process for Tecon Santos. The strategy for solid waste is to concentrate efforts on its origin, which means reducing the volume consumed and consequently purchases. 34 GRI Supplementary Information 35 About the Report Stakeholder engagement GRI G4-24 | G4-25 | G4-26 | G4-27 Stakeholder Demands Channels Pages Status of the analysis of the executive expansion project at Tecon Santos• Financing schedule and E-mail, website, IR Ombudsman, results conference, Shareholder structure for the investment in expansion • Competition faced at the Port of Santos • Impact of 11 Apimec meetings and service to analysts economic crisis on our operations • Migration to the Novo Mercado corporate governance segment Sales consultants, Customer Relations department, Clients Operating results• Innovations in the services offered • New procedures • Sustainability satisfaction survey, our website, marketing e-mails, app 30 and social networks Operating, environmental and safety performance• Delivery of port access between Cônego Government Specific contacts in the organizational structure 12 Domenico Rangone Highway and Santos Dumont Avenue Monthly magazine, weekly dashboard, e-mails, internal Employees Operating results • Health and Safety • Volunteer Work • Recognition • Sustainability 29-30 TV, personal communication and social networks Suppliers, third parties Environment • Rapprochement and relationship • Supplier qualification and training • Dashboard, materiality survey and monthly meetings 30 and related persons Learning/professional courses for community youngsters.
