Global price increases in oily fish were also seen in Finland.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Operating environment / Raisioagro Raisioagro is a feeding expert Raisioagro’s strength is its ability to innovate products that promote sustainable development and meet customer needs. Feeding expertise and high-quality feeds meeting the farm needs improve the profitability of farms in line with objectives while ensuring animal welfare. Restructuring of milk farms continued in Finland Despite the lowering number of Finnish milk farms, the number of dairy cows did not substantially decrease since some of the farms carried out extension investments. The key change impacting the feed market was that the number of TMR feeding farms and robotic milking farms continued to grow. TMR feeding means that all feed components are mixed with silage and a cow is given only one feed mixture. As the challenging economic situation continued, milk farms continued their shift to more affordable feeds of lower added value. The main reasons for the milk farmers’ challenging economic conditions are the Russian ban on imports of dairy products and the subsequent drop in the producer price of milk in Finland. Benemilk added value feeds are mainly used at the robotic milking farms where farmers are satisfied with the added value they have received for their milk production. At the end of 2016, some six per cent of all Finnish dairy cows were fed with Benemilk feeds. Raisioagro did not get involved in the aggressive price competition but focused on extending the expertise of sales employees, targeted marketing, developing of the product range corresponding customer Benemilk feeds have an needs and digital services. established position in Finland Russia's economic challenges and weakening liquidity of dairy farms reduced Raisioagro’s cattle feed sales to Russia.

Due to its advanced expertise, Raisioagro has a strong potential to increase its exports to Russia.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Year 2016 / Business risks Business risks Raisio Group is an international diversified company whose key products are plant-based foods, their ingredients and feeds for cattle and fish. Raisio is a significant user of renewable raw materials. Changes in quality, availability and prices of these materials are difficult to predict so they present a challenge to the Group's operations. In Europe, Raisio’s key operational area, changes affecting consumer demand are closely monitored and the company strives to adapt to these changes. The year 2016 was marked by many long-term election results, such as the UK decision to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States. In spite of the prevailing uncertainty, the world economy is expected to grow moderately in 2017 and the growth is generated primarily by private consumption and increasing investments. The euro area economy is expected to grow moderately in 2017. The recovery is still based on private consumption, supported by low oil prices, low interest rates and the weakening euro, particularly against the US dollar. European refugee crisis continues and its effects may extend not only to politics but also to the economy. In 2016, economic growth in Finland was based on the domestic demand, especially on the growth of private consumption. In addition, construction investment has increased rapidly. The situation on the labour market has improved and the unemployment rate trend is downward. In Finland, the economy is expected to grow moderately in 2017, supported by domestic demand. Although Brexit is causing uncertainty, the UK’s economic growth is expected to continue, and employment and earnings are estimated to develop positively. The UK’s vote to leave the EU and related exit negotiations are creating uncertainty in the food industry’s operating conditions and long-term business planning. Changes in the pound to euro A large portion of Raisio's exchange rate significantly affect Raisio's net sales and EBIT, net sales and EBIT is directly and indirectly, as a significant portion of the Group’s net generated in the UK. sales and EBIT is generated in the UK. Volatility in the rouble's external value affects the exports of feeds and oat products to Russia and may also have an impact on the utilisation rates of production plants in Finland. The price and availability of agricultural raw materials are a major challenge for Raisio's businesses. Global warming and extreme weather events rapidly affect the crop expectations, supply, demand and price of these commodities. In addition, changes in supply, demand, availability and price of other key raw materials are possible. In terms of business profitability, the role of risk management remains essential both for value and volume. In Europe, various health taxes are discussed and related initiatives are being set up. Sugar may be one of the taxed raw materials. In case these initiatives result in new taxes, they will probably affect Raisio’s operations.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Year 2016 / Business risks Raisio expects the grocery market to remain fairly stable compared to other sectors. However, retail activities create pressure on the food industry too, through prices and sales terms. Grocery market expected to remain stable. Profitability problems in the Finnish agriculture and livestock farming weaken the purchasing power of the sector and put pressure on Raisioagro's profitability. Due to the crisis in Ukraine and Crimea, the EU’s sanctions and Russia’s counter-sanctions in 2014, especially the import ban of dairy products, will directly and indirectly hamper Raisioagro’s operations. To ensure growth and profitability of its operations, Raisio may carry out corporate restructuring which, as rationalisation projects, may result in significant one-off expenses. Risk management Raisio's risk management policy defines the targets, principles and responsibilities of risk management. The target of risk management is to identify risks and to secure the continuity of Raisio's operations, safety of products and operations, personnel and assets and to prevent events affecting negatively the shareholder value. Raisio emphasises preventive measures in its risk management and strives to continuously improve the risk management in all of its aspects. In practice, the Divisions and service functions, such as financing, are responsible for identifying and surveying risks and report them to the Group's Management Team and Risk Management function. Risk Management function coordinates, develops and monitors risk management at the Group level.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Year 2016 / Benemilk Benemilk feeds and their production method were granted a patent in Finland on 30 December 2016. After a thorough investigation, the Finnish Patent Authority determined that the Benemilk innovation meets the criteria for patentability; it is new, inventive and industrially applicable. In Finland, the first patent applications related to the Benemilk innovation were filed in January 2012. Furthermore, patent authorities in New Zealand examined the patent applications, and granted patents for the Benemilk feeds and their manufacturing method as well as for the milk produced by Benemilk fed cows. So far, Benemilk has been granted patents in Finland, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, which is a strong indication of the patentability of the innovation in various markets.

Business operations In November 2015, Benemilk Ltd launched a process to examine the conditions and opportunities to obtain new financing. Based on the completed assessment, Benemilk Ltd’s Board of Directors concluded in June 2016 that it is not justified to implement the equity financing scheme as the company valuation indicated by potentially interested investors was not satisfactory for owners. Benemilk Ltd’s operations were significantly reduced in the autumn 2016 and the investment to internationally commercialise the innovation was minimised in accordance with the decision taken by Raisio’s Board of Directors in August. Global crisis in the milk market as well as potential customers’ unwillingness to change their feeding models affected the decision, and for these reasons, the company’s short-term prospects for the international expansion of the business were not favourable.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Responsibility Management / Diverse value chain Raisio’s value chain extends from primary production to consumers. In different parts of the value chain, the company’s influence and way of interacting are different. Raisio’s ability and willingness to develop responsible foods and feeds promote the sustainable food chain. Raisio affects the beginning of the value chain, i.e., suppliers, by following its responsible procurement principles. Raisio expects its suppliers to commit to the Supplier Code of Conduct concerning, for example, environmental responsibility, working conditions in accordance with international regulations, prohibition of child and forced labour and anti-discrimination. Some of Raisio’s branded products are manufactured by subcontractors. They are required to follow operating and production practices outlined by Raisio. The agreements specify, for example, the quality requirements of raw materials used. Raisio purchases all its grain from areas near its production plants whenever possible. Raisio’s grain products are mainly manufactured in Finland. In Finland, the company purchases some 85 per cent of the grain directly from farmers. Due to close cooperation, Raisio has an opportunity to develop farming practices together with the farmers. Raisio continuously examines consumer needs and behaviour. This way, Raisio can provide retailers with interesting branded products and innovations that meet consumer needs. The company also invests in its brands to keep them commercially interesting. Furthermore, Raisio must meet the increasingly stringent requirements of trade organisations, restaurants and catering companies, and industrial customers regarding the responsibility of products. In terms of the international Benecol ingredient business, Raisio’s influence extends to the assistance and counselling of licencing partners. Licensing agreements define in detail matters related to the products and use of the brand. In addition, Raisio's licensing partners are committed to Raisio’s Benecol Partner Code of Conduct. At the higher end of the value chain of consumer products, Raisio influences consumers by communicating on nutrition, environmental labels, recipes and tips to use the products, among other things. Raisio is engaged in a continuous dialogue with consumers in, for example, social media and customer service channels. Raisio influences dairy and fish chains by providing producers with feeds that promote profitable and sustainable agriculture. Raisio’s feeding solutions affect animal welfare and improve the yields. In the fish chain, our feeding innovations have significantly reduced the environmental impacts. Raisio plc’s shares are listed on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki Ltd. The company has over 39,000 shareholders and about 1,400 employees. Raisio operates in 12 countries and has production plants in nine places in three countries.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Responsibility Management / Materiality Assessment Materiality Assessment defines the key responsibility themes Raisio’s Materiality Assessment was renewed in 2015 together with stakeholders. We have discussed with them and listened to their views. The Materiality Assessment, confirmed by Raisio’s Board of Directors, took all stakeholders into consideration both locally and internationally in the countries where Raisio operates. Based on the views of the businesses and stakeholders, key responsibility aspects were identified and prioritised, and then grouped in the matrix below. Material aspects concern the entire Raisio Group. Raisio’s Materiality Assessment guides the company’s responsibility work and reporting. The timeliness of the Materiality Assessment is reviewed annually. In 2016, no changes were made and Raisio continued its work to promote the key themes.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Responsibility Management / Target-oriented Responsibility Programme Goal-oriented Responsibility Programme Raisio’s Responsibility Programme for 2016 – 2018 sets objectives and indicators for important, selected sustainability themes. In 2016, Raisio began the determined implementation of its Responsibility Programme. Objectives of the Responsibility Programme support the implementation of Raisio’s business strategy. Responsibility Programme is a practical tool to be used in Raisio's responsibility work: it sets targets and indicators for important sustainability themes to the company management and personnel. All Raisio’s businesses actively participated in the preparation of the Responsibility Programme and are committed to its implementation. Raisio operates in many countries and in several sectors. Therefore, important responsibility themes vary by business. The Group’s Responsibility Programme has three themes that are material to every business. To promote these themes, concrete goals and indicators were determined to monitor progress. Some of the objectives are business-specific. Raisio’s clear and concrete Responsibility Programme supports the business strategy and is focused on material responsibility issues. Main parts of Raisio’s value chain are matters related to responsible procurement of raw materials, innovations and product development, healthiness and work safety. Since these themes were also highlighted in Raisio’s Materiality Assessment, they are also the key themes of the Responsibility Programme.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Responsibility Management / Target-oriented Responsibility Programme Key themes in Raisio’s Responsibility Programme Sustainable food chain Ethical and environmental aspects are related to the procurement of raw materials. Management of these aspects is material to Raisio. In addition, Raisio aims to reduce the environmental impacts of its own production and affects the sustainability of milk production and fish farming through its feed innovations. Healthier food Development of healthier products and services is important to consumers and at the core of Raisio’s strategy. At Raisio, we never compromise on product safety. Safety and well-being at work Staff safety and wellbeing are of particular importance in Raisio’s operations so that we can ensure product safety, process reliability and the ability to develop new innovations that interest consumers and customers. Raisio’s businesses have also identified other responsibility-related issues on which Raisio is actively working.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Responsible procurement Responsible procurement promotes sustainability of the food chain Quality, safety and responsibility are the key criteria for Raisio’s raw material procurement. Raisio’s consumers and customers are increasingly interested in the traceability of product raw materials and in the production in line with sustainable development. As an expert in animal feeding and healthy foods, Raisio has an ability and opportunity to promote the sustainable food chain with its raw material choices. Main events in 2016 Raisio harmonised its responsible procurement practices. The Group’s common Supplier Code of Conduct will be introduced in all our businesses during 2017. Healthy Snacks business prepared its transfer to the use of UTZ certified cocoa. At the Nokia mill, Raisio decided to get the RSPO Supply Chain certificate and it will enter into force in the spring 2017. Raisio’s value chain is part of the sustainable food chain. All the company’s raw materials are renewable. Raisio’s key raw materials are grains (wheat, oats, rye, barley) and rapeseed. These account for some 70 per cent of all raw materials. Raisioagro’s share of the Group’s all raw materials is almost 70 per cent. Key raw materials in the feed Raisio’s Annual Report 2016 has been published in http://annualreview2016.raisio.com/ Raisio Oyj This page is part of the annual report. Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Responsible procurement manufacturing are wheat, barley and rapeseed. Raisio has almost 80 years of experience in contract farming and the company acquires 85 per cent of its grain directly from farmers. Raisio’s grain products are largely made in Finland and the grain transport distance from the producer to the factory is on average less than 100 kilometres. Subcontractors manufacture part of Raisio’s branded products. Quality criteria for the raw materials used in contract manufacturing are defined in the agreements. Raisio acquires raw materials for part of its Finnish subcontractors. Raisio secures the responsibility of raw materials by requiring its suppliers to commit to the Supplier Code of Conduct regarding, for example, human rights, working conditions in accordance with international regulations, environmental responsibility and anti-corruption. Certified raw materials To secure the responsibility of soy, palm oil and cocoa, Raisio has drawn up policies regarding the use of certified raw materials. Soy accounts for about one per cent of all raw materials and the company uses it mainly for fish feeds. All the soy Raisio used in feeds is either ProTerra or RTRS certified. Raisio is a member of the Round Table on Responsible Soy association. Since 2014, all the palm oil used in Raisio’s foods has been responsible. In 2016, 70 per cent of the palm oil used in Raisio’s foods was physically traceable (mass balance or segregated) and 30 per cent was Green Palm certified. Our long-term goal is to transfer to the use of physically traceable palm oil in food products. Palm oil accounts for less than one per cent of all Raisio’s raw materials. Raisio is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. Raisio’s goal is that the cocoa used in its own branded products is certified by the end of 2018. This does not, however, apply to the confectionery since major part of the confectionery is produced for contract partners who themselves define the certification requirements of raw materials. During 2016, we were preparing the transfer to the use of certified cocoa, and the first products containing certified cocoa will be available in 2017. Cocoa accounts for less than 0.5 per cent of all raw materials of our branded products. Origin of the fishmeal and oil used in fish feeds is always known, and no endangered fish species are used in the manufacturing of our feeds. Certified raw materials account for some four per cent of all Raisio’s raw materials. In addition to certified palm oil and soy, Raisio uses, for example, small amounts of organic oats and other organic grains. Objectives for 2016-2018 We will further develop the responsible procurement of our key raw materials. Raw materials that we use the most include grains, particularly oats and wheat, and rapeseed. We require our suppliers to operate in accordance with our Supplier Code of Conduct. We expect the suppliers to complete the Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire at least every three years. We continue to purchase Proterra or RTRS certified soy. Raisio’s Annual Report 2016 has been published in http://annualreview2016.raisio.com/ Raisio Oyj This page is part of the annual report.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Environmental responsibility Environmental efficiency through innovation and production development Raisio operates in a sustainable manner, respecting the environment. We follow environmental impacts of our operations, and develop the operations in a sustainable and goal-oriented way. Raisio’s environmental priorities are the reduction of energy usage, the improvement of material efficiency and innovations benefiting the environment and customers. Main events in 2016 Reporting and monitoring of the Group’s environmental impacts were harmonised with a new data management system. All the Group’s production functions drew up plans to improve energy and material efficiency. Raisio developed several innovations promoting sustainability of the primary food production. Baltic Blend fish feeds, milking robot monitoring (Tuotostutka) and a urea index describing greenhouse emissions from milk production are good examples of these innovations. WWF Finland added Finnish farmed whitefish on the green list of its Seafood Guide in 2016. Several Raisio’s fish feed innovations have reduced the environmental impacts of fish farming. The Czech Confectionery business invested in the wastewater treatment that resulted in improved wastewater quality and enabled the use of recovered biogas. The investment improved energy efficiency and Raisio’s Annual Report 2016 has been published in http://annualreview2016.raisio.com/ Raisio Oyj This page is part of the annual report. Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Environmental responsibility allows the expansion of production. The UK Confectionery business is involved in the Climate Change Act aiming to reduce energy consumption. Raisio reports on the environmental impact arising from its production. Raisio’s operations cause environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of products. In 2016, Raisio had nine production plants in Finland, the UK and Czech Republic. Our environmental efficiency development is goal-oriented, particularly in energy and material efficiency. The company invests in renewable energy. Raisio started building a bioenergy plant in its industrial area. The plant will be completed during the spring 2017. As a result, the carbon footprint of Raisio’s production plants will decrease significantly as, at the same time, the company will discontinue its use of coal-based industrial steam. Raisio operates in accordance with rules and regulations. No environmental damages were identified in the Group’s offices and the Group received no fines or sanctions for violations of environmental legislation in 2016. Raisio’s production plants are not located in protected areas or in areas of high biodiversity value, or in their immediate vicinity. Results 2016 Environmental investments were carried out to enhance energy production and consumption, waste reduction and wastewater treatment. In the fish feed production, heat recovery was renewed, which improved the energy use. In the production of cholesterol-lowering Benecol ingredient, a new operating model resulted in significant energy savings. The Group’s energy consumption per produced product tonne decreased by four per cent. The amount of landfill waste declined by 62 per cent. The amount of recovered waste increased to 94 per cent. Investments and improvements in the equipment contributed to the results. Raisio’s product packages are mainly made of recycled material. Objectives for 2016-2018 We will enhance our energy use. We will perform energy audits at all our production plants at least every two years. We will analyse material efficiency in terms of raw materials and other production inputs. We will decrease waste at our production plants. We will only use recyclable materials in our product packages. We continue to develop and commercialise innovations that benefit the environment and our customers.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Environmental impact Raisio's environmental impact Raw materials and material efficiency Raw materials used in Raisio’s products are renewable. The company’s goal is a material-efficient use of raw materials. To achieve this, all the Group’s production plants have drawn up plans. Material efficiency is promoted particularly through the development of monitoring and reporting. Raw material use at Raisio’s production plants decreased by over three per cent and per tonne of product by one per cent. Recoverable waste accounts for more than 94 per cent of the total waste. The amount of landfill waste declined by 62 per cent from the previous year. The amount of hazardous waste decreased by 38 per cent and that of total waste by two per cent. Scope of reporting: In terms of raw material use, Finnish production plants are reported for 2013 – 2016, while the Group’s continuous operations are reported for 2015 – 2016. Landfill waste is reported for the whole Group’s continuous operations. Water use for products is not included in the raw material quantities shown below. Water Water use is an important environmental factor at Raisio, as water is needed in production and cooling processes. Water use is monitored continuously and water is recycled effectively. Furthermore, we actively examine means to decrease water use. Household water use increased by 14 per cent in the Group. Despite various enhancement measures, a number of pipeline leaks in the UK resulted in the increase in the Group's water use. In Finland, household water use decreased by over four per cent. The amount of wastewater increased by six per cent in the Group while decreased significantly in Finland.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Environmental impact Emissions from energy production Raisio reports direct greenhouse emissions of its own energy production and indirect emissions of purchased energy as CO2e values. Emissions generated in Raisio’s production are calculated while for the purchased energy, emissions are defined as CO2e values of emissions reported by suppliers. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) describes the total climate warming effect of greenhouse gases. The Groups’ electricity is purchased energy. Electricity that Raisio buys in Finland is eco-labelled and its production does not cause greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity purchased in Finland accounts for almost 60 per cent of the Group’s electricity use. The UK and Czech production plants produce heat from natural gas. In Finland, our thermal energy is purchased with the exception of the Kouvola plant that has a steam boiler plant using natural gas. In Raisio’s industrial area, there is a power plant operating as a reserve plant. It will be closed during the spring 2017 when the new bioenergy plant is completed. Raisio continues its work to improve energy efficiency and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Case: Leading through information results in more sustainable milk production Leading through information results in more sustainable milk production Modern barns generate plenty of information that results in more profitable and sustainable milk production. Internet of Farming also reduces the environmental impact of milk production. Milk increasingly comes from free-stall barns where one or several milking robots take care of the milking. A robot generates a large amount of data on, for example, the cow’s milking, activeness and production phase. Raisioagro developed a milking robot monitoring service so that the information gathered could be used more effectively. Monitoring service is meant for farms using robotic milking; real-time data on the yields, feeding and health of dairy cows is gathered. Raisioagro’s experts analyse the data and prepare a report for the producer who can then optimise the feeding, improve milk yield and enhance economic profitability of the farm. This service is a concrete example of the opportunities offered by the Internet of Farming. The development of the service started in 2015 together with a few farms and milking robot manufacturers. With the innovation, the aim is to create added value through feeding plans and feeds as well as through specialists and investments made in a milking robot. Cattle welfare in focus Raisio’s Annual Report 2016 has been published in http://annualreview2016.raisio.com/ Raisio Oyj This page is part of the annual report. Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Case: Leading through information results in more sustainable milk production Raisioagro’s monitoring service uses cow-specific information gathered by the milking robot. Based on the data, it is possible to monitor, for example, the impacts of changed feeding on yield as well as their effects on the relationship between milk yield and feed costs. The report provides results regarding the entire cattle, while it is also possible to follow the yields of different animal groups or individual cows. Only healthy cows produce a lot of milk. With the data analysis, it is possible to closely monitor the cow’s wellbeing, quickly detect anomalies and make necessary feeding changes. Monitoring service strengthening the In addition, the feed efficiency improves as concentrated feed can partnership between be optimised faster with the silage used. As the feed efficiency improves, environmental impacts in relation to the milk produced in Raisioagro and producers. kilograms are reduced. Already more than 130 dairy farms, almost 15 per cent of the Finnish robotic milking farms, use the monitoring service, with very positive results. The energy-corrected milk yields of the farms involved have grown by 6.5 per cent on average resulting in higher producer milk income. Raisioagro is the strongest Finnish expert in the use of Internet of Farming. The company continues to further develop its milking robot monitoring and other services using digitalisation.

Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Case: The feed innovation Baltic Blend made fish farming more sustainable The feed innovation Baltic Blend made fish farming more sustainable Since June 2016, the innovation Baltic Blend® has been used in all Raisioaqua feeds. Fish meal and oil made of the Baltic Sea fish are used as raw materials for the Baltic Blend feeds. When the fish farmed in the Baltic Sea area are fed using local feeds, nutrients are recycled and not brought to the Baltic Sea from outside. With Baltic Blend, the environmental impact of Raisioaqua’s feed customers will be significantly lower as the phosphorus load from fish farming turns negative and the nitrogen load is reduced to a fraction of what it was before. Nutrient recycling is one of the pillars of sustainable food chain. Until now, fishmeal and oil made of the fish from the world’s oceans have been used also in the Finnish fish feeds; now they can be replaced by fishmeal and oil made of the Baltic Sea fish. This way, nutrients will not be brought to the Baltic Sea from outside. With Raisioaqua's innovation Baltic Blend, the same amount or even more phosphorus and nitrogen is removed, in the form of herring used for fishmeal production, from the Baltic Sea than generated from the farming. According to Raisio’s Annual Report 2016 has been published in http://annualreview2016.raisio.com/ Raisio Oyj This page is part of the annual report. Contacts communications@raisio.com Raisio Annual Report / Sustainable food chain / Case: The feed innovation Baltic Blend made fish farming more sustainable the Natural Resources Institute Finland, strong herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea are considered sustainable, so the local feed production is not harmful to natural fish stocks. A significant reduction in the Baltic Sea nutrient loading A total of 13,000,000 kg of fish a year is farmed in Finland. The feeding earlier based on raw materials brought from the world’s oceans has produced 60,000 kg of phosphorus load and 507,000 kg of nitrogen load each year. When the Baltic Sea feed Baltic Blend is introduced, significant nutrient load reductions will be achieved. On an annual basis, phosphorus will be reduced by 75,000 kg and nitrogen by 377,000 kg, so sustainable fish farming will decrease the nutrient load in the Baltic Sea. Raisioaqua has also developed a feeding concept Hercules Opti allowing the replacement of fish oil used in fish feeding by rapeseed oil while maintaining high levels of omega-3 fatty acids of fish. Already from 2009, the Hercules feeds contain phytase enzyme. Due to the enzyme, the phosphorus load into the water system decreased by 26 per cent. Feeds have a significant impact on the sustainability of fish farming. WWF Finland added Finnish farmed rainbow trout on the green list of its Seafood Guide in 2014 and Finnish farmed whitefish in 2016.

The food supplement Benecol Soft Chew launched in autumn 2016 is a new, convenient way to lower cholesterol for example during the workday or while travelling as it does not require cold storage. With changing eating habits and today’s mobile lifestyle, consumers increasingly eat away from home. Since the efficacy of Benecol products is at its best when consumed with food, Raisio developed a new, portable Benecol product storable at room temperature. Lemon and lime flavoured Benecol Soft Chew food supplement is easy to pack as it is light and small. It is sweetened with xylitol and the daily dose, 3-6 Soft Chews, is taken with one or more meals, with or without water. The food supplement launched in the autumn has been well received. Unlike other Benecol products, Benecol Soft Chew is primarily sold by pharmacies. It is available in Finland, Ireland, Belgium, Poland and Holland as well as in Raisio’s online Oatlet Store that supplies goods within the European Union. Benecol products sold in Raisio’s home markets are mostly cold chain items. The best-selling products are Benecol minidrinks and spreads. Product diversification is an integral part of the renewed Benecol. We want to provide effective and tasty alternatives to lower cholesterol so that as many consumers as possible could find a suitable Benecol product. Raisio’s brand Benecol is a Finnish top innovation promoting people’s well-being in about 30 countries. It has helped millions of consumers to lower their cholesterol levels for over 20 years.
