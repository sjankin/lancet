The president talked about the progress in the current Medium-Term Management Plan, the direction of the next Medium-Term Management Plan, which is still under development, the company’s non-financial initiatives, and other issues. The two invitees, shared their frank expectations of the company and provided some recommendations. (Held in a conference room at the head office in April, 2016) Mr. Hiroshi Watanabe Kazuaki Kotani Mr. Hirosuke Tai Portfolio Manager President and CEO Chief Analyst, Equity Research Department T. ROWE PRICE INTERNATIONAL LTD Nabtesco Corporation Daiwa Securities Co., Ltd. Hereinafter, names will be shown without titles. WEB About the Medium-Term Management Plan Message Movie: Conversations with CEO Full Version (28:48) Progress in and outlook for the current Medium-Term Management Plan Kotani: Regarding the progress we have made under the current Mid-Term Management Plan https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=AMQpKUHO-w8 [hereinafter, the “Mid-Term Plan”], for which fiscal 2016 marks the final year, unfortunately we will not be able to attain our predefined targets either for sales or for profit. This is mainly due to the impact felt in the Hydraulic Equipment Business by a sharp drop in demand for construction machinery in China. We recorded an operating loss in this business in fiscal 2015. In response, we consolidated two plants in China into one, reduced our production capacity, and recorded an impairment loss as part of our efforts to foster structural reforms. As the result, given that sales volume in the Chinese construction machinery market remains at the same level as in the previous year, we will be able to improve operating profit at least to break even level. We have thus already completed the implementation of the necessary remedies. Moreover, in general we expect that during the whole period starting from the final year of the previous Mid-Term Plan until the end of the current Mid-Term Plan, both our sales and profits will keep increasing. We expect to reach our numerical targets for the businesses located in developed countries, as well as for the businesses, whose clients are mostly represented by those countries. 13 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Specifically, we will achieve growth as planned in the Precision Reduction Gear, Marine Vessel WEB Equipment, Aircraft Equipment, and Automatic Door Businesses. For other businesses, we will be Message Movie: unable to achieve the predefined targets due to environmental changes in the emerging markets Conversations with CEO (China and Southeast Asia), for which we had especially high expectations of growth.

Kotani: We will expand the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) business. We used to passively wait for customer requests but in around 2014, particularly for the transport equipment segment, we began to promote the MRO business more aggressively, which has contributed to the increase in both sales and profit. On the other hand, in the Precision Reduction Gear and Hydraulic Equipment businesses, the effect of economic fluctuations significantly affect because customers take over MRO services. In the Precision Reduction Gear Business, we have been looking for new markets, apart from industrial robot, and have been promoting the sales of actuators, which are the new products combining precision reduction gears and servomotors, mainly outside Japan since the latter half of 2015. Also, in the Hydraulic Equipment Business, we are striving to expand to new markers in addition to the excavator market. About the financial strategies initiatives Watanabe: I think the efficient use of the balance sheet is one of the targets set in the Mid-Term Plan. Could you talk about your financial strategies? Kotani: As regards our financial strategies, let me first talk about the use of our capital. First of all, we will use earnings to make growth investments. We think that it is the best way to use the capital, and, as followed from the discussions, many investors agree with us. As for the breakdown of growth investments, the amount invested in M&A is relatively small except from the Automatic Door Business. We will make growth investments not only in capital expenditure but also in our technologies and products. If we can add new technologies and products to our existing key components for value creation, we will be able to further improve our capital efficiency. Our present financial foundation is not bad at all, but ROE has not been improving in the proportion to profit increases. We recognize that investors might take this as related to the tendency of Nabtesco to keep its retained earnings and not fully utilize its assets. Watanabe: Regarding M&A, I think investors need to be well aware of the fact that in many cases large-scale M&As, in particular those in which the acquisition amount exceeds 10% of the market value of the purchaser, are not very successful. This is because it is often difficult to integrate the two companies after the acquisition. Nabtesco has not become involved in such large M&As and has not experienced any big failures in its M&A projects. Still, please keep in mind the risks posed by large acquisitions when you are making big M&A plans in the future. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 14 Non-financial Initiatives About R&D Tai: It seems that Nabtesco has been fostering cooperation with overseas research institutes and promoting workforce diversity for the past 5 to 10 years. In regard to this, what were your achievements in R&D so far? Kotani: I believe that, as a component manufacturer, we have the ability to meet the needs of end product manufacturers in terms of quality, cost and delivery (QCD). However, we must make more efforts to expand trade with overseas customers. Our Japanese customers process the purchased components into subsystems by themselves in order to differentiate their products, while most of our overseas customers purchase standard products that have already been processed into subsystems and differentiate their applications to add more value to their products. I think we can learn about these different approaches and obtain related advice from overseas research institutions with whom we have formed partnerships, which will help us to develop the next generation of products. Group’s long-term targets (To be achieved in FY2020) Consideration for the environment < Target in Japan > Tai: Let me ask one more question. Recently ESG, which stands for the environment, society and Total CO2 emissions 15 governance, has often been referred to as a theme to be tackled by the corporate sector. What initiatives are you implementing for ESG, in particular for the environment? % reduction (Relative to FY2005) Kotani: It is critical to reduce CO2 emissions to curb climate change, and we have been discussing this issue inside the company since the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol by the international community. Nabtesco is a manufacturer and, as such, uses more machinery the more it grows, which Group’s inevitably leads to an increase in its CO2 emissions. long-term target (To be achieved by FY2020) In response, the former CEO of Nabtesco set the policy of reducing CO2 emissions by 1% annu< Global target > ally while pursuing the growth of the company. Further, in 2015, in order to execute a PDCA cycle Total CO2 emissions (per unit of sales) continuously for energy conservation, we set energy conservation guidelines for equipment invest20 ment. Since the establishment of the guidelines, we have been approving the construction of new % reduction plants on the precondition that energy consumption at each new plant is reduced by at least 40% (Relative to FY2012) compared to our conventional production facilities. For example, energy consumption is about 40% less at our new production base for precision reduction gears in China, than at the existing Tsu Plant. Also, at the new building under construction within the premises of the Gifu Plant (aircraft equipment plant) to enhance its production capacity, energy consumption will be reduced by more Outside directors on the than 50% relative to our conventional facilities. We will thus reduce our energy use while increasBoard of Directors ing production by operating new plants. (as of March 24, 2016) Furthermore, as established in our Mid-Term Plan, we continue the modernization of our plants in Japan by replacing, old equipment with new energy-saving and more productive equipment, based on the energy conservation guidelines, thereby reducing energy consumption at our existing plants. Furthermore, we are introducing solar-electric power generation, installed at Tarui, Tsu, and Kobe Plants. As mentioned, we regard environmental protection as an integral part of our corporate activi3 ties and strive to reduce our CO2 emissions by reducing our energy consumption. 10 persons Corporate governance Watanabe: As the result of the introduction of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code and Outside auditors on the Stewardship Code for investors, the public is paying even more attention to corporate governance. Board of Corporate What measures are you implementing in response to this trend? Auditors Kotani: We did not implement any extra measures to comply with the Corporate Governance (as of March 24, 2016) Code. By talking with investors, including foreign investors, about issues such as corporate governance as part of our IR activities, both the former CEO and I have become well aware that company needs to have independent outside directors. Therefore, independent outside directors are appointed every time new Nabtesco directors are selected, and the company had already 3 appointed two outside directors before the Corporate Governance Code was introduced. Since 5 persons around that time we have held numerous discussions on the composition of the Board of Directors and have decided on a Board of 10 directors, of which three would be independent outside directors. 15 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 As a result, we appointed the third outside director this year to arrive at three outside directors in total. Regarding in-house directors, we will continue our discussions on the best composition of the administrative and business departments. Moreover, we established a Nomination Committee in addition to the existing Remuneration Committee. Nonetheless, I think there is still room to improve our corporate governance, and we will therefore continue to work towards enhancing it. For Long-Term Improvement of the Corporate Value Managers of both the administrative and business departments should be strongly committed to making profit in the existing businesses Determined to emphatically and unequivocally make necessary growth investments About the next Medium-Term Management Plan Tai: What messages do you plan to send in the new Mid-Term Management Plan to be launched in the next fiscal year? Kotani: Our products are taking top spots in their respective markets, but we are facing difficulties in releasing new products. Although we have developed new products to meet the needs of our customers, we find it really difficult to release new value-added products. The next Mid-Term Plan will be set for a period of four years, lasting until the final year of our Long-Term Vision (FY2020). During the first two years or so, we will mainly pursue organic growth. Then, for the last two years, we will pursue the creation of new value and promote the sales of so-called subsystems as new products. We have three years including this one until 2019, while it will take about two years for our customers to evaluate our new products. Therefore, if we can release new products within the next two years or so, receiving inspiration, for example, from our collaborations with external organizations, this will drive our future growth. Thus, we will pursue organic growth first, and then try to introduce new valued-added products into the market to ensure profitability. Watanabe: Will you set any specific targets for capital efficiency and shareholder returns in the next Mid-Term Plan? Kotani: In order to gain more understanding from investors, I think we need to create and implement a total shareholder return plan. Our basic approach to finance is to make growth investments by debt and not by capital increase, in principle. If we really need to increase capital for a large M&A project to drive our growth, we will do so after making the necessary explanations. We can basically make capital expenditure using our own capital, and if we need more capital we will obtain it by debt procurement. It is estimated that we can potentially procure debt of about 80 billion yen based on our current financial situation, on the precondition that we continue to receive a credit rating of A. To maintain this, managers of both the administrative and business departments should be strongly committed to making profit in the existing businesses while also being determined to emphatically and unequivocally make necessary growth investments despite economic fluctuations. Based on this, we will discuss a total shareholder return plan at the Board of Director’s meetings in 2016 and disclose its results in the next Mid-Term Plan. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 16 At present, however, I am hesitating about the extent to which our numerical targets should be disclosed in the next Mid-Term Plan. It is certainly necessary for us to disclose the direction in which Nabtesco needs to move with a focus on growth, but is it also necessary to disclose our detailed numerical targets outside the company? Internally we will allocate human and other resources as well as funding based on the numerical targets. However, we might not be able to attain the targets as planned if the preconditions change due to economic shifts, which tend to occur in a shorter span of time and on a larger scale. Under these circumstances, we must consider whether it is beneficial to disclose detailed numerical targets to the public. Potential debt procurement capacity Balance sheet as of the end of Dec. 2015 Based on the precondition that a credit Liquidity on hand: About 35 billion yen rating of A is maintained, the equity ratio Shareholders’ equity: About 140 billion yen could be lowered to around 45% Equity ratio: 60.9% (meaning that Nabtesco has the potential No equity financing in principle to procure debt of 80 billion yen) Expectations toward and recommendations for Nabtesco Tai: On a mediumto long-term basis, I have two main expectations for Nabtesco. First, I expect the company to increase the number of its customers. I know that Nabtesco’s customers include top global brands and these companies have long served as the company’s driving force. I am now paying attention to the question of whether Nabtesco can gain more customers other than these large ones and if so, how many. Second, as the president has mentioned regarding actuators, I expect to see Nabtesco processing components into systems as much as possible or making better use of data by adopting the concept of the IoT, which has been a hot topic recently, to expand the MRO business. In short, Nabtesco could implement measures to add value to its products for higher profitability. I hope that the company will increase the number of customers on the vertical axis and expand the avenues of profit-making on the horizontal axis. Kotani: In fact, we regard what you have said as a new theme for the company. Among the slogans set in the Long-Term Vision, I like “Enjoy the Challenge” the most. I think we need to “play,” more or less, in our development activities to come up with new and quite innovative solutions, even if there is a risk that our customers will not accept them. I want employees to adopt such a proactive attitude to create more value-added products. Our balance sheet shows that Nabtesco can take that level of risk, and by taking on a series of challenges employees will be able to make great contributions to the next Mid-Term Plan. As for the development of new products, some of the seeds are starting to sprout, and we are also beginning to make measurable progress in our efforts to find new customers, including the challenge that we are taking in the European railroad market. However, I do not think that we will be able to achieve results as soon as in fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2018. We will have to patiently continue our efforts in order to achieve outcomes in subsequent years. Tai: Probably, the world we will see in 2020 or so will be very different. Kotani: Yes, indeed. Watanabe: In my opinion, many of the investors who pay attention to mediumto long-term increases in your company’s profits are very interested in how you are keeping a good balance between growth investments and shareholder returns. Nabtesco is engaged in a broad spectrum of businesses, including the businesses that are expected to achieve growth on a long-term basis, 17 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 such as precision reduction gears for industrial robots, and also those businesses that are unstable in terms of profitability due to their market business cycles. It is therefore difficult for outsiders to analyze the investments made by the company. Also, Nabtesco is conducting a range of businesses in China, which forced some investors to depend heavily on macroeconomic information about the Chinese market when evaluating the company, and as a result they sometimes felt uneasy about holding Nabtesco shares. It is important to disclose related information in more clearly in response to such investors’ concerns. I know you are proactively conducting IR activities, but please be more aware of the fact that investors frequently feel uneasy due to the lack of information. It would indeed help us investors make appropriate decisions if you disclose your mediumto long-term ideas about the company. Kotani: We will continue to actively disclose information, although it is not always possible to disclose it in a perfect manner. I am telling people at the company to foster the disclosure of data that we can show to the public. We are always working to achieve ambitious targets to increase our sales and profit, and I think it is necessary for us to disclose, as openly as possible, the preconditions that we need to meet to attain the targets. While we disclose the breakdown of our operating income by segment—and in no finer detail—we disclose the breakdown of sales by individual business. I think investors will be able to predict Nabtesco’s profitability in reference to the breakdown of operating income by segment and based on the results of the analyses they have made regarding the company. Watanabe: Last year, you repurchased your own shares for the first time to increase shareholder returns. I think that the buyback has given a strong message to investors because it implies that the company has confidence in its own growth and thinks that its stock price is at an appropriate level. I would like to see that the company makes use of the repurchase of its own shares as a means of returning more profits to shareholders and thereby mitigates the concerns of investors about shareholder returns. Kotani: Regarding the repurchase of our own shares, we will formulate a total shareholder return plan, as I have already mentioned. When we talk to investors about shareholder returns as part of our IR activities, many of them expect stable dividend payments and make comments along the lines of “I don’t want Nabtesco to reduce its dividends.” Or they say, “Even if the company’s profit has decreased due to outside changes, it has the ability to continue paying dividends for at least a year because it has a sound balance sheet.” There might be ups and downs in our businesses and if we continue to pay dividends too proactively and in a stable manner, it might have an adverse effect on our balance sheet. Based on this recognition, I think it would be better for us to propose a total shareholder return plan spanning around five years that combines increasing dividends with repurchases of our own shares as the chosen methods of returning more profits to shareholders. The former CEO aimed to increase the dividend payout ratio to 30% in his shareholder return plan, and I took over this idea and achieved the targeted ratio during the previous Mid-Term Plan period. At present, we have a policy of a dividend payout ratio of 30% or higher and stable payment of dividends. For the past five years, our profit has fluctuated. But we have never cut our dividends during that period.

Whether to describe the results of the past five years as “pure coincidences” or the “fruits of our management decisions” could be a matter of different expression styles. I would like to make more investors aware of our shareholder return plan by fostering the dialogue, hoping that they will evaluate our shares in consideration of the plan. Finally, let me say one more thing regarding last year’s repurchase of our own shares. We repurchased the shares when the prices were relatively high, and some investors have pointed out that the buyback helped maintain the stock prices. The period during which we were able to make a resolution on the repurchase of our own shares was limited, due to which it was difficult for us to choose the best timing for the buyback. At any rate, I think there were some learning points from this buyback process for the future. Generally, however, we earned good marks for the repurchase of our own shares, and I have one again recognized the importance of taking measures proactively to receive a higher evaluation from our stakeholders. Thank you very much for today. We will incorporate your valuable feedback into our management decisions and work to meet the expectations of all of our stakeholders. 19 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Message from General Manager of Corporate Planning Division PURSUING CAPITAL EFFICIENCY WHILE ACHIEVING BOTH GROWTH INVESTMENTS AND SHAREHOLDER RETURNS Based on a strong balance sheet and the capacity to generate stable cash flow, the Nabtesco Group pursues an optimal distribution of revenue and retained earnings with a view to maintaining an appropriate balance with strategic growth investments, a sound financial position, and shareholder returns. Going forward, we will employ financial leverage in consideration of the optimal level of debt, and seek further enhancement of capital efficiency while sustaining and improving profitability. Katsuhiro Teramoto Representative Director Managing Executive Officer General Manager of Corporate Planning Division The capital we have earned through our business activities will be allocated to growth investments Strategic growth in the first priority aimed at expanding our corporate value over the medium and long term. investments Under the current Medium-Term Management Plan, we are steadily making upfront investments aiming at further reinforcement of our business foundation. This has been somewhat pushing up selling, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditure, a cost increase that will temporarily decrease our profitability, but we are convinced that the upfront investments will WEB contribute to building a more solid business foundation.

In the fiscal year ended December 2015, https://youtu.be/ uH05JzVDhac we made bold investments in growth businesses, while endeavoring to invest efficiently by keeping abreast of changes in demand. We intend to continue along this upward trajectory in investments during the current fiscal year ending December 2016. Let me move on to discuss developments by business segment. In our Precision Reduction Gear Business targeting the industrial robot market, we increased production capacity at our Tsu Plant and launched production at a new production base in China1 starting January 2016.

Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 20 Investments for boosting production at the new Chinese production base will be continued during this fiscal year. We presume that a rapid increase in demand for industrial robots will continue in China over the medium term due to rising needs for automation and policy support provided by the Chinese government. As the world’s leading supplier of precision reduction gears, Nabtesco will make flexible investments while closely monitoring demand to secure an enduring and stable supply system and fortify its production system that allows “local production for local consumption.” In the Aircraft Equipment Business, we are planning to boost our production capacity in and after the fiscal year ending December 2016. Orders have been received for equipment to be used for new aircraft models: products for the Boeing 737 MAX and 777X, and Mitsubishi Aircraft MRJ2. In preparation for mass production of the equipment, we are stepping up the production capacity of the Gifu Plant, investing a total of about 10 billion yen by 2019, when the plant expansion work will be completed. Production and environmental efficiencies will be increased twofold to secure a long-term competitive advantage. The current Medium-Term Management Plan upholds the “modernization of domestic mother plants” as a key strategy. We are therefore planning to allocate around 50% of our capital expenditure this fiscal year toward enhancing productivity, renovating deteriorated facilities, ensuring safety, and implementing environmental measures. Through these initiatives, we intend to improve our production system to underpin the organic growth of our businesses. 1 N  abtesco (China) Precision Equipment Co., Ltd.: Jointly established with the Shanghai Electric Group in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province in China 2 Mitsubishi Regional Jet Nabtesco is proceeding with M&As for the purpose of absorbing outside resources to swiftly Harnessing M&A advance into new markets and expand lineups of technologies and products.

Our basic diviEnhancing dend policy under the current Medium-Term Management Plan is to “maintain the payout ratio at shareholder returns 30% or higher and not cut the dividend unless the ratio exceeds 40%.” However, the payout ratio increased to 49.5% in the previous fiscal year ended December 2015 as a result of maintaining the amount of dividend per share at the same level as in the fiscal year ended March 2015, and owing to the transitional period for changing the accounting term. In addition, we repurchased our own shares for the first time as part of measures to return profits to shareholders, acquiring 2.4% of the total number of outstanding shares and cancelling them all as of December 28, 2015. As a result, our total return ratio over the past cumulative five years amounted to approximately 48%. The annual dividend for the fiscal year ending December 2016 will be increased by 6 yen to 50 yen per share.

NABCO began conducting such business back in the 1930s, offering a range of products, not only for construction machines and special vehicles, but also for general industrial equipment. The company also developed small, multiple-spool control valves for use in road sweepers produced in Japan, and these valves have been developed into our present control valve products. Teijin Seiki began conducting business by establishing the Tarui Plant in 1961. Its hydraulic motors were not highly competitive despite being core products, and the company worked to develop a new product independently. The traveling units “GM Series” that was thus developed provided the four functions necessary for the driving unit of hydraulic excavators (i.e. hydraulic motor, reduction gear, valve and parking brake functions), and was also compact enough relative to the width of an excavator crawler shoe. The company then successfully commenced mass production of this innovative product. Further, the reduction gear technology developed for hydraulic motors led to the development of Precision Reduction Gear RV to control the joints of industrial robots. Subsequently, we established a production base in China in 1996 and another in Thailand in 2008, and have resulted in fostering overseas business expansion and increasing our global market share in the business of traveling units for hydraulic excavators to 30%.

Roles to Be Played by the Technology and R&D Division (1) Support for In-house Companies The Technology and R&D Division makes recommendations and supports in-house companies to help meet their challenges and develop necessary human capital with the aim of eventually improving manufacturing quality to the industry’s top level in each business field. The Division also formulates and implements intellectual property strategies to increase the company’s competitiveness and protect its intellectual rights and associated benefits in all business segments. It supports the development activities of the in-house companies by using IT-based technologies, including computer-aided engineering (CAE), digital engineering (DE), 3D printing technologies and its unique material technology. Through simulations made at the initial product development stage, the Division helps the in-house companies make prior verifications in a precise manner. In addition to this “front-loading type” of develDisc brake thermal analysis (example) opment support, it also supports in-house companies in human capital development and other development activities by providing electronics and sensor technologies. (2) Creating New Businesses The Division searches for the seeds of business, including market needs and technological seeds and engages in various development projects. The Division conducts joint research with both domestic and overseas universities, research institutes, and companies on multiple development themes to develop high-level technologies in a timely manner. The NDEC works on the creation of new businesses through a wide range of intra-industry and industry-academia collaborations, Fluid-structure coupled analysis taking an open innovation approach. for high-speed electromagnetic valve (example) (3) Enhance Base Technologies (Surface Treatment and Heat Treatment Technologies) Recently, great progress has been made on a range of machines in terms of energy conservation and product life longevity, which is said to be attributable to the advancement of surface treatment and heat treatment technologies. The Division proactively introduces the most advanced of these base technologies and verifies their effectiveness in laboratories, discloses the results internally, and applies the technologies to individual products and components in cooperation with the in-house companies. As competitors in emerging countries are catching up with us technologically, we are enhancing the base technologies and transforming them into “black box” technologies so that it will be difficult to imitate them. We are thus making Robot motion simulation efforts to maintain and increase our product competitiveness. (example) 45 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 03 Major R&D Fields Additive Manufacturing (Making use of 3D printers to acquire new manufacturing technologies) 3D printer technology is advancing from the stage of rapid prototyping (RP) to that of additive manufacturing (AM). Nabtesco has made the NDEC a center for its 3D printer-related technologies, and has equipped the NDEC with a metal 3D printer as well as a resin 3D printer (stereolithography equipment) to foster research into AM technologies. The NDEC has already started R&D using these printers, to further reduce the time required for development of new projects. We also plan to input resources in the development of materials to support the base technologies. Sensor Technology (Shift from prototyping to mass production of color and water sensors) Nabtesco developed a lubricant oil status monitoring sensor by using fine processing technology for semiconductors, and its unique color measurement technology developed for lubricant oil by using white LEDs. The sensor enables the real-time quantitative measurement of lubricant oil contamination, degradation and water content. We will foster the use of this sensor in a wider range of fields. Joint Research with Overseas Universities and Research Institutes We conducted wind power generation-related analyses jointly with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and announced the results at EWEA 2014 (European Wind Energy Association). In FY 2015, as the first stage of the joint research we continued working on the application of analytical technologies in preparation for their commercialization. In FY 2016 in the second stage, we plan to start validity testing using DTU-owned wind turbines. Moreover, in collaborative R&D with Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH) in Switzerland on power electronics, we have made progress not only in theory-building, but also in prototype development and presented our results on environmental energy generators with new methods as well as sensor technologies at several international symposiums. We also filed patent applications.

By concentrating our 3D printerrelated technologies in NDEC, we now possess the necessary leading-edge infrastructure to shorten the time required for development, from initial prototyping of products using resin and then metal, to design for mass production. We will develop products by taking advantage of the features of our 3D printers while also focusing on the acquisition of AM technologies using the 3D printers. Metal 3D printer Expanding Product Lines via M&A (From component unit sales to system product proposal) In April 2016, we absorbed Hyest Corporation which we have acquired with the purpose to enhance product development function through extension of hydraulic equipment product lines as well as to reinforce the hydraulic system function. By assimilating us with a power control company specialized in the Hydraulic Equipment Business, we push forward increasing the efficiency of the business operation and aim to accelerate the synergy effect development. In addition, in May 2016, through Nabtesco Automotive Corporation whose expertise lies in the Commercial Vehicle Equipment Business, we acquired German corporate vehicle compressor manufacturers, ITG Serienfertigung Fahrzeugteile GmbH and ITG Kompressoren GmbH. The acquisition will enable us to attain early production of high valueadded systems that are equipped with air dryer, our mainline product, and compressor technologies their primary technologies. The common objective of this set of acquisitions was to acquire a components entity so that we can accelerate the shift from sales of individual component units to the proposal of “system” products. With the strategic M&A, we will strive to respond to potential customer needs as well as create greater added-value. “Moving it, stopping it.” + 05 “Monitoring it, and repairing it.” Nabtesco has been shaping its motion control technology under the tag line “moving it. stopping it.” to provide customers with high-precision and high-efficiency products.

Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 126 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Nabtesco Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries Nine-month period ended December 31, 2015 and year ended March 31, 2015 1. Description of Business and Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements (1) Description of business Nabtesco Corporation (the “Company”), a Japanese corporation, was established as a holding company on September 29, 2003 through a stock transfer process by TS Corporation (formerly Teijin Seiki Co., Ltd.) and NABCO Ltd. As a result of the stock transfer, both TS Corporation and NABCO Ltd. became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Company completed its business integration through the acquisition of the two wholly owned subsidiaries on October 1, 2004. The main products of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the “Companies”) include precision equipment, transport equipment, aircraft and oil hydraulic equipment, and industrial equipment. (2) Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are based on their accounting records maintained in conformity with generally accepted principles prevailing in the respective countries of domicile. The accounts of consolidated overseas subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standard or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, with adjustment for the specific four items as applicable. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been restructured and translated into English from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements, but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translation of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars is included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at December 31, 2015, which is ¥120.61 to U.S. $1.00. The convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. 127 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its 48 subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions, account balances and unrealized profits are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 10 affiliated companies (generally 20% to 50% owned), over which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policy, are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Cash and cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, deposits with banks withdrawable on demand and short-term investments which are readily convertible to cash subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and which are purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. See Note 5 as to reconciliation to cash and deposits on the balance sheets. (3) Allowance for doubtful receivables The allowance for doubtful receivables is provided in amounts management considers sufficient to cover possible losses on collection. The allowance is based on past collection experience and management estimate of the collectability of individual receivables. (4) Provision for loss on order received To cover the future losses relating to order received, a provision is recorded when the future losses are anticipated and the losses are reasonably estimated. (5) Securities The Companies are required to examine the intent of holding each security and classify those securities as (a) securities held for trading purposes (hereafter, “trading securities”), (b) debt securities intended to be held to maturity, (c) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and (d) for all other securities that are not classified in any of the above categories (hereafter, “other securities”). The Companies have no trading securities at December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2015. Held-to-maturity debt securities are expected to be held to maturity and are recognized at amortized cost computed based on the straight-line method. Other securities with available fair market values are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on these securities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate component of Net assets. Realized gains and losses on sale of such securities are computed using the movingaverage cost method. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at moving-average cost. If the market value of equity securities and other securities declines significantly, such securities are written down to their fair market value and the difference between fair market value and the carrying amount is recognized as loss in the period of the decline. For equity securities with no available fair market value, if the net asset amount of the investee declines significantly, such securities are written down to the net asset amount in the income statement in the period of decline. In these cases, such fair market value or net asset amount will be the carrying amount of the securities at the beginning of the next year. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 128 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 (6) Inventories Inventories of the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries are stated at the lower of the cost or net realizable value, while inventories of its consolidated foreign subsidiaries are principally stated at the lower of cost or market. The evaluation methods for the cost of inventories are as follows: Inventories Evaluation method Finished goods and Work in process Mainly weighted average method (however certain finished goods and work in process are determined by the specific identification method) Raw materials and Supplies Mainly weighted average method (however certain raw materials and supplies are determined by moving average method) (7) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, including building and building fixtures, are stated at cost. The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries calculate depreciation by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. In addition, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries depreciate Machinery and equipment, of which acquisition cost is ¥100 thousand or more but less than ¥200 thousand, over a period of three years on a straight-line basis. The consolidated foreign subsidiaries calculate depreciation mainly by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation of assets acquired by the domestic companies after March 31, 2007 is calculated mainly by the straightline method under the amended tax code for building, not including building fixtures and by the declining-balance method under the amended tax code for the remaining assets. (8) Lease assets Property, plant and equipment capitalized under finance lease arrangements are depreciated over the lease term of the respective assets. (9) Derivative financial instruments and hedging transactions The Companies use derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of mitigating fluctuation risk of interest rates with respect to loans payable and future risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates with respect to foreign currency receivables and payables. The following summarizes hedging derivative financial instruments used by the Companies and items hedged: Hedging instruments Hedged items Interest rate swap contracts: Loans payable Forward foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency trade receivables and trade payables The Companies evaluate hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative changes in cash flows from or the changes in fair value of hedged items and the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedging derivative instruments. The Companies are required to state derivative financial instruments at fair value and to recognize changes in the fair value as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments meet the criteria for hedge accounting. 129 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Companies defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments until the related losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the net amount to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contract is added to or deducted from the interest on the assets or liabilities for which the swap contract is executed. If forward foreign exchange contracts are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, hedging instruments and hedged items are accounted for in the following manner: a When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge an existing foreign currency receivable or payable, (a) the difference, if any, between the Japanese yen amount of the hedged foreign currency receivable or payable translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract and the book value of the receivable or payable is recognized in the income statement in the period which includes the inception date, and (b) the discount or premium on the contract (that is, the difference between the Japanese yen amount of the contract translated using the contracted forward rate and that translated using the spot rate at the inception date of the contract) is recognized over the term of the contract. b When a forward foreign exchange contract is executed to hedge a future transaction denominated in a foreign currency, the future transaction will be recorded using the contracted forward rate, and no gains or losses on the forward foreign exchange contract or the forward foreign currency options are recognized. (10) Amortization Goodwill is amortized using the straight-line method over a period within twenty years. However, if the amount is insignificant, it is expensed as incurred. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (five years). (11) Research and development costs Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. (12) Income taxes The Companies recognize tax effects of timing differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for tax reporting purpose. Income taxes are comprised of corporation tax, enterprise tax and prefectural and municipal inhabitants taxes. (13) Provision for product warranties Provision for product warranties is provided to cover the estimated cost for customers’ claims relating to after sales repairs. (14) Translation of foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates. Financial statements of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates, except that shareholders’ equity are translated at historical rates and income statement items resulting from transactions with the Company are translated at the rates used by the Company when the transactions occurred. Foreign currency translation adjustment is reported in net assets. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 130 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 (15) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Japanese Corporate law, the appropriation of retained earnings with respect to a given financial period is made by a resolution of the shareholders at the general shareholders meeting held subsequent to the close of such financial period. Therefore, the accounts for that period do not reflect such appropriations. (16) Retirement benefits The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries provide two types of retirement and severance benefit plans, unfunded lump-sum payment plans and funded non-contributory pension plans, under which all eligible employees are entitled to benefits based on the level of wages and salaries at the time of retirement or termination, length of service and certain other factors. a Allocation of estimated retirement benefit obligation Expected retirement benefits are attributed to the respective fiscal years by a Benefit formula basis. b Past service costs and actuarial gains and losses Past service costs are recognized as expense when incurred, and actuarial gains and losses are recognized as expense from the following fiscal year using the declining-balance method over a certain period (10 years) not exceeding the average of estimated remaining service period. c Simplified method in small consolidated subsidiaries Certain consolidated subsidiaries calculate retirement benefit liabilities and expenses using the simplified method that assumes their benefit obligation is equal to the benefits payable if all employees voluntarily retired at fiscal year-end. (17) Provision for director’s retirement benefits Certain consolidated subsidiaries accrue liabilities for retirement benefits, which is estimated at the end of the fiscal year, for their directors and corporate statutory auditors based on their internal policies. (18) Earnings per share The computation of basic net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock after consideration of dilution that securities or other contracts to issue common stock are exercised or converted into common stock, or resulted into issuance of common stock. Amounts per share of net assets are calculated based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding at the year-end. Cash dividends per share include interim dividends of the Company proposed by the Board of Directors in addition to year-end dividends approved by shareholders at the general shareholders meeting held subsequent to the end of fiscal year. 131 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 (19) Recognition of significant revenues and expenses Accounting for construction of completions When the construction work is in progress at year end and the progress rate of construction work up to that time is deemed certain, the percentage-of-completion method is applied. The progress rate is estimated using cost-to-cost method. When the above condition is not met, the completed-contract method is applied. (20) Change in fiscal year The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries changed their fiscal year end from March 31 to December 31. The consolidated fiscal year end was also changed from March 31 to December 31. As a result of the change, consolidation period consists of the nine months from April to December for the Company and its subsidiaries whose fiscal year end was previously March 31 and consists of the twelve months from January to December for subsidiaries whose fiscal year end was December 31. 3. Change in Accounting policy (1) Accounting Standard for Business Combination Effective from the beginning of this fiscal year, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries has applied “Revised Accounting Standard for Business Combination” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Statement No. 21, issued on September 13, 2013, (“Statement No. 21”)), “Revised Accounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements” (ASBJ Statement No. 22, issued on September 13, 2013 (“Statement No. 22”)) and “Revised Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Statement No. 7, issued on September 13, 2013 (collectively, the “Business Combination Accounting Standards”). As a result, the difference arising from changes in the equity in subsidiaries under ongoing control of the Company should be accounted for as capital surplus, and acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses for the fiscal year in which they are incurred. In addition, with respect to any business combination took place on or after April 1, 2015, it is required to reflect adjustments to the allocation of acquisition cost under the provisional accounting treatment retrospectively on the consolidated financial statements in which the relevant business combination became or will become effective. Presentation of “net income” was changed and the term of “minority interest” was replaced to “non-controlling interests.” In order to reflect the changes in the presentation, certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements with respect to the previous fiscal year. The Business Combination Accounting Standards has been applied prospectively, in accordance with the transitional treatments of article 58-2 (4) of Statement No. 21 and article 44-5 (4) of Statement No. 22 has been applied prospectively. In the consolidated statement of cash flows of the current fiscal year, cash flows from acquisition or disposal of the shares in subsidiaries with no changes in the scope of consolidation are included in “Cash flows from financing activities”, and cash flows from acquisition related costs of the shares in subsidiaries with changes in the scope of consolidation and costs related to acquisition or disposal of the shares in subsidiaries with no changes in the scope of consolidation are included in “Cash flows from operating activities”. As a result, the impact on income, Cash flows for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2015 and Capital surplus as at December 31, 2015 are immaterial. The impact on the earnings per share is explained in Note 17 “Earnings Per Share”. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 132 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 4. Accounting standards issued but not yet applied Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred tax assets (ASBJ Guidance No. 26 issued on December 28, 2015) (1) Overview The implementation Guidance basically continues to apply the framework used in the JICPA Guidance No. 66 that provides the criteria to classify entities into five categories and determines the amount of deferred tax assets according to those categories, but certain accounting treatments were changed. The implementation Guidance includes the following: a Accounting treatments for entities which are not included in any categories, b Criteria as to the classification of entities in the (Category 2) and (Category 3), c Accounting treatments of unscheduled deductible temporary differences for entities in the (Category 2),  Accounting treatments for reasonably estimated period for taxable income before temporary differences for entities in the (Category 3), which are scheduled to be deductible after 5 years, and  Accounting treatments for entities in the (Category 4) in the current fiscal year, which are expected to be included in the (Category 2) or (Category 3) in the future year.

Financial Instruments (1) Qualitative information on financial instruments a Policies for using financial instruments The Company raises required fund for its business primarily from loans payable and bond issues, and manages surplus funds using financial instruments that carry low or no risk. The Company uses derivatives to mitigate the risk that are described below, and as a matter of policy does not use derivatives for speculative transactions. b Details of financial instruments used and the exposures to risk and how they arise Trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from receivables denominated in foreign currencies. The Company uses derivative transactions including forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk of exchange fluctuations associated with receivables denominated in foreign currencies. Short-term investment securities and other securities mainly consist of held-to-maturity debt securities and securities for strengthening the relationship with counterparty and exposed to market price risk. Loans payable and bonds payable are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments. The repayment dates of long term loans payable extend up to five years beyond the date of the closing of accounts. The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuation that arise from receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. c Policies and processes for managing the risk (a) Credit risk management (counterparty risk) The Company has prepared policies for managing its credit exposure and business receivables. The Company manages amounts and settlement dates by counterparties and works to identify and mitigate payment risk that may result from situations including deterioration of the financial condition of counterparties at an early stage. Consolidated subsidiaries are subject to the same risk management rules. Held-to-maturity debts securities carry low credit risk because they are managed in high liquidation. The Company conducts only with highly creditworthy financial institution under the risk management policy when using derivatives. (b) Market risk management The Company and some consolidated subsidiaries use derivative transactions including forward foreign exchange contract to hedge the risk of exchange fluctuations associated with receivables denominated in foreign currencies. For short-term investment securities, the Company examines fair value and the financial condition of the issuing entities. In addition, for all securities other than those classified as held-to-maturity debt securities, the Company regularly revises its portfolio based on its relationships with issuing entities, and interest rate swap transactions to hedge against interest rate risks on long-term loans payable. For derivative transactions, the basic policies for executing the derivative transactions are managed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Based on such policies, the finance departments of each company establish the internal policies which prescribe the specified limits and procedures on the derivative transactions. After execution, each finance department reports certain information on derivative transactions to the Board of Directors of the Company. (c) Liquidity risk management The Accounting Department manages liquidity risk for the Company by making and updating a capital deployment plan based on reports from each division. In addition, the Company manages liquidity risks by keeping high leveled liquidity on hand due to the unstable financial market. Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 134 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 d Supplemental information on fair values The fair value of financial instruments is based on market prices, or a reasonable estimate of fair value for instruments for which market prices are not available. Estimates of fair value are subject to fluctuation due to the variable factors and assumption. In addition, the contractual amounts of the derivative transactions discussed in “Derivative Financial Instruments” below are not an indicator of the market risk associated with derivative transactions. (2) Fair value of financial instruments Fair value and difference compared to the book value reported in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2015 are as follows.

Net Assets Under the Japanese Corporate Law, upon issuance of common stock, the entire amount of the issue price is required to be accounted for as common stock, although companies may, by resolution of the Board of Directors, account for an amount not exceeding one-half of the issue price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, in cases where dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in-capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in-capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital could be used to eliminate or reduce a deficit by a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Japanese Corporate Law, however, all additional paid-in-capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Japanese Corporate Law. 143 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY2015/12 Nabtesco Group Integrated Report FY Ended December 31, 2015 13.
