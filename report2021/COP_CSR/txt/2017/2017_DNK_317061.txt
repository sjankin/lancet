In contributes to addressing the 2016, the share of renewable energy amounted to 21.2 per cent. challenges of producing dairy in a sustainable way. As an implementing member of the Dairy Sustainability Framework (DSF), an initiative leading the way to sustainable dairy production globally, Arla supports the industry by sharing its knowledge. Valuable discussions on how to move forward are also held in the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Dairy Working Group (SAI DWG) in which Arla is an active member, together with peers and customers. In 2016, DSF-indicators were defined for greenhouse gas emissions and animal care, and the SAI DWG agreed on minimum levels for animal care, working conditions, legal compliance and biodiversity. It is Arla’s conviction that this wide and collaborative approach will result in both sustainable and commercial advantages. 26 SUSTAINABLE DAIRY PRODUCTION Switching to renewable energy doesn’t happen overnight Arla’s 2020 goal is for half of its worldwide energy consumption to come from renewable sources. However, it’s not as simple as just pushing a button to make this green shift. It is a question of cost, availability and quality. “When I started working with this, about 12 years The fact that renewables, with the exception of solar More biogas ago, we were purchasing diesel oil, electricity and natural gas, and our focus was wholly on price. Now, and wind, have not yet reduced in price and become more readily available disappoints Peter.

One way Arla helps to encourage climate impact as well as responsible for purchasing all the energy that Arla uses renewable energy production is to work closely with generate energy for the grid. in all markets, for both production and transport. both existing and potential suppliers. At Arla’s Lockerbie site in Scotland, Peter describes how conditions today vary a lot from Meanwhile internally, Arla’s recipe to reaching its goal production waste is currently fed country to country. Sweden and Denmark already use is cooperation between colleagues in procurement, to an effluent treatment plant a high percentage of renewables, while the UK and environment and processing. that includes a very large, aerated Germany, Arla’s two other large production countries, lagoon.
