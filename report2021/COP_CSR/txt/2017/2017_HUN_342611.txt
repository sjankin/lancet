• • • • • • In close cooperation with our logistics partners, we continuously search for ways to optimize the loading of trucks and reduce the environmental impact of transportation. Using our Cube packaging system, the windows are wrapped with stretch foil and stacked horizontally in the trucks to allow as many windows as possible in each load. The windows travel from production site to point of use in the same packaging, with only the stretch foil being discarded. The packaging allows easy opening by the installer and reduces the number of heavy lifts required by the installer. All cardboard used for packaging can be recycled.
