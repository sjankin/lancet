We strive to find ways of conducting businesses using smart approaches and most of our R&D work centers on finding ways to minimize or eliminate the impracticalities. Today, we have successfully formulated and synthesized a very stable mixture of bio-fuels with Nano Emulsion and Polarization Technology which requires blending & storage tanks to mix bio components and fossil fuels. Even though most of our additives are Jatropha based, we have the technology to formulate “Drop-In” additives derived from other types of feedstock such as used cooking oil, canola, cotton seed oil, algae etc. As bio-fuels and renewable fuels are comparatively new to existing fossil, we do not wish to be seen as competitor to the oil majors. Instead we opt and prefer to collaborate with the oil majors, national oil and energy companies to further enhance their existing products and turning them into renewable fuels. We firmly believe that through collaboration with the oil majors we would be able to speed up the promotion and use of renewable energy, minimize or eliminate investments required for infrastructure setups and utilizing the oil majors’ industry knowledge & experience, retailing, and supply chain. Through our technology, we believe this could also reduce the use of fossil thus prolonging the life of oil reserves. 0023 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 BIONAS PRODUCTS REGISTRATION, CERTIFICATION & TEST REPORTS The Company’s products registration with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 0024 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 Certificate of Fuel Additive Registration from Department of Energy, Ministry of Energy, Philippines to Bionas Philippines Corporation 0025 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 Permanent Registration for B30(M) Bio-Petrol and B30 Bio-Diesel issued by the Ministry of Energy, Philippines for Bionas Philippines Corporation 0026 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 Test result by PUSPAKOM (Malaysian Government Vehicle Inspection Agency) with 94% Emission Reduction.

Its goal is to reverse land degradation and desertification in the Sahel and Sahara, boost food security and support local communities to adapt to climate change. In Africa's Sahel and Sahara region, fertile drylands are a vital source of life to millions. Not only is this precious natural asset the basis for food security and agricultural production, it also generates employment and mitigates social crises for the region's most poverty stricken and vulnerable people. An estimated 83 percent of rural Sub-Saharan Africans are dependent on livelihoods from the land, yet 40 percent of Africa's land resources are currently degraded, driving poverty, hunger, unemployment, forced migration and conflict while amplifying climate risks such as drought and floods. Eleven countries in the Sahel-Sahara region—Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Senegal—have joined to combat land degradation and restore native plant life to the landscape. 0069 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB Nigeria’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution Aspect Type of objective Reduction from Business as Usual (BAU) Target year 2030 Implementation period 2015-2030 Base data period 2010-2014 Summary objective Economic and social development: grow economy 5% per year, improve standard of living, electricity access for all Unconditional and conditional 20% unconditional mitigation objectives 45% conditional Key measures • Work towards ending gas flaring by 2030 • Work towards Off-grid solar PV of 13GW (13,000MW) • Efficient gas generators • 2% per year energy efficiency (30% by 2030) • Transport shift car to bus • Improve electricity grid • Climate smart agriculture and reforestation Emissions per USD GDP 0.873 kg CO2e (2015) 0.491 kg CO2e (2030) GDP per capita 2,950 (2014) 3,964 (2030) Estimated emission per capita Current: around 2 tonnes CO2e 2030 BAU: around 3.4 tonnes CO2e 2030 Conditional: around 2 tonnes CO2e Global warming potentials used IPCC Fourth Assessment Report Cost estimate data National Cost = $142b: National Benefits = $304b (World Bank report “Low Carbon Development Opportunities for Nigeria 2013”) Gases covered CO2, N2o, CH4 Emissions as % of global total <1% (2010) Historical emission (1850-2010) 2,564.02 million tonnes 0070 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB Bionas’ Plans for Nigeria’s Indc Aspect Type of objective Roadmap to Nigeria Go Green Target year 2022 Implementation 2017 2022 period Summary objective Energy, economic and social development: reduced carbon emission and enforce biofuels policy efficiently, grow economy 5% per year, improve standard of living, electricity access for all Key measures • Climate smart agriculture and reforestation with Jatropha Curcas L. • Work towards biofuels from Jatropha • Work towards waste to energy by bio-digester, pyrolysis & distillation • Efficient gas generators • Develop Green Cities, Green Sea Port City & Green Airport City • Target of holding global warming to well below 2⁰C Biofuels Blending 20% 30% renewable fuel + 70% 80% crude oil Mechanism Emissions 80% 95% Reduction Target Gases covered COx, NOx, SOx, CH4 Emissions as % of <1% (2010) global total 0071 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 2017 WORLD CLEAN ENERGY HUB Energy & Food Security Program For Nigeria E-Consumer E-Government E-Business Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) System JATROPHA AGROFOOD KIOSKS POLITAN DEVELOPMENT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AGRO BUSINESS (BIOFUELS/CLEAN ENERGY & WASTE TO ENERGY) MURABAHAH & RETAIL PROJECT FINANCING FINANCING Green Funds Fund Raising 1.
