Energy consumption as a proportion of sales was down 4% compared with 2015, on a reduction target of 8% by 2020. In line with its commitments, the Group pursued its ISO 50001 energy management certification target, bringing the number of ISO 50001 certified sites to 12% of the total at the end of 2016. 4 In 2016, the total amount of waste as a proportion of sales increased by 3.7% compared with 2015. The increase had two main causes:  first, the opening of new sites, which generate more waste during the start-up phase, and the development of new products at existing sites, which also generate more waste during the launch phase due to a higher reject rate than during a period of stabilized production;  second, more accurate reporting this year, which resulted in more thorough results for this item, in the identification and counting of waste for instance. 2016 Registration Document – Valeo 193 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 4 Environmental management and performance of Valeo’s sites Review of the 2008-2016 performance 3 Water consumption 3 Waste production 368 17.1 17.0 184 -1% -50% 2008 2016 2008 2016 Total water consumption/Sales (cu.m/€m) Total waste production/Sales (metric tons/€m) 3 Energy consumption 3 Direct and indirect CO2 emissions 199 59.6 56.6 137 -31% -5% 2008 2016 2009 2016 Total energy consumption/Sales (MWh/€m) Total Scope 1 + 2 /Sales (metric tons of CO2/€m) 3 Packaging consumption 7.5 5.6 The charts on this page show the very significant reductions achieved by Valeo since 2008 in its water, energy and packaging consumption in proportion to its sales (reduced by 50%, 31% and 26% respectively). -25% Waste production has been steady as a proportion of sales since 2008.

To this end, and with the aim of identifying new areas for improvement, Valeo has chosen to conduct a pilot project on a site that has already achieved significant reductions in energy consumption. The Angers site (Visibility Systems, France), identified as a Center of Excellence for the conservation of energy, was selected as the pilot site in 2015. The first step was to install equipment to measure the main sources of electricity consumption on the site, such as on each of the injection presses, which consume particularly large amounts of energy. The measurements were analyzed, notably by cross-referencing energy consumption with the number of produced parts per machine during a given period. The objective is to optimize the energy consumption of each machine with respect to the level of production based on a “kWh per parts produced” indicator. In 2017, production managers will be required to use this indicator, which will be displayed on each machine, to manage stops and restarts. The results obtained allow conclusions to be drawn as to the effectiveness of the approach and its possible mainstreaming on other Group sites. In conjunction with this pilot, Valeo plans to map the various initiatives that have helped to achieve energy savings at each site. This will enable the Group to identify sites that have not yet committed to action and to encourage them to implement such initiatives. Valeo has set itself the goal of reducing its total energy consumption as a proportion of sales by 8% between 2016 and 2020. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions Challenges Approach Since 2009, Valeo has made progress in the analysis of its carbon Valeo is actively working to reduce its consumption of footprint by evaluating the direct and indirect greenhouse gas energy and resources in order to decrease its greenhouse (GHG) emissions resulting from its activities. For 2016, the gas emissions. following emission sources are included in the review:  direct GHG emissions: combustion emissions from stationary sources on sites, emissions from fuel combustion by Group-owned vehicles, direct emissions from non-energy processes such as the incineration of VOCs(1), and direct fugitive emissions relating to refrigerant leaks (included in Scope 1 of the international framework);  indirect GHG emissions: associated with energy consumption, related to the consumption of electricity, steam, compressed air and other sources (included in Scope 2 of the international framework);  other indirect GHG emissions: related to purchases of products used in industrial processes, and the transportation of goods and people (included in Scope 3 of the international framework).

The comparison of 35.8% this chart with that of the geographic breakdown of total energy Europe 1.5% consumption (see “Analysis of the geographic breakdown of South America energy consumption”, pages 196 to 197 of this section) shows that while Valeo’s European sites consume around 48% of the Group’s total energy, the associated GHG emissions account 42.7% for just under 36% of the Group total. By contrast, sites in 0.5% Asia Asia consume nearly 29% of the Group’s total energy but emit Africa approximately 43% of its total GHG emissions. The difference stems from the fact that the power plants that provide energy to Valeo’s sites in Asia are mainly fired by coal, which emits substantial quantities of GHG. The Group’s growth in Asia accordingly results in an increase in absolute terms in indirect emissions of greenhouse gases. 2016 Registration Document – Valeo 199 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 4 Environmental management and performance of Valeo’s sites Scope 3 In 2016, Valeo estimated all other indirect emissions sources (Scope 3) linked to its activity.

Valeo will next year incorporate emissions from product use when calculating its overall carbon footprint. The chart below shows the preeminent contribution of materials used in industrial processes to the Group’s overall carbon footprint (approximately 85%, of which two-thirds for metals), whereas direct emissions represent only 2% of the overall footprint. 3 2016 breakdown of GHG emissions 0.4% 1.4% 1.7% 0.2% 2.7% 0.1% 8.7% 0.1% Direct emissions – combustion energy (1.4%) Direct emissions – refrigerant leaks (0.2%) Direct emissions – Valeo vehicles (0.1%) Other direct emissions (0.1%) Indirect emissions – production of input materials (84.7%) 84.7% Indirect emissions – production of electricity and other sources of energy (8.7%) Indirect emissions – logistics (2.7%) Indirect emissions – commuting (1.7%) Indirect emissions – business travel (0.4%) Outlook Valeo has set itself the goal of reducing its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) as a proportion of sales by 8% between 2016 and 2020. 4 2016 Registration Document – Valeo 201 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 4 Environmental management and performance of Valeo’s sites 4.3.3 Discharges and waste Valeo’s activities are liable to generate the discharge Each Valeo site assesses, particularly whenever any production of substances into the air or soil that could impact the processes are changed, potential ways of reducing atmospheric environment. Such discharges must be tightly controlled so emissions of pollutants at source, focusing primarily on as to avoid pollution. processes that do not require the installation of treatment facilities. To this end, Valeo sites are required to identify any substances prohibited or regulated by local regulations or by customers in Performance its buildings, manufacturing equipment or products. Valeo monitors emissions into the air of volatile organic All such prohibited or controlled substances are listed in a compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), lead (Pb) and database known by the acronym BRDS (“Banned, Regulated trichlorethylene (TCE) resulting from its activities. and Declared Substances”) established by the Group. Emissions of sulfur oxides (SOx) are not monitored, as The Group also prohibits the use of the following substances: combustion equipment mainly uses natural gas, which does  asbestos; not emit sulfur oxides during combustion.  PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls);  refrigerants such as halons, CFCs, etc.; Atmospheric VOC emissions  RCFs (refractory ceramic fibers); 119 117  radioactive substances. 109 Valeo has for several years sought to take a proactive approach to reducing emissions of substances that deplete the ozone layer. Its commitments on the subject are set out in a dedicated directive in the Risk Management Manual. Chlorofluorocarbons 1,590 1,644 (CFCs) and halons are prohibited substances at Valeo. For 1,444 hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the Group’s objective is to bring forward the elimination deadlines set under the Montreal Protocol. To comply with this directive, the sites have taken action on system replacement and periodic monitoring of 2014 2015 2016 leaks from equipment containing refrigerants. Atmospheric VOC emissions/Sales (kg/€m) Because of their danger and their legacy use in industrial Atmospheric VOC emissions (metric tons) processes on its sites, the Group also works to reduce the consumption of heavy metals (lead, mercury, chromium VI, VOC emissions fell by a further 6.8% as a proportion of sales cadmium), chlorinated solvents and substances classified in 2016. under European regulations as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR). The decline was attributable chiefly to the Thermal Systems Business Group after the oil used in the manufacturing process was changed. Prevention of air emissions The Group is constantly improving the methodology used to Approach obtain a consistent estimate of VOC emissions at each site, thereby increasing confidence in the figures reported each year. Each site must establish an organization to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements in respect of air emissions. Atmospheric NOx emissions This organization requires the establishment by each site of an emissions inventory aimed at: 9.5  8.6 identifying the sources of air emissions based on a 8.1 comprehensive review of the site’s processes and activities, and facilities for the treatment of these emissions;  describing the nature of emissions on the basis of their origin (emissions from combustion plants or production processes); 119 121 122  quantifying emissions in order to determine the need to obtain operating permits in accordance with applicable regulations. 2014 2015 2016 Atmospheric NOx emissions /Sales (mg/€m) Atmospheric NOx emissions (metric tons) 202 Valeo – 2016 Registration Document SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Environmental management and performance of Valeo’s sites NOx emissions are estimated on the basis of consumption of water from fire extinguishers must be separated and oil and gas, mainly used for heating, heat treatment processes analyzed prior to proper disposal. and VOC incinerators.

Valeo, a participant in the remanufacturing market Through its remanufacturing activity, Valeo places its OEM parts design and manufacturing expertise at the service of the remanufacturing market, for which the Group has developed a high-quality, environmentally friendly range of products. Valeo only offers remanufactured products, as opposed to reused, repaired, rebuilt, refurbished, reworked or reconditioned products, and uses quality processes and standards to ensure the quality of the products offered for sale(1). Valeo offers two ranges of parts – one new and one remanufactured. Remanufactured systems are mainly alternators and starters as well as clutches and thermal compressors. Valeo has set up an efficient system called e-CORPS to collect used parts. The system permits the immediate identification of product references (type of part, origin, size, production year, etc.). Once parts have been retrieved, Valeo disassembles, inspects and cleans them, and subjects them to electrical and electronic tests. Valeo then initiates a remanufacturing process, which most importantly involves eliminating any traces of hazardous substances to guarantee personal protection. With more than 40 testing points for rotating machines on test benches, Valeo meets the standards of the original equipment market, and tests all remanufactured products before packaging them for sale on the aftermarket. This industrial expertise has enabled Valeo to offer a full range and selection of remanufactured parts, and thereby to champion environmental protection in the remanufacturing market. 4 (1) The definition of remanufactured products is common to the entire industry (ACEA, APRA, CLEPA, FIRM, VDA): “A remanufactured part fulfills a function which is at least the equivalent to the original part. It is restored from an existing part (core), using standardized industrial processes in line with specific technical specifications. A remanufactured part is given the same warranty as a new part, and it clearly identifies the part as a remanufactured part and the remanufacturer”. 2016 Registration Document – Valeo 245 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 4 Commitment to corporate citizenship 4.5.5 Public and regulatory policies Challenges Relationships with public bodies A major innovative player in the automotive industry operating Valeo develops institutional relationships with relevant in many countries, Valeo is an important group for the life of administrations (at international, national and local level), certain areas. through regular dialog, such as:  dialog with international organizations (UN Global Compact, Approach and achievements during the year OECD, World Bank); Relationships with professional associations  consultations on request: As an independent, global tier-one automotive equipment (1)  from the European Commission (Directorates-General supplier, Valeo is a member of the main organizations that for Industry, Research, Transport, and the Environment), represent the interests of initial-fit and aftermarket equipment  from ministries of industry (France, China, Spain), the suppliers on the world’s main automotive markets: economy (France, Poland, Japan, Germany), research  in Europe: CLEPA (European Association of Automotive (France, China), energy (France, United States), Suppliers); transportation (France, Germany, United States) and  employment (all countries where there are Valeo sites); in the United States: OESA (Original Equipment Supplier Association);  co-construction/co-management of jointly financed projects,  especially through participation in the governance bodies in France: FIEV (Fédération des Industries des Équipements of European Union public-private partnerships (European pour Véhicules); Green Vehicle Initiative Association – EGVI);   in Germany: VDA (Verband der Automobilindustrie); participation in the construction of roadmaps, under Valeo’s  in Spain: Sernauto (Asociación Española de Fabricantes de co-chairmanship (since 2014) of ERTRAC, the European Equipos y Componentes para Automoción); Commission technology platform (see section 4.2.4 of this  in Italy: ANFIA (Associazione Nazionale Fra Industrie chapter, “European Road Transport Research Advisory Council Automobilistiche); (ERTRAC)”, page 182).  in Japan: JAPIA ( Japan Autoparts Industries Association); Institutional relationships are coordinated under the  in Brazil: Sindipeças (Sindicato Nacional da Indústria de responsibility of three people at Head Office, and relayed Componentes para Veículos Automotores). locally, as required, by management in the country or region concerned.

Valeo – 2016 Registration Document SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Commitment to corporate citizenship Valeo employees, working with the local community Valeo North America is committed to sustainable local communities In 2016, Valeo’s teams in Troy and Auburn Hills decided to get more involved in sustainable development within their local communities, launching projects in four main areas:  strengthening global awareness about the importance of recycling;  providing concrete examples of the potential of reusing used objects;  supporting young people in difficulty;  supporting efforts to assist homeless people in difficulty and their families. This commitment resulted in the launch of a major recycling and reuse initiative at the headquarters of Valeo’s North American Division in Troy, with the organization of a drive to recycle and reuse electronic products. Building on a system involving the sorting and reuse of electronic products, the initiative led to donations to local organizations, while raising awareness about the importance of recycling. As regards support for young people in difficulty, the Valeo Women Connected network, which brings together women working at Valeo around sponsorship and mentoring, took part in the DREAM mentoring operation led by the association Vista Maria in May 2016. Vista Maria specializes in the support, assistance and education of young people in difficulty. Similarly, members of Valeo Women Connected volunteered as part of a partnership with the Grace Center, which is dedicated to providing shelter for the homeless and their families.

The organization works to encourage the independence and professional and personal integration of people with motor disabilities. The foundation has put together a considerable network of expertise, including doctors, heads of motor disability associations and heads of partner companies. Valeo works alongside professionals from the foundation’s wheelchair selection and test center. The Group’s Research and Development Department thus launched a technological innovation program to build an obstacle detection system to fit into wheelchairs. The system will allow people who occasionally lose control of their movements to drive a wheelchair and offer them a certain degree of mobility. 2016 Registration Document – Valeo 249 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 4 Methodology and international guidelines 4.6 Methodology and international guidelines 4.6.1 Sustainable development reporting methodology Environmental reporting methodology Changes in scope Data for sites newly consolidated in a given year (i.e., new In view of the lack of public guidelines applicable to the sites or sites in which the Group increases its interest and automotive supplier business, environmental indicators were gains control) are only consolidated as of the following year. reported in compliance with internal procedures developed by the Group.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the shareholders, In our quality as an independent veriﬁer accredited by the COFRAC(1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of the company Valeo, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2016, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the “CSR Information”, pursuant to the provisions of the article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the company It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce), in accordance with the protocols used by the company (hereafter referred to as the “Criteria”), and of which a summary is included in the management report and available on request at the company’s headquarters. Independence and quality control 4 Our independence is deﬁned by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the article L.822-11 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Responsibility of the independent verifier It is our role, based on our work:  to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R.225-105 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information);  to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria. Our veriﬁcation work mobilized the skills of ﬁve people between October 2016 and February 2017 for an estimated duration of eight weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the Order of May 13, 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party veriﬁer conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of fairness and the reasonable assurance report, in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000(2). 1. Attestation of presence of CSR Information Nature and scope of the work We obtained an understanding of the company’s CSR issues, based on interviews with the management of relevant departments, a presentation of the company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the activities of the company and its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programs. We have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the Article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce).

We veriﬁed that the information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L.233-1 and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L.233-3 of the French Commercial code (Code de commerce). Conclusion Based on this work, we conﬁrm the presence in the management report of the required CSR information. 2. Limited assurance on CSR Information Nature and scope of the work We undertook around ten interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments, in charge of the data collection process and, if applicable, the people responsible for internal control processes and risk management, in order to:  Assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards;  Verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices. For the CSR Information which we considered the most important(1):  At the level of the consolidated entity, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report;  At the level of the representative selection of sites that we selected,(2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 10% of the total workforce and between 16% and 20% of the quantitative environmental information, that were considered as representative characteristics of the environmental and social domains. (1) Social information: Indicators (quantitative information): total headcount and breakdown, hiring and terminations, number of absence hours and absenteeism rate, frequency (FR1 and FR2) and severity rate of work accidents, total number of training hours, number of employees trained. Qualitative information: employment (total headcount and breakdown by gender and geographic area, hiring and terminations), organisation of working time, labour relations (social dialogue, collective agreements), absenteeism, health and safety at the work place, work accidents, notably their frequency and their severity, training policies, diversity and equality of treatment and opportunities (measures undertaken for gender equality, employment, inclusion of disabled people, anti-discrimination policies and actions), promotion and respect of the ILO core conventions (freedom of association, anti-discrimination policies and actions, elimination of forced labour and child labour). Environmental and Societal information: Indicators (quantitative information): number of ISO 14001 certified sites, hazardous and non-hazardous waste production in tons, valorisation rate, electric and thermal energy consumed in MWh, direct and indirect greenhouse gases emissions in tons, volatile organic compounds emissions in tons, and packaging material consumption in tons; Qualitative information: approaches to environmental evaluation and certification, training and information delivered to the employees, resources dedicated to the prevention of risks and pollutions, preventative measures, reduction of and compensation for discharges into the air (volatile organic compounds emissions), circular economy (preventative measures, recycling and waste management, water consumption, total energy consumption, measures undertaken to improve energy efficiency and to promote the use of renewable energy), climate change (the significant emission sources of greenhouse gas generated by the company’s activities, including the use of the goods and services it produces, adaptation to climate change); importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in purchasing policies and relations with suppliers and subcontractors, business ethics (actions undertaken to prevent bribery and corruption).

Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information. We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive veriﬁcation work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a signiﬁcant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated. Conclusion For the “Packaging materials consumption” indicator, discrepancies of various types were identiﬁed during the work on audit and consolidation samples, and not all of them have been corrected. These discrepancies can lead to a risk for the consolidated indicator. Based on our work, except for the incidence of the discrepancies identiﬁed for the indicator “Packaging materials consumption” as mentioned above, we have not identiﬁed any other signiﬁcant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria.
