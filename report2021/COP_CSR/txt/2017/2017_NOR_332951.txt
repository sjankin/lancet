Operating revenues amounted to MNOK 15,845, a reduction of 7 per cent compared with 2015. The reduction comes primarily from the oil and offshore-related business areas of the Group. In total the Group had a good level of new order intake in 2016, although somewhat lower than in 2015. We have experienced a negative development in oil and gas, but at the same time, our defence businesses have developed in a positive direction, and the non-offshore-related parts of our maritime business have developed satisfactorily. During the year several strategic decisions have been taken that are expected contribute to KONGSBERG’s growth in the years to come: KM has made significant adjustments to its capacity and organisational model, KPS signed a breakthrough contract for MCT-30 and is well under way with the delivery, KDS has made a strategic entry into Finnish Patria and Kongsberg Digital is established. Despite the obvious challenges in some markets, KONGSBERG is well positioned and we see significant opportunities ahead. The Group continues to invest major resources in new and existing products. As in previous years, over MNOK 1,000 was spent on internally financed product development and maintenance. Geir Håøy was appointed as President and CEO in June 2016. EBITDA for the Group in 2016 amounted to MNOK 1,217, of the order backlog in KM along with other impairments. compared to MNOK 1,784 in 2015.

Restructuring between the business areas from 2016 In the years 2013–2016, Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies (KOGT) has reported as a separate operating segment. As of 2016, KONGSBERG has carried out a restructuring of the areas that previously were part of KOGT. KOGT’s area for oil and gas related engineering services is placed under the corresponding area in Kongsberg Maritime. KOGT’s largest unit historically, Software & Services, is incorporated as an important part of the newly established Kongsberg Digital. As a result of this, KOGT ceased to be a separate business area from 2016 and will therefore no longer be an operating segment that is required to report. The remaining activity in KOGT is being phased out and has been transferred to “Other”. In the restructuring process the simulation business in Kongsberg Maritime has been transferred to Kongsberg Digital. The comparison figures have been retrospectively changed both for the operating segment Kongsberg Maritime and for Others. 46 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Directors’ Report • Financial Statements and Notes • Statement from the Board • Auditor’s Report Operating segment data Kongsberg Kongsberg Kongsberg Defence Protech EliminaConsoliMNOK Maritime Systems Systems Other tions dated 2016 Revenue from external customers 8 588 4 214 2 083 960 15 845 Revenue from group companies 9 122 13 478 (622) Total revenues 8 597 4 336 2 096 1 438 (622) 15 845 Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 280 801 126 10 1 217 Depreciation (178) (137) (37) (13) (360) Impairment of property, plant and equipment (7) (15) (22) Operating profit before amortisation (EBITA) 95 669 89 (18) 835 Amortisation (43) (32) (30) (38) (143) Operating profit (EBIT) 52 637 59 (56) 692 Segment assets1) 7 477 5 570 1 339 714 (202) 14 898 Segment investments2) 364 372 149 24 909 Current segment liabilities and provisions3) 2 711 3 125 711 540 (201) 6 886 2015 Revenue from external customers 10 141 4 051 1 735 1105 17 032 Revenue from group companies 56 98 42 450 (646) Total revenues 10 197 4 149 1 777 1 555 (646) 17 032 Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 1 109 695 227 (247) 1 784 Depreciation (191) (105) (50) (16) (362) Impairment of property, plant and equipment (9) (8) (17) Operating profit before amortisation (EBITA) 909 590 177 (271) 1 405 Amortisation (48) (30) (33) (50) (161) Impairment of intangible assets (300) (300) Operating profit (EBIT) 861 560 144 (621) 944 Segment assets1) 8 762 4 491 1 469 829 (222) 15 329 Segment investments2) 292 179 25 14 510 Current segment liabilities and provisions3) 3 539 3 181 442 484 (218) 7 428 There are no differences between the measurement methods used at the segment level and those applied to the consolidated financial statements.

The mortality and disability risks are based on public tables and observations of disabilities at KONGSBERG. The probability that an employee in a given age group will become disabled or die within one year, and the life expectancy is as follows: Disability% Mortality% Estimate life Age Men Women Men Women Men Women 20 0.1 0.2 <0.1 <0.1 89 94 40 0.3 0.4 0.1 <0.1 88 92 60 1.4 1.8 0.4 0.3 87 90 80 4.4 3.0 90 92 The disability rate in IR 73 was chosen because it offers the best approach to KONGSBERG’s disability statistics. This is based on KONGSBERG’s history in which approx. 25 per cent of the disability pension is reimbursed through an international pool. 52 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Directors’ Report • Financial Statements and Notes • Statement from the Board • Auditor’s Report The year’s pension costs were calculated as follows: MNOK 2016 2015 Present value of the year's earned pensions 50 117 Interest cost on accrued pension liabilities 49 56 Estimated return on pension plan assets (38) (40) Administration costs 14 16 Accrued social security expenses 11 21 Total 86 170 Settlement pension scheme incl. social security costs.

Forward exchange contracts as fair value hedges must protect all contractual currency flows. This means that the forward exchange contracts will hedge capitalised receivables in foreign currency, as well as invoicing remaining on the contracts. KONGSBERG is also exposed to other currencies, but these are insignificant compared with the exposure to USD and EUR.

Loan hedges are currency hedges connected to loans in foreign currency. 4) The total value increase on hedged projects was MNOK 810 during 2016 (reduction of MNOK 107 in 2015). Derivatives used as project hedging have had the corresponding negative value through the year and the hedging has thus been 100 per cent efficient. Change of value is recognised in accounts receivable and construction contracts in progress (assets and liabilities).

The effect on results that occurs will be recognised and realised in line with the progress of the projects. The carrying amount associated with the rolled cash flow hedges amounts to MNOK 550 on 31 Dec 16 (MNOK 585 on 31 Dec 15). 2) The net effect from the cash flow hedges before tax that are recognised in comprehensive income amounts to MNOK 1,063 in 2016 (MNOK -425 in 2015). In the comprehensive income, there is a change of MNOK 1,029, and the deviation of MNOK 34 is due to a change in the fair value of interest rate swaps of MNOK 5 and basis swaps of MNOK 29. If an expected project becomes contractual and a fair value hedge is established, the recognised hedge reserve is transferred from comprehensive income to the carrying value of the hedged project. If an expected cash flow occurs and does not result in a project hedge, the hedge reserve is recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transactions. In 2016, a total of MNOK -83 was recognised that was related to inefficient cash flow hedges in the ordinary results.

Level 2: Fair value is measured based on data other than the list prices covered by the level 1, but which is based on observable market data either directly or indirectly. These methods have some uncertainty in the determination of fair value. Level 3: Fair value is measured using models that substantially employ non-observable market data.

The financial statements of the parent company comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2016, the income statement and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2016, the income statement, statements of other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, ► the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the law and regulations; ► the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 2016, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway; ► the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2016 and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Norway, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities as required by law and regulations. We have also complied with our other ethical obligations in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for 2016. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements. A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 96 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Directors’ Report • Financial Statements and Notes • Statement from the Board • Auditor’s Report Auditor’s Report, page 2 Recognition of construction contracts A large part of the Group’s revenues and expenses are derived from construction contracts recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method. Under this method, the construction contracts’ profitability and degree of completion is determined based on estimates. There is uncertainty related to the expected total revenues and expense used as a basis for these estimates. The recognition of construction contracts is a key audit matter, due the extent and complexity of ongoing projects in the Group with duration over several years, and where management exercises judgement to estimate the percentage of completion. We evaluated the application of accounting principles, methodology for calculating the projects’ percentage of completion, routines for monitoring projects and tested controls over project assessments and recognition. We discussed estimated total project expenses or hours with project management, evaluated these estimates against comparable projects, and analysed the development in margins for selected projects and the total project portfolio. For selected contracts, we tested estimated revenues against agreements, incurred expenses against invoices and hours against timesheets, and assessed the total estimated project expenses. In addition, we have analysed actual margins on selected projects against estimated total margins at completion during the project period in order to evaluate management’s accuracy in judgments and estimates. We refer to note 2 for details on estimation uncertainty and note 8 on construction contracts in the consolidated financial statements. Currency hedging of future cash flows in foreign currency A large part of Kongsberg Gruppen’s revenues is in foreign currencies. The Group hedges highly probable and contractual future cash flows by entering into forward contracts. Currency hedging and hedge accounting has been a key audit matter due to the complex accounting rules for hedge accounting, detailed documentation requirements and the amounts involved. We assessed the application of accounting principles and the Group’s routines for hedge accounting, and we tested the Group’s controls over hedge accounting and hedging derivatives. We considered the Company’s process to follow-up forward contracts against expected cash flows. We tested the existence and completeness of unrealised currency forward contracts and the Company’s documentation of the hedge effectiveness. We recomputed the value of the forward contracts based on the foreign currency rates as of 31 December and assessed the presentation and classification of currency hedges in the financial statements, including note disclosures. We refer to note 3 for details on accounting principles and note 21 on financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements. Other information Other information consists of the information included in the Company’s annual report and sustainability report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (management) is responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with law, regulations and generally accepted auditing principles in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ► identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ► obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control ► evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ► conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ► evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ► obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other Independent auditor’s report – Kongsberg Gruppen ASA A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited 98 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Directors’ Report • Financial Statements and Notes • Statement from the Board • Auditor’s Report Auditor’s Report, page 4 matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

KONGSBERG is an international technology group that delivers advanced and reliable solutions that improve safety, security and performance in complex operations and under extreme conditions.

The State’s stake is managed by the Ministry of Trade and Fisheries. The process we have used to define the content of the report ensures that we are reporting in accordance with the expectations put to us through the White Paper. Global Compact The Group joined the UN Global Compact in 2006. Membership requires that we submit a report to the UN each year, describing our activities and the advances we have made in the field of sustainability. The Group’s Sustainability Report serves as such a report – a COP (Communication on Progress). We would maintain that the report complies with Global Compact’s criteria for ‘Advanced Level’. For more details about the Global Compact, see their website at www.unglobalcompact.org Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) We use the GRI’s guidelines for voluntary reporting on sustainable development. The guidelines cover financial, environmental and social dimensions related to operations, and are the leading global initiative in this field. In 2015 we conducted a materiality analysis to identify the most important sustainability topics for KONGSBERG and our most important stakeholders. This is described in more detail over the next two pages. In our opinion, our reporting practice is generally compliant with GRI’s reporting principles. GRI G4 uses a classification that indicates the extent to which a company applies GRI’s definitions and disclosure requirements, Core or Comprehensive, respectively. KONGSBERG has chosen to comply with the requirements for the Core level. The report’s final pages contain a reference to the individual GRI indicators and where they are discussed in the report. For more details about GRI, see their website at www.globalreporting.org The Norwegian Accounting Act The Norwegian Accounting Act requires large enterprises to report on their corporate social responsibility either in the Directors’ Report or in a separate report. The report is to cover consideration for human rights, labour rights and social conditions, the outdoor environment and the programme to combat corruption. Special regulations stipulate that reporting pursuant to the UN’s Global Compact or Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) can supersede the requirements for reporting in the Directors’ Report. It is our assessment that the Sustainability Report for 2016 is fully adequate and compliant with the requirements of the Norwegian Accounting Act. 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Introduction • Sustainable innovation • What have we achieved? • Climate and environment • Goals and Reporting • GRI • Auditor’s Report Board Management 04 SUSTAINABILITY The Group’s Sustainability Report has in its entirety been reviewed and approved by the Group’s corporate management and the Board of Directors.

The UN’s sustainable development goals are a joint work plan Our main contribution to the “The Global Goals” is to use our for extreme poverty, to fight inequality and to protect our expertise to develop products and systems that provide our planet. “The Global Goals” have become a guideline for customers with better opportunities to implement their goals sustainability efforts across the entire globe. “The Global in the process towards a more sustainable society. Here are Goals” have likewise become a guide for KONGSBERG’s some examples of what we call sustainable innovation. work with technology for global challenges. “Technology development is essential to create a more sustainable society. With the global environmental and climate challenges facing the world, technology companies such as KONGSBERG hold a key role.” Geir Håøy, president and CEO 132 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Introduction • Sustainable innovation • What have we achieved? • Climate and environment • Goals and Reporting • GRI • Auditor’s Report OFFSHORE FISH FARMING The world’s first digital fish farm Today, two per cent of the food we eat comes from the sea. If we are to feed the world’s growing population, we must increase the production of farmed fish and make the industry more efficient. KONGSBERG is cooperating with the company Ocean Farming on the development of the world’s first digital fish farm. Here, the living conditions for salmon are monitored by a large number of our sensors. These send signals into a single database, where “Big data” from the plant is analysed, processed and visualised in real time. The visualisation will help in the effort to feed the salmon optimally and avoid stress and diseases. The goal of the industry is to use under one kilogram of feed per kilogram of salmon. WIND OFF-/ONSHORE Increase the efficiency of wind power Reduced costs mean that the industry predicts more growth in offshore wind. Last year, Europe took the decision to develop offshore wind for NOK 163 billion, which is a new record. Kongsberg EmPower is a turbine independent decision support system based on our broad experience within automation and decision support systems. The system allows the user to have complete control over the production, operation and maintenance planning at each wind farm. KONGSBERG delivers EmPower to Statoil’s floating wind turbine Hywind Demo and to Statkraft and Arctic Wind who use the system on land. Kongsberg EmPower helps our clients to achieve higher operational performance and reduce maintenance costs. 133 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Introduction • Sustainable innovation • What have we achieved? • Climate and environment • Goals and Reporting • GRI • Auditor’s Report OCEAN SPACE Enabling technology for the ocean space 70 per cent of the soil surface is covered by water, 80 per cent of the ocean is deeper than 3,000 meters, 90 per cent is not yet explored and 90 per cent of the world’s biomass is in the sea. The ocean space has huge potential to solve the greatest challenges we face today. Energy, food, climate and transportation are key areas where the ocean space can be exploited in a sustainable way with the use of technology. KONGSBERG delivers technology that enables mapping and utilisation of resources beneath the seabed and in the water column. On the ocean surface, KONGSBERG delivers technology to ships that use the sea for transport routes, to wind farms that create green energy and to sustainable fisheries. Our aerospace technology monitors the ocean environment and utilise assets related to information technology. On the defence side, KONGSBERG supplies systems that safeguard resources in the oceans. STRATEGIC INFRASTRUCTURE Maintain the route network in Norway KONGSBERG, in collaboration with Indra Navia and Avinor, has developed technology for remote-controlled control towers. The technology makes it possible to operate control tower services at a number of airports from a single control centre. As of 2018, the system will be used by a number of small Norwegian local and regional airports to operate the tower service. Avinor expects to reduce costs for tower services at the airports by approximately 30-40 per cent. Lower costs at the airports in turn means lower fees for the airlines, and will help to maintain the large route network Avinor has in Norway today. Remote-controlled towers also leads to a strengthened emergency health service for these districts as small airports will be able to open for air ambulances outside normal working hours. 134 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2016 01 02 03 04 INTRODUCTION DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SUSTAINABILITY • Introduction • Sustainable innovation • What have we achieved? • Climate and environment • Goals and Reporting • GRI • Auditor’s Report SECURITY AND SOVEREIGNTY Border control and maritime surveillance Copernicus is Europe’s major satellite-based AISSat consists of satellites that monitor shipping tions off the African coast and supervision of programme for environmental monitoring and civil traffic in Norwegian and international waters. shipping activity in waters where Norway has protection.

It expands the mindset and positively influences the company’s strategy and execution. Therefore, we work systematically and focused to recruit, develop and retain people of different ages, ethnicity and gender. The focus on diversity must be integrated into all HR processes, such as profiling, recruitment and leadership development, along with reporting and follow-up. In 2015 and 2016, we have had special focus on gender equality. This will continue in 2017. RECRUITWe must continuously strive to be an attracthe Group.

In 2015, for the first time, we reported CO2 emissions linked to the transportation of goods and merchandise paid in Norway. CO2 emissions in 2015 were just below 40,000 metric tonnes with a solid reduction in 2016 to 33,500 metric tonnes. The decrease of close to 15 per cent is primarily due to lower emissions from air travel and transport. The Group reports to the international “Carbon Disclosure Project” framework on issues relating to climate changes and the level of greenhouse gas emissions. Our goal of increasing our quality and score in this reporting resulted in an improved score, going from an E for 2015 to a B for 2016. 78.8% (+5.6% from 2015) ENERGY 2.8% (-21.1% from 2015) CONSUMPTION 18.4% (-3.3% from 2015) Flyreiser Indirekte Direkte 127 OIL AND HEAT RECOVERY, ELECTRICITY GWh TOTAL GAS DISTRICT HEATING AND 120000 120000 120000 96.73 GWh ENERGY REMOTE COOLING CONSUMPTION 122.79 GWh 96000 72000 96000 72000 96000 72000 IN 2016 48000 48000 22.59 GWh 48000 24000 3.47 GWh 24000 24000 0 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2014 2015 2016 2014 2015 2016 KONGSBERG uses energy in the form of electricity, Efficient technology allows 20–25 GWh to be recovered district heating, remote cooling, gas and fuel oil in its annually by the heat recovery unit at the plant in Kongsberg activities.

The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included the subject matters on which we provide our conclusion below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have conducted interviews of managers responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate as well as comparing reported data with source documentation for the reporting units KPS Johnstown (USA), KM Bekkajordet (Norway) and KM Seatex (Norway). We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to draw a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Kongsberg Gruppen has applied procedures to collect, compile and validate sustainability information for 2016 from its reporting units to be included in the Report, as summarised on pages 115 – 116. Information presented for 2016 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  Data reported for 2016 from the reporting units specified above, has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us.  Information about attainment of targets, as presented on pages 153 – 154, appropriately reflects performance related to the objectives for 2016.  The Report fulfils the content requirements for reporting in regards to sustainability as stated in the (Norwegian) Accounting Act, § 3-3c, article one.  Kongsberg Gruppen applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G4) reporting principles and the reporting fulfils the in accordance level Core according to the GRI guidelines.
