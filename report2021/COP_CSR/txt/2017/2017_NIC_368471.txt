H.E. Ban Ki-moon Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Managua, Nicaragua, 31st August 2017 Re. Letter of Commitment to Global Compact Dear Mr. Secretary-General, It is with great pleasure that I herewith confirm that Ingemann Food Nicaragua continues to supports the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. With this Letter of Commitment we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence in the honey chain in Nicaragua. Ingemann Food Nicaragua is committed to continue making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in projects in collaboration with honey and cocoa chain stakeholders which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Ingemann Food Nicaragua recognizes that a key requirement in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts and outcomes of implementing the ten principles. We support public accountability, transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of joining the Global Compact, and annually thereafter according to the Global Compact COP policy. Yours sincerely, Lars Saquero Møller Managing Director Ingemann Food Nicaragua S.A. lsm@ingemann.com.ni
