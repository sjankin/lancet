Such efforts include reorganizing our organization, products, and services not from a company-oriented but from a customer-oriented perspective. As part of this work, we are actively implementing customer compensation and support policy. We hereby once again promise to take full responsibility to satisfy our customers and society. Reasons for Recall A government investigation found that in three models (CHPI-380N/CPI-380N, CHPCI-430N, CPSI-370N) of Coway’s ice water purifiers, nickel particles coming off of a nickel-coated evaporator dropped into the cold water tank under it. This was caused by damage to the nickel coating in the course of assembling the cooling structure in which the evaporator is placed. The investigation tentatively concluded that Coway’s ice water purifiers—other than the three affected models—did not have the same problem since they have different structures. To investigate the harmfulness of nickel, an examination of longand short-term exposure to nickel was carried out in consideration of the actual time of product use, which found that the amount of nickel found in the products in question was lower than the limit set by international standards, causing low risk concerns. Nevertheless, it was recommended that customers with affected products that had not been collected stopped using them. This was because continued use of these products without taking any measures may cause dermatitis for those sensitive to nickel.

Facilities for solar power, which is a new renewable energy, were installed and operated in the Yugu Factory (49.5KWh), Incheon Factory (39KWh), and Pocheon Factory (45KWh), through which 174,709KW of electrical power was generated and self-consumed in 2016. This is equivalent to a reduction of 81 tons of GHG. Furthermore, the adoption of the energy storage system (ESS) in the Yugu Factory was completed, reducing approximately KRW 70 million in energy costs. Through ESS, KRW 140 million in energy costs is expected to be reduced in 2017. LED lighting was also installed in the Yugu Factory and warehouses, improving the working environment (illumination intensity) of work areas, reducing over KRW 100 million in energy costs and creating an effect of roughly 300 tons of GHG reduction. Greenhouse Gas and Energy Management Greenhouse Gas Emissions Although Coway is not subject to greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy target management in Korea, we Type Unit 2014 2015 2016 have established mid and long-term GHG reduction goals and implemented relevant activities in an effort to actively take part in responding to the challenges of climate change.

Our goal is to reduce GHG intensity, compared to (Scope 1) 2010, by 50% by 2020. In 2016, Coway’s net GHG emissions decreased by 1.70% compared to 2015 Indirect Emissions (provided that it increased by approximately 0.82% prior to the physical division of Coway EnTech), and tCO2e 5,385 5,369 5,261 (Scope 2) GHG emissions intensity decreased by 3.62%.

Through our continuous support of carbon partnership suppliers, their energy competitiveness is enhanced by suppressing energy consumption against sales increase as much as possible. Through these efforts, Coway seeks to prevent supplier risks caused by climate change. Major Accomplishments Coway aims to offset greenhouse gas emissions by introducing new models of photovoltaic power generation at its Pocheon factory in 2013 and by introducing renewable energy by 2020. By installation ESS in 2016, we reduced energy costs as well as improved the working conditions. COPYRIGHT COWAY CO., LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

I(Ice)_&rsquo액티브쿨링 시스템&rsquo으로 끊임없이 자라나는 새로운 아이스 제공 코웨이 아이스 AIS는 증발기 없이 얼음을 만드는 &lsquo 액티브쿨링 시스템&rsquo 을 탑재했다. 액티브쿨링 시스템은 증발기에서 고드름이 생기듯 천천히 얼음이 맺혀 떨어지는 기존 제빙 방식과 달리 정수가 차가운 관을 지나면서 얼음이 되고, 아래에서 위로 자라 나오는 신개념 제빙 방식이다. 이 방식은 기존 방식 대비 제빙이 빠르고 풍부하며 깨물어 먹기 편한 원통 모양의 아이스틱(아이스+스틱 합성어)을 만들어낸다. 특히 제빙 과정 상 물과 얼음이 닿는 부분을 스테인리스 재질로 만들어 위생성을 높였다. 또한 아이스 AIS는 내부 탱크를 투명 재질로 만들어 물과 얼음의 깨끗함을 눈으로 직접 확인할 수 있도록 했다. A(Aqua pure)_&rsquoCIROO 필터 시스템&rsquo 탑재로 더 깨끗한 물 제공 아이스 AIS는 코웨이의 특별한 필터 기술이 집약된 &lsquoCIROO(Coway Intensive Reverse Osmosis) 필터 시스템&rsquo을 탑재했다. CIROO 필터 시스템은 핵심 필터인 CIROO 필터와 C9 카본블 록 필터로 구성됐다. CIROO 필터는 머리카락 수만 분의 1 이온물질까지 제거하는 얇고 조밀한 인텐시브 멤브레인 소재를 기존 RO 멤브레인 필터 대비 최대 24 더 촘촘하게 감아 고성능의 정수 성능을 유지하면서도 풍부하게 물을 추출할 수 있다. C9 카본블록 필터는 코웨이 자체 기술로 제작한 3단계 레이어 구조를 적용해 정수 성능을 강화했다. 아이스 AIS는 제품 스스로 순환살균 및 순환배수를 진행한다. 이 정수기는 전기분해 살균수로 물탱크, 유로, 파우셋 등 정수기 속 물이 닿는 부분을 스스로 살균해 더욱 안심하고 사용할 수 있다. 또한 24 시간 동안 물 사 용량이 적으면 정수기에 담겨 있던 물을 배출하고, 신선한 물을 채워주는 순환배수 기능을 적용했다. S(Sparkling)_&rsquo직수 탄산 시스템&rsquo으로 더욱 간편하게 탄산수 추출 가능 아이스 AIS는 전용 용기에 물을 먼저 받고, 탄산을 주입하는 기존 방식과 달리 탄산수를 바로 추출할 수 있는 &lsquo직수 탄산 시스템&rsquo을 적용했으며 탄산 강도를 3단계로 조절할 수 있어 가정에 서 편리하게 탄산수를 즐길 수 있다. 또한 정량 추출 기능을 적용해 반 컵(120ml), 한 컵(250ml), 두 컵(500ml) 중 사용자가 원하는 용량의 탄산수를 이용할 수 있다. 이 외에도 아이스 AIS는 3단 맞춤 온수(45˚Cㆍ70˚Cㆍ85˚C) 시스템을 적용해 상황과 용도에 따라 편리하게 사용할 수 있으며 순간온수 시스템과 순환냉각 냉수 시스템 적용으로 사용 전기량을 최소화 해 에너지소비효율 1등급을 획득했다. 이해선 코웨이 대표이사는 &ldquo아이스 AIS는 &lsquo더 깨끗한 콜드워터(Aqua pure)&rsquo, &lsquo더 빠르고 풍부한 아이스(Ice)&rsquo, &lsquo더 짜릿해진 스파클링(Sparkling)&rsquo을 하나의 제품으로 모두 경험할 수 있는 혁신적인 제품이다&rdquo며 &ldquo이 제품의 출시로 정수기 시장에서 얼음, 탄산, 물의 개념이 완전히 바뀌게 될 것이다&rdquo고 말했다.
