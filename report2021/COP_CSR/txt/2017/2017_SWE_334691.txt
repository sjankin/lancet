Human Rights principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses AQ Group AB 5. a) Assessment, Policy & Goals AQ Group’s goal is for all our employees and business partners to live up to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The goal is to have 0 reported human rights cases. Our Core Values and code of conduct outlines the way each of us should behave and also clarifies our responsibility to report instances of human rights violations. The code of conduct is known to all employees within the company. Also our immediate supply chain should adhere to the same principles. The principles are clearly stated in the AQ Supplier Code of Conduct. AQ Group AB 5. b) Implementation All employees and external stakeholders can report violations directly by sending a message to whistleblower@aqg.se should there be any grievances with regards to human rights. However, in most cases contacting the local management team and or group management should be enough. This year the AQ Group continually implemented its core values, which was established in early 2012, across all AQ companies. One of the cornerstones of the core values is “Courage and Respect” including the principles, “Every employee has the same status” and “We treat others as we like to be treated ourselves”. A copy of the AQ “Core Values” booklet has been handed to each employee in local language and workshops have taken place to further strengthen their understanding across the company. This together with the AQ Code of Conduct and the global policies on human rights gives guidance how to act within the AQ Group in any given situation. Suppliers are audited using the standard AQ Group template which contains a section on human rights and they are required to adhere to the AQ Group supplier code of conduct. Suppliers who have questionable ethics are not approved as an AQ supplier. AQ Group AB 5. c) Measurement of Outcomes In AQ Group there have been no reported incidents of human rights abuses. If any issues should occur in the future they will be recorded and brought to the attention of group management and the related authorities. AQ Group is fully committed to handle any such occurrences objectively and to provide fair solutions. In the last three years we have had 0 human rights violation reports. AQ Group AB 6.

Any issues can be discussed in this forum. This is the principle channel of collective bargaining in AQ Group. With regards to the safety of our employees we evaluate and audit working conditions and make sure that, where necessary, the correct protective clothing and equipment is used by our employees. During workshop audits the work environment is constantly reviewed for any new or potential safety risks and appropriate actions are taken if any such cases arise. We fully commit to providing a safe working environment. New employees receive relevant orientation training and existing employees receive continuous training at various intervals based on the need to be able to perform their respective tasks. AQ Group AB 6. c) Measurements of Outcomes Of the AQ Group Board of directors there are three men and 2 female. In the AQ Group management team three are female and four are men. Company‐wide, female employees represent 45% of the headcount. AQ have since 2015 implemented a company self assessment that is done by the management of every subsidiary within the group. This gives the group management a good understanding of the labor rights status in the group as a whole. The results from this survey in 2016 show high scores on average. A gap analysis is also made in order to strengthen the subsidiaries where the score is low. The score in 2016 was on average 2,86 where 3 is highest. No subsidiary within the group have scored lower than 2. Our target is to have an average score higher than 2.5 and that no subsidiary should have score lower than 2.

AQ Group AB 8. Anti-Corruption Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery AQ Group AB 8. a) Assessment, Policy & Goals AQ Group puts great emphasis on building trust and long lasting relations with our employees, customers and suppliers. It lies in our business ethics to always follow laws and regulations as a minimum requirement in all countries we operate. We do not, under any circumstances, accept bribery, extortion or any other kind of corrupt activities. It is stated in our code of conduct that we shall always conduct good business ethics and that we do not offer rewards or benefits, which are in conflict with laws or regulations, to customers, suppliers or authority representatives. Every employee that are involved in business transactions receive training on our code of conduct and our supplier code of conduct which clearly indicates our stance on corruption: “If an employee is offered a gift, a bribe, an illegitimate commission, or any other form personal payment, it must not be accepted.” Also, a preliminary evaluation of the risk of corruption was made. The biggest risks come in the form of supplier/customer gifts and bribes. AQ Group AB 8. b) Implementation It is all managers’ responsibility to inform employees about our anti-corruption policy and code of conduct. All managers shall furthermore encourage employees to report on indications of any type of violation in regards to these policies. Such reports can be done anonymously to the whistleblower@aqg.se in accordance with our Whistleblower Policy. This year we have received two reported cases. The AQ group management team have analyzed them and found that they where without ground. In order to prevent the identified risks we commit to several actions:  Implementation of a rigorous procurement process including cross‐functional approval of suppliers.  Periodic market research of prices of key materials to be compared against existing purchasing prices.  Review of expense claims.  Addition of the Global Compact logo and description into our company presentation to disseminate this knowledge to our new and existing supply chain partners and customers AQ Group AB 8. c) Results Regarding the aforementioned examples of corruption: We make it clear to our employees and supply chain partners that we will not accept behavior of this kind. If it ever were to happen in AQ Group the relevant disciplinary and/or legal action would be taken against the guilty parties. There have been no indication of violation of our anti-corruption principles in 2016. Audits from senior management take place at various intervals to check that standard procedures are being followed. And to cement these principles the management of each subsidiary need to commit to our principles in our yearly self assessment. In 2016 the whistleblower@aqg.se email and policy have also been implemented in order to make it safe to report violations for internal and external stakeholders. AQ Group AB 9.
