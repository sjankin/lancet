(1) The circular economy promotes greater resource productivity aiming to reduce waste and avoid pollution by design or intention. This is contrast to a linear economy which is a 'take, make, dispose' model of production. (2) Biodiversity, a contraction of biological diversity, refers to the variety and variability of life on Earth. This is the number and variety of plants, animals and other organisms that exist. (3) Employee well-being is more than just people’s medical health. Employee well-being is defined as creating an environment to promote a state of contentment which allows an employee to flourish and achieve their full potential for the benefit of themselves and the company. (4) Diversity means respect for and appreciation of differences in such age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, education or national origin. Inclusion is a sense of belonging: feeling respected, valued for who you are as an individual or group. (5) The Supply chain includes every business that comes in contact with a particular product it means Lyreco direct suppliers, but also the suppliers of our suppliers, etc. (6) Information disclosure and transparency aim to increase clarity and accuracy into the communications with stakeholders. For example, voluntarily share information related to the company's ecological or financial impact. 7 Sustainable Development Report 2017 INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND Sustainability Management A team of 28 people all over the world An integrated A unique certification body Management System based for continuous improvement OHSAS FSC on international standards To ensure a consistent approach, Lyreco has 18001 CoC To ensure a common operating practice for all chosen SGS as the unique certification body for subsidiaries, Lyreco uses the recognised interall the subsidiaries worldwide. national standards ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 to SGS audits all Lyreco subsidiaries annually and which the Integrated Management Systems are certified.
