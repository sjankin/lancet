Many of the efforts involve wellness initiatives to promote healthy lifestyles at work. Vitality Health Insurance analysed 4 318 employees in 2014 and 2015 and found that among employees who moved from ‘obese’ to ‘overweight’, presenteeism dropped by 25 percent. Vitality Health Insurance advocates that employers identify what they are doing to cause or exacerbate these problems. One solution from Robertson Cooper, who performs stress audits for companies believes that presenteeism will not be rectified until managers are recruited differently. Instead of recruiting people only on the basis of their targeting-hitting and technical expertise, Robertson Cooper advocates recruiting people who also have the skills to manage human beings. 32 33 02 PART Leading the way in including health metrics in +HDOWKLHUZRUNIRUFHV corporate reporting are more productive In our 2016 report, we shared our vision that by 2020, workforce health metrics will be an integral indicator of overall organisational performance within the broader corporate accountability framework. Driven by OUR APPROACH our belief that shared value can deliver meaningful positive benefits for broader society, Discovery is ideally positioned to offer leadership in developing and refining these health metrics. The intention is for these workforces metrics to become a voluntary but widely used reporting initiative through which employers systematically capture data and information about the health and wellbeing of their workforce. There is clear economic value to be derived from healthy workforces too. In the United States of America, a 2013 paper known as the Fabius study saw researchers tracking a group of companies and their performance on the Standard & Poor's 500, a stock market index based on the market capitalisations of 500 large companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
