Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 5 Opening Feature Succeeding by rapidly of revenue-generating Since its establishment, Sojitz has overcome changes in the external environment one by one, notably the restructuring of its finances after its management integration, the financial crisis of 2008, and the European debt crisis. As a result, Sojitz has evolved as a company that perseveres and prevails. Now that it has established a strong earnings foundation and financial standing, Sojitz is entering a new phase – a real growth phase in which it can steadily generate profit of ¥50 billion or more. In this phase, Sojitz is placing priority on building up numerous clusters of revenue-generating businesses that each earn profit of ¥5 billion to ¥10 billion. In individual regions and businesses, the Sojitz Group is demonstrating its strengths, and already has established a number of clusters of revenue-generating businesses. The Group is now focusing on creating new businesses while continuing to expand its existing businesses. Sojitz’s Position ROA3 (%) 1.

In addition to a faster organizational structure and decision-making process, it is imperative that we increase our speed on the front lines of business, including speed in responding to customers and business partners. We are rapidly building up clusters of revenue-generating businesses. To move these efforts forward, Sojitz must prevail against the competition while keeping in mind the need to deliver value to customers and to society. By rapidly executing strategies such as investments and loans and putting the right people in the right jobs, Sojitz will outpace the competition. We believe this will create a stronger Sojitz that will run up to a real growth phase.

Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 7 Fertilizer Business Accelerating Expansion by Building Strong Local Networks Overview of Fertilizer Business Managing manufacturing and sales of compound chemical fertilizer in the ASEAN region Established top market share in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines Manufacturing and sales capacity across Sojitz Group totals 1.8 million tons, making it one of the largest fertilizer businesses in ASEAN. Perspective from the Front Line I have been involved in the fertilizer business in Southeast Asia, including business management at Thai Central Chemical Public Limited (TCCC) and the acquisition and management of Atlas Fertilizer Corporation in the Philippines. Currently, my mission is to expand the chemical fertilizer business in Myanmar as Managing Director of TCCC Myanmar Limited, an importer and wholesaler of compound chemical fertilizers. Although cultural and geographic differences exist between Myanmar and other ASEAN countries, building strong networks and establishing our brand – that is, winning the support of farmers – remain the two essential elements in business development common to all of these countries. Therefore, we directly inform farmers about the benefits of using compound chemical fertilizers in addition to strengthening sales networks by building relationships with local wholesalers and dealers. As the local farmers Ko Tojima have yet not acquired a sufficient understanding of agricultural techniques, we Managing Director, TCCC Myanmar Limited are actively creating opportunities to explain the advantages of compound chemical fertilizers, including the scientific rationale. 8 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 Opening Feature: Succeeding by rapidly building up clusters of revenue-generating businesses Entry into the Myanmar Market In the fertilizer business, we are expanding existing businesses in neighboring regions by leveraging the dominant brand power we have built in the ASEAN region. One new region we are targeting for expansion in Southeast Asia is Myanmar. With farmland comprising roughly 20 percent of the country’s land area, and about 70 percent of the population engaging in agriculture, Myanmar is one of the major agricultural countries in Southeast Asia. However, the country is facing issues in agricultural development, and popularizing the use of high-quality fertilizers poses a significant challenge as well. Myanmar’s market growth rate is the highest in Southeast Asia, with demand increasing by double-digit percentages every year. Myanmar attracts numerous competitors, but Sojitz is at an advantage, having established a branch office in Yangon more than 100 years ago. In the fertilizer business, while we thus far engaged in expanding imports and sales of compound chemical fertilizers from Thailand, in order to meet the expected growth in local demand, we plan to develop domestic compound chemical fertilizer manufacturing operations. Assigning Experienced Staff to Quickly Roadmap for Creating a Cluster of Establish Our Presence Revenue-Generating Businesses The key to developing and growing our fertilizer business in Myanmar is to build strong local networks. Local fertilizer dealers Expand existing businesses and develop businesses in new regions have close relationships with farmers in their sales territories, so Sojitz is assigning staff with extensive experience cultivating and maintaining sales channels to quickly establish sales networks in cooperation with dealers. To gain insight into user needs, our Quickly build locally-based networks personnel frequently visit sales locations to interview the fertilizer and relationships in new regions dealers. Furthermore, we engage in activities tied closely to the local region such as working directly with farmers, the end users of the product. We also consider the role of Myanmar staff crucial to expanding Establish our brand by acquiring the business. Accordingly, we are building a business model that solid support from users fits the local market through promotion and development of local staff, including management-level employees. In Myanmar, where there is still ample room for market Accelerate expansion by gaining development, we believe that speed will determine success. We insight into local needs and will strive to turn the fertilizer business into a revenue-generating assigning expert staff with extensive cluster by assigning highly experienced personnel to work overseas experiences alongside local staff, in order to quickly establish our position. There is a great deal of potential in Myanmar. While the country’s primary industry is agriculture, one can sense the energy behind growth in urban centers firsthand, in the construction of modern shopping centers and other developments under construction. To establish a dominant presence in the country, we must build a cluster of revenue-generating businesses extending beyond the fertilizer business. Sojitz already has an alliance with the City Mart Group (CMG), Myanmar’s leading retail group, and is working together with CMG to develop cold supply chain and food service businesses. If we can link these businesses with the fertilizer business – in other words, maximize the capabilities of our local staff to build a value chain encompassing everything from fertilizers to agriculture, distribution and retail – we can expect even further development. I truly hope that people will come to recognize our solid presence in Myanmar in the near future.

Since then, this company has performed steadily, generating profit in any Perspective from the Front Line I have been involved in the automotive industry for many years, with experience in the U.S., Europe and other markets. I am currently the representative of the three dealerships that are Sojitz subsidiaries, and am responsible for the growth and expansion of the U.S. dealership business. Having originally come from Portugal, I am sharing ideas and techniques cultivated in the United States with the dealership group in Brazil. The U.S. dealership business is a very attractive market. Many dealerships were privately owned, but the business landscape has been transformed through consolidation of dealerships over the last 20 years.

Having businesses such as these in our ranks M&A in promising markets will strongly bolster our presence in the United States. The current president of all three dealerships is a seasoned professional in the local industry. We are also applying the business model developed in this Invest in highly experienced market in other regions. In 2015, we acquired dealerships of management talent for BMW and MINI brand vehicles in Brazil, and we plan to continue successful integration expanding into new regions. Provide practical front-line experience to develop more management candidates brands: BMW and MINI. As for process, we share them across the organization, enabling us to achieve standardized processes. As for people, the assignment of managers after business integration is important. We need people who can understand the different corporate cultures and backgrounds of the companies we acquire, and then create a new strategic direction. Also, since the pool of management talent is limited, it is important to quickly develop new management candidates. I believe the shortest path to achieving that is to hire young people and give them responsibility early, so they can learn while gaining practical front-line experience. Luckily, Sojitz’s management has the same idea. After we establish such a model in the United States, we will work to apply it in other regions. Weatherford Motors, Inc.

Investors have asked many questions about Sojitz’s One of the strategies of the current management plan approach to new investments and loans. Their most for developing the capacity to generate profit for the frequent question is whether Sojitz can really achieve an year of at least ¥50 billion is to create clusters of investment and loan total of ¥150 billion during the year revenue-generating businesses that earn ¥5 billion to ending March 31, 2018, the final year of Medium-term ¥10 billion in profit for the year.

But met with these concerns, I only slated to have such clusters by March 31, 2018. As have this to say: Investors have nothing to worry about. each division increases its scale to give it presence and It is true that we took a disciplined approach to positioning, we are steadily building the clusters we investments and loans during the first two years of the envisioned at the start of the plan. current management plan.

Material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating unit groups were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ...................................................................... 7,460 7,460 66,607 Consumer Lifestyle Business Domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ........................................................... 8,090 8,090 72,232 The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its value in use founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management. The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performance. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated. The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates that were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively, were as follows. (a) Discount rate before tax 2016 2017 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business .......................................................................................... 6.7% 6.7% Consumer Lifestyle Business The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ........................................................................... 6.8% 6.8% (b) Ultimate growth rate In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term. With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.

The value of these mining rights were 12,527 million yen on March 31, 2016, and 11,122 million yen (U.S.$99,303 thousand) on March 31, 2017. The value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives included above were 4,957 million yen on March 31, 2016, and 4,936 million yen (U.S.$44,071 thousand) on March 31, 2017. Such assets consisted primarily of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements were mainly acquired through business combinations and were expected to exist as long as business continues. Therefore, management considers the useful lives of these assets to be indefinite. There were no internally-generated intangible assets as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017. Amortization expenses are included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments,” fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. 130 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 (2) Profit or loss relating to investment property Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Rental income from investment property ................................................................... 4,940 4,902 43,767 Expenses arising from investment property ...............................................................

(24,169) (11,777) (105,151) For the year ended March 31, 2016, impairment on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of 6,662 million yen was recognized for coal interests in Australia because the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by these interests were judged to be lower than originally assumed in the Group’s business plan. This amount represented the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of 13,470 million yen. This recoverable amount is based on the fair value less costs of disposal, which was estimated by discounting future cash flows at a pre-tax rate of 9.6%. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 139 In addition, impairment on intangible assets totaling 4,921 million yen was recognized for iron ore interests in Australia after we reappraised the business value of these assets based on the drop in the price of iron ore. This amount represented the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of 1,315 million yen. This recoverable amount is based on the fair value less costs of disposal, which was estimated using the value of deposit volumes of iron ore interests possessed by similar companies. Furthermore, impairment on property, plant and equipment totaling 2,855 million yen was recognized for certain gas fields in the United States because the future cash flow anticipated to be generated by these interests were judged to be lower than originally assumed in the Group’s business plan. This amount represented the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of 3,505 million yen. This recoverable amount is based on the value in use, which was estimated by discounting future cash flows at a pre-tax rate of 8.0%. During the year ended March 31, 2017, with respect to its investment in Brazil in which it has a 43.1% equity stake through a consolidated subsidiary and to which it applies the equity method, it is estimated that it could be impossible to secure the levels of income initially projected. Upon reviewing the recoverable amount, the Company recognized an impairment loss of 6,693 million yen (U.S.$59,758 thousand) based on fair value. The loss is included in “Loss on reorganization of subsidiaries/associates” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss. These are included in the Metals & Coal segment, Energy segment and Foods & Agriculture Business segment, and the fair value less costs of disposal is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3.

The said fund returned the substitutional portion of the welfare pension on October 1, 2015 and made the transition to the Tokyoto Electric Industry Corporate Pension Fund Organization. The contributions for this fund are calculated as a fixed percentage of the average salary or the like of participating employees. In addition, each fund ensures future solvency by revising the contribution a minimum of every five years in accordance with relevant regulations. If the funds are dissolved and liquidated, they will charge participants to cover deficits or distribute residual assets calculated by minimum funding standards based on regulations or the like. In addition, companies that elect to withdraw from the funds are subject to a charge to cover any liabilities and deficits projected to result from their withdrawal. This fund is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated.

For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company and some of such subsidiaries recognized tax losses and deferred tax assets for the unused tax losses carried forward only to the extent it was probable that they could be used against future taxable profit within rational estimate periods, since they could recognize taxable profit each period if there were no non-ordinary factors. The taxable profit was calculated based on estimation for increase and decrease of the temporary differences and was approved by the Company’s management. As of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, the consolidated taxation group recognized deferred tax assets of 11,380 million yen and 4,799 million yen (U.S.$42,848 thousand), respectively for the tax losses carried forward. 2) Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows.

Because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences, and it is probable that such temporary differences will not be reversed within the foreseeable future, the Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities with respect to such temporary differences.

Under these acts, the scheduled increase in the consumption tax rate to 10 percent was postponed to October 1, 2019 from April 1, 2017. Consequently, the repeal of the special local corporation tax and the related restoration of business tax, the revision of local tax rates, and the revision of corporate inhabitant tax rates were also postponed from business years beginning on or after April 1, 2017 to business years beginning on or after October 1, 2019. 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (1) Classes of financial instruments The breakdown of financial instruments per class was as follows.

Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature. (3) Credit risk management The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer. In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationallyacknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties. 1) Maximum exposure to credit risk Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 were 19,986 million yen and 21,320 million yen (U.S.$190,357 thousand), respectively. 2) Financial assets that are past the due date The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Within three months past due date ............................................................................. 12,843 8,478 75,696 Between three and six months past due date ............................................................. 1,762 658 5,875 Between six months and one year past due date ........................................................ 935 1,264 11,285 Over one year past due date ...................................................................................... 1,734 1,832 16,357 Total .................................................................................................................... 17,276 12,233 109,223 3) Financial assets of which impairment has occurred The Group establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts for each major customer by reviewing, among other matters, such customer’s financial condition and credit ratings, status of collection of receivables with respect to such customer, amendments to payment conditions, industry trends and state of affairs of the country/region in which such customer was situated. Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Trade and other receivables ........................................................................................ 58,880 55,042 491,446 Allowance for doubtful accounts .................................................................................

Instead, the Group accounts for such impairment loss under the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Balance at beginning of year .................................................................................... 45,257 50,043 446,812 Increase for the year (Note)........................................................................................ 9,553 2,897 25,866 Decrease for the year (incurred and charged against the allowance) ..........................

(1,340) (891) (7,955) Balance at end of year ............................................................................................. 50,043 47,407 423,276 (Note) “Increase for the year” includes the effects of changes in the consolidation scope. (4) Liquidity risk management The Group raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions or issuance of bonds. Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets or a significant downgrade to the Group’s credit rating by one or more rating agencies, the Group’s ability to raise funds may become more restricted, and consequently the Group may not be able to make payments on debt by the due date. To provide additional financial flexibility and liquidity, the Group maintains long-term commitment lines of 100 billion yen and U.S.$1 billion and a U.S.$300 million delayed draw long-term foreign exchange facility. The Group maintains good relationships with financial institutions, including the counterparties to these commitment line agreements. 1) Non-derivative financial liabilities The breakdown of non-derivative financial liabilities by due date was as follows. 2016 Millions of yen Within Between one and Over one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables ................................................................... 434,119 13,658 1,932 449,709 Bonds and borrowings ....................................................................... 164,597 533,710 286,102 984,410 Total 598,716 547,368 288,034 1,434,119 2017 Millions of yen Within Between one and Over one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 483,056 3,716 5 486,777 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 168,904 517,250 283,812 969,968 Total ............................................................................................ 651,961 520,967 283,817 1,456,746 2017 Thousands of U.S. dollars Within Between one and Over one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 4,313,000 33,178 44 4,346,223 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 1,508,071 4,618,303 2,534,035 8,660,428 Total ............................................................................................ 5,821,080 4,651,491 2,534,080 13,006,660 Other than the above, the guarantees for obligations as March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 were 19,986 million yen and 21,320 million yen (U.S.$190,357 thousand), respectively. 152 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2) Derivatives The breakdown of derivatives by due date was as follows. 2016 Millions of yen Within Between one and Over one year five years five years Total Currency-related derivatives Cash inflows ................................................................................... 273,163 5,940 — 279,103 Cash outflows ................................................................................

(1,383) — — (1,383) Total ........................................................................................ (3,839) (23,455) (5,526) (32,830) (5) Market risk management The Group is exposed to market risks, such as exchange rate fluctuation risk associated with transactions denominated in foreign currencies in connection with international trade or business investments, interest rate fluctuation risk associated with financing, investments or the like, commodity price fluctuation risk associated with purchase and sale agreements/commodity inventories arising from operating activities and price fluctuation risk associated with the ownership of listed securities (i.e., stock price fluctuation risk). The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 153 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like. 2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Profit before tax U.S. dollar ...........................................................................................................

(299) (179) (1,598) Australian dollar ................................................................................................... (30) (29) (258) 2) Interest rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of and policy for managing interest rate fluctuation risk The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds to acquire fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit (e.g., through trade receivables). Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks. 2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Profit before tax .................................................................................................... (1,438) (672) (6,000) 3) Commodity price fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels. 154 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Sensitivity analysis of commodity price fluctuation risk In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

Content of, and policies for managing, stock price fluctuation risk The Group has large holdings of marketable securities and, therefore, is exposed to stock price fluctuation risk. Against such risk, the Group makes efforts to understand market prices and financial conditions or the like of issuers and, especially with respect to listed stocks, the Group reviews their portfolios on a periodic basis. 2. Sensitivity analysis of stock price fluctuation risk In regards to listed stocks held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in the case that prices of such listed stocks decrease by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

(987) (1,092) (9,750) (6) Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments were as follows. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments,” fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. 1) Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value amount value Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade notes and accounts receivable ......................... 465,217 465,049 519,925 519,848 4,642,187 4,641,500 Total .................................................................... 465,217 465,049 519,925 519,848 4,642,187 4,641,500 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade notes and accounts payable ............................ 362,804 362,804 408,430 408,430 3,646,696 3,646,696 Bonds and borrowings Bonds payable (including current portion) ................... 79,771 81,683 79,883 81,690 713,241 729,375 Long-term loans (including current portion) ................. 775,233 795,992 764,334 781,304 6,824,410 6,975,928 Total ........................................................................ 1,217,809 1,240,481 1,252,649 1,271,425 11,184,366 11,352,008 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 155 The fair values stated above are calculated as follows. (a) Trade notes and accounts receivable Each receivable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (b) Trade notes and accounts payable Each payable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (c) Bonds and borrowings The fair value of bonds payable is the market price when available. The fair value of long-term loans is the present value of total principal and interest discounted using an assumed interest rate on equivalent new borrowings. Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. 2) Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value ① Analysis of fair value by hierarchy level The following tables provide analysis by level reflecting the significance of inputs used when measuring fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are measured at fair value. No financial assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 2016 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ........... — 318 548 866 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ....................................................... 103,763 — 68,988 172,751 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ............................................... 196 (2,169) — (1,972) Total ........................................................................................... 103,959 (1,850) 69,537 171,645 2017 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ........... — 312 3 316 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ....................................................... 114,182 — 58,444 172,627 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ............................................... 190 (3,907) — (3,717) Total ........................................................................................... 114,373 (3,595) 58,448 169,227 2017 Thousands of U.S. dollars Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ........... — 2,785 26 2,821 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ...................................................... 1,019,482 — 521,821 1,541,312 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ............................................... 1,696 (34,883) — (33,187) Total ........................................................................................... 1,021,187 (32,098) 521,857 1,510,955 156 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements The fair values stated above are calculated as follows. (a) Other investments The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group’s corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies. (b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities Currency-related derivatives The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date. Interest rate-related derivatives The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk. Commodity-related derivatives The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end. Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. ② Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

The fair values of such financial assets at the dates of the sales transactions and the cumulative gains (before taxes) concerning such sales were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2016 2017 2017 Fair value at the date of sale ...................................................................................... 5,324 15,165 135,401 Cumulative gains ....................................................................................................... 2,521 9,648 86,142 158 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2017 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 4) Reclassification to retained earnings The Group reclassifies to retained earnings cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in either of the following cases: when an investment is disposed of; and, when there is a significant decline in the fair value. Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017 were gains of 2,016 million yen and losses of (1,229) million yen (U.S.$(10,973) thousand), respectively. (8) Hedge accounting 1) Types of hedge accounting (a) Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories. With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss. Gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments included net losses of 45 million yen and net gains of 154 million yen (U.S. $1,375 thousand) for the years ended March 31, 2016, and March 31, 2017, respectively. Gains or losses on the hedged items or less corresponded to the gains or losses on the hedging instruments. (b) Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency. With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. For the years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were profit of 168 million yen and profit of (661) million yen (U.S.$(5,901) thousand), respectively. (c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The Group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations. With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. 2) Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting were as follows.
