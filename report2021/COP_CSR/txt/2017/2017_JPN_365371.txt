Since our very beginning, our corporate principles have been the cornerstone upon which we continue to build sustainable businesses. We still aspire to the words of our founder, when he said, We will contribute to global society through our business. These words have been the underpinnings of our strong management foundation, inspiring us to build bigger and better. Looking at the world of today, we see familiar social issues that have only become more grave over time. Labor shortages, rising payroll costs, more people suffering from advanced age-induced lifestyle diseases. We have built our reputation upon on successfully solving these issues through our businesses. This is why we see these changes as a major business opportunity. Our initiatives in solving these issues ties neatly together with contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Our new medium-term management plan outlines our strategy for sustainable growth. We will be bold in pursuing new technological innovations. And we will use these technologies as drivers of our business to solve social issues. These technologies will drive steady, sustainable growth in our businesses and in our corporate value. ★ OMRON Principles (P56-57) President and CEO July 2017 6 OMRON Corporation Vision Overview Strategy Governance Financial Information 7 Integrated Report 2017 EARTH-1 STAGE Review (Fiscal Years 2014-2016) ■ Basic Strategy Successes and Issues EARTH-1 STAGE represents the second mediumBusiness, we have created a strong foundation term management plan under our long-term vision, that will serve to propel growth under our next VG2020.

Taking the lead in each era, OMRON has developed unique core technologies that create value. Sensing collects status and other information about people and manufacturing based on observation of the production ﬂoor. Control provides appropriate solutions to the production ﬂoor based on the information obtained through Sensing. In 2011, OMRON added a new category, + THINK . This idea expresses the need for human intelligence in Sensing & Control. We believe that the more Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and other technical innovations evolve, the more these technologies need to become truly intelligent to be valuable.
