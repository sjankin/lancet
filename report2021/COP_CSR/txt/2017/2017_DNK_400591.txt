As long-term landowners, our goal is to improve the quality of our soil every year. However, this is a very slow process, and not easily demonstrated in an annual CSR report. our most We measure our soil fertility status in five-year intervals. It is our long-term goal to improve the topsoil layer by 2 mm a year, so you can say that Ingleby grows both crops and soils. By 2030, important asset! we aim to achieve an improvement of 30 mm. How we improve our soils We define and monitor our soil's quality We improve our soils by leaving sufficient crop residues in relation to its ability to support on the ground, using cover crops and minimum tillage, maintaining healthy crop rotations, and adding compost and crop and pasture growth. We assume livestock manures where available and cost effective. We also that by improving soil properties contour plough, add nutrients to avoid depletion, use nonthat contribute to improved plant chemical weed controls, satellite-guided input applications and tractor-wheel path tracking. production, we also contribute to the other environmental services that We accept that in diversifying our crop rotations, we produce fewer soils provide. calories with a potentially lower income, provided these crop rotations are more advantageous for our farming system and soil health over the long term. Yearly soil benchmarks In our sustainability reports, we have our yearly benchmarks, which tell To measure how our soils are us if we are supporting our soil quality in a positive way. We monitor: developing, we take Reference Soil Samples every five years. > Nutrient balance for N, P, and K (primary macronutrients) > Nutrient use efficiency for the primary macronutrients Samples are taken from representative areas of the farms and we analyse for In addition to the above, we also monitor a number of other all key soil properties that determine soil parameters that are either influenced by soil quality, or that affect quality. soil quality over the longer term. We combine these results with those This is benchmarked against our 5-year reference soil samples. from our annual crop nutrient balances We take these at deeper soil depths than our routine soil and leaf nutrient analyses to track samples used for crop management decisions and can how our farming practices therefore measure more soil properties. Any changes of soil affect soil quality. properties at these sites provide us with valuable information for coming generations to learn how our farms developed over time. Soil profile, Romania.

Our yields were 97% higher for canola compared to earlier years, and 27% higher for wheat compared to the last 5-year average. The good results are based on a combination of factors. IMPROVED SOILS GOOD MANAGEMENT Since we bought our first farm in Romania Our management team carried out all tasks, in 2007, we have constantly focused on from soil preparation and seeding to optimal improving the soils. Our soils have a high level fertilisation and crop protection in good of clay and silt and some deep compaction. timing, and with special attention to details. To improve the soil structure, we have added We seeded our winter crops from late-August more than 11 tonnes of lime per hectare over to mid-October 2016. Despite the challenging the years. weather with high rainfall during that period, our team got the timing just right. We have also changed our tillage system to deep cultivation every third year. We work the We also improved our fertiliser plan according soil with single tines to a depth of 40-45 cm to to soil and leaf analyses, keeping in mind break up soil compaction, increase the water sustainable nutrient balances. capacity, and improve the soil structure. This allows our plants to develop a deeper root zone, making them more resistant to drought and increasing their yield potential.

This was followed by a wet cold We constantly test new crop varieties. This spring that gave our crops good and steady year, we planted about 60% of our hectares in growth without any heat stress.

In Doña Maria, a farm consisting mainly of natural grasslands, we recorded 136 species. Of these, 131 species are breeding, these represent 41% of the known breeding bird species in Uruguay. We also monitored birds in La Rinconada to assess the impact of our new irrigation activity on biodiversity. Here, we recorded 157 bird species. Monitoring birdlife captures a picture of the richness of Both farms' bird counts included 17 species of Tyrant-flycatchers (Tyrannidae), and 14 species across our farms, while of Tanagers (Thraupidae).

The fragile nature of the soil and vegetation has meant that the landscape and native flora have suffered from grazing livestock and large-scale land clearing for agriculture. On Ingleby’s farm in Western Australia, our farm team have spent seven years protecting and fencing isolated pockets of bush for long-term conservation and natural regeneration. Up to 20% of the farm now consists of fenced-off remnant, native vegetation. Fencing prevents livestock grazing the understory and it also makes other environmental risks such as fires easier to manage. In certain places, particularly the creek lines, there are many introduced grasses, Western Australia and fencing allows controlled grazing on these areas. is famous for its wild Over seven years, the team has built more than flowers. 100 kilometres of fences.

The most spectacular of these is the Grand Canyon Cave, a spacious 350 metre-long tunnel leading deep into a steep ridge. This cave, which was set aside under a Conservation Covenant in 1998, is also significant because of the colony of endangered Long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculata) that roost there. Long-tailed bats are one of three bat species endemic to New Zealand – the country’s only native land mammals. Grand Canyon Cave, together with its resident bats, is safeguarded by the local Department of Conservation (DOC) as a 32-hectare nature reserve. The bats use the cave for roosting, though not at all times. They also have numerous roosts in small cavities in trees (under bark or epiphytes or in holes in trees) and they move roosts frequently, usually not spending more than a couple of nights in a row in any one roost. Cave entrance to the Grand Canyon Cave, Puketiti, New Zealand. Photographer: Mette Bøgeløv Erichsen This year DOC completed a three-year markrecapture study on the bats to compare the population and survival estimates with an earlier study, to discover population trends. Over the three years there have been a total of 706 captures of 531 individual long-tailed bats. These bats can live for quite a long time, one caught last year in another area was first banded as an adult 20 years before, so the record is about 21 or 22 years, for an animal the size of a mouse!
