We are ready to build the networks that allow the Nordic and Baltic regions to be frontrunners in the next phase of digitalization. Our network is our backbone and we want our customers to be confident that they will always get the best connection from Telia Company. In order to offer a competitive customer offering and positive long-term returns for shareholders, we have continued the important and challenging change agenda during the year. IT systems continue to become more efficient, the product portfolio is simpler and the old copper technology is being replaced with modern communication solutions. Our continued path to modernization allows us to keep the customer in focus, and allows tomorrow's products and services to be at our customer’s fingertips sooner. Connectivity and technology have a significant impact on society and Telia Company has an important role to play.

Together we learned Chair of the Board 12 OUR COMPANY Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 CEO COMMENTS COMMENTS BY THE CEO ON THE EVE OF THE GIGABIT SOCIETY Telia Company is a company with strong values and we want digitalization and our services to be used to help overcome the challenges of our time. I am more convinced than ever that a commitment to digitalization is the way to effectively underpin our customers’ changing reality, our societies increasing awareness and to create value for our shareholders. Our customers will be the pioneer users of the new generation mobile technology, 5G; Stockholm, Tallinn and Helsinki will be first out and we thus enable our home markets to be the world’s testing ground for connected cars, medical care and other services that we today can barely imagine. Our ambition is that the Nordic and Baltic countries will take the first steps into the Gigabit society and that Telia Company leads the way. TO BE SOMETHING MORE Digitalization is not an event but a series of components that together create a pattern. Our customers are the drivers of ingenuity and change and in the same way, Telia Company is changing. There are days when I think that the pace of change is too slow, and then it is good to stop and look back. In this perspective, it becomes clear that we really have changed since we embarked on the path that is gradually bringing us closer to being the New Generation Telco. This does not mean that we want to be anything different but that we want to be something more. We have now reached the stage in our development where we have been able to manifest the change with a new name and updated visual style. In more and more countries Telia signs are put up with the aim of creating a cohesive and strong brand in all our core markets. Norway to choose our connections.

Stockholm, March 8, 2017 Johan Dennelind President and CEO 14 OUR COMPANY Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 TRENDS AND STRATEGY TRENDS AND STRATEGY Three major inputs are the cornerstones for how we develop and formulate the strategy, namely megatrends, stakeholders’ opinions and our capabilities and resources. Exploding number of connected devices Our society is changing more rapidly through digitalization. Three mega­trends are driving the telecom business. MEGATRENDS Our society is changing more rapidly through digitalization. This might be a shift as big as the industrial revolution. The shift is enabled by the radically reduced cost for storage and computing, exponentially increasing number of connected devices combined with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. This is what we believe will lead to the tipping point. As other technologies are becoming generally available the digitalization will take further steps. The sweet spot will be the intersection of these trends. At the same time, we have a number of trends that are the legacy of how we implemented industrialization. Climate change, increased inequality and rapid urbanization. This requires societal attention and drives the need for a sustainable approach to all that we do. As we also live longer than ever, medical advances give cure, and relief from more and more deceases we will have a pressure on our social security systems but also a risk of a health inequality that might further challenge our social structure. 15 OUR COMPANY TRENDS AND STRATEGY Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 KEY TRENDS AFFECTING TELIA COMPANY 1 Exponential technology 2Digitalization 3 Urbanization 4 Aging population development everywhere An exponential technoDigitalization that will As more and more people The aging population will logical development that affect every company, move to fewer cities, the drive increased healthwill be the facilitator for individual and socipressure on infrastruccare need but also create new advances and create ety and drive changes ture and sustainability a target market with new ways for sharing in most, if not all, areas. will be enormous.

SEK Retained earnings 54,206,643,071 Net income 10,366,679,823 Total 64,573,322,894 The Board proposes that this sum be appropriated as follows: SEK SEK 2.00 per share ordinary dividend to the shareholders 8,660,169,562 To be carried forward 55,913,153,332 Total 64,573,322,894 The dividend should be split and distributed into two equal tranches of SEK 1.00 each, one in April 2017 and one in October 2017. The Board of Directors has, according to Chapter 18 Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act, assessed whether the proposed dividend is justified. The Board of Directors assesses that: The parent company’s restricted equity and the group’s total equity attributable to the shareholders of the parent company, after the distribution of profits in accordance with the proposal, will be sufficient in relation to the scope of the parent company’s and the group’s business. The proposed dividend does not jeopardize the parent company’s or the group’s ability to make the investments that are considered necessary. The proposal is consistent with the established cash flow forecast under which the parent company and the group are expected to manage unexpected events and temporary variations in cash flows to a reasonable extent. The full statement by the Board of Directors on the same will be included in the AGM documents.

Failing to reach the targets set for business transformation, customer attraction and future growth may negatively impact the results of operations. 46 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Risk Description Mitigating activities Associated Telia Company conducts some of its activities through associ• Monitoring of the associates’ perforcompanies and ated companies, the major ones being MegaFon in Russia and mance and development joint operations Turkcell in Turkey, in which Telia Company does not have full • Active board work in our associated ownership or controlling interest and are due to that not in full compnaies (e.g. MegaFon), driving control but still have significant influence over the conduct of issues of key importance to Telia these businesses.

The risk of actions outside Telia Company’s or its associated companies’ control and adverse to their interests is inherent in associated companies and jointly controlled entities. Potential impact The financial performance of these associated companies may have a significant impact on Telia Company’s shortand longterm results. As part of its strategy, Telia Company may want to increase or decrease its shareholdings in some of its associated companies. This may be complicated due to a variety of factors, including factors beyond Telia Company’s control, such as willingness on the part of other existing shareholders to dispose or accept dilution of their shareholdings and, in the event Telia Company gains greater control, its ability to successfully manage the relevant businesses. As they are jointly controlled, there is a risk that the partners may disagree on important matters, including funding of the operations which may affect Telia Company’s position to act as planned. A disagreement or deadlock or a breach by one of the parties of the material provisions of the co-operation arrangements may have a negative effect on Telia Company. 47 DIRECTORS’ REPORT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 Risk Description Mitigating activities Impairment losses Factors generally affecting the telecom markets as well as • Management constantly reviews and and restructuring changes in the economic, regulatory, business or political refines the business plans, and may charges environment may negatively change management’s expectamake exit decisions or take other action of future cash flows attributable to certain assets.

MSA’s report was made public on February 1, continuously hand over information to 2013. In April 2013, the Board of Directors assigned the interlaw enforcement agencies, who are national law firm Norton Rose Fulbright (NRF) to review transbetter equipped to assess whether actions and agreements made in Eurasia by Telia Company in any criminal acts have occurred the past years with the intention to give the Board a clear picture of the transactions and a risk assessment from a business ethics perspective. For advice on implications under Swedish legislation, the Board assigned two Swedish law firms. In consultation with the law firms, Telia Company has promptly taken steps, and will continue to take steps, in its business operations as well as in its governance structure and with its personnel which reflect concerns arising from the review. The Swedish Prosecution Authority’s investigation with respect to Uzbekistan is still ongoing and Telia Company continues to cooperate with and provide assistance to the Prosecutor. If continued assessments and investigations would lead to new observations and findings, it cannot be excluded that the consequences of such findings would be that the results of operations and financial position in Telia Company’s operations in the Eurasian jurisdictions are adversely impacted. Another risk is presented by the Swedish Prosecution Authority’s notification in the beginning of 2013 within the investigation of Telia Company’s transactions in Uzbekistan, that the Authority is separately investigating the possibility of seeking a corporate fine against Telia Company, which under the Swedish Criminal Act can be levied up to a maximum amount of SEK 10 million per instance, and forfeiture of any proceeds to Telia Company resulting from the alleged crimes. 49 DIRECTORS’ REPORT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 Risk Description Mitigating activities Review of Eurasian The Swedish Prosecution Authority may take similar actions transactions with respect to transactions made or agreements entered into – Continued by Telia Company relating to operations in its other Eurasian markets, but it could be noted that the Swedish prosecutor made a public statement in May 2016, that it had decided not to investigate any other of Telia Company’s operations in Eurasia. Further, actions taken, or to be taken, by the police, prosecution or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions against Telia Company’s operations or transactions, or against third parties, whether they be Swedish or non-Swedish individuals or legal entities, might directly or indirectly harm Telia Company’s business, results of operations, financial position, cash flows or brand reputation. As examples, investigations concerning bribery and money laundering in connection with the transactions in Uzbekistan are conducted by the Dutch prosecutor and police authorities, and by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. As requested by the Dutch authorities, Telia Company has provided a bank guarantee of EUR 10 million as collateral for any financial claims which may be decided against one of its Dutch subsidiaries. Telia Company is cooperating fully with the Dutch and US authorities and has done so since it was informed of the investigations in March 2014 and has engaged leading US and Dutch law firms as legal counsel for advice and support. On September 14, 2016, Telia Company received a proposal from the US and the Dutch authorities for financial sanctions amounting to a total of approximately USD 1.45 billion or approximately SEK 12.5 billion at that point in time. It is not at present possible to assess when the investigations will be finally resolved. Telia Company has received requests to make public the reviews made by NRF and other law firms. However, despite risking criticism, it is not possible to publish the reviews with respect to people, companies, business agreements, privacy and thus the risk of Telia Company incurring lawsuits as the law firms’ views are not necessarily shared by those implicated. 50 Annual and Sustainability Report 2016 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT STATEMENT OF MATERIALITY AND SIGNIFICANT AUDIENCES Telia Company AB is registered in Sweden and is bound by the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). The act requires the Board of Directors to govern the company in a way that is profitable and creates value for its shareholders. It is Telia Company’s firm belief that the best way of ensuring sustainable growth and profitability is integrating sustainable, responsible business practices into all parts of business and strategy, to create long term shared value for the company, its stakeholders and society. Telia Company has adopted a stakeholder based approach to identify and manage the most material business aspects, including related risks and opportunities. The approach involves engaging with significant stakeholder groups to understand Telia Company’s current and future impact on its stakeholders, the environment and society. Material aspects guide how Telia Company develops and drives its business strategy, including how the company contributes to the fulfillment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Significant stakeholder groups include: • Shareholders • Consumers • Business customers • Employees • Investors • Suppliers • Society The Annual General Meeting is the primary forum for shareholder engagement. Telia Company continuously engages with other stakeholders in many ways. See “Trends and strategy” for more information about stakeholder engagement.

These include: • The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights • The core conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) • The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises • The UN Global Compact • The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights • The Children’s Rights and Business Principles These guidelines form the foundation of the Code of Responsible Business Conduct which is approved by the Board of Directors.

Telia Company monitors and discloses the progress on these material business aspects through this combined Annual and Sustainability Report.

DON’T DO THIS AT WORK The Code is a tool to raise awareness and engagement regarding ethics, values, dilemmas, culture and leadership. The new Code more clearly reflects the “tone from the top” and the expectations of employees and management as well as the consequences of non-compliance. Its 17 chapters reflect group policies and instructions and also provide practical, instructional information on how to interpret the Code requirements. It also includes information about contact points for raising concerns and whistle-blowing through the externally available Speak-Up Line. The Code is available in English, Russian, Kazakh, Azeri, Romanian, Georgian and all Nordic and Baltic languages both online and in a printed newspaper-format document. Roll-out of the Code The roll-out of the Code started in Sweden and continued with management teams in local companies, covering ten countries by year-end. Participants took part in an interacCode of Responsible Business Conduct tive dilemma game based on real Telia Company cases. The game allows people to discuss different approaches to SOR220124 160503 Telia Ethics Newspaper print master ENG.indd 1 2016-09-01 10:59 and the consequences of ethical dilemmas. At the end of The Code is available online and each session, participants anonymously submit their own in printed newspaper format dilemmas to be used in updated versions of the game. Feedback from employees has been positive and many have commented that the new Code addresses serious matters in a fun, lighthearted way that is easy to understand and apply. We aim to conduct face-to-face training on the Code and ethical dilemmas with employees in 2017. E-learning program The launch of the Code was complemented by an elearning program that was introduced in December. This program is compulsory for all employees. The main module covering the Code’s purpose, expectations of employees and our speak-up culture will be followed by topical e-learning courses to be rolled out during 2017. The Code is available at dontdothisatwork.teliacompany. com. If you have feedback or would like to know more, just contact us at ask-us (at) teliacompany.com.
