This information Codes, policies, and standards enables customers, investors, employees, nongovernmental organizations, and others to assess our progress and gain insights from our sustainable business practices that can be applied to Autodesk codes, policies, and standards related other companies and organizations. We published our first Sustainability Report in 2008, and to sustainability include the following: we report annually. • Code of Business Conduct Performance data included in this report is based on the Autodesk fiscal year when noted, and • Code of Ethics for Senior Executive and the calendar year otherwise. The Autodesk 2017 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2016, through Financial Officers January 31, 2017. Performance data covers the company’s global operations, unless otherwise • Environmental Policy stated. In some cases, segments in tables do not add up to the total due to rounding. Dashes indicate where data was unavailable. • Human Rights Policy • Partner Code of Conduct To learn more about our commitment to sustainability and our vision for the role design can have in addressing global challenges, visit our website at www.autodesk.com/sustainability. Performance summary We have a tremendous opportunity to help our customers and employees imagine, design, and create a better world. Although our biggest opportunity to improve our shared future is through the designers who use our software, we also work hard to improve the direct impact of our operations. This report provides a high-level view of our progress in sustainability over the past several years. Economy Autodesk’s ongoing financial performance underpins the company’s efforts in sustainability. Our business model has shifted away from one-time, perpetual licenses toward term-based product subscriptions, cloud service offerings, and flexible enterprise business agreements. Over time, this business model transition will result in a more predictable, recurring, and profitable business. However, during the transition, traditional financial metrics, such as revenue, margins, earnings per share, and cash flow from operations will be adversely impacted. This is primarily due to revenue for new subscription offerings being recognized over time rather than up front and because subscription offerings generally have a lower initial price than perpetual offerings.

We enable our customers to design solutions that mitigate the effects of climate change, helping them win more business and save money. We also address the environmental impact of our own operations through a range of activities, as described in this report. The following commitments and targets demonstrate our broad and bold approach in this area. COMMITMENTS • Continue to report climate change information in mainstream financial reports (see Autodesk FY2017 Annual Report). • Continue to conduct responsible corporate engagement in climate change policy (see Public policy). • Continue to use an internal price on carbon. • Continue to integrate sustainable design capabilities into our products and services. TARGETS PROGRESS IN FY2017 We are committed to following our Corporate Finance Approach to Achieved. Since fiscal year 2009 (our baseline), CO2e Climate-Stabilizing Targets (C-FACT) methodology through 2020, we have decreased absolute GHG emissions by which aims to reduce GHG emissions in line with an 85 percent 44 percent, surpassing our goal for fiscal year reduction by 2050.

When we look to the future of making things, it’s imperative that it be low-carbon. Sustainable design can have a real, lasting effect in our collective efforts to move toward that future by helping to reduce the GHG emissions and environmental impact of buildings, infrastructure, and manufactured goods. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) and manufacturing sectors account for two-thirds of the world’s carbon emissions.1 The rate of new construction in the United States alone is equivalent to building a new Manhattan every 35 days.2 And in 2014, the value of U.S. manufacturing was enough to make it the ninth largest economy in the world, valued at $2.1 trillion.3 The opportunity to transform our world through sustainable design is immense, and Autodesk’s customers are looking for ways to design and manufacture more sustainable buildings, infrastructure projects, and products. In fact, an Autodeskcommissioned study from Deloitte revealed that by 2020, 75 percent of the market we serve will demand software tools that help advance sustainable design. Our customers have a broad and global reach. They include a wide range of companies, established design Model courtesy of DesignGroup and the National Audubon Society. firms, academic institutions, nonprofits, and entrepreneurs in the AEC, product design, and manufacturing fields. We develop solutions that our customers can use to design a future in which our built environment, infrastructure, products, and manufacturing can allow us all to live well, and live within the limits of the 35 days planet. We help customers proactively understand, optimize, and improve the environmental performance of everything they make, so they can advance their carbon, energy, resource productivity, and cost savings goals. The time it would take to construct a new Architecture, engineering, and construction: Our customers use Autodesk® tools to design and retrofit Manhattan at the current rate of U.S. building buildings; maximize energy and material efficiency; prioritize infrastructure projects based on social, environmental, and economic impacts; and minimize waste during construction.

Historical values for total GHG emissions, GHG emissions intensity, and carbon offsets as a percent of GHG emissions are updated due to revisions to business travel data, as described in footnote 9. 6. Beginning with fiscal year 2015, data are calculated with the market-based accounting method, which takes into account purchased renewable energy. Data for prior years use a location-based methodology to calculate GHG emissions. 7. These data are calculated based on the economic input-output lifecycle assessment model, using industry-specific emissions factors in conjunction with Autodesk’s spend. 8. Data for capital goods and transportation and distribution were calculated based on annual spend and allocated evenly across quarters. 9. We updated our methodology for calculating GHG emissions associated with business travel to more accurately capture the effects of radiative forcing. Historical data have been restated accordingly. 10.
