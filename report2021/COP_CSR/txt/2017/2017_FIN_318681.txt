Comparable operating profit eliminates both the inventory gains/losses generated by the volatility in raw material prices and changes in open derivatives, and better reflects the company's underlying operational performance. Also, it reflects Neste's operational cash flow, where the change in IFRS operating profit caused by inventory valuation is mostly compensated by changing working capital. Items affecting comparability are linked to unpredictability events of a significant nature that do not form part of normal day-to-day business. They include among others impairment losses and reversals, gains and losses associated with the combination or termination of businesses, restructuring costs, and gains and losses on the sales of assets.

The base inventory is the minimum level of stocks which can reasonably assure the continuous operation of the refineries and preventing deliveries from being Market risks compromised. It comprises inventories at the refineries and within the supply chain. Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements The base inventory includes the minimum level of stocks that Neste is required to and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary commodity maintain under Finnish laws and regulations. price risks that the Group is exposed to include crude oil, oil products, renewable The role of price risk management in logistics is particularly present in the feedstocks, and renewable diesel prices that could adversely affect the value of the Renewable Products' business due to market practices in feedstock pricing and Group’s financial assets, liabilities, or expected future cash flows. As the pricing longer sea voyages. In the Renewable Products' business, the price risk related to the currency used in the oil market is the U.S. dollar and Neste operates and reports in base inventory is higher than the physical inventory and is approximately one third Euro, also this factor exposes Neste's business to short-term transaction risks and of the annual renewables refining capacity used. In traditional oil refining, the base longer-term economic currency risks. In accordance with Group risk management inventory is approximately one tenth of the total annual fossil fuel refining capacity. principles, the Group enters into various derivatives transactions for risk management The base inventory creates a risk in Neste’s income statement and balance sheet purposes. The positions are monitored and managed on a daily basis according to the inasmuch as Neste applies the FIFO method for measuring the cost of goods sold, above mentioned risk management principles. raw materials and inventories. Hedging operations related to price risk do not target the base inventory. Instead, Neste’s inventory risk management policies target the 1. Commodity price risks ‘transaction position’ inasmuch as these stocks create cash flow risks depending The main commodity price risks Neste faces in its businesses are related to market on the relationships between feedstocks purchases, refinery production and refined prices for crude oil, renewable feedstocks, and other feedstocks, as well as refined petroleum product sales over any given period. petroleum and renewable products. These prices are subject to significant fluctuations According to the Neste risk management principle, any open exposures of the resulting from a periodic over-supply and supply tightness in various regional markets, transaction position are hedged without delay. coupled with fluctuations in demand. In hedging the transaction position, derivative financial instruments are used. Neste's results of operations in any given period are principally driven by the Because of the differences between the quality of the underlying feedstocks for which demand for and prices of oil and renewable products relative to the supply and cost derivative financial instruments can be sold and purchased and the actual quality of of raw materials. These factors, combined with Neste's own consumption of raw Neste’s feedstocks, the business will remain exposed to some degree of basis risk. materials and output of refined products, drive operational performance and cash Basis risk is typically higher in the Renewables business due to the nature of the flows in Oil Products and Renewable Products, which are Neste's largest business feedstock pool and limited availability of hedging instruments. areas in terms of revenue, profits and net assets. Neste divides the commodity price risks affecting Neste’s revenue, profits and net Refining margin risk assets into two main categories; inventory price risk and refining margin risk. As the total refining margin is an important determinant of Oil Products business area's earnings, its fluctuations constitute a significant risk.

Foreign exchange risk revenue from sold petroleum products and the cost of raw materials together with As the pricing currency used in the oil industry is the U.S. dollar and Neste operates other costs. Neste’s exposure to low refining margins in traditional oil refining is partly and reports in Euro, this factor is one that exposes Neste's business to short-term offset by its high-conversion refineries. transaction and longer-term economic currency risks. Neste is exposed to greater margin volatility in the Renewable Products’ business The objective of foreign exchange risk management in Neste is to limit the compared to that in fossil fuel refining. In the Renewables business, the refining margin uncertainty created by changes in foreign exchange rates on the future value of is mainly a function of the renewable fuel sale price received and the feedstocks used. cash flows and earnings, and in the Group's balance sheet. Generally, this is done The underlying indices used in renewable diesel pricing are primarily oil products or by hedging currency risks in contracted and forecast cash flows and balance sheet conventional biodiesel related. Product prices fluctuate regionally depending on the exposures (referred to as transaction exposure) as well as the equity of non-eurozone nature of bio mandates, local supply and demand, and fossil fuel prices. In Europe, the subsidiaries (referred to as translation exposure). price of renewable fuels is determined mainly by the price of the local biodiesel price. Typical biodiesel qualities are Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) or Rapeseed-Oil Methyl Transaction exposure Ester (RME).

Disputes and potential litigations Neste has two pending disputes concerning the bio mandate penalty payments totaling approximately EUR 62 million. The dispute concerning the penalty payment levied in 2014, amounting approximately EUR 44 million, is pending at the Supreme Administrative Court. Despite the appeal, Finnish Customs has returned penalty payment to Neste in August 2015. The dispute concerning the penalty payment levied and expensed in 2015, amounting approximately EUR 17 million, is pending at the Administrative Court of Helsinki. In both cases Neste considers that it has complied with the requirements according to the legislation and the authority instructions and that the penalty payments are in contradiction with the legislation and general principles. Neste has one pending dispute concerning the excise tax levied on the exported products. Finnish Customs levied excise tax, interest and additional tax totaling approximately EUR 16 million due to the default of entries to the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS). The payment has been charged to the income statement during the financial period 2016. However, Neste considers that excise duty cannot be levied due to the default of entries to EMCS when products have been exported under the customs supervision and when the export outside EU is indisputable. Neste considers that the excise tax levy is in contradiction with the purpose of excise tax legislation of EU as well as the general principle of proportionality and the interpretations of Court of Justice of the European Union. Neste demands for rectification of decisions from the tax authority. In December 2016, Finnish Customs decided – contrary to its former draft resolution and in consequence of the statement of Neste – not to levy excise tax, interest and additional tax totaling approximately EUR 18 million for two shippings placed to export procedure and shipped outside Finland in 2013. The representative of Finnish state has demanded for rectification of the custom’s decision and the decision is not yet final. Neste considers that export has been the correct procedure in these shippings and Finnish Customs’ decision should not be changed. No provision is recognized in consolidated financial statement because possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is not considered probable.
