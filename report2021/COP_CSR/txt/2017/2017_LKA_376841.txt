New Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective A number of new standards and amendments to standards, which have been issued but not yet effective as at the Reporting date, have not been applied in preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, the following Accounting Standards have not been applied in preparing these Financial Statements and the Group plans to apply these standards on the respective effective dates: Accounting Standard Summary of the Requirements Possible Impact on Consolidated Financial Statements SLFRS 9 – SLFRS 9, issued in 2014, replaces the existing guidance in LKAS The Group has completed the initial high level ‘Financial 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.

The new model applies to financial model approach and solely payment of principal assets that are not measured at FVTPL. and interest criteria to ensure that financial assets are classified into the appropriate categories The model uses a dual measurement approach, under which the loss allowance is measured as either: Need to build a model with appropriate zz 12 month expected credit loss; or methodologies and controls to ensure that judgment exercised to assess recoverability of zz Lifetime expected credit losses. loans and make robust estimates of expected The measurement basis will generally depend on whether there has credit losses and point at which there is been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. significant increase in credit risk.

Net Interest Income Interest income and expense are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Interest income and expense presented in the Income Statement include: zz Interest on Held-for-trading financial instruments calculated using EIR method; zz Interest on Loans and receivables calculated using EIR method; zz Interest on Available-for-sale investments calculated using EIR method; zz Interest on Held-to-maturity investments calculated using EIR method; zz Interest on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost calculated using EIR method. Effective Interest Rate (EIR) The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. The calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that forms an integral part of the EIR. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than credit impaired assets, the Group estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not future credit losses. For credit impaired financial assets, a credit adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows.

This is recognised as an item of ‘Other Income’ in the year in which significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. 17.2 Rental Income Rental income is recognised in the profit or loss on an accrual basis. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 219 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 18. Impairment Charges for Loans and Other Losses For financial assets carried at amortised cost (such as amounts due from banks, loans and advances to customers as well as held to maturity investments), the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists for individually significant financial assets or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is not recognised are included in a collective assessment of impairment together with the financial assets that are not individually significant. Individual Assessment of Impairment For financial assets above a pre-determined threshold (i.e., for individually significant financial assets), if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses that have not yet been incurred). The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a provision account and the amount of impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss. Interest income continues to be accrued and recorded in ‘Interest Income’ on the reduced carrying amount/impaired balance and is accrued using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The present value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original EIR. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current EIR. If the Bank has reclassified trading assets to loans and advances, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the new EIR determined at the reclassification date. The calculation of the present value of the estimated future cash flows of a collateralised financial asset reflects the cash flows that may result from foreclosure less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral, whether or not foreclosure is probable. Collective Assessment of Impairment Those financial assets for which, the Group determines that no provision is required under individual impairment, such financial assets are then collectively assessed for any impairments that have been incurred but not yet identified. For the purpose of a collective evaluation of impairment, financial assets are grouped on the basis of similar risk characteristics such as internal credit ratings, asset type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past-due status, etc. Future cash flows on a group of financial assets that are collectively evaluated for impairment, are estimated based on the historical loss experiences of assets with similar credit risk characteristics to those in the group. The key inputs into the measurement of provision for collective impairment are the term structure of the following variables: zz Probability of default (PD) zz Loss given default (LGD) zz Exposure at default (EAD) These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models and other historical data. PD values are estimates at a certain date, which are calculated based on statistical rating models, and assessed using rating tools tailored to the various categories of counter parties and exposures. These statistical models are based on internally compiled data comprising both quantitative and qualitative factors. If a counterparty or exposure migrates between rating classes, then this will lead to a change in the estimate of the associated PD. PDs are estimated considering the contractual maturities of exposures. LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss in case of default. The Group estimates LGD parameters based on the history of recovery rates of claims against defaulted counterparties. The LGD models consider the structure, collateral, seniority of the claim, counterparty industry and recovery costs of any collateral that is integral to the financial asset. They are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using the effective interest rate as the discounting factor. EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default or the financial asset’s gross carrying amount. 220 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Historical loss experiences are adjusted based on the current observable data to reflect the effects of current conditions on the historical losses experienced, further removing the effects of conditions that do not exist at the Reporting date. Estimates of changes in future cash flows reflect, and are directionally consistent with the changes in related observable data year-on-year such as changes in; Interest rates, Inflation rates, Growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Global GDP growth rates, Countries’ Sovereign ratings, ease of doing business Indices, Exchange rates, Political stability, and Portfolio factors including percentage of restructured performing loans. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating provision for impairment including assumptions for projecting future cash flows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between loss estimates and actual loss experiences. Impairment of Rescheduled Loans and Advances Where possible, the Bank seeks to reschedule loans and advances rather than to take possession of collateral. If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated, modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made to whether the financial asset should be derecognised. If the cash flows of the renegotiated asset is substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised and new financial asset is recognised at fair value. The impairment loss before an expected restructuring is measured as follows: zz If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the estimated cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in the measurement of the existing asset based on their expected timing and amounts discounted at the original EIR of the existing financial asset. zz If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the Reporting date using the original EIR of the existing financial asset. Collateral Valuation The Bank seeks to use collateral, where possible, to mitigate its risks on financial assets. The collateral comes in various forms such as cash, gold, Government Securities, Letters of Credit/Guarantees, real estate, receivables, inventories, other non-financial assets and credit enhancements such as netting agreements, etc. The fair value of collateral is generally assessed, at a minimum, at inception and based on the Bank’s annual reporting schedule. Collateral Repossessed The Bank’s policy is to carry collaterals repossessed at fair value at the repossession date and such assets will be disposed at the earliest possible opportunity. These assets are recorded under assets held for sale as per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – SLFRS 5 on ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’. Write Off Financial assets (and the related impairment allowances) are normally written off either partially or in full, when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. Where financial assets are secured, this is generally after receipt of any proceeds from the realisation of securities. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in a provision account against the relevant category of financial assets. If, in a subsequent year, the amount of the estimated impairment loss increases or decreases because of an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced by adjusting the provision account. If a write-off is later recovered, the recovery is credited to ‘Other Income’.

Depreciation and Amortisation Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of Property, Plant & Equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives and is recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Freehold land is not depreciated. 222 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The estimated useful lives of the Property, Plant & Equipment of the Bank as at December 31, 2016 are as follows: Class of Asset Depreciation % Period Per Annum (years) Freehold and leasehold buildings 2.5 40 Motor vehicles 20 5 Computer equipment 20 5 Office equipment 20 5 Office interior work 20 5 Furniture & fittings 10 10 Machinery & equipment 10 10 The above rates are compatible with the rates used by all Group entities. The depreciation rates are determined separately for each significant part of an item of Property, Plant & Equipment and depreciation commences when it is available for use, i.e., when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Depreciation of an asset ceases at the earlier of the date that the asset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised. All classes of Property, Plant & Equipment together with the reconciliation of carrying amounts and accumulated depreciation at the beginning and at the end of the year are given in Note 39 on pages 265 to 276. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at each Reporting date and adjusted, if required. Amortisation of Intangible Assets Intangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method to write down the cost over its estimated useful economic lives, at the rate specified below: Class of Asset Amortisation % Period Per Annum (years) Computer software 20 5 The above rate is compatible with the rates used by all Group entities. The unamortised balances of intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever there is an indication for impairment and recognised in profit or loss to the extent that they are no longer probable of being recovered from the expected future benefits.

Income Tax Expense Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the Income Statement, except to the extent it relates to items recognised directly in Equity or in OCI. Current Taxation ‘Current tax’ comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax receivable or payable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted, as at the Reporting date. Current tax also includes any tax arising from dividends. Accordingly, provision for taxation is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year, as adjusted for taxation purposes, in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and amendments thereto, at the rates specified in Note 22.1 on page 225. This Note also includes the major components of tax expense, the effective tax rates and a reconciliation between the profit before tax and tax expense, as required by the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 12 on ‘Income Taxes’. Provision for taxation on the overseas operations is made on the basis of the accounting profit for the year, as adjusted for taxation purposes, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant statutes in those countries, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted as at the Reporting date. Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for: zz temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss; zz temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and zz taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. 224 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each Reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each Reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which they can be used. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted as at the Reporting date. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects as at the Reporting date to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Additional taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends by the Group, are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend is recognised. These amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss as they generally relate to income arising from transactions that were originally recognised in profit or loss. 22.1 Entity wise breakup of Income Tax Expense in the Income Statement is as follows: GROUP BANK For the year ended December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Current Year Tax Expense 5,606,143 5,185,218 5,554,989 5,094,780 Current year income tax expense of Domestic Banking Unit 4,086,795 3,536,032 4,086,795 3,536,032 Current year income tax expense of Off-shore Banking Centre 291,831 277,207 291,831 277,207 Current year income tax expense of Bangladesh Operation 1,167,596 1,185,736 1,167,596 1,185,736 Current year Income tax expense of Commercial Development Company PLC 40,063 37,882 – – Current year Income tax expense of ONEzero Company Ltd. 13,169 10,914 – – Current year Income tax expense of Serendib Finance Ltd.

Earnings Per Share (EPS) The Group computes basic and diluted EPS for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss that is attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potentially ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees. Details of Basic and Diluted EPS are given below: 226 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 23.1 Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share GROUP BANK 2016 2015 2016 2015 Amounts used as the numerator: Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Bank (Rs. ’000) 14,510,333 11,855,172 14,512,511 11,903,224 Number of ordinary shares used as the denominator: Weighted average number of ordinary shares [Refer Note 23.3] 890,037,763 888,693,776 890,037,763 888,693,776 Basic earnings per ordinary share (Rs.) 16.30 13.34 16.31 13.39 23.2 Diluted Earnings per Ordinary Share GROUP BANK 2016 2015 2016 2015 Amounts used as the numerator: Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Bank (Rs. ’000) 14,510,333 11,855,172 14,512,511 11,903,224 Number of ordinary shares used as the denominator: Weighted average number of ordinary shares [Refer Note 23.3] 892,043,791 890,103,365 892,043,791 890,103,365 Diluted earnings per ordinary share (Rs.) 16.27 13.32 16.27 13.37 23.3 Weighted Average Number of Ordinary Shares for Basic and Diluted Earnings per Share Outstanding No. of Shares Weighted average No. of Shares 2016 2015 2016 2015 Number of shares in issue as at January 01, 876,866,801 865,857,675 876,866,801 865,857,675 Add: Number of shares satisfied in the form of issue and allotment of new shares from final dividend for 2014 [Refer Note 53.1] – 8,838,513 – 8,838,513 Add: Number of shares satisfied in the form of issue and allotment of new shares from final dividend for 2015 [Refer Note 53.1] 12,731,007 – 12,731,007 12,731,007 889,597,808 874,696,188 889,597,808 887,427,195 Add: Number of shares issued under Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) 2008 894,487 2,170,613 268,784 1,266,581 Add: Number of shares issued under Employee Share Option Plan (ESOP) 2015 242,245 – 171,171 – Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per ordinary share calculation 890,734,540 876,866,801 890,037,763 888,693,776 Add: Bonus element on number of outstanding options under ESOP 2008 as at the year end – – 1,404,951 1,409,589 Add: Bonus element on number of outstanding options under ESOP 2015 as at the year end – – 601,077 – Weighted average number of ordinary shares for diluted earnings per ordinary share calculation(*) 890,734,540 876,866,801 892,043,791 890,103,365 (*) The market value of the Bank’s shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of share options has been based on the excess of quoted market price as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 over the offer price.

The Board of Directors of the Bank has recommended the payment of a final dividend of Rs.2.00 per share which is to be satisfied in the form of issue and allotment of new shares for both voting and non-voting ordinary shares of the Bank for the year ended December 31, 2016 (Bank declared a final dividend of Rs. 5.00 per share for 2015 in 2016 and this was satisfied by way of Rs. 3.00 per share in the form of cash and Rs. 2.00 per share in the form of shares). The total dividend recommended by the Board is to be approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to be held on March 30, 2017. In accordance with provisions of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard No.10 on ‘Events after the Reporting Period’, the second interim dividend referred to above and the proposed final dividend for the year ended December 31, 2016 has not been recognised as a liability as at the year end. Final dividend payable for the year 2016 has been estimated at Rs.1,783.199 Mn. (Actual final dividend for 2015 amounted to Rs. 4,384.985 Mn.) Accordingly, the dividend per ordinary share ( for both voting and non-voting ) for the year 2016 would be Rs. 6.50 (2015 – Rs. 6.50). 228 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 25.

Notes to the Financial Statements 26. Fair Value Measurement The Group measures the fair value using the following fair value hierarchy, which reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement. An analysis of fair value measurement of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities is provided below. Level 1 Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical instruments. When available, the Group measures the fair value of an instrument using active quoted prices or dealer price quotations (assets and long positions are measured at a bid price; liabilities and short positions are measured at an ask price), without any deduction for transaction costs. A market is regarded as active if transactions for asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). This category includes instruments valued using; (a) quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, (b) quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered to be less active, or (c) other valuation techniques in which almost all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data. Level 3 Inputs that are unobservable. This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation. This category includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices of similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect difference between the instruments. Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, comparison with similar instruments for which observable market prices exist. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, risk premiums in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign exchange rates, expected price volatilities and corrections. Observable prices or model inputs such as market interest rates are usually available in the market for listed equity securities and Government Securities such as Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds. Availability of observable prices and model inputs reduces the need for management judgment and estimation while reducing uncertainty associated in determining the fair values. Models are adjusted to reflect the spread for bid and ask prices to reflect costs to close out positions, credit and debit valuation adjustments, liquidity spread and limitations in the models. Also, profit or loss calculated when such financial instruments are first recorded (‘Day 1’ profit or loss) is deferred and recognised only when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument.

This approach employs the current market interest rates of similar financial instruments as a significant unobservable input in measuring the fair value and hence it is categorised under Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Sensitivity of Significant Unobservable Inputs used to Measure Fair Value of Fixed Rate Financial Instruments A significant increase/(decrease) in the market interest rate would result in lower/(higher) fair value being disclosed. Assets for which Fair Value Approximates Carrying Value For financial assets and liabilities with short-term maturities or with short-term re-pricing intervals, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits and savings deposits which do not have a specific maturity. 236 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The following table sets out the estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value and hence reflected at the carrying amounts in Financial Statements and the fair value hierarchy used: GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Total Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Total Carrying Value Amount Value Amount Note Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Financial Assets Cash and cash equivalents 27 – 32,924,227 – 32,924,227 32,924,227 – 30,193,589 – 30,193,589 30,193,589 Balance with Central Banks 28 – 43,935,258 – 43,935,258 43,935,258 – 43,873,205 – 43,873,205 43,873,205 Placements with banks 29 – 11,718,499 – 11,718,499 11,718,499 – 11,718,499 – 11,718,499 11,718,499 Loans and receivables to banks 32 – 624,458 – 624,458 624,458 – 624,458 – 624,458 624,458 Loans and receivables to other customers 33 – – 625,821,184 625,821,184 620,129,488 – – 621,709,924 621,709,924 616,018,228 Financial investments – Held-to-maturity 35 62,777,800 – 62,777,800 63,626,598 60,132,500 – – 60,132,500 60,981,298 Financial investments – Loans and recievables 36 – – 51,824,026 51,824,026 51,824,026 – – 51,824,026 51,824,026 51,824,026 Total financial assets not at fair value 62,777,800 89,202,442 677,645,210 829,625,452 824,782,554 60,132,500 86,409,751 673,533,950 820,076,201 815,233,303 Financial Liabilities Due to banks 43 – 71,098,391 – 71,098,391 71,098,391 – 67,608,811 – 67,608,811 67,608,811 Securities sold under repurchase agreements – 69,628,961 – 69,628,961 69,628,961 – 69,867,469 – 69,867,469 69,867,469 Due to other customers/ deposits from customers 45 – – 743,145,668 743,145,668 743,310,613 – – 739,728,439 739,728,439 739,563,494 Other borrowings 46 – – 9,270,154 9,270,154 9,270,154 – – 9,270,154 9,270,154 9,270,154 Subordinated liabilities 52 – – 24,175,367 24,175,367 24,849,539 – – 24,175,367 24,175,367 24,849,539 Total financial liabilities not at fair value – 140,727,352 776,591,189 917,318,541 918,157,658 – 137,476,280 773,173,960 910,650,240 911,159,467 GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Total Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Fair Total Carrying Value Amount Value Amount Note Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Financial Assets Cash and cash equivalents 27 – 20,107,076 – 20,107,076 20,107,076 – 20,043,512 – 20,043,512 20,043,512 Balances with Central Banks 28 – 28,221,017 – 28,221,017 28,221,017 – 28,221,017 – 28,221,017 28,221,017 Placements with banks 29 – 17,193,539 – 17,193,539 17,193,539 – 17,193,539 – 17,193,539 17,193,539 Securities purchased under resale agreements – 8,002,100 – 8,002,100 8,002,100 – 8,002,100 – 8,002,100 8,002,100 Loans and receivables to banks 32 – 601,106 – 601,106 601,106 – 601,106 – 601,106 601,106 Loans and receivables to other customers 33 – – 511,056,767 511,056,767 509,923,128 – – 509,248,766 509,248,766 508,115,127 Financial investments – Loans and receivables 36 – – 57,724,369 57,724,369 57,724,369 – – 57,724,369 57,724,369 57,724,369 Total financial assets not at fair value – 74,124,838 568,781,136 642,905,974 641,772,335 – 74,061,274 566,973,135 641,034,409 639,900,770 Financial Liabilities Due to banks 43 – 31,789,396 – 31,789,396 31,789,396 – 30,319,119 – 30,319,119 30,319,119 Securities sold under repurchase agreements – 112,249,703 – 112,249,703 112,249,703 – 112,384,812 – 112,384,812 112,384,812 Due to other customers/deposits from customers 45 – – 624,570,898 624,570,898 624,021,217 – – 624,651,491 624,651,491 624,101,810 Other borrowings 46 – – 9,985,637 9,985,637 9,985,637 – – 9,985,637 9,985,637 9,985,637 Subordinated liabilities 52 – – 12,019,342 12,019,342 11,988,272 – – 12,004,342 12,004,342 11,973,272 Total financial liabilities not at fair value – 144,039,099 646,575,877 790,614,976 790,034,225 – 142,703,931 646,641,470 789,345,401 788,764,650 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 237 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 2 6.4 Valuation Techniques and Inputs in Measuring Fair Values The table below provides information on the valuation techniques and inputs used in measuring the fair values of Derivative financial assets and liabilities in the Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as given in Note 26.1 on page 234.

The said forward rate is projected, based on the between currencies spot exchange rate and the forward premium/discount under consideration calculated using extrapolated interest rates of the currency pairs under consideration. In computing the present value, interest rate differential between two currencies under consideration is used as the discount rate. 27. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, placements with banks and loans at call/short notice and highly liquid financial assets with original maturities within three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in fair value and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

Derivative Financial Assets The Bank uses derivatives such as interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, etc. Derivative financial assets are recorded at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in ‘Net Gains/(Losses) from Trading’ in the Income Statement. Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not itself held-for-trading or designated at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded derivatives separated from the host are carried at fair value in the trading portfolio with changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss.

Other Financial Instruments – Held-for-Trading Financial assets are classified as Held-for-trading if; zz they are acquired principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term; or zz they hold as a part of a portfolio that is managed together for short-term profit or position taking; or zz they form part of derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as per the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 39 on ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Financial assets Held-for-trading are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Interest and dividend income are recorded in ‘Interest Income’ and ‘Net Gains/(Losses) from Trading’ respectively in the Income Statement, according to the terms of the contract, or when the right to receive the payment has been established. The Group evaluates its financial assets Held-for-trading, other than derivatives, to determine whether the intention to sell them in the near term is still appropriate.

After initial measurement, Loans and receivables to banks are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR, less provision for impairment, except when the Group designates loans and receivables at fair value through profit or loss. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in ‘Interest Income’ while the losses arising from impairment are recognised in ‘Impairment charges for loans and other losses’ in the Income Statement.

Consequently, one of the counterparty banks appropriated US$ 4.170 Mn. (Rs. 624.458 Mn.) which has been kept as a deposit with them. This action has been contested by the Bank. In view of the stance taken by the Bank in this regard, both the deposit (made by the Bank) and the amount due to the said counterparty bank, have been recorded in the Statement of Financial Position. 32. 1 (a) By Currency GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 United States Dollar 624,458 601,106 624,458 601,106 Subtotal 624,458 601,106 624,458 601,106 33. Loans and Receivables to Other Customers ‘Loans and receivables to other customers’ comprises of non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, other than: zz those that the Group intends to sell immediately or in the near term and those that the Group, upon initial recognition, designates as at fair value through profit or loss zz those that the Group, upon initial recognition, designates as available-for-sale zz those that the Group, upon initial recognition, designates as held-to-maturity. zz those for which the Group may not recover substantially all of its initial investment, other than because of credit deterioration. ‘Loans and receivables to other customers’ include, Loans & Advances and Lease Receivables of the Group. When the Group is the lessor in a lease agreement that transfers substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee, the arrangement is classified as a finance lease. Amounts receivable under finance leases, net of initial rentals received, unearned lease income and provision for impairment, are classified as lease receivable and are presented within ‘Loans and receivables to customers’ in the Statement of Financial Position. After initial measurement, ‘Loans and receivables to other customers’ are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR, less provision for impairment, except when the Group designates loans and receivables at fair value through profit or loss. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in ‘Interest Income’, while the losses arising from impairment are recognised in ‘Impairment charges for loans and other losses’ in the Income Statement. The Bank may enter into certain lending commitments where the loan, on drawdown, is expected to be classified as Held-for-trading because the intent is to sell the loans in the short term. These commitments to lend, if any, are recorded as derivatives and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Where the loan, on drawdown, is expected to be retained by the Bank and not sold in the short term, the commitment is recorded only when it is an onerous contract that is likely to give rise to a loss.

Financial Investments – Available-for-Sale Available-for-sale financial investments include equity and debt securities. Equity investments classified as available-for-sale are those which are neither classified as held-for-trading nor designated at fair value through profit or loss. Debt securities in this category are intended to be held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or in response to changes in the market conditions. The Group has not designated any loans or receivables as available-for-sale. After initial measurement, available-for-sale financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in Equity through OCI in the ‘Available-for-sale reserve’. When these financial investments are disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in Equity is recycled to profit or loss through ‘Operating income’. Interest earned while holding available-for-sale financial investments is reported as ‘Interest income’ using the EIR. Dividend earned while holding available-for-sale financial investments are recognised in the Income Statement as ‘Operating income’ when the right to receive the payment has been established. The losses arising from impairment of such investments are recognised in the Income Statement in ‘Impairment charges for loans and other losses’ and removed from the ‘Available-for-sale reserve’.

After initial measurement, held-to-maturity financial investments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR, less provision for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in ‘Interest Income’ while the losses arising from impairment of such investments are recognised in ‘Impairment charges for loans and other losses’ in the Income Statement. A sale or reclassification of a more than insignificant amount of held-to-maturity investments would result in the reclassification of all held-to-maturity investments as available-for-sale, and would prevent the Group from classifying investment securities as held-tomaturity for the current and the following two financial years. However, sales and reclassifications in any of the following circumstances would not trigger a reclassification: zz sales or reclassifications that are so close to maturity that changes in the market rate of interest would not have a significant effect on the financial asset’s fair value; zz sales or reclassifications after the Group has collected substantially all of the asset’s original principal; and zz Sales or reclassifications that are attributable to non-recurring isolated events beyond the Group’s control that could not have been reasonably anticipated.

Investments in Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are investees controlled by the Group. The Group ‘controls’ an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group reassesses whether it has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. This includes circumstances in which protective rights held (e.g. those resulting from a lending relationship) become substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee. The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the consideration, including contingent consideration. The acquired identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the initial measurement the Bank continues to recognise the investments in Subsidiaries at cost. The Financial Statements of Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date when control ceases. The Financial Statements of all Subsidiaries in the Group have a common financial year which ends on December 31, except for the Serendib Finance Ltd., a licensed finance company, whose financial year ends on March 31. The Financial Statements of the Bank’s Subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. The reason for using a different Reporting date by the aforesaid subsidiary is due to the requirement imposed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for licensed finance companies to publish their key financial data and key performance indicators for a 12-month period ending March 31 and 6 month period ending September 30, every year, in accordance with a format prescribed by the Director of the Department of Supervision of Non-Bank Financial Institutions of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of Subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Parent (the Bank) in the form of cash dividend or repayment of loans and advances. All Subsidiaries of the Bank have been incorporated in Sri Lanka except Commex Sri Lanka S.R.L. which was incorporated in Italy and Commercial Bank of Maldives Private Limited which was incorporated in the Republic of Maldives. 260 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Holding Cost Market Value/ Cost Market Value/ Cost Market Value/ Cost Market Value/ Directors’ Directors’ Directors’ Directors’ Valuation Valuation Valuation Valuation % Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Local Subsidiaries: Quoted: Commercial Development Company PLC 93.85* – – – – 272,363 845,755 273,610 1,047,611 (11,261,717 Ordinary Shares) (@ Rs. 92.60) (@ Rs. 92.60) (11,313,290 Ordinary Shares (94.28 as at December 31, 2015) in 2015) Unquoted: ONEzero Company Ltd. 100 – – – – 5,000 5,000 5,000 5,000 (500,001 Ordinary Shares) (@ Rs. 10.00) (@ Rs. 10.00) (500,001 Ordinary Shares as at December 31, 2015) Unquoted: Serendib Finance Ltd. 100 – – – – 1,116,046 1,116,046 916,046 916,046 (21,600,000 Ordinary Shares) (21,600,000 Ordinary Shares as at December 31, 2015) Foreign Subsidiary: Unquoted: Commex – Sri Lanka S.R.L.

Accordingly, the Bank disposed 83,988 shares since November 2015 through the Colombo Stock Exchange and reduced the shareholding in the above Company to 93.85% by December 31, 2016 and is in the process of taking steps to dispose the required number of shares to adhere to the requirements of the Listing Rules. Consequent to the above disposal, ownership interests of the Bank has changed while retaining control. As per SLFRS 10 on ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’, changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the parent losing control are equity transactions and hence, the resulting gain/loss is recognised in equity. (**) During the year, Commex Sri Lanka S.R.L., a fully-owned subsidiary of the Bank, inaugurated its money transfer operation in Italy, following the grant of a Money Transfer License from the Bank of Italy. However, the Bank has made provisions for the expenses incurred on Account of Italy operations before finalising the Bank’s Financial Statements. (***) Commercial Bank of Maldives, a subsidiary of the Bank partnering with Treetop Investments Maldives, formally inaugurated banking operations in the Maldives on September 26, 2016.

Accordingly, the total amount provided for impairment as at December 31, 2016 is Rs.165.940 Mn. (2015 – Rs. 150.590 Mn.) 38. Investments in Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the variable returns through its power over the investee. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20% or more of the voting power of another entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost, in terms of Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 28 on ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’. The Group’s investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the income and expenses and equity movements of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the Accounting Policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. Accordingly, under the Equity Method, investments in Associates are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the Associates and are reported as a separate line item in the Statement of Financial Position. The Income Statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the Associates. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the Associate, the Group recognises its share of any 262 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements changes, when applicable, in Equity through OCI. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the Associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in Associate. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investments, is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. If the Associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equal the share of losses not recognised previously. The Group discontinues the use of the Equity Method from the date that it ceases to have significant influence over an Associate and accounts for such investments in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 39 on ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. Upon loss of significant influence over the Associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the Associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss. After application of the Equity Method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its Associate. At each Reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the Associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the Associate and its carrying value, and recognises the loss as ‘Share of profits of associates’ in the Income Statement.

Property, Plant & Equipment The Group applies the requirements of the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard LKAS 16 on ‘Property, Plant & Equipment’ in accounting for its owned assets (including buildings under operating leases where the Group is the lessor) which are held for and used in the provision of services, for rental to others or for administrative purposes and are expected to be used for more than one year. Basis of Recognition Property, Plant & Equipment is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and cost of the asset can be reliably measured. Basis of Measurement An item of Property, Plant & Equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset is initially measured at its cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent costs (excluding the costs of day-to-day servicing) as explained in Note below. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs. Purchased software which is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of Computer Equipment. When parts of an item of Property, Plant & Equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of Property, Plant & Equipment. zz Cost Model The Group applies the Cost Model to all Property, Plant & Equipment except freehold land and freehold & leasehold buildings. These are recorded at cost of purchase together with any incidental expenses thereon, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. zz Revaluation Model The Group applies the Revaluation Model for the entire class of freehold land and freehold & leasehold buildings for measurement after initial recognition. Such properties are carried at revalued amounts, being their fair value at the date of revaluation, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation on buildings and any accumulated impairment losses charged subsequent to the date of valuation. Freehold land and buildings of the Group are revalued by independent professional valuers every three years or more frequently if the fair values as are substantially different from carrying amounts to ensure that the carrying amounts do not differ from the fair values as at the Reporting date. On revaluation of an asset, any increase in the carrying amount is recognised in Revaluation Reserve in Equity through OCI or used to reverse a previous loss on revaluation of the same asset, which was charged to the Income Statement. In this circumstance, the increase is recognised as income only to the extent of the previous write down in value. Any decrease in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense in the Income Statement or charged to Revaluation Reserve in equity through OCI, only to the extent of any credit balance existing in the Revaluation Reserve in respect of that asset. Any balance remaining in the Revaluation Reserve in respect of an asset, is transferred directly to Retained Earnings on retirement or disposal of the asset. The Group revalued all its freehold land and freehold & leasehold buildings as at December 31, 2014. Methods and significant assumptions including unobservable market inputs employed in estimating the fair value together with the sensitivity of same are given in Note 39.5 (b) and Note 39.5 (c). Subsequent Cost Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it is probable that the future economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the Group. Ongoing repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Derecognition An item of Property, Plant & Equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset), is recognised in ‘Other Income (Net)’ in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised. When replacement costs are recognised in the carrying amount of an item of Property, Plant & Equipment, the remaining carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised as required by Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 16 on ‘Property, Plant & Equipment’. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 265 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Capital Work-in-Progress These are expenses of a capital nature directly incurred in the construction of buildings, major plant and machinery and system development, awaiting capitalisation. These are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Capital work-in-progress is transferred to the relevant asset when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management (i.e. available for use). 39.1 Group – 2016 Freehold Freehold Leasehold Computer Motor Office Capital Total Total Land Buildings Buildings Equipment Vehicles Equipment, Work-in2016 2015 Furniture & Progress Fixtures Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs.’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Cost/Valuation Balance as at January 01, 4,924,702 2,635,938 1,080,861 3,880,784 335,180 4,514,891 358,439 17,730,795 16,810,952 Additions/transfers during the year – 379,169 2,507 643,084 44,457 746,335 (314,482) 1,501,070 1,086,405 Disposals during the year (10,419) (905) – (275,233) (31,768) (72,080) – (390,405) (209,304) Exchange rate variance – – – 4,772 1,964 12,935 – 19,671 42,742 Adjustments – – – 11,666 – (11,666) – – – Balance as at December 31, 4,914,283 3,014,202 1,083,368 4,265,073 349,833 5,190,415 43,957 18,861,131 17,730,795 Accumulated Depreciation and Impairment Losses Balance as at January 01, – 91,285 62,296 2,973,701 217,350 3,204,730 – 6,549,362 5,676,091 Charge for the year [Refer Note 20] – 94,171 29,887 413,528 40,519 514,983 – 1,093,088 1,024,162 Disposals during the year – (42) – (271,541) (30,511) (66,538) – (368,632) (187,573) Exchange rate variance – – – 4,351 1,964 11,332 – 17,647 36,682 Transfers/adjustments – – – 1,207 – (1,207) – – – Balance as at December 31, – 185,414 92,183 3,121,246 229,322 3,663,300 – 7,291,465 6,549,362 Net book value as at December 31, 2016 4,914,283 2,828,788 991,185 1,143,827 120,511 1,527,115 43,957 11,569,666 Net book value as at December 31, 2015 4,924,702 2,544,653 1,018,565 907,083 117,830 1,310,161 358,439 11,181,433 266 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 39.2 Group – 2015 Freehold Freehold Leasehold Computer Motor Office Capital Total Total Land Buildings Buildings Equipment Vehicles Equipment, Work-in2015 2014 Furniture & Progress Fixtures Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs.’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Cost/Valuation Balance as at January 01, 4,883,273 2,549,352 992,126 3,518,719 327,762 4,131,515 408,205 16,810,952 14,449,047 Property, Plant & Equipment acquired on business combination – – – – – – – – 216,168 Additions/transfers during the year 41,429 153,299 22,022 441,459 41,428 436,534 (49,766) 1,086,405 1,072,322 Transfer of accumulated depreciation on assets revalued – – – – – – – – (243,872) Surplus on revaluation of property – – – – – – – – 1,812,757 Disposals during the year – – – (89,418) (38,262) (81,624) – (209,304) (491,897) Exchange rate variance – – – 10,024 4,252 28,466 – 42,742 (3,573) Adjustments – (66,713) 66,713 – – – – – – Balance as at December 31, 4,924,702 2,635,938 1,080,861 3,880,784 335,180 4,514,891 358,439 17,730,795 16,810,952 Accumulated Depreciation and Impairment Losses Balance as at January 01, – 608 34,369 2,719,287 205,193 2,716,634 – 5,676,091 5,273,822 Accumulated depreciation assumed on business combination – – – – – – – – 17,068 Charge for the year [Refer Note 20] – 90,677 27,927 334,108 41,274 530,176 – 1,024,162 1,087,175 Reversal of over provided depreciation – – – – – – – – (243,872) Disposals during the year – – – (88,532) (33,269) (65,772) – (187,573) (456,362) Exchange rate variance – – – 8,838 4,152 23,692 – 36,682 (1,740) Transfers/adjustments – – – – – – – – – Balance as at December 31, – 91,285 62,296 2,973,701 217,350 3,204,730 – 6,549,362 5,676,091 Net book value as at December 31, 2015 4,924,702 2,544,653 1,018,565 907,083 117,830 1,310,161 358,439 11,181,433 Net book value as at December 31, 2014 4,883,273 2,548,744 957,757 799,432 122,569 1,414,881 408,205 11,134,861 There were no capitalised borrowing cost related to the acquisition of Property, Plant & Equipment during the year 2016 (2015 – Nil).

Intangible Assets The Group’s intangible assets include the value of acquired goodwill and computer software. Basis of Recognition An intangible asset is recognised if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the entity and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably in accordance with the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 38 on ‘Intangible Assets’. Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, these assets are stated in the Statement of Financial Position at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Subsequent Expenditure Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Useful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment The useful economic lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Useful economic lives, amortisation and impairment of finite and indefinite intangible assets are described below: zz Intangible Assets with Finite Lives and Amortisation Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic lives. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each Reporting date. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates, which require prospective application. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is expensed as incurred. zz Goodwill Goodwill that arises on the acquisition of Subsidiaries is presented with intangible assets (Refer Note 40 on page 277). Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. zz Computer Software Software acquired by the Group is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Expenditure on internally developed software is recognised as an asset when the Group is able to demonstrate its intention and ability to complete the development and use the software in a manner that will generate future economic benefits, and can reliably measure the costs to complete the development. The capitalised costs of internally developed software include all costs directly attributable to developing the software and capitalised borrowing costs, and are amortised over its useful life. Internally developed software is stated at capitalised cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure on software assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed as incurred. zz Research and Development Costs Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an intangible asset when the Group can demonstrate: The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale. Its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset. The asset will generate future economic benefits. The availability of resources to complete the asset. The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during development. The ability to use the intangible asset generated. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 277 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. As at the Reporting date, the Group does not have development costs capitalised as an internally-generated intangible asset.

Contingent Liabilities and Commitments Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligations where the transfer of economic benefit is not probable or cannot be readily measured as defined in the Sri Lanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 37 on ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. To meet the financial needs of customers, the Bank enters into various irrevocable commitments and contingent liabilities. These consist of financial guarantees, letters of credit and other undrawn commitments to lend. Letters of credit and guarantees commit the Bank to make payments on behalf of customers in the event of a specific act, generally related to the import or export of goods. Guarantees and standby letters of credit carry a similar credit risk to loans. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but are disclosed unless its occurrence is remote. Operating lease commitments of the Group (as a lessor and as a lessee) form part of commitments and pending legal claims against the Group form part of contingencies. Even though, these obligations may not be recognised on the Statement of Financial Position, they do contain credit risk and are therefore part of the overall risk of the Bank as disclosed in Note 59.1 on page 305. In the normal course of business, the Bank makes various irrevocable commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities with legal recourse to its customers. Even though these obligations may not be recognised on the date of the Statement of Financial Position, they do contain credit risk and therefore form part of the overall risk profile of the Bank. 304 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Contingencies 365,862,605 365,874,611 365,853,920 365,874,611 Guarantees 33,267,170 31,504,779 33,258,485 31,504,779 Performance bonds 22,553,060 14,095,269 22,553,060 14,095,269 Documentary credits 36,222,394 30,161,623 36,222,394 30,161,623 Other contingencies [Refer Note 59.1] 273,819,981 290,112,940 273,819,981 290,112,940 Commitments 132,705,895 155,357,709 132,450,607 155,357,709 Undrawn commitments [Refer Note 59.2] 131,628,622 153,979,986 131,381,356 153,979,986 Capital commitments [Refer Note 59.3] 1,077,273 1,377,723 1,069,251 1,377,723 Total 498,568,500 521,232,320 498,304,527 521,232,320 59.1 Other Contingencies GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Forward exchange contracts: 70,646,854 77,647,330 70,646,854 77,647,330 Forward exchange sales 26,084,323 44,293,601 26,084,323 44,293,601 Forward exchange purchases 44,562,531 33,353,729 44,562,531 33,353,729 Interest Rate Swap agreements/Currency Swaps: 158,012,034 168,466,179 158,012,034 168,466,179 Interest rate swaps – – – – Currency swaps 158,012,034 168,466,179 158,012,034 168,466,179 Others: 45,161,093 43,999,431 45,161,093 43,999,431 Acceptances 25,281,037 25,708,732 25,281,037 25,708,732 Bills for collection 19,260,765 17,533,095 19,260,765 17,533,095 Stock of Travellers’ Cheques 616,341 586,893 616,341 586,893 Bullion on consignment 2,950 170,711 2,950 170,711 Subtotal 273,819,981 290,112,940 273,819,981 290,112,940 59.2 Undrawn Commitments GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 On direct advances 97,459,750 109,755,816 97,212,484 109,755,816 On indirect advances 34,168,872 44,224,170 34,168,872 44,224,170 Subtotal 131,628,622 153,979,986 131,381,356 153,979,986 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 305 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 59.3 Capital Commitments The Group has commitments for acquisition of Property, Plant & Equipment and intangible assets incidental to the ordinary course of business which have been approved by the Board of Directors, the details of which are as follows: GROUP BANK As at December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Commitments in relation to property, plant & equipment 647,677 964,469 647,677 964,469 Approved and contracted for 511,667 725,069 511,667 725,069 Approved but not contracted for 136,010 239,400 136,010 239,400 Commitments in relation to intangible assets 429,596 413,254 421,574 413,254 Approved and contracted for 429,596 413,254 421,574 413,254 Approved but not contracted for – – – – Subtotal 1,077,273 1,377,723 1,069,251 1,377,723 59.4 Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Subsidiaries and Associates 59.4 (a) Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Subsidiaries Contingent liabilities and commitments of the subsidiary, Commercial Bank of Maldives Private Limited have been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group while other subsidiaries of the Group do not have any contingencies or commitments as at the Reporting date. 59.4 (b) Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Associates The Associates of the Group do not have any contingencies as at the Reporting date. 60.

Set out below are the unresolved legal claims against the Bank as at December 31, 2016 for which, adjustments to the Financial Statements have not been made due to the uncertainty of its outcome.

Managing these risks is critical for the sustainability of the Bank and plays a pivotal role in all activities of the Bank. Risk Management function strives to identify potential risks in advance, analyse them and take precautionary steps to mitigate the impact of risk whilst optimising risk-adjusted returns within the risk appetite of the Bank. Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 321 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements Risk Management Framework The overall responsibility and oversight of the Risk Management Framework of the Bank is vested with the Board of Directors (BOD). The Board Integrated Risk Management Committee (BIRMC), a mandatory Subcommittee set up by the Board, in turn is entrusted with the development of the Bank’s Risk Management Policies and monitoring of due compliance of same through the Executive Integrated Risk Management Committee (EIRMC). The Risk Management Policies spell out the risk appetite of the Bank and have incorporated risk exposure limits and controls to monitor adherence to the limits in force. These Policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect the changing market conditions and the products and services offered. The Bank strives to inculcate a Risk Management Culture through continuous training, work ethics and standards. Refer Note 3 on pages 196 to 199 for more information on the Risk Management Framework of the Bank. Integrated Risk Management Department (IRMD) Business Units are the Risk Owners and have the primary responsibility for Risk Management. The IRMD acts as the second line of defence in managing the risk. The IRMD through Chief Risk Officer reports to the BIRMC thus ensuring its independence. Risk Measurement and Reporting The Bank uses robust risk measurement techniques based on the type of risk and industry best practices. The Bank also carries out Stress Testing which is a key aspect of the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and the Risk Management Framework and provides an insight on the impact of extreme, but plausible scenarios on the Bank’s risk profile. The results are reported to the EIRMC and to the BIRMC on a periodic basis. The Bank establishes policies, limits and thresholds within the risk appetite. These limits reflect the business strategy and market environment of the Bank as well as the level of risk that the Bank is willing to accept (risk appetite). The monitoring and control mechanism therefore, is based on risk appetite of the Bank. 69.1 Credit Risk The financial loss resulting from a borrower or counterparty to a financial instrument failing or delaying to meet its contractual obligations is referred to as credit risk. It arises principally from the loans and receivables to banks and other customers and investments in debt securities. In addition to the credit risk from direct funding exposure i.e., On-Balance Sheet exposure, indirect liabilities such as Letters of Credit, Guarantees etc. also would expose the Bank to credit risk. The Bank considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure (such as individual obligor default risk, country and sector concentration risks) to ensure stringent Credit Risk Management. 322 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 69.1.1 Credit Quality Analysis 69.1.1 (a) Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk by Risk Rating The table below sets out information about the maximum exposure to credit risk (including Off-Balance Sheet exposure) broken down by risk ratings and the related provision for impairment made by the Bank against those assets: As at December 31, Notes Loans and Receivables to Loans and Receivables Financial Investments Lending Commitments and Other Customers to Banks Contingencies 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Maximum Exposure to Credit Risk Carrying amount 31 36 616,018,228 508,115,127 624,458 601,106 277,816,593 269,625,007 – – Amount committed/contingencies 59 – – – – – – 497,235,276 519,854,597 At amortised Cost – Loans and receivables Government securities (Risk Free Investments) – – – – 40,076,392 44,925,168 – – Rating 0-4: Investment grade(*) 382,276,912 295,536,012 – – 11,747,634 12,799,201 – – Rating 5-6: Moderate risk 222,439,065 205,704,910 624,458 601,106 – – – – Rating S: High risk 1,696,932 2,937,274 – – – – – – Rating 7-9: Extreme risk 26,977,998 21,988,485 – – – – – – Gross carrying amount 633,390,907 526,166,681 624,458 601,106 51,824,026 57,724,369 – – Less: Provision for impairment (Individual and Collective) 17,372,679 18,051,554 – – – – – – Net carrying amount 32,33,36 616,018,228 508,115,127 624,458 601,106 51,824,026 57,724,369 – – Financial investments – Available-for-sale Government securities (Risk Free Investments) – – – – 159,573,316 193,938,549 – – Rating 0-4: Investment grade – – – – 450,155 486,880 – – Rating 5-6: Moderate risk – – – – – 9,818,860 – – Rating S: High risk – – – – – – – – Rating 7-9: Extreme risk – – – – – – – – Gross/net carrying amount 34 160,023,471 204,244,289 Financial investments – Held-to-maturity Government securities (Risk Free Investments) – – – – 50,980,717 – – – Rating 0-4: Investment grade – – – – – – – – Rating 5-6: Moderate risk – – – – 10,000,581 – – – Rating S : High risk – – – – – – – – Rating 7-9: Extreme risk – – – – – – – – Gross/net carrying amount 35 – – – – 60,981,298 – – – Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 323 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements As at December 31, Notes Loans and Receivables to Loans and Receivables Financial Investments Lending Commitments and Other Customers to Banks Contingencies 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Other financial instruments – Held-for-trading Government securities (Risk Free Investments) – – – – 3,505,335 3,943,697 – – Rating 0-4: Investment grade – – – – 293,809 326,263 – – Rating 5-6: Moderate risk – – – – 1,188,654 3,386,389 – – Rating S: High risk – – – – – – – – Rating 7-9: Extreme risk – – – – – – – – Gross/net carrying amount 31 – – – – 4,987,798 7,656,349 – – Total net carrying amount 616,018,228 508,115,127 624,458 601,106 277,816,593 269,625,007 – – Off-Balance Sheet(**) Maximum Exposure Lending commitments Grade 0-6: Investment grade to moderate risk – – – – – – 131,381,356 153,979,986 Contingencies Grade 0-6: Investment grade to moderate risk – – – – – – 365,853,920 365,874,611 Total exposure 59 – – – – – – 497,235,276 519,854,597 (*) Investment grade also includes Cash, Gold.

Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 325 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 69.1.1 (c) Credit Risk Exposure for Each Internal Credit Rating on Facilities and Probability of Historical Default Rates Through adoption of a robust risk grading system that falls in line with Basel requirements, the Bank maintains accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio in accordance with the established policy framework to ensure the quality of its credit portfolio. The risk grading framework consists of several ratings of risks to represent varying degrees of risks as an indicator for Lending Officers to evaluate the overall risk profile of counterpart and to arrive at an acceptable risk return trade-off.

Assets Obtained by taking the Possession of Collaterals Repossession of collaterals is resorted to in extreme situations where action is necessitated to recover the dues. The repossessed assets are disposed, in an orderly and transparent manner and the proceeds are used to reduce or recover the outstanding claims. The amount recovered in excess of the dues is refunded to the customer. 69.1.4 Concentrations of Credit Risk By setting various concentration limits under different criteria within the established risk appetite framework (i.e., single borrower/group, industry sectors, product, counterparty and country etc.), the Bank ensures that an acceptable level of risk diversification is maintained on an ongoing basis. These limits are continuously monitored and periodically reviewed by the Credit Policy Committee, the Executive Integrated Risk Management Committee and the Board Integrated Risk Management Committee to capture the developments in market, political and economic environment both locally and globally to strengthen the dynamic portfolio management practices and to provide an early warning on possible credit concentrations. 332 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of each item of financial assets in the Statement of Financial Position as at December 31, as per industry sector and by geographical region of financial assets is given below: 69.1.4 (a) Industry-wise Distribution As at Agriculture ManuTourism Transport Construction Traders New Financial Government Infrastructure Other Other Total December 31, and facturing Economy and Services Customers 2016 Fishing Business Services Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Financial Assets Cash and cash equivalents – – – – – – – 30,193,589 – – – – 30,193,589 Balances with Central Banks – – – – – – – – 43,873,205 – – – 43,873,205 Placements with banks – – – – – – – 11,718,499 – – – – 11,718,499 Securities purchased under resale agreements – – – – – – – – – – – – – Derivative financial assets – 86,050 – – – 180,305 – 757,311 – – 29,163 – 1,052,829 Other financial instruments – Held-for-trading – 115,386 8,269 – 8,487 30,707 28,912 77,933 4,693,989 24,115 – – 4,987,798 Government Securities – – – – – – – – 4,693,989 – – – 4,693,989 Quoted equity securities – 115,386 8,269 – 8,487 30,707 28,912 77,933 – 24,115 – – 293,809 Loans and receivables to banks – – – – – – – 624,458 – – – – 624,458 Loans and receivables to other customers 61,601,062 89,467,955 43,784,446 14,493,562 78,831,928 90,502,006 14,664,164 49,133,741 – 17,805,741 56,263,732 99,469,891 616,018,228 Loans & advances* 61,601,062 89,467,955 43,784,446 14,493,562 78,831,928 90,502,006 14,664,164 49,133,741 – 17,805,741 56,263,732 99,469,891 616,018,228 Financial investments – Available-for-sale – 14,427 – – – – – 435,728 159,573,316 – – – 160,023,471 Government Securities – – – – – – – – 159,573,316 – – – 159,573,316 Equity securities – Quoted shares – 14,427 – – – – – 232,121 – – – – 246,548 Equity securities – Unquoted shares – – – – – – – 47,147 – – – – 47,147 Investment in Unit trusts – – – – – – – 156,460 – – – – 156,460 Financial investments – Held-to-maturity – – – – – – – – 60,981,298 – – – 60,981,298 Government Securities – – – – – – – – 60,981,298 – – – 60,981,298 Financial investments – Loans and receivable – 2,584,717 – – – 998,155 – 7,927,595 40,076,392 – 237,167 – 51,824,026 Government Securities – – – – – – – – 40,076,392 – – – 40,076,392 Investment in Unit trusts – 2,584,717 – – – 998,155 – 7,927,595 – – 237,167 – 11,747,634 Total 61,601,062 92,268,535 43,792,715 14,493,562 78,840,415 91,711,173 14,693,076 100,868,854 309,198,200 17,829,856 56,530,062 99,469,891 981,297,401 (*) Loans and advances referred to above do not agree with the Note 33.1 (c) on page 247 due to impairment provision.

It has accounted for 76% (approximately) of total advances portfolio of the Bank (excluding Bangladesh operations) as at December 31, 2016. Although, Western Province is attracted with highest credit concentration, we believe that a sizable portion of these lending has been utilised to facilitate industries scattered around the country. For example, most of the large corporates which have islandwide operations are being accommodated by the Branches and Corporate Banking Division situated in the Western Province thereby reflecting a fairly diversified geographical concentration contrary to the figures given below: As at December 31, 2016 Country/Province Loans and Receivables by Product Overdrafts Trade Lease Credit Pawning Staff Housing Personal Long-Term Short-Term Bills of Total Finance Receivables Cards Loans Loans Loans Loans Loans Exchange Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Sri Lanka Central 10,661,557 178,668 1,942,902 323,715 52,966 – 2,787,403 1,374,071 16,327,523 953,154 30,441 34,632,400 Eastern 832,420 91,427 428,517 69,867 13,091 – 286,271 407,103 1,933,866 34,492 – 4,097,054 North Central 946,600 104,482 1,534,704 79,938 7,219 – 423,027 293,058 4,584,201 201,547 4,433 8,179,209 Northern 2,004,596 148 792,854 90,711 352,881 – 619,791 614,333 3,070,477 40,954 – 7,586,745 North Western 4,761,332 522,114 2,633,365 270,788 121,944 – 2,982,527 1,483,099 11,563,070 714,417 13,287 25,065,943 Sabaragamuwa 4,571,645 289,939 2,334,374 165,686 53,744 – 2,430,909 865,355 7,917,406 427,456 3,025 19,059,539 Southern 5,137,398 1,380,610 3,022,169 329,615 83,428 – 4,472,432 1,803,027 12,331,936 327,570 976 28,889,161 Uva 1,226,155 31,070 963,565 92,241 17,990 – 1,600,487 551,923 3,505,996 220,512 1,248 8,211,187 Western 64,168,727 38,940,278 21,660,085 4,646,051 532,526 7,144,946 30,661,911 17,701,287 201,515,731 43,616,020 3,571,804 434,159,366 Bangladesh 3,793,007 704,416 177,863 68,234 – 106,066 221,024 276,508 8,720,126 23,435,538 8,634,842 46,137,624 Total 98,103,437 42,243,152 35,490,398 6,136,846 1,235,789 7,251,012 46,485,782 25,369,764 271,470,332 69,971,660 12,260,056 616,018,228 As at December 31, 2015 Country/Province Loans and Receivables by Product Overdrafts Trade Lease Credit Pawning Staff Housing Personal Long-Term Short-Term Bills of Total Finance Receivables Cards Loans Loans Loans Loans Loans Exchange Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Sri Lanka Central 8,554,213 180,407 2,066,547 256,801 103,425 – 2,480,416 1,438,608 12,100,975 1,005,681 50,194 28,237,267 Eastern 671,967 27,151 479,533 59,211 35,273 – 228,346 435,810 1,490,021 28,071 1,599 3,456,982 North Central 691,180 71,533 1,384,839 68,702 8,779 – 355,277 281,563 2,948,036 199,250 2,901 6,012,060 Northern 1,709,859 47,798 735,285 73,501 486,231 – 536,945 557,278 2,504,367 29,811 967 6,682,042 North Western 3,531,249 406,243 2,579,974 220,765 192,368 – 2,756,994 1,414,967 9,546,347 558,536 3,212 21,210,655 Sabaragamuwa 3,222,608 139,125 1,912,235 121,407 78,159 – 1,961,883 882,740 5,437,548 255,548 8,833 14,020,086 Southern 4,071,013 1,328,383 3,062,705 238,144 126,180 – 3,961,944 1,958,579 10,612,183 213,666 21,603 25,594,400 Uva 828,363 2,409 998,925 75,521 31,476 – 1,359,779 481,967 3,049,962 145,196 7 6,973,605 Western 51,816,858 41,965,436 20,425,439 2,868,609 803,814 5,999,407 25,570,432 17,918,380 165,670,040 19,425,636 2,838,338 355,302,389 Bangladesh 3,943,380 911,569 176,685 57,608 – 100,426 170,182 279,043 5,861,989 20,825,415 8,299,344 40,625,641 Total 79,040,690 45,080,054 33,822,167 4,040,269 1,865,705 6,099,833 39,382,198 25,648,935 219,221,468 42,686,810 11,226,998 508,115,127 Please refer Note 33 on page 245 for the Gross carrying amount of the Loans and Advances.

The principal objective in liquidity risk management is to assess the need for funds to meet such obligations and to ensure the availability of adequate funding to fulfil those needs at the appropriate time, under both normal and stressed conditions. Therefore, the Bank continuously analyses and monitors its liquidity profile, maintains adequate levels of high quality liquid assets, ensures access to diverse funding sources and has contingency funding agreements with peer banks to meet any unforeseen liquidity requirements. Exposures and ratios against tolerance limits as well as stressed scenarios are regularly monitored in order to identify the Bank’s liquidity position and potential funding requirements. Assets and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) ALCO chaired by the Managing Director, has representatives from Treasury, Corporate Banking, Personal Banking, Risk and Finance Departments.

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Bank’s Income Statement as at the Reporting date to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant. Sensitivity of Projected Net Interest Income 2016 2015 Net Interest Income (NII) Parallel Increase Parallel Decrease Parallel Increase Parallel Decrease Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 As at December 31, 670,859 (668,620) 363,173 (362,303) Average for the period 634,306 (632,375) 336,601 (335,541) Maximum for the period 827,488 (824,962) 469,161 (468,336) Minimum for the period 366,432 (365,569) 267,117 (266,063) The graph below depicts the impact on the Net Interest Income due to a Rate shock of 100 bps on Rupee denominated Assets and Liabilities and 25 bps on FCY denominated Assets and Liabilities. The impact of changes in interest rates on NII is measured using a static Balance Sheet which is subjected to 100 bps and 25 bps shocks on Rupee and foreign currency denominated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities portfolios, respectively. Thereafter, the potential impact on the Bank’s profitability due to changes in Rupee and foreign currency interest rates is evaluated to ensure that the volatilities are prudently managed within the internal tolerance limits. Above graph depicts the sensitivity of NII to rate shocks during the years 2015 and 2016. Right throughout 2016, the impact of rate shocks on projected NII has been well below the Management Action Trigger (MAT) limit. Since December, 2015 the impact has gradually decreased due to the conscious decision of the Bank to rebalance the Fixed Income Securities (FIS) portfolio, growth in short term repricing portfolio and the Bank’s decision to increase the shock level for foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities to 25 bps from 10 bps. 348 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 69.3.3 Exposure to Currency Risk – Non-Trading Portfolio Currency Risk arises as a result of fluctuations in the value of a financial instrument due to changes in foreign exchange rates. There are set limits on position by currency and these positions are monitored on a daily basis. The table below indicates the currencies to which the Bank had significant exposures as at December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the exposure as a percentage of the total capital funds: Foreign Exchange Position as at December 31, 2016 Currency Spot Forward Net Open Net Position Overall Overall Position in Other Exposure in Exposure Exchange Respective in LKR Contracts Foreign Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net Currency 2 3 4=2-3 5 6 7=5-6 8 9 10 11 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 United States Dollar 34,367 42,279 (7,912) 20,447 11,005 9,442 3,179 4,709 705,226 Great Britain Pound 3,524 7,832 (4,308) 5,072 807 4,265 45 3 467 Euro 5,216 5,384 (168) 420 300 120 66 17 2,703 Japanese Yen 15,549 2,271 13,278 5,847 18,937 (13,090) (150) 38 49 Indian Rupee – – – – – – – – – Australian Dollar 180 71 109 – 100 (100) (40) (30) (3,284) Canadian Dollar 97 74 23 – – – (1) 23 2,538 Other currencies in US Dollars 914 340 574 – 509 (509) 95 160 23,948 Total exposure US $ 3,367 US $ 4,886 731,647 Total capital funds as per the Audited Basel ll computation (capital base of the Bank as at December 31, 2016) 103,373,535 Total exposure as a percentage of total capital funds 0.71% Foreign Exchange Position as at December 31, 2015 Currency Spot Forward Net Open Net Position Overall Overall Position in Other Exposure in Exposure Exchange Respective in LKR Contracts Foreign Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net Currency 2 3 4=2-3 5 6 7=5-6 8 9 10 11 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 ’000 United States Dollar 27,147 27,207 (60) 15,410 14,568 842 1,096 1,877 270,602 Great Britain Pound 191 183 8 60 100 (40) 46 15 3,171 Euro 2,751 753 1,998 172 2,143 (1,971) (58) (31) (4,886) Japanese Yen 16,056 12,095 3,961 12,040 9,734 2,306 (420) 5,848 6,999 Indian Rupee – – – – – – – – – Australian Dollar 503 569 (66) 1,350 1,250 100 (33) 1 86 Canadian Dollar 354 347 7 – – – – 7 716 Other currencies in US Dollars 363 144 219 168 99 69 44 333 47,951 Total exposure US $ 1,117 US $ 2,252 324,639 Total capital funds as per the latest Audited Financial Statements (capital base of the Bank as at December 31, 2015) 79,687,972 Total exposure as a percentage of total capital funds as per the Audited Financial Statements 0.41% Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 349 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank regularly conducts sensitivity analysis on Net Open Position (NOP) due to possible changes in the USD/LKR exchange rate to assess the exposure to FX Risk. An appropriate shock based on historical USD/LKR exchange rate is applied on the NOP which is measured against the Board approved threshold limits. 69.3.4 Exposure to Equity Price Risk Impact on Income Statement due to a change in market price by 10% on equity shares held by the Bank. Equity price risk arises as a result of any change in prices and volatilities of individual equities. The Bank conducts mark-to-market calculations on a daily, quarterly and on a need basis to identify the impact due to changes in equity prices. The table below summarises impact (both to the Income Statement and to the equity) due to a shock of 10% on equity price. 2016 2015 Held-for-Trading Available-for-Sale Total Held-for-Trading Available-for-Sale Total Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Market value of equity securities as at December 31, 293,809 246,548 540,357 326,263 234,839 561,102 Stress Level Impact on P&L Impact on OCI Impact on Equity Impact on P&L Impact on OCI Impact on Equity Shock of 10% on equity price (upward) 29,381 24,655 54,036 32,626 23,484 56,110 Shock of 10% on equity price (downward) (29,381) (24,655) (54,036) (32,626) (23,484) (56,110) 69.4 Operational Risk Operational risk arises due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk events which include legal and regulatory implications could lead to financial and reputational losses to the Bank. The Operational Risk Management Framework of the Bank has been defined under the Board approved Operational Risk Management Policy. Operational risk is managed by establishing an appropriate internal control system that requires a mechanism for segregation of related responsibilities within the Bank, and a detailed testing and verification of the Bank’s overall operational systems, and achieving a full harmony between internal and external systems and establishing a fully independent back-up facility for Business Continuity Planning. 350 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements 69.5 Capital Management Objective The Bank is required to manage its capital taking into account the need to meet the regulatory requirements as well as the current and future business needs, stakeholder expectations and available options for raising capital. 69.5.1 Regulatory Capital Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is calculated based on the CBSL Directions stemming from Basel II Accord. These guidelines require the Bank to maintain a CAR of not less than 5% with core capital (Tier 1) in relation to total risk weighted assets and a minimum overall CAR of 10% with Tier I and Tier II (Supplementary Capital) in relation to total risk weighted assets. As at December 31, 2016 2015 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Tier I: Core Capital Paid-up ordinary shares/Common stock/Assigned capital++ 24,978,002 23,254,605 Statutory reserve fund 5,647,890 4,922,265 Published retained profits/(accumulated losses)(+/-) 1,538,142 1,582,894 General and other reserves 44,749,627 36,007,573 Minority interests (consistent with the above capital constituents) – – Tier I: Deductions/Adjustments Goodwill – – Other intangible assets (640,646) (465,962) Advances granted to employees of the Bank for the purchase of shares of the Bank (ESOP) (302) (499) 50% of Investments in unconsolidated banking and financial subsidiary companies (1,065,444) (458,023) 50% Investments in the capital of other banks and financial institutions (402) (402) Total Eligible Core Capital (Tier I Capital) 75,206,867 64,842,451 Tier II: Supplementary Capital Revaluation reserves (as approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka) 2,034,231 2,034,231 General provisions 2,863,408 2,351,948 Approved subordinated term debt 24,334,875 10,917,767 Tier II: Deductions/Adjustments 50% of investments in unconsolidated banking and financial subsidiary companies (1,065,444) (458,023) 50% investments in the capital of other banks and financial institutions (402) (402) Total eligible supplementary capital (Tier II Capital) 28,166,668 14,845,521 Total capital base 103,373,535 79,687,972 Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC Annual Report 2016 351 Financial Reports Notes to the Financial Statements The Bank’s regulator, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka sets and monitors capital requirements for the Banking industry as a whole. Historically, the Bank has been maintaining a relatively higher CAR, which shows the stability and resilience of the Bank. Higher level of capital maintained by the Bank too contributed to the growth of the Bank. The Bank has a well structured Corporate Planning and Budgeting procedure and therefore Capital budgeting decisions are arrived at after evaluating the impact of such decisions on the income of the Bank. 69.5.2 Capital Allocation Management monitors the capital adequacy ratio on a regular basis and ensures that it operates well above the internal limit set by the Bank. The allocation of capital between specific operations and activities, to a large extent, is driven by optimisation of the return achieved on the capital allocated. The amount of capital allocated to each operation or activity is based primarily on regulatory capital requirements, but in some cases the regulatory requirements do not fully reflect the varying degree of risk associated with different activities. In such cases, the capital requirements may be flexed to reflect differing risk profiles, subject to the overall level of capital to support a particular operation or activity not falling below the minimum requirements for regulatory purposes. 70. Events After the Reporting Period No circumstances have arisen since the Reporting date which would require adjustments or disclosure in the Financial Statements other than those disclosed below. 70.1 Interim Dividend – 2016 The Bank declared and paid a second interim dividend of Rs. 3.00 per share on February 17, 2017 to both the voting and non-voting ordinary shareholders of the Bank.
