Economic performance Message from the General Director 2016 has been a year of great complexity in which Petróleos Mexicanos faced important challenges, but also brought opportunities to keep strengthening Pemex and consolidate it as a major player in the global oil and gas industry. We are taking advantage of all the new tools provided by the Energy Reform with a focus on profitability, without forgetting that, as a state-owned company, we have the mandate to maximize the resources for the development of the country. In 2016, we achieved the first of many partnerships that will consolidate Pemex as one of the major oil companies. Together with the Australian company BHP Billiton, we won the first farm out contract of Pemex’s history, the Trion block, which will be explored and developed in the “Cinturón Plegado de Perdido”, located in ultra-deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Furthermore, with the American company Chevron and the Japanese company Inpex, we jointly won the tender of the National Hydrocarbons Commission to explore the Block 3 North in deepwaters. In terms of industrial safety, we obtained the lowest accident frequency rate in the history of the company, registering 0.36 injuries per million man hours. This rate represents a 64% decrease in the incidence of disabling accidents and fatalities since Pemex-SSPA System was implanted as a best We are taking advantage of all practice. The operational discipline and effective operation the new tools provided by the of our systems enabled us to reduce personal accidents by 29% during 2016 and to achieve a significant improvement Energy Reform with a focus on in occupational health, reducing by 69% the descent due to profitability, without forgetting diseases of workers at drilling offshore platforms. that, as a state-owned company, To reach our goal of Zero Accidents we keep on working we have the mandate to maximize on the continuous improvement of our Safety, Health, and the resources for the development Environmental Protection Policy, as well as on the training of of the country. our colleagues, with the aim of moving towards cleaner and safer operations. Sustainability Report 2016 3 Regarding the promotion of social development in regions where we have a strong presence, during 2016 we invested 187 million pesos in our Support to the Community and the Environment Programs (PACMA), through which we promote actions with a direct impact on the quality of life of families. Some examples are the Mobile Medical Unit, the rehabilitation of schools and the development of infrastructure works for the benefit of oil communities. For almost 20 years, Pemex has supported, promoted and developed high impact environmental conservation projects. We do so because we are convinced that companies in the energy sector have an ethical and moral commitment to the conservation of our ecosystems. In 2016, we wanted to go a step further, thus we started working on the creation of the JATUSA Ecological Corridor, a project that will make us the first company in devoting such a large area for conservation purposes, which will enable the advancement of the interconnection of natural or modified spaces, ecosystems and habitats in order to facilitate conservation of biological diversity and the continuity of ecological processes. To further strengthen this project, we included it within our new Business Plan, ensuring thus the vision of perdurability that we want to print on it. Regarding our environmental liability, and despite the company’s efforts to clean up impacted areas contaminated with hydrocarbons, fuel theft continued to have a significant impact on ecosystems and affected the assets of Pemex and the country, jeopardizing the safety of communities living close to our pipelines. To fight this crime, a new strategy is already being implemented as part of an inter-institutional effort involving Petróleos Mexicanos, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP, by its acronym in Spanish), the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR, by its acronym in Spanish), the Federal Police, the Federal Attorney’s Office of Consumer (Profeco, by its acronym in Spanish), as well as state and municipal police departments. Finally, in financial matters, our total sales revenue amounted to $ 1’079,546 million pesos and we contributed to the public finances with the payment of taxes, rights and exploitations for $264,521 million pesos. Towards the end of the year, we made the presentation of our 2017-2021 Business Plan, an instrument that promotes the creation of partnerships throughout Pemex’s value chain, as a mechanism to increase the profitability of our investments. The Plan contains the actions to be taken in order to replace the natural decline of our most important fields, as well as to efficiently operate the refineries and eliminate losses in the National Refining System by 2021. The future imposes a scenario of important challenges but also opportunities for the modernization and transformation of the company. Our confidence in the talent and work of our employees allows us to look towards the future with optimism. Based upon basic principles of a clean, safe and sustainable operation, Pemex will continue occupying one of the most relevant positions in the international scope and will continue being the most emblematic company of Mexico. José Antonio González Anaya Pemex General Director Sustainability Report 2016 4 Guiding principles of the report ABOUT THIS REPORT The Sustainability Report of Petróleos Mexicanos 2016 presents the most significant economic, social and environmental results of the fiscal year 2016 and the results of Pemex Corporativo (Pemex Corporate) and its Subsidiary Productive Companies (EPS, by its acronym in Spanish), being these: Pemex Exploración y Producción (Pemex Exploration and Production), Pemex Perforación y Servicios (Pemex Drilling and Services), Pemex Transformación Industrial (Pemex Industrial Transformation), Pemex Logística (Pemex Logistics), Pemex Etileno (Pemex Ethylene) and Pemex Fertilizantes (Pemex Fertilizers).

The methodology for the analysis of materiality consists of: Identiﬁcation: Relevant issues through interviews with key areas, analysis of public opinion and perception of relationship groups were visualized. Prioritization: Issues were weighted and prioritized according to the relevance to the sustainability of the business in the long term. Validation: The contents were subject of evaluation by different areas to select the approaches and indicators to be included in the report. Sustainability Report 2016 5 MAIN IMPACTS The activities of the oil and gas industry impact on social, economic and environmental spheres of our environment; this is why Pemex develops preventive actions in order to mitigate negative impacts and maximize the benefits that its operation entails for society. In economic matters, we have the obligation to generate value and contribute to guarantee the availability of energy that the country requires for its development. With regard to our environmental management, we focus our performance on: (i) reducing the emissions we generate to the atmosphere, (ii) using water efficiently, (iii) minimizing waste generation, (iv) ensuring adequate treatment and final disposal, as well as (v) taking care of our ecosystems by implementing biodiversity conservation measures and improving the energy performance of our facilities. Finally, in social matters, we aim to mitigate the impacts of our operations in the communities located near our facilities and generate social management plans, inclusive social development programs, productive projects, as well as to establish a continuous communication to maintain harmonious and lasting relationships with communities. SUSTAINABILITY AT PETRÓLEOS MEXICANOS The 2017-2021 Business Plan is the guiding document of our operations and it includes the following sustainability goals: • Reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions by 25% by 2021. This is based on several actions such as: o Boost cogeneration projects in various process centers. o Reduction of gas burning in assets located in shallow water by rehabilitating compression modules. o Energy consumption optimization in refineries. • Increase water reuse by more than 60% by 2021. • Integration of the Ecological Corridor “JATUSA” (around 2,500 hectares): Jaguaroundi and Tuzandepetl parks, as well as the Swamp of Santa Alejandrina. • Strengthening of our ecosystem restoration, management and conservation programs in the Centla swamps and critical areas of Tabasco. Sustainability Report 2016 6 Furthermore, our company has implemented transversal strategies in the areas of environmental protection, social investment and industrial safety and health, which are fundamental tools for moving towards an increasingly sustainable operation. STAKEHOLDERS We identify stakeholders as individuals or groups of individuals that have a direct relationship with the company in the economic, social and/or environmental spheres. They are players with whom we build relationships that can influence or be influenced by our operations or activities. In order to strengthen the link with our communities and social and political actors, under a decentralized scheme, the needs of stakeholders are met on four representative areas: • Northern Region. • Gulf Region. • Central Region. • South Eastern Region. This areas group the federal states in which Pemex is present, allowing direct promotion of programs of linkage with some of the stakeholders. The main stakeholders of the company are located in 12 states which, due to the intensive oil activity, represent a priority for Petróleos Mexicanos, these are Campeche, Coahuila, Chiapas, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Nuevo Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Tabasco, Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Pemex encourages supplier and contractor outreach through a section of our web portal exclusive for them. This includes information on procurement procedures, supplier relationships and procurement strategies (http://www.pemex.com/en/procurement/ supplier_relationships/Paginas/default.aspx). The company also maintains communication with its employees through institutional instruments such as the intranet, the Orgullo Petrolero magazine, Pemex TV, emails and posters, among other communication channels. Similarly, the periodic review of the collective labor agreement is another opportunity to strengthen communication between workers and senior management positions. In order to maintain a fluid communication with public opinion, Pemex constantly issues news bulletins about topics of interest of our company, and our officials participate in public events and media to disseminate information of interest to our stakeholders. Finally, the company interacts with authorities and regulators by means of various institutional mechanisms through which it informs about its operation.

This agency of the Federal Public Administration has the mission of “Managing federal and state real estate assets by optimizing their use, as well as by providing control services to the Federal Public Administration, supporting the rationalization of public spending.” On the other hand, when the compensation to an individual origins from damages directly linked to the operation of the company, compensation negotiations are carried out through the Office of Responsibility and Social Development, in direct contact with the affected person or people, and representatives from the social and/or legal departments. PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE Pemex applies the precautionary principle as a result of being a risk-intensive and capital-intensive industry, with a significant influence on the country’s economy and a close relationship with various social and environmental actors. Compliance with this principle is supported by the legal and fiscal regulation that provides guidance on the company’s operations about the various provisions and regulations issued by the regulatory agents of the sector; but also, by multiple actions and mechanisms implemented by the company itself, such as managing the various risks it faces (financial, environmental and safety risks, among others matters). CONTEXT OF PETRÓLEOS MEXICANOS Petróleos Mexicanos is a State Productive Company, owned exclusively by the Federal Government, with legal personality, own equity, and technical, operative and management autonomy, so it does not have social capital and therefore has no shareholders. Pemex is the largest company in the country, one of the largest in Latin America and the largest contributor to federal public finances. Pemex is a company that develops the entire production chain of the oil and gas industry (exploration, production, industrial transformation, logistics and commercialization). Pemex produces daily around two million barrels of oil and more than 5.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. In terms of industrial transformation, it accounts for six refineries, five petrochemical complexes and nine gas processing complexes, which produce petroleum products for different economic and industrial sectors. The company has 89 land and sea terminals, as well as pipelines, ships, and ground transportation vehicles.

Sustainability Report 2016 13 Climate Change At Pemex, we recognize the importance of an active and coordinated cooperation and participation of the oil and gas sector, with the purpose of meeting the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase by 2° C, agreed at the Conference of the Parties (COP21) in December, 2015. We join the multilateral agreements to which Mexico adheres and collaborate with the Federal Government to update, strengthen and standardize the sector’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory, as well as to define the industry’s role in the fulfillment of climate change national commitments. STRATEGY The increase in the share of renewable sources in the country’s energy mix plays a fundamental role in the transition towards lower carbon footprint schemes. However, hydrocarbons will continue to be the main source of energy in the coming decades, thus it is a priority to favor the transition towards cleaner fuels such as natural gas, more efficient use of natural resources and the use of new technologies that meet the growing demand for energy and, at the same time, address the challenges of climate change. In 2016, Pemex concluded its 2016-2020 Environmental Strategy, consolidating in a single instrument the identification of the main guidelines and action lines to be developed for the achievement of strategic objectives and environmental goals. This strategy proposes to advance in fighting climate change through the identification of projects, technologies and use of financial instruments. The strategy considers the following aspects: • Recognizing the need for cooperation and coordinated response to achieve Mexico’s goals and commitments. • Consolidating Pemex’s participation in alliances and initiatives at a global and industry level to boost mitigation of climate change. Sustainability Report 2016 14 • Management of regulatory instruments. • Mitigation measures focused on energy efficiency, gas flaring reduction, transition to lower carbon footprint fuels, and carbon capture and storage associated with enhanced Goal included in oil recovery (CCS/EOR). the Business Plan 2017-2021 15 MITIGATION GOAL Adding up to the inherent demands of climate change, Pemex established –for the first time– a GHG reduction goal in its 2017-2021 Business Plan. This reduction target was set MMtCO2-eq at 25% of the CO2-eq emissions that were generated during 2016, to be accomplished by 2021. This corresponds to a reduction of around 15 million tons of CO2-eq. PERFORMANCE Pemex’s main GHG emissions are generated by carbon dioxide from thermal systems (between 70% and 75%); in which, by burning fossil fuels, heat energy is generated to provide current heating, production of steam or motive power to roll mechanical equipment and generate electricity. GHG emissions are also generated from flaring and venting of gas and CO2. In 2016, the company achieved a 3% decrease in GHG emissions, as compared to 2010. This consolidates the downward trend initiated in 2008, despite the levels recorded in recent years. According to the GHG direct emission inventory, 43.3 million tons of CO2 or about 58 million tons of CO2-eq were emitted in 2016. -3% GHG emissions as compared to 2010 While Pemex Industrial Transformation, Pemex Ethylene, Pemex Logistics, Pemex Fertilizers and Pemex Corporate emissions decreased, Pemex Exploration and Production emissions increased by 23.15%. This was largely due to an operational contingency at the Abkatun-A platform and the subsequent changes in the shallow water gas management strategy, which led to increase by 11% the company’s CO2-eq emissions from 2015 to 2016. It is expected that actions aimed at reversing this situation will start presenting a favorable impact on PEP’s emissions in the first half of 2017. COORDINATED COOPERATION AND RESPONSE TO THE COUNTRY´S GOALS The Special Climate Change Program (PECC, by its acronym in Spanish) is the climate policy instrument that tracks the country’s mitigation and adaptation measures. In the context of this program, Pemex develops the following actions: • Implementing operational GHG emission reduction projects through energy efficiency, operational efficiency, flare reduction and gas use. Sustainability Report 2016 15 • Designing a pilot project for enhanced oil recovery with CO2 injection at the Cinco Presidentes field. • Estimating, monitoring and mitigating the emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (mainly black carbon). • Encouraging the implementation of GHG Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) to reduce gas flaring, fugitive emissions and gas venting in transportation and production processes. • Developing climate change adaptation plans and actions for strategic infrastructure. The emission reduction goal established by 2018 in the PECC, accounts for 5 million tons of CO2-eq, as long as the investments portfolio to reduce GHG emissions and energy savings does not present significant changes in their investment amounts. In support to the actions led by the Federal Government and in coordination with the Ministry of Energy, Pemex updates on a semiannual basis the mitigation and adaptation goals agreed in the PECC 2015-2018 for the oil and gas sector in Mexico. GLOBAL AND SECTOR ALLIANCES AND INITIATIVES TO BOOST CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION Global Methane Initiative, GMI The GMI is a public-private initiative that promotes cost-effective methane reduction and recovery projects, as well as their use as a clean energy source. Since 2005, Pemex has cochaired the GMI Sub-Committee on Oil and Gas. Sustainability Report 2016 16 The collaboration with GMI has provided valuable information for the identification, measurement, technical-economic analysis and proposal of solutions for the reduction of methane emissions in Pemex facilities. The transfer of experiences and collective effort revitalize actions with the purpose of identifying cost-effective mitigation opportunities, increasing energy security, and improving air quality and worker safety. Climate and Clean Air Coalition, CCAC Recognizing the benefits of coordinated collaboration, Pemex is also a member of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and participates in the work group of the Oil and Gas Initiative. The Coalition is a complementary effort to the GMI coordinated by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). This global effort aims to improve air quality and protect climate by focusing on reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (methane and black carbon). The Coalition acts as a catalyst to create, implement, and share immediate and short-term solutions to combat climate change and improve the quality of life for societies. In 2016, with the support of a CCAC advisor, a survey was conducted at three of the Pemex Implementation Plan’s strategic facilities, considering the following nine key sources established by the coalition: (i) centrifugal compressors with “wet” (oil) seals, (ii) reciprocating compressors rod seal/packing vents, (iii) natural gas-driven pneumatic controller and pumps, (iv) glycol dehydrators, (v) unstabilized hydrocarbon liquid storage tanks, (vi) fugitive component and equipment leaks, (vii) well venting for liquids unloading, (viii) casinghead gas venting, and (ix) well venting/flaring during well completion for hydraulically fractured gas . Results from the survey demonstrate that assessed facilities are managed under high quality standards. According to the coalition criteria, the key sources located at the Dos Bocas maritime terminal, which handles offshore production, were considered as mitigated when complying with international best practices. At the Atasta gas processing and transport center, the results were similar. In the Cactus CPG, which processes around half of the company’s sour wet gas, all centrifugal and reciprocating compressors comply with international best practices on GHG emissions control. Environmental and Climate Change, Canada (ECCC) Assistance The Government of Canada, through the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) assistance program, has been a strategic ally of Pemex. Through this cooperation, it has been possible to develop a program to drive verifiable methane reductions at oil and gas facilities by transferring technical expertise and providing technical support with the Sustainability Report 2016 17 purpose of identifying cost-effective reduction opportunities, evaluating control options, and implementing solutions. During 2016, the work that began with the ECCC assistance program consisted on the development of the 2017-2021 work plan, with the purpose of promoting, financing and large-scale co-investing considering the following priorities: • Reducing flaring, venting and fugitive emissions from oil and gas operations • Promoting the development of clean technologies • Supporting finance for emissions mitigation • Supporting and piloting an innovative and robust program to monitor, report and verify emissions. These actions will be promoted from the resources that the ECCC will provide for the period 2017-2021, an amount of about 7 million Canadian dollars. Thanks to the collaboration between Pemex, ECCC and the CCAC, Mexico is the most advanced country in the jurisdiction of the coalition by having identified potentially costeffective opportunities to reduce black carbon emissions. The development of at least one business case per year is expected to be presented to potential investors for its execution. Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) OGCI represents the effort and commitment of ten international oil companies, which account for 20% of the world’s oil and gas production, committed to reduce their emissions in 20% in the following 10 years. The initiative focuses on four priority areas: 1) Reducing methane emissions. 2) Accelerating the development of carbon capture, use and storage. 3) Improving energy efficiency. 4) Contributing to transportation efficiency. MITIGACIÓN Key achievements in climate change mitigation include the following: • Starting external cogeneration in the Salamanca refinery under a pilot contract that will enable the reduction of up to 250,000 tones CO2-eq per year. • Finalizing infrastructure improvements to supply natural gas to the Antonio Dovali Jaime refinery in Salina Cruz. This will enable fuel switching from fuel oil to natural gas Sustainability Report 2016 18 with a potential mitigation of 350,000 tones CO2-eq per year, in addition to significant reductions in SOx and soot emissions. • The “Heat Recovery at the Terminal Maritima Dos Bocas”, project registered as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 2016, a new project registered as CDM (“Destruction of Nitrous Oxide in Lazaro Cardenas”) was added to the company’s portfolio with the 3,600 purchase of the Fertinal’s Nitric Acid facility, which, in despite of being at the end of its crediting period, is still mitigating its emissions. Roadmap for Gas Use million dollars to meet the goal In 2016, a roadmap was designed to achieve a 98% ratio of gas use in the following three of 98% gas use years, thanks to different projects that will be implemented in shallow waters. During this period, based on various actions considered in the Strategic Gas Use Plan 2016-2019 presented to the National Hydrocarbons Commission, Pemex will meet the established target. To this end, an investment of $ 3,600 million USD will be allocated, mainly in the Ku Maloob Zaap field, for the operation of a gas pipeline, two compression platforms and associated pipelines. The goal is to incorporate about 160 million cubic feet per day of gas and its byproducts to the petrochemical plants in the southeast region of the country. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Roadmap related to Enhanced Oil Recovery Carbon storage related to enhanced oil recovery enables us to return to the underground the extracted carbon, mitigating climate change, as well as improving the recovery rates of oil in mature or declining fields. One of the main constraints for carbon capture and storage has been the lack of cost-effective projects that allow a greater use of this technology. Pemex is aiming to generate the capacities and synergies to implement projects of this type and collaborates with the Federal Government in the implementation of the CCUS Technological Roadmap. To date, we have performed the design and laboratory tests of a demonstrative pilot project in the Activo de Produccion Cinco Presidentes, using the CO2 emitted by the Cosoleacaque ammonia plants. With the support of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, two feasibility studies on CCUS were developed and a third was started. The feasibility studies developed enabled (i) the analysis of the carbon capture potential in the facilities located at the Minatitlan and Coatzacoalcos area, (ii) the carbon capture at the Cosoleacaque ammonia reformer plants, (iii) the estimation of CO2 capture potential of Brillante field, (iv) the monitoring, reporting and accounting of emission reductions for eventual verification, (v) the abandonment and shutdown procedures of wells and the corrosion management. Sustainability Report 2016 19 ADAPTATION Petróleos Mexicanos incorporated climate change adaptation criteria into the Institutional Project Development System and continues to promote environmental conservation projects. The last, with the aim of establishing natural barriers against meteorological phenomena and strengthening the resilience of the areas surrounding our facilities. Example of this is the basin management strategy we have adopted over the last few years, and in which we can highlight the support to conservation projects in The Lacandon Jungle, Los Tuxtlas and Centla´s Swamps, as well as the promotion of the JATUSA Ecological Corridor in Coatzacoalcos. These projects enable us, among other aspects, to increase the areas of carbon sinks, increase rainwater harvesting, preserve environmental services, maintain water table levels, reduce the sediment in rivers and regulate flood. Sustainability Report 2016 20 Environmental Performance Indicators Nowadays, setting strategies and action plans for environmental protection is not only an ethical imperative for oil and gas companies, but also a matter of business. If more solid plans and programs to minimize the impacts of our operations in the environment are available, we will ensure legislation compliance, avoid fines and sanctions, and build better relationships with the communities. A responsible environmental operation enables the preservation of the environmental services required in our processes, as well as the mitigation of negative impacts caused by climate change on our facilities. Thus, Petróleos Mexicanos has an environmental protection plan comprising action lines on air emissions, efficient use of water, wastewater discharges, waste management, petroleum-impacted sites remediation, biodiversity conservation and ecological management of the territory. For many years, Pemex has been committed to the protection and conservation of our country’s natural wealth. Over time, we have supported various social initiatives in the Centla Swamps, the Lacandon Jungle, and the Natural Protected Areas in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as in the mangroves and lowland rainforests in the state of Veracruz. We have also offered our ecological park Jaguaroundi in Coatzacoalcos to serve environmental research and education purposes. This park holds 960 hectares of jungle, grassland, and holm-oak wood, as well as 57 hectares of water bodies, in the middle of the Cangrejera, Pajaritos and Morelos petrochemical complexes. The park holds more than 548 species of plants, 205 species of birds, 65 species of mammals, 214 species of butterflies, 29 species of amphibians, 45 species of reptiles, 22 species of fish and 655 species of invertebrates. Sustainability Report 2016 21 Now we want to take a step forward in the conservation of our ecosystems through the development of the JATUSA Ecological Corridor. This project aims to establish a corridor for the rainforest and wetlands environmental conservation that will help control floods in the region, serving as containment area around industrial facilities with the purpose of ensuring the safety of the communities in case of contingency, preserving environmental services and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on industry at the service of research and surrounding communities. To do so, we will use lands owned by Pemex in the and environmental education Jaguaroundi and Tuzandepetl parks, as well as in Santa Alejandrina swamps, recently restored by the company. Jaguaroundi We know this is an ambitious project, but we are strongly confident that the experience, ecological park the high level of commitment and the knowledge of our workers will enable us to turn this in Coatzacoalcos project into a reality for the enjoyment of generations to come. During 2016, the environmental performance at Petróleos Mexicanos showed favorable results in two fundamental aspects: the reduction of the inventory of hazardous waste by 3.8% and a slight reduction in the use of raw water of 0.3%, as compared to 2015. However, several challenges have been identified in terms of emissions and the inventory of sites affected by hydrocarbons. Regarding the latter, it is important to observe that this increase is, to a large extend, result of a greater number of illegal tapping registered in the National Pipeline System. Among the highlights of the 2016 performance are the following: • Participation with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT, by its acronym in Spanish), the National Agency of Industrial Security and Environmental Protection for the Hydrocarbon Sector (ASEA, by its acronym in Spanish), and the Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE, by its acronym in Spanish) in the review and update of several environmental policies and standards for the industry. • In December 2016, we received 101 Clean Industry certificates from ASEA, the first ones that the agency granted to the EPS. • At the beginning of November 2016, the Madero refinery reduced its raw water consumption by using municipal treated water; this initiative will generate important reductions in the use of water for the upcoming years. • We reduced the inventory of hazardous waste through the disposal of spent caustic at the Salamanca refinery during October and November, 2016.

Likewise, the Gas Processing Complexes (GPC) of Poza Rica, Cd. Pemex and Nuevo Pemex sent sour gas to burners due to maintenance activities at the sulfur plants. We also registered an increase in volume of gas flared at Minatitlan and Salina Cruz refineries. In order to reverse this trend, progress is being made through projects focused on improving associated gas use and completion of maintenance programs at the sulfur recovery facilities in GPC Nuevo Pemex and Cactus. A reduction in SOx emissions during the first months of 2017 is expected as a result of the start-up of operations at sulfur facilities in GPC Nuevo Pemex and Cactus, as well as the reduction in gas vented in PEP. 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 SOX (t) 632,207 471,024 413,286 481,545 606,893 732,984 900,192 NOX (t) 97,830 112,827 108,131 112,620 110,214 116,116 99,891 VOC’s (t) 44,426 42,811 39,872 38,403 37,311 44,778 48,322 TSP 20,519 21,316 16,994 18,171 17,326 16,861 14,645 Sustainability Report 2016 25 INDIRECT EMISSIONS Indirect emissions from the importation of electric energy were estimated at 880,000 0.3% tons of carbon dioxide for this year, considering an emission factor of 0.458 tons of CO2 per MW/h.* raw water use reduction as compared to 2015 RAW WATER USE The use of raw water slightly decreased by 0.3%, as compared to 2015, continuing with a reduction trend started in 2014.

Sustainability Report 2016 30 Energy Management INTRODUCTION Petróleos Mexicanos aims to develop business, economic, industrial and commercial activities in the hydrocarbons sector, which involves production processes that are highly energy demanding and requires great responsibility to use resources in the most efficient way and with a sense of social and environmental responsibility. Therefore, the Energy Management Policy was issued in 2015, through which Petróleos Mexicanos assumes a commitment to the efficient and rational use of energy, while contributing to the country’s energy security and maximizing the economic value of the hydrocarbons it extracts, transforms and delivers to the market. The Energy Management System aims to improve energy performance, in other words, to reduce energy consumption in order to achieve the production processes without changing the quantity and quality of the products. In that sense, the following action lines are included: • Producing products that meet customer requirements, while optimizing the energy use and consumption in their elaboration. • Carrying out actions to improve energy performance through good practices, maintenance, incorporation of new technologies, as well as to promote an energy saving culture and awareness throughout the organization. • Complying with legal requirements related to energy efficient use and rational consumption. Sustainability Report 2016 31 One of the main strategies at international level to improve an organization’s energy performance is the establishment of Energy Management Systems (EMS) under the ISO 50001 standard, which provides insight into the current state of energy consumption and defines saving goals and performance improvements. In the period 2014-2016, several tasks were conducted towards to the establishment of Energy Management Systems in Petróleos Mexicanos. From the beginning of 2014, Gas Processing Complexes were certified under the ISO 50001 standard, while in 2015 and 2016 a program was carried out with the assistance of the Danish Energy Agency with the purpose of implementing this system in a pilot facility for each refinery. PEMEX INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION Refineries During 2016, the National Refining System consumed 35,927 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) to produce various products such as: Pemex Diesel, Pemex Diesel UBA, Pemex Premium Gasoline, Pemex Magna Gasoline, LPG, propylene, isobutene, jet fuel, fuel oil and coke.

Over time, we have supported a wide variety of initiatives focused on promoting and encouraging biodiversity conservation, especially in the areas where we are located. Some of the projects we have supported are: (i) the only swamp interpretation center in Mexico, “Casa del Agua”, in the Biosphere Reserve Pantanos de Centla, in Tabasco; (ii) the Conservation, Management and Restoration project in the Lacandon Jungle; and (iii) the Education and Reforestation project in the Protected Natural Areas of the Gulf of Mexico. In 2002, after promoting public policies with the National Commission on Natural Protected Areas, we obtained the registration of the first Area Voluntarily Dedicated to Conservation (ADVC, by its acronym in Spanish) with the Jaguaroundi Ecological Park in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz. This park was the precedent for more than 300 ADVC that today exist in the country, and it is considered a state and national reference in conservation and environmental education while holding 960 hectares of forest, grassland and tropical holm oak. Additionally, in 2011, the Tuzandepetl Ecological Park was certified as an ADVC in Ixhuatlan del Sureste, Veracruz, for the next 50 years. This park holds more than 1,000 hectares of wetlands and rich mangrove areas, as well as some of the last relicts of high jungle in the region. Now, we want to take a step forward in the conservation of the ecosystems of our country, through the development of the JATUSA Ecological Corridor. This project aims to establish a biological corridor in an initial area of more than 2,400 hectares of jungle and wetlands, which will enable flooding control in the region, preservation of environmental services and mitigation of the adverse effects of climate change on communities around a region that is highly impacted by urban and industrial development. For this project, we will use lands owned by Petróleos Mexicanos, such as the ecological parks of Jaguaroundi and Tuzandepetl, as well as the Pantano de Santa Alejandrina area, which was recently restored by the company. Sustainability Report 2016 43 In 2002 we Background registered our first ADVC In 1998, various intermediate safeguarding zones of Petróleos Mexicanos were evaluated with a double purpose: on the one hand, with the aim of preserving their function of risk mitigation for the protection of communities and facilities; on the other, to take advantage of the ecological characteristics of these territories to promote conservation, restoration and environmental education projects. This approach enabled us to consolidate environmental protection actions in two key areas. Jaguaroundi Ecological In 2002, the protection area in Pemex’s petrochemical facilities in Coatzacoalcos Park was declared an ADVC by the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas from SEMARNAT, which led to the creation of the Jaguaroundi Ecological Park. Later, Tuzandepetl was recognized as the company’s second ADVC in 2011. In this property, there are salt domes used by Pemex to store crude oil. Following the same path, Pemex is the land owner of the wetland area of Santa Alejandrina, an area close to the Lazaro Cardenas refinery in Minatitlan, which holds a high ecological value, mainly because of the presence of migratory birds. The corridor aims to connect these three areas (Jaguaroundi, Tuzandepetl and Santa Alejandrina) through patches of vegetation in good conditions to preserve areas of environmental value under the voluntary certification scheme. This implies an effort on ecological territory planning, while integrating communities to tasks of conservation and improvement of productive processes in such communities. The consolidation of the project will make it possible to connect and evaluate the existence of vegetation islands that provide irreplaceable environmental services for the population and industry, such as water capture, sediment, erosion and silting of water bodies control, carbon capture, flood control, and pollinators’ conservation, among others. JATUSA’s environment Veracruz’s climatic, orographic, and geological conditions have provided the region with an extraordinary biological richness. It is the only state in Mexico where the transition from temperate forests to the tropical zone is presented, converging the characteristics of both ecosystems. However, this natural wealth has been accompanied by an accelerated process of ecosystems decline. According to the report “The environment in Mexico” of Semarnat (2005), Veracruz presented a loss of 19% of its natural wealth between 1993 and 2000. Sustainability Report 2016 44 The accelerated and aggressive development process that has taken place in this state has caused an impact on the fragmentation of the landscape, the formation of patches of vegetation, and changes in land use; factors that influence the loss of environmental services. The JATUSA Ecological Corridor The Central American Commission on Environment and Development defines a biological corridor as “a defined geographical space that provides connectivity between landscapes, ecosystems and habitats, natural or modified, ensuring the preservation of biological diversity and ecological and evolutionary processes.” The JATUSA Ecological Corridor project aims not only to preserve the region’s biodiversity, but also to integrate communities to its development, ensuring an optimal management of environmental resources while enabling compatibility between economic activities in the region and environmental conservation and restoration. With the purpose of achieving the aforementioned, it is necessary to collect on-site biological information and to develop maps, as well as to initiate dialogue processes with our communities in order to identify their demographic characteristics, to address their concerns and interests, to agree on a collaborative agenda, and to define issues related to land use. For Petróleos Mexicanos, carrying out this project means The concept of corridor aims to demonstrating consistency with its environmental and connect these three areas social standards and policies, as well as opening a space (Jaguaroundi, Tuzandepetl and for building good relationships and improving the living Santa Alejandrina) through patches conditions of our neighbors through environmental of vegetation in good condition to conservation actions, ensuring the integrity of our preserve areas of environmental value intermediate safeguard zones. Sustainability Report 2016 45 CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN THE USUMACINTA RIVER MIDDLE BASIN This project, operated by Natura Mexicana, is carried out in one of the most important regions of Mexico, mainly because it contains the largest tropical rainforest spot, and the country’s most diverse terrestrial ecosystem; also, because of the environmental services it generates for the local population, the Tabasco’s plains, the Gulf of Mexico and for the national population. The Lacandon Jungle is located in the Usumacinta river middle basin, in the state of Chiapas, which is the main recharge zone of the Usumacinta and Grijalva rivers. More than half of the flow of the Usumacinta River comes from the Lacandon Jungle. The objective of the project is to promote and implement the necessary actions for the conservation and management of the natural ecosystems in the Lacandon Jungle region, both in the protected natural areas and in the surroundings. The project aims that ecosystems remain healthy, while their natural resources are preserved, and environmental services, new income and jobs are generated, all of which are necessary for the development and social welfare of the population. The conservation of the forest area and the environmental services of the Usumacinta river middle basin enable water supply to remain within its natural cycle and stop the erosion and sediment movements. During 2016, the program continued preserving the ecosystems of the protected natural areas and surroundings of the Lacandon Jungle through surveillance and monitoring activities, as well as persisted on promoting the implementation of public programs for the benefit of the local population and the preservation of the jungle. Among the most important actions promoted in 2016 are the following: • Operation of three on-site stations for biodiversity conservation along the Lacantun river, from which activities of monitoring, research, environmental education, ecological restoration and support of the sustainable management of resources are being carried out. • Trap cameras continuous monitoring, indicating the ecosystem quality for species such as: jaguar, tapir, white-lipped peccary, temazate deer and swamp crocodile, in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, the Chan-Kin Flora and Fauna Protection Area, the Yaxchilan Natural Monument, as well as in remaining areas of four ejidos of the municipality Marques de Comillas. • Rescue and protection of scarlet macaw in the Lacandon Jungle, through river monitoring and ground observations performed by technical personnel and community monitors. • Monitoring of amphibians and reptiles in the Natural Protected Areas of the Lacandon Jungle. Sustainability Report 2016 46 • Monitoring of the physicochemical characteristics of aquatic environments to evaluate ecosystem health. • Collaborative work with eleven ejidos (communal land used for agriculture) with the purpose of managing, advising and following up their participation in the program Payment for Environmental Services (PES) of the National Forestry Commission (CONAFOR, by its acronym in Spanish), supporting as a result, the conservation of more than 10,000 hectares of forest in these communities. • Counseling and support to four social companies created –from its origin– by members of the Marques de Comillas community. These are now at different stages of development, earning revenues and generating employment through management and conservation of their forest: Canto de la Selva eco-tourism hotel, Casa del Morpho butterfly Environmental Management Unit (UMA), Tamandua eco-tourism camp, and Selvaje eco-tourism center. • The combined aquaculture and aquaponic modules maintain a steady production. They have experienced improvements in their operation while they remain under hydrological and productive evaluation. • 1.5 tonnes of meat in the aquaculture production units and more than 350 kg of habanero chili pepper in the aquaponics component have been produced in each unit. The conservation of the forest area and the environmental services of the Usumacinta river middle basin enables water supply to remain within its natural cycle, and to prevent the erosion and sediment movements. Sustainability Report 2016 47 • Development of a pilot study to determine the forest potential in the Ejido Emiliano Zapata -one of the ejidos with the largest forest extension in the region-, and to define a critical route with the objective of developing a sustainable forest management plan based on the pilot study. • 700 children and young people from the ejidos and communities surrounding the Protected Natural Areas participated in environmental education activities and talks. • 300 children received self-managed courses in which they become familiar with information technologies and cultural topics. They had access to 90 functional computers equipped with self-taught educational software. • Training of workers and partners of five eco-tourism companies for the operation and administration of their centers and the exchange of experiences with other communitybased nature tourism projects. • Support to fifteen local youths to continue their education and acquisition of technical skills, three of them were awarded with a scholarship to study at the university in Tuxtla Gutierrez and San Cristobal de las Casas. • Training for 46 professionals from the region (Chiapas and Tabasco) on natural protected areas management, through talks and workshops in their institutions. Please visit the following link to know more about the work of Natura Mexicana http://naturamexicana.org.mx/ CASA DEL AGUA Casa del Agua is located within the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve in the state of Tabasco. It is an Environmental Interpretation Center operated and managed by the civil organization Natural Spaces and Sustainable Development (ENDESU, by its acronym in Spanish), whose mission is “the conservation and sustainable management of the natural resources of Mexico, considering wealth in terms of environmental services and biodiversity as a heritage for present and future generations”. The mission of Casa del Agua is to “introduce values in society for the conservation, protection and sustainable use of the natural heritage of the Pantanos de Centla, as well as to strengthen values of human development for the conservation of the planet, through its facilities, didactic tools and interactive workshops focused on different groups: school, family and business”. With the general objective of “promoting in society a culture for the conservation of the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve”, in 1998 Petroleos Mexicanos agreed with ENDESU, A.C. the development of the Casa del Agua project, an Environmental Interpretation Center, for which the association acquired a property in the Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve (RBPC). Sustainability Report 2016 48 Since 2000, several donations have been made to ENDESU, A.C. with the aim of supporting conservation actions in the RBPC. Pemex’s contributions amounted to $ 33’420,000.00 pesos from 2000 to 2015, equivalent to an average of $2’088,750.00 pesos per year. These donations represent more than 90% of Casa del Agua’s budget. To date, over 100,000 people have visited Casa del Agua since its inauguration. In addition, more than 180 workshops for Pemex workers and contractors have been developed, covering topics about Protected Natural Areas value and legal framework, reaching approximately 3,500 people. This project has enabled us to communicate the reality of the oil and gas activity within the reserve, through a didactic room addressing oil as the main topic, showcasing from the origin and storage of hydrocarbons in the subsoil, to the actions of seismic prospecting, exploration, and transport and transformation of oil derivatives; teaching also about the actions Pemex has implemented in terms of ecosystem prevention, restoration and conservation. Sustainability Report 2016 49 In addition, this project has become a space for coordination, organization and training, acting as a venue for specialized courses, community meetings and work between different levels of government. The National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP, by its acronym in Spanish), perceives the Environmental Interpretation Center as the basis for developing the policy of Culture Centers for Conservation in Mexico. Near the Center, six tourist services organizations have been organized, trained and registered with the participation of more than 50 families from the community. It is worth mentioning that the plant nursery center from Casa del Agua, with a production capacity of 100 thousand plants per year, has continuously fed with native plants the restoration of sites and banks of several rivers in the reserve, in alignment with the projects of ENDESU and the RBPC. Among the most relevant results achieved through this project are the following: • More than 100 thousand visitors and more than 900 environment awareness courses provided. • 30 social services and five specific theses have been supported, in addition to other research projects. • Universities such as Universidad Michoacana and Universidad de Campeche, as well as several technological institutes from the country, perform annual visits to the Center as part of their ecotourism and biology academic programs. • Pre-school, primary, secondary and high school institutions throughout the state of Campeche -particularly those located in the Reservevisit Casa del Agua, where they participate in environmental culture workshops as part of their academic programs. • Teaching materials for different school levels have been generated and distributed, including support for teachers with the aim of strengthening knowledge of wetlands and the reserve. • Four itinerant exhibitions have been displayed at points of large influx of visitors (airports, museums, schools) on topics such as oil goods, values and ecosystems services; a climate change exhibition; swamp themed oil paintings; and an exhibition resulting from a state level school drawing contest.

DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING Due to budget constraints applied in the company during 2016, several decisions were taken in order to optimize the allocation of budgetary resources, nevertheless, we are committed to continue delivering training in accordance with the core needs of the business. Sustainability Report 2016 53 The main actions undertaken in 2016 are the following: • Training program optimization, by focusing on courses that have an impact on substantive activities of the company such as operation, maintenance and safety; 66% of the courses are related to technical subjects, 30% to safety issues, and the remaining 4% to behavioral, administrative and computer related matters. • For the implementation of the program, priority was given to courses that enable compliance with federal regulatory obligations and strategic topics included in our Business Plan. • The training program was restructured to strengthen it with internal trainers. The number of courses under this modality increased from 62% to 77%, with the participation of 2,200 instructors. 2012-2016 INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Number of courses 13,533 15,137 12,278 8,611 5,855 Number of hours 858,561 912,699 803,375 595,898 395,765 Number of participants 180,226 177,840 209,764 153,601 61,280 Sustainability Report 2016 54 2016 INSTITUTIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM DETAIL Courses Hours Participants Investment Exploration and Production 941 30,720 15,228 117,572,900 Industrial Transformation 2,564 270,266 23,939 29,838,045 Logistics 293 39,184 8,148 6,878,497 Drilling and Services 941 8,633 5,130 0 Fertilizers 63 11,280 573 171,601 Ethylene 0 0 0 0 Cogeneration and Services 0 0 0 0 Corporate 1,053 35,682 8,262 14,421,374 Total 5,855 395,765 61,280 168,882,417 ESPECIALIZED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS Based on the priorities of the company’s business lines, talent has been strengthened through continuous skills development and training, which are summarized as follows: • 596 individual development plans were established for professional staff and 3,205 for technical personnel. • Collaboration with research centers to carry out specialized human resources training programs such as “On-site Diploma in Static Mechanical Maintenance” and “Preparation, Training and Skills Training for Welder Certification” by the AWS. • Coordination and delivery of specialized events in technical issues, registering the participation of 5,373 workers. • Allocation of workers from different EPS to training programs sponsored by the Japan Cooperation Center Petroleum (JCCP). ORGANIZATATIONAL CULTURE As a part of the implementation of the first stage of the cultural transformation project, the development of internal facilitators was initiated. They share their cultural change knowledge through practical sessions implemented within the company. In this context, Pemex is currently working on developing this project to an enterprise-wide scale, as part of an ongoing exercise that enables us to consolidate a result oriented culture. Sustainability Report 2016 55 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION The performance management process in Pemex and its EPS is carried out under the Institutional System for Individual Performance Management (SIADI, by its acronym in Spanish). Based on this system, objectives are planned and tracked to its fulfilment while results are measured, always focusing on those projects and initiatives that create value. The SIADI is evolving to become a simple, agile, objective, and transparent process that suits the needs of the company. Hence, during 2016, the SMART methodology for the individual performance goals definition was implemented, as well as the seven organizational competencies that every worker must have. The latter are aligned to the cultural transformation initiative, and include the following competencies: (i) innovation, (ii) teamwork, (iii) continuous improvement, (iv) customer-focus, (v) productivity, (vi) alignment, and (vii) result-oriented. During the performance cycle of 2016, nearly 25,000 non-union workers used the system, an amount equivalent to 97% of participation. This amount accounted for an input for the final review, registering a 96% participation. Below is a comparison of the participation in recent years.

Sustainability Report 2016 58 EQUALTITY AND INCLUSION In alliance with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP-Mexico), the Social Inclusion Institutional Strategy (EISI, by its acronym in Spanish) in Matters of Gender Equality, Non-Discrimination and Labor Inclusion of Women, People with Disabilities and LGBTTTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, transvestite, intersexual) Population is committed to the creation of inclusive and free from discrimination labor spaces, based on awareness-raising and staff training. Moreover, it is dedicated to create and strengthen labor inclusion policies for highly vulnerable groups. In 2016, the strategy was implemented with the following outstanding actions: a) Performance of face-to-face training and two online courses on inclusion: “Women and men equality in the workplace” and “Step by step we build inclusion in Pemex”, with more than 26,000 trained people nationwide. b) Awards on Inclusive Company and Family Responsible Company, both granted by the STPS. c) Release of the document “Policies and procedures for dealing with possible acts of discrimination, mobbing, and/or sexual harassment in Pemex” at the Institutional Library on Regulation, which is aligned to the codes of ethics and conduct, as well as to national and international standards. d) Social inclusion diagnosis. In March 2016, a survey was conducted throughout a representative sample of Pemex personnel, with the purpose of drawing attention to the culture of inclusion. e) Implementation of physical accessibility. After the diagnosis performed, the recommendations were applied and reasonable adjustments made, which will be replicated to other facilities nationwide. f) Development of the theoretical-methodological design and logistics process to identify population in vulnerable situations or traditionally excluded (people with disabilities, LGBTTTI and women). In addition, we continue to operate the Table on Inclusion, Equality and Non-Discrimination (MIIND, for its acronym in Spanish) to implement transversely the inclusion, equality and Ruta para Ruta paraatender casos de discriminación, atender el 1.

Sustainability Report 2016 59 The Network for Diversity was also consolidated to create working environments where LGBTTTI staff can feel safe, valued and respected, allowing them to reach their full potential. In addition, Pemex joined Pride Connection Mexico, a group of multinational companies (Google, IBM, JPMorgan, Pfizer, DOW, Pepsi, SAP, Cinepolis, among others) that meet monthly to share best practices for full labor inclusion of people in the LGBTTI community. Likewise, five Fairs for Inclusion were held in different working centers (the Miguel Hidalgo refinery, Nuevo Pemex CPG, Cactus CPG, Edificio Piramide and the Centro Tecnico Administrativo in the southern region) to raise awareness in employees through playful and didactic materials on different types of disability, sexual diversity, family co-responsibility and inclusive language, among other topics. Permanent awareness and information campaigns are carried out through internal electronic and printed media, as well as messages alluding to equality and nondiscrimination have been published in Pemex social networks. The company also participated in the Third National Forum on Corporate Social Responsibility in Mexico and delivered the presentation “Pemex commitment to gender equality” at the 3rd Global Forum “Companies for Gender Equality: Promoting the Sustainable Development Goals”, encouraged jointly by the Government of Panama and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Moreover, the company participated in the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (CONAPRED, by its acronym in Spanish) and the UN Working Group on Businesses and Human Rights coordinated by the Secretariat of Government. In addition, the Family Integration Centers (CIFAs, for its acronym in Spanish) and the Social and Integral Center for Senior Adults (CESIPAM, for its acronym in Spanish) continued to work with the aim of improving the quality of life of active and retired employees, entitled holders and people from the communities located close to our facilities. A program was developed with the purpose of reinforcing the collaboration between Pemex and public institutions, foundations and educational institutions. A training program was integrated for beneficiaries, which covered the topics of equality, inclusion and nondiscrimination. Also, 22 conferences and various awareness talks were delivered in 10 CIFAs and one CESIPAM. The 3rd Expo Fair of Foundations and Non-profit Associations, organized by Petróleos Mexicanos, took place in 2016. More than 25 foundations and associations participated in this event. Similarly, the Fair of Women Producers and Artisans INMUJERES CDMX was held with the aim of promoting the economic empowerment of women in Mexico City, with the participation of 20 artisanal producers from four delegations. Sustainability Report 2016 60 Occupational health and industrial safety OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH In 2016, we implemented the “Raise the voice, all safe, all on board” campaign in Pemex Drilling and Services, which reduced by 69% the absenteeism of workers due to diseases in the last quarter, as compared to the rest of the quarters of the year. The Person-Position Compatibility Procedure (PCPP, by its acronym in Spanish) was initiated in Pemex Drilling and Services (PPS, by its acronym in Spanish), Pemex Exploration and Production (PEP, by its acronym in Spanish), PEMEX Industrial Transformation (TRI, by its acronym in Spanish) and Pemex Logistics (PLOG, by its acronym in Spanish). The Person Position Compatibility Procedure includes activities that enable the evaluation of the proposed personnel according to physical, functional and psychological performance requirements for the job and its characteristics, thus ensuring that the staff has the necessary skills to perform their activities in the position to be occupied. Moreover, the first four profiles for critical positions in Pemex Drilling and Services were developed, and the profiles to be created in the rest of the EPS were determined. Sustainability Report 2016 61 In addition, the foundations between the company and the STPRM were established with the aim of integrating job profiles to our labor regulations. Similarly, the strategy and the profiles of the personnel that will participate in the development of the Psychosocial Risk Factors standard were developed. In 2016, the report on the preventive indicators of the Occupational Health Administration Subsystem (SAST, for its acronym in Spanish) was consolidated, as well as its analysis for decision-making in this area. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY Frequency rate During 2016, the initiatives promoted by the company in terms of Safety, Occupational Health, Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development enabled to surpass the frequency rate target of 0.38 injuries per million man hours, reaching a historical minimum for the company of 0.36 injuries per million man hour, decreasing by 23%, as compared to 2015. Accident severity rate At the end of 2016, the cumulative accident severity rate amounted to 23, decreasing by 25%, as compared to 2015. The lowest accident severity rate in the company history 0.36 injuries per million man hour Sustainability Report 2016 62 The outstanding performance recorded during 2016 was largely due to the implementation of the ZERO TOLERANCE twelve safety directives issued by our Director General, which were supported alongside to other different initiatives. One of these initiatives is the application of an audit and technical support program in critical workplaces of all business lines, with the aim of detecting risks and establishing the necessary actions for their immediate mitigation. Moreover, the role of SSPA professionals has been strengthened through a simple mandate focused on applying the best international auditing, regulatory, supporting and training practices. Furthermore, communication and diffusion campaigns were launched in all EPS to address the main causes of accidents, to ensure that technical and manual workers can identify and manage their labor risks. As a result, we decreased personal accidents by 29% during 2016. Contextualizing the above, it is worth remembering that Pemex began operations in 1938 with a three-digit accident rate; nowadays, indicators have been significantly reduced, contributing to the safety and confidence of oil workers, their families and communities near our facilities. Contractor safety rate For contractors, the safety rate amounted to 0.26 injuries per million man hours, decreasing by 41%, as compared to 2015. This was also possible by involving contractor personnel in the ZERO TOLERANCE guidelines unrestricted application, and by conducting permanent compliance audits with the SSPA Appendix during risk activities. Sustainability Report 2016 63 Ethics and corporate integrity In a competitive environment, ethics and corporate integrity acquire a renewed value to the company, as they are elements that enable workers to inhibit irregular behavior while strengthening the image and reputation of the company. Demonstrating high standards of ethics and integrity reinforces the trust of customers, investors, suppliers and communities in the company and its workers. Therefore, in February 2016, the Ethics and Corporate Integrity Program was launched to promote integrity and ethical values in the company, with the purpose of aligning all activities conducted by Pemex employees. This program incorporates international standards and best practices in ethics, integrity, anti-corruption strategies, and aims at the following: • Improving public perception regarding Pemex’s ethical and integrity culture and principles. • Minimizing the probability of occurrence of identified corruption risks in business activities. • Improving business partners’ confidence in the company’s ethical and integrity behavior. • Improving the response to acts of non-compliance in ethics or integrity related matters. Among the main action lines of the Program are the following: • Adapting ethics and conduct codes to meet new needs while incorporating better practices. • Developing training and adherence mechanisms on ethics and integrity for the company’s employees. • Implementing ethical profile assessments for new entry staff and including their development in staff evaluation mechanisms. • Establishing new mechanisms for assessing the ethical and integrity environment of the company. Sustainability Report 2016 64 CODE OF ETHICS As part of the implementation of the Ethics and Integrity Program, in November 2016, the Board of Directors of Petróleos Mexicanos issued the new Code of Ethics for Petróleos Mexicanos, its Subsidiary Productive Companies and Affiliate Companies, with the purpose of aligning ethical values with the new challenges of Pemex as a State Productive Company. The new Code includes a simpler and easier-to-understand language to provide examples and present tools that enable employees strengthen their ethical judgment. Please visit the following link to consult our Code of Ethics: http://www.pemex.com/etica-e-integridad/etica/Documents/ C%C3%B3digo%20de%20Etica%202016%20carta%20DG.PDF CODE OF CONDUCT Another strategy of the Program is the update of the Petróleos Mexicanos Code of Conduct, its Subsidiary Productive Companies and, if applicable, Affiliate Companies that will clearly establish the expected behaviors of Pemex’s employees in their daily functions in order to promote transparency and strengthen the ethical culture of all company’s employees. The new code has already been reviewed by the Ethics Committee and it will be issued by the General Director in the first half of 2017. Our current code is available at the following address: http://www.pemex.com/acerca/marco_normativo/ Documents/codigos/codigo-conducta_20170830.pdf ETHICS COMMITTEE As a result of the introduction of the new Code of Ethics, and as part of the Ethics and Corporate Integrity Program activities, a new Ethics Committee of Petróleos Mexicanos, its Subsidiary Productive Companies and, if applicable, Affiliate Companies, was set up in December to regulate and promote the implementation and compliance with the provisions of the Codes of Ethics and Conduct. The Committee is a collective body integrated as follows: POSITION HOLDER President Head of the Institutional Internal Control Unit. Substitute President Appointed by the person holding the Chair of the Committee. Permanent Member Person appointed by the Head of the Corporate Management and Services Department. Four Rotary Members Representatives of corporate offices, EPS and Subsidiary Companies. • Person appointed by the Head of the Legal Department of Petróleos Mexicanos. Permanent guests • Person appointed by the Head of the Responsibility Unit in Petróleos Mexicanos. • Person appointed by the Head of Internal Audit. Secretary Appointed by the person holding the Chair of the Committee. Sustainability Report 2016 65 Among the main functions of the committee are the following: • Promoting corporate strategies with the aim of generating an ethical environment that leads to the compliance of Pemex objectives. • Promoting the knowledge and practice of the codes of Ethics and Conduct with the purpose of improving the level of ethical culture in Pemex’s employees. • Knowing, communicating, analyzing and instructing to the corresponding areas about possible infringements reported to the codes of Ethics and Conduct. • Verifying the implementation and compliance with dictated sanctions for the relevant cases. With the purpose of offering permanent and specialized means for the reception of reports and consultancies on ethics and integrity issues, an Ethics Helpline (LAE, for its acronym in Spanish) has been made available to employees. ANTI-CORRUPTION AND RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIONS Additionally, in compliance with section I of Article 56 of the Pemex Law, the company’s corporate risk management model is based on international standards. The model is established by the Board of Directors and carried out by the General Director with the support of the Risk Committee, as well as by the different administrative units of Pemex and its EPS. Through the business risk management process, the identification, measurement, analysis, treatment, control, surveillance and communication of risks is performed in order to provide reasonable certainty regarding compliance with the objectives set, as well as to preserve the performance, efficiency and effectiveness of the resources management, operational capacity and safeguarding. Accordingly, and regarding to corruption risks, the company continues to establish the mechanisms required for its attention and control. For this, different sources, both internal (e.g., processes diagnoses or internal audits results) and external (e.g., in the case of Procurement and Supply, a study was conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are managed. It is important to highlight that the corruption risks inventory is managed by the first line of defense, consisting on the areas responsible for the processes, with the support and advice of the Institutional Internal Control Unit (UCII, by its acronym in Spanish). Moreover, periodic reports are delivered to the Risk, Audit and Ethics Committees. Sustainability Report 2016 66 TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY From January 1st to December 31, 2016, Pemex and its former Subsidiary Entities (OS, for its acronym in Spanish), now Subsidiary Productive Companies (EPS, by its acronym in Spanish) received 7,355 requests for information access under the established legislation. For the same period 6,112 applications were attended, including those received in 2016 and those collected from previous periods, which were attended within the deadlines set by the Law. It should be mentioned that, given that the INFOMEX systems started operating for the obliged entities (EPS), the report includes Subsidiary Entities.

ADOPTION OF BEST INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES AND STANDARDS Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) standard derives from a global initiative to promote the transparent, public and accountable management of financial transactions in the extractive industries (gas, oil and mining). Sustainability Report 2016 67 The implementation of the standard requires the participation of the government, companies and civil society. Countries that are included in the standard make public information on the payment of taxes, services, licenses, contracts and production related to the extraction of resources in the country. The information is communicated in an open and transparent way, which allows the public to know how the natural resources of the countries are managed and the amount of income generated by their exploitation. Mexico is in the process of promoting its candidacy to join the EITI initiative. As part of this process, on November 22nd, 2016, the Multiparty National Group for Mexico’s Adherence was created. The group is integrated by representatives of the Federal Government (Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, Ministry of Energy, and the Ministry of Economy), the Industrial Sector (Mexican Association of Hydrocarbons Companies, Pemex and the Mining Chamber of Mexico) and Civil Society (various organizations, including Transparencia Mexicana, and the Economic Research Institute of UNAM). At that meeting, the three sectors subscribed to the declaration of principles of EITI Mexico. The responsibility of this working group is the design of an action plan for the submission of the candidature of Mexico. Currently, this effort is in the process of being drawn up. Open Government Alliance The Open Government Alliance (AGA, for its acronym in Spanish) aims to consistently ensure that governments become more transparent and accountable, while improving responsiveness to their citizens by providing quality services. Pemex has participated in this effort under the leadership of the Ministry of Energy; therefore, on October 26th, the Ministry stated that the 2013-2015 Action Plan had been implemented, presenting significant results regarding the transparent and periodic publication of the following information: • Contributions and donations granted by Pemex to each state and municipality. • Information related on Pemex’s contracting processes. • Information related to studies contracted by Pemex with third parties. Sustainability Report 2016 68 Social investment With the purpose of actively contributing to the improvement of the quality of life of families in oil regions, Pemex has taken a proactive role in generating favorable conditions for growth and well-being through the Office of Responsibility and Social Development. We know that investing in these communities enables us not only to strengthen Pemex’s role in the development of the region, but it also enables the communities to enjoy the benefits that the oil industry entails. To achieve the above, the company develops various instruments aimed at improving the quality of life in oil regions in order reconcile the industry’s growth with the legitimate welfare aspirations of the communities. The main instruments developed are: • Cash donations. • In-kind donations (fuels and asphalt). • Movable and immovable property donations. • Mutual Benefit Works (OBM, by its acronym in Spanish). • The Community and Environment Support Program (PACMA, by its acronym in Spanish) that supports and implements social programs, actions and civil works. It is designed to promote the economic and social development of the communities in which we operate, as well as to protect the environment. • Other social responsibility contractual mechanisms such as the Integrated Extractions and Production Contracts (CIEPs, by its acronym in Spanish) and the appendixes and clauses of sustainable development included in contracts with suppliers or contractors, through which they commit to improve the communities’ quality of life. Sustainability Report 2016 69 In 2016, the company’s social investment amounted to $1,649.2 million pesos, distributed as follows.

The program consists on a set of strategic actions to stimulate the economic activity of this country’s important region by supporting the families and businesses economy. In this context, Pemex received from the Presidency of the Republic the following four instructions to move forward in the implementation of this program. 1. Immediately address the lack of liquidity faced by businesses in these states, prioritizing and expediting payments to local suppliers. As of December 2016, the following progress was made. Initial debt New debt Payments made as of State May 2016 Jun-Dec 2016 Dec 30 2016 Number of suppliers (millions of pesos) (millions of pesos) (millions of pesos) Campeche $ 25,226 $ 11,564 $ 36,790 202 Tabasco $ 21,202 $ 12,595 $ 33,797 549 Total $ 46,428 $ 24,159 $ 70,587 751 Sustainability Report 2016 76 2. Pemex and National Financial Entity (NAFINSA, by its acronym in Spanish) will work with large contractors to build an invoicing program, impacting through this way the entire supply chain. Meetings were carried out between Pemex, NAFINSA, and major contractor companies working in the states of Campeche and Tabasco. NAFINSA presented the productive chains outlines that provide improvements in the development of suppliers. It was agreed that NAFINSA will address each major contractor company individually, with the purpose of helping them to participate in the invoicing program and reactivate the entire supply chain of these states, solving as a result, their liquidity problems. 3. Use of non-consolidated bidding schemes for goods and services in which a local supplier is considered. As of December 30th, 2016, 12 procurement processes adding up $ 58,129,299 pesos have been carried out under the scheme of non-consolidated bidding schemes to companies in Campeche and Ciudad del Carmen. Also, 26 processes adding up $107,155,260 pesos were carried out under the scheme of non-consolidated bidding schemes to companies of La Venta, Macuspana and Villahermosa, Tabasco. INTER-INSTITUTIONAL ALLIANCES Ministry of Social Development On September 30th, 2014, Petróleos Mexicanos and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL, for its acronym in Spanish) signed a collaboration agreement to carry out actions focused on the welfare of the communities under the influence of the oil industry, through the promotion of nutrition activities within the framework of the National Crusade against Hunger. In support of SEDESOL’s actions, community kitchens were set up, and firm floors and safe roofs were delivered to families from oil communities, mainly in Veracruz and Tabasco. Social conflicts The dynamics of the oil industry generate diverse impacts on social groups that must be prevented, corrected and, where appropriate, attended, in order to guarantee the communities’ social welfare and, at the same time, to strengthen the social license to operate. Bearing this in mind, the Office of Responsibility and Social Development has been identifying recurrent conflicts, with the purpose of informing them and taking actions to address them appropriately. Sustainability Report 2016 77 The topics generating major conflicts in the communities where we operate are the following: • Illegal tapping. • Fuel price increase. • Heavy traffic and road damage complaints. • Pollution. • Damages to the fishing industry. • Damages to the agricultural sector. • Compensation payment claims. • Unfulfilled minutes. With the purpose of solving these issues, relevant information about the social environment is collected, classifying the risk of social conflict. Based on this analysis, an ad-hoc assessment strategy is developed, beginning with the implementation of necessary efforts and negotiations for the conflict deactivation. During 2016, 50 social conflicts related to the company’s operations were registered, most of them in the states of Oaxaca, Veracruz and Tabasco, decreasing by 37%, as compared to 2015.

Through the donation of more than 12.5 million pesos, which benefited almost 5,700 inhabitants, maintenance and enhancement of the hydraulic basement were carried out, as well as the construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of asphalt pavement. Sustainability Report 2016 78 These works provided the inhabitants of 78 communities in the municipality of Centro with better communication routes, while continuing the operations of 197 producer wells in the Samaria, Cunduacan and Iride fields. This effort also granted access to various rights of way through which nearly 68% of PEP’s production is transported. Operation and management of the Jaguaroundi Tuzandepetl – Santa Alejandrina ecological corridor (JATUSA), in the Southern region of Veracruz In Petróleos Mexicanos we have a solid commitment to the protection and conservation of our country’s natural wealth. Over time, we have supported various social initiatives in the Centla wetlands, the Lacandon Jungle, the Protected Natural Areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and the Veracruz’s mangroves and low jungles. While supporting these projects we recognize the historical process of natural capital deterioration and loss suffered by the coastal plain. Therefore, we have developed various initiatives such as reforestation campaigns and natural resources sustainable management, by taking advantage of the installed capacity in the Protected Natural Areas and incorporating a component of environmental education, social organization and technological development for sustainable development. A new step in this commitment is the consolidation of the JATUSA project, which aims to establish a biodiversity corridor on a surface of more than two thousand hectares of forest and wetlands, with the purpose of contributing to flooding control in the region, having an area of contention around industrial facilities to ensure the communities’ safety in case of contingency, preserving environmental services, and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on the industry and the surrounding communities. To do this, we will use land owned by Petróleos Mexicanos in Jaguaroundi and Tuzandepetl, as well as the Pantanos de Santa Alejandrina, recently restored by the company. Pemex is working on the consolidation of the JATUSA corridor, an environmental conservation effort on a surface of more than two thousand hectares of forest and wetlands Sustainability Report 2016 79 Rehabilitation of the Federal Rural School Ignacio Zaragoza In 2016, we allocated more than 8.6 million pesos to improve the physical infrastructure of Las Balsas community in the state of Puebla. These works included the construction of a dome, bathrooms (biodigestor installation), civic square, pedestrian area, perimeter fence, dining rooms and classrooms rehabilitation, as well as the supply of school furniture (desks, tables and chairs). Schools from eight communities of the Carmen municipality in the state of Campeche were equipped with school furniture An amount of around three million pesos was allocated to solve the school’s lack of furniture in the communities of the Municipality of Carmen. The support included the provision of 100% of the furniture required by the principals, in agreement with the state’s Secretariat of Public Education. In total, 15 kindergartens, ten primary schools and two secondary schools were equipped, granting 3,129 chairs and 1,533 tables to students, 109 chairs and 117 tables to teachers, as well as 78 blackboards. Sustainability Report 2016 80 Mobile Medical Clinic We continued operating the Mobile Medical Clinic to bring vulnerable communities closer to essential medical services, with the purpose of improving the health and quality of life of families who do not have the resources to reach a medical center for their care or to obtain medication. 35,729 people were attended in the communities of Santa Maria Petapa, Matias Romero and Asuncion Ixtaltepec. At the same time, 15,766 beneficiaries were attended in the municipalities of Coatzacoalcos, Nanchital, Ixhuatlan del Sureste, Cosoleacaque, Juan Rodriguez Clara, Molotitlan, Las Choapas, Agua Dulce, Acayucan and Chinameca. Supply of ice factories to the coastal fishing sector of the Municipality of Carmen Seven ice factories were built for the coastal fishing industry in the state of Campeche with the aim of strengthening productive infrastructure in the region. The project enabled the activities of fishery products self-consumption and conservation through an investment of more than four million pesos. Indigenous people Within the collaboration agreement framework with the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, Petróleos Mexicanos rebuilt two Casas del Niño Indigena in the Istmo de Tehuantepec, which will serve 28 children at primary level and 70 at secondary level. In these facilities, the permanence of indigenous children and young people in the school is assured, while lodging, food services and complementary activities are provide to them in adequate infrastructure conditions. Based on the above, Petróleos Mexicanos contributes to the development of the communities where the oil industry is present, favoring the integration of indigenous children and young people from scarce resources communities into better academic, cultural, health and food development stages.

In December, BHP Billiton Petróleo Operaciones de México, S. de R.L. de C.V. was awarded with the 60% of the tender for the development of the Trión Block, a process that was led by the National Hydrocarbons Commission. It was a historic event that marked the beginning of a new stage for the company and that demonstrates that Pemex is an attractive and reliable partner to invest. Similarly, the consortium formed by Pemex Exploration and Production, Chevron and Inpex Corporation, won the deep waters block 3 North in Round 1.4. This was the first block awarded to Pemex in partnership with other companies in a competitive process. As a result, the company consolidated its strategic position in the Perdido Fold Belt area. Also, during 2016, Pemex presented its 2017-2021 Business Plan (http://www.Pemex. com/acerca/plan-de-negocios/Documents/plannegocios-pmx_2017-2021.pdf). The Plan promotes the integration of alliances throughout Pemex’s value chain as a mechanism to increase its investments and efficiency, while taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the new legal framework of the industry that springs from the Energy Reform. The Plan has been designed to take advantage of short-term opportunities such as (i) 2017-2021 cost structure and business strategy adjustments for a low price international scenario, business plan (ii) implementation of an adjustment program and austerity measures, (iii) fiscal discipline and (iv) budget control. The Plan also enables us to take advantage of the Energy Reform Promotes the formation of alliances through in order to focus our efforts on the most profitable strategic activities to carry out alliances and partnerships and to improve our operative efficiency and effectiveness. Pemex’s value chain Sustainability Report 2016 84 In terms of performance, during 2016 the company concentrated on recovering financial stability by taking firm steps to exploit the opportunities offered by the Energy Reform, as well as deepen and strengthen the relationship with financial markets and different players in the energy sector. The results of this strategy allowed us to: • Comply with the Adjustment Plan proposed for the year. • Regularize payments to suppliers and contractors. • Improve in our financial balance. • Implement the Business Plan. • Take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Energy Reform. FINANCIAL INFORMATION During 2016, the company implemented a budget adjustment program of $100 billion pesos based on three lines of action: (i) generate efficiencies and reduce costs in operating expenses and personal services, renegotiate fees with suppliers and contractors, and optimize maintenance of equipment; (ii) defer and reformulate investments by compromising as little as possible future production; and (iii) suspend unprofitable projects under a price scenario for the Mexican Export Crude Oil Blend of USD 25/bbl. At the close of fiscal year 2015, we experienced adverse situations such as a negative working capital of $176,207 million pesos, a loss of equity of $563,955 million pesos and a net loss of $712,567 million pesos, due to the recognition of fixed assets deterioration. However, the actions implemented in 2016 allowed the company to improve by $105,416 million pesos its working capital; reduce losses compared to those reported in fiscal year 2015 at $521,423 million pesos; and to break the negative trend that had emerged in the last years with the Pemex’ equity, which in the 2016 fiscal year resulted in a positive variation as compared to 2015, with an increase of $98,668 million pesos (7.4%). In terms of total sales, the drop in hydrocarbon prices had a significant impact on revenues. This was the main cause of a reduction of $86,817 million pesos (7.4%) in total sales, as compared to 2015. In regards to contributions to public finances, the payment of taxes and duties decreased by $66,979 million pesos (20.2%). The duties on extraction of hydrocarbons and other fees made in this year were lower, by $72,274 million pesos (19.2%), than what was paid during 2015, mainly due to the decrease in the price of crude oil and hydrocarbon production. Income Tax increased by $5,295 million pesos (11.6%) due to the decrease in deferred taxes recognized in 2016, as compared to those recorded in 2015, which recognized the favorable effect of labor liabilities. Sustainability Report 2016 85 At the end of 2016, Pemex registered a net loss of $191,144 million pesos which represented a decrease of 521,423 million pesos (73.2%), as compared to 2015 PAYMENTS OF TAXES AND DUTIES (millions of pesos) Variation Concept 2015 2016 Absolute Relative (%) Indirect taxes 378,943.7 467,957.1 89,013.4 23.5 Value added tax 147,110.0 157,148.0 10,038.0 6.8 Special tax on production and services 231,833.8 310,809.2 78,975.4 34.1 Direct taxes 428,406.5 321,186.9 -107,219.5 -25.0 Ordinary duty on hydrocarbon -10,484.9 n.a. n.a.

This was a result from adjustments to the budget between February and September 2016, which derived from the capitalization of the Federal Government to Petróleos Mexicanos, as well as from the financial lease 299.1 billion pesos, contracting by Exploration and Production and Industrial Transformation. representing 146% of the planned investment Based on the above, the estimated investment expenditure for 2016 was adjusted to for the year $304.4 billion. The distribution of investment during the period mentioned above was as follows: • $241.2 billion pesos to Pemex Exploration and Production, of which $37.2 billion were allocated to exploration; • $45.2 billion to Pemex Industrial Transformation; • $7 billion to Pemex Logistics; • $3.6 billion to Pemex Drilling and Services; • $1 billion to Pemex Corporate; • $0.7 billion to Pemex Ethylene; and • $0.4 billion to Pemex Fertilizers: CRUDE OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION In 2016, crude oil production reached 2,154 Mbd, which exceeded the production target for the first time in the last five years. However, as compared to 2015, it decreased by 113 Mbd, equivalent to 5%. The main causes of this reduction were the following: • A 6.3% decrease in production of light crude oil, primarily as a result of a natural decline in production of fields located in the Litoral de Tabasco and Abkatún-Pol-Chuc business units. This reduction was partially offset by a 70.6% increase in production at the Xanab field of the Southwestern Marine region, which contributed with an average of 127 Mbd during 2016, as compared to 74.4 Mbd in 2015. • Less production of heavy crude oil as a result of a natural decline in production and an increase in the fractional water flow of wells in highly fractured deposits of the Cantarell business unit in the Northeastern Marine region. • A slight decrease in the production of extra-light crude oil by 11 Mbd, primarily due to a natural decline in production and an increase in the fractional water flow of wells of fields in the Bellota-Jujo, Samaria-Luna and Macuspana-Muspac projects of the South region, as well as in the Litoral de Tabasco business unit of the Southwestern Marine region.

The completion of wells decreased by 52.2% during 2016, from 312 to 149 wells, mainly due to a decrease in the completion of development wells. This was largely because of a scheduled reduction of activities at the Aceite Terciario del Golfo and Burgos business units in the Northen region, and a decrease of activities at the SamariaLuna, Macuspana-Muspac and Cinco Presidentes business units of the Southern region: as a result of the budget adjustments approved at the beginning of the year. During 2016, Pemex focused its exploration activity in the search for hydrocarbons in shallow waters and land areas of the Southeastern Basins, as well as in deep waters in the Perdido Area project. The company prioritized the drilling of exploratory wells and the processing of 3D seismic data, in order to increase the geological knowledge of the basins and to identify possible deposits of hydrocarbons. As a result of these works, important discoveries were made in the Southeastern Sea Basins with the Pokche-1, Teca-1 and Uchbal-1 wells, which resulted in oil and gas producers, adding 383 million barrels of crude oil equivalent (MMboe) to 3P reserves. In the province of the Perdido Fold Belt, two new fields were discovered with the exploratory wells Nobilis-1 and Doctus-1, which also resulted in oil and gas producers, contributing together 301 MMboe. Sustainability Report 2016 89 Regarding our reserves, the exploration activities carried out in 2016 have enabled to soften the rhythm to which the 1P reserve was decreasing. As of January 1, 2017, from the total of the nation’s 1P reserves, 7,219 million barrels of crude oil, condensates and liquids from plants, as well as 6,984 billion cubic feet (MMMcf) of dry gas, were assigned to Petróleos Mexicanos. The reserve-production ratio for proven reserves is 7.7 years. 3P reserves are in the process of opinion and approval by the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH, by its acronym in Spanish).

Note: All units are expressed at atmospheric conditions, and assume 15.6 ° C and 14.7 pounds of pressure per square inch. In 2016, the integrated restitution rate of proven 1P reserves was 4%. This value represents a favorable result as compared to that obtained in 2015. The positive value results from the incorporation of 57 MMboe of proven reserves in new fields, and the decrease by 17 MMboe due to a reclassification of reserves by developments, behavioral reviews and delimitation. The increases in proven reserves were in the fields of Ayatsil, Tekel, Utsil and Maloob; and the reductions are related to the Jujo-Tecominoacán fields, the fields of the Antonio J. Bermudez complex, as well as to the marine fields (Tsimin, Ixtal, Kuil and Xux). NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION Natural gas production was 5,792.5 MMcfd, of which 4,851.4 MMcfd corresponded to hydrocarbon gas (it does not include 15 MMcfd of CO2 and 926 MMcfd of nitrogen).

On the other hand, the hydrocarbon gas released into the atmosphere amounted to 511.4 MMcfd, 17.3% more than last year. This increase was due to the incident on the Abkatún-A platform in February and to operational problems in compression systems. Thus, the use of natural gas was 91.2%. The efforts to increase the use of gas resulted in a decrease in the levels of gas released into the atmosphere, amounting to 392.7 MMcfd during the last month of the year. Moving forward, additional actions committed with the CNH are to be implemented in order to increase the use of gas and reduce emissions to the atmosphere, with the purpose of reaching the value of 98% indicated in the regulation.

The Cárdenas-Mora fields are located 62 km away from Villahermosa, Tabasco. The first field covers approximately 104 km2 and the second one 64 km2. Altogether, they contribute with around 94 MMboe in 3P reserves as of January 1st, 2016, and are currently producers of extra-light crude oil. The Ogarrio field is located in Huimanguillo, Tabasco, 65 km away from Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz; and covers approximately 153 km2, accounting for 54 MMboe in 3P reserves as of January 1st, 2016. A significant amount of infrastructure and communications lines have been developed on this project, which currently produces light crude oil. Sustainability Report 2016 92 INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION Operational information During 2016, total crude oil processing amounted to 933 Mbd, decreasing by 12.3%, as compared to 2015, primarily due to non-scheduled shutdowns at the Madero and Minatitlán refineries, as well as to failures in auxiliary services and high inventories of intermediate products (distillates).

The total petroleum products output decreased by 12.6%, as compared to 2015, as a result of lower crude oil processing and distillate yields. The Cadereyta, Madero and Minatitlán refineries accounted for the majority of the decrease, due to non-scheduled shutdowns and maintenance activities. Petroleum products production at the refineries accounted for 945.1 Mbd; the volume of gasoline was 310.4 Mbd, and diesel was 216.2 Mbd, decreasing by 59.9 Mbd and 58.5 Mbd, respectively, as compared to 2015. The production of jet fuel registered a decrease of 5 Mbd. Fuel oil production averaged 228.1 Mbd, 3.9% less than the previous year, mainly due to a lower crude oil process and the reduction of heavy crude oil in the mix of the SNR.

The total production of petrochemicals decreased by 9.0% compared to 2015, reaching The SNR recorded a variable refining margin of 4,100 Mt. This reduction was primarily caused by: • A 148 Mt decrease in production in the ethane´s derivatives chain, mainly due to a reduction in the supply of ethane in response to the startup of operations of the BraskemIdesa (Etileno XXI) ehtylene cracker, lower storage availability at the Pajaritos Ethylene Refrigerated Terminal and Port (TREEP, by its acronym in Spanish), and non-scheduled shutdowns at the Cangrejera petrochemical complex. • A 126 Mt decrease in production in the chain of propylene and derivatives, due to decreased availability of propylene, non-scheduled shutdowns, and an extended maintenance shutdown of the acrylonitrile facility at the Morelos complex. • A 42 Mt decrease in production in the methane derivatives chain, due to a lower output of ammonia and methanol as a result of operating problems, and a reduction in the supply of natural gas during the first half of the year. • A 139 Mt decrease in production of other petrochemicals, primarily due to a decrease in production of sulfur, hexane and raw material used for the production of carbon black, due to lower crude oil processing and sour wet gas. Sustainability Report 2016 95 PROCUREMENT AND SUPPLY In a new competitive economic environment characterized by low hydrocarbons prices, the roles of procurement and supply are key elements to satisfy in a timely and competitive manner the requirements of the user areas, as well as to achieve the objectives of our Business Plan. The Procurement tasks must be efficient and specialized in order to acquire the goods and services in the right quantity and quality, at the required price and time, with the best suppliers, aiming to optimize the profitability of the company and the long term relationship with its suppliers, within a framework of transparency and certainty. The transformation of procurement in Pemex has focused on the following strategies: the centralization of the role; the strategic sourcing and category management; the innovation and simplification of the contracting schemes; and the integrated management of suppliers. Centralization of the role of procurement: strengthening the governance of procurement process With the creation of the Corporate Office of Procurement and Supply (DOPA, by its acronym in Spanish), the procurement role has been centralized to ensure a better governance and management of the procurement process, as well as to efficiently and timely meet the needs of Pemex in an open market and competition. Since its inception, the structure of the purchasing team has been optimized to increase its productivity, the rules and processes of contracting have been reviewed and approved, and the digitization of the procurement process has been promoted. During 2016, significant progress was made in the homologation and standardization of contracting models, as well as in the implementation of electronic procurement. From the beginning of November 2016, all contracting processes are carried out electronically through the Pemex Electronic Contracting System (SISCeP, by its acronym in Spanish), guaranteeing greater transparency, certainty and efficiency in the procurement process. In order to facilitate the adoption of the system, online and face-to-face training schemes have been implemented. Since its implementation, more than 376 Pemex buyers (excluding user and support area training) and more than 761 representatives from 427 companies have been trained. Sustainability Report 2016 96 Strategic sourcing and category management: towards a competitive and sustainable purchase In order to improve the purchasing conditions of the products and services required by the business areas, DOPA has adopted the methodology of strategic sourcing and category management for 80% of expenditure with the aim of maximizing the economic value creation. In order to evaluate the market offer and to identify the best ways to achieve short and long term savings, the methodology sets out the steps to be taken with the purpose of having a robust analysis of what to buy, to whom, when to buy and how to buy. On the other hand, the category management enables us to strengthen the strategic approach of procurement by moving from a traditional approach of purely transactional and administrative purchases towards a value management approach, evaluating the total cost of ownership, and establishing the most adequate strategies for contracting and supply chain risk management. To date, 40 categories have been identified, representing more than 80% of Pemex’s strategic purchases based on expenditure. By the end of 2016, there were 30 categories approved by the Strategic Supply Group (GAE, by its acronym in Spanish), made up of officials from the Operative Direction of Procurement and Supply, the Corporate Finance Department and the Legal Department, as well as from the Institutional Unit of Internal Control and Internal Audit, whose purpose is to guarantee certainty and transparency in the decision making of the contracting strategies that are defined for these categories. Innovation in procurement schemes: simplify and expedite procurement Alternatively, the use of contracting schemes such as preparatory contracts and referential agreements has been promoted with the aim of accelerating and simplifying contracting processes and obtaining better purchasing conditions. The preparatory contracts are legal instruments that establish a unilateral commitment on the part of those suppliers that have commercial exclusivity or an exclusive right of sale, in order to supply Pemex with goods and services without compromising the budget. Those are granted directly and imply a justified exception for open tender procedures. Referential agreements are legal instruments that are held with two or more suppliers of goods and services that are recurrently contracted to establish approved terms and conditions, which simplify the procurement process without compromising the budget. Integrated management of suppliers: link value solutions and manage risk The selection of the best suppliers that respond in a competitive and sustainable manner to the current and future needs of the Company requires the adoption of an integrated management of suppliers that enables the improvement of our knowledge about them and their value offer. This has the purpose of linking them effectively with the areas of business; establishing mechanisms to strengthen risk and compliance assessment of suppliers from the early stages of the procurement process; and during the execution of contracts, systematically monitoring their performance. Sustainability Report 2016 97 Knowing and bonding with our suppliers In 2016, the supplier registration and evaluation scheme was consolidated. The registry is divided into two levels: a basic registry, in which legal and commercial general information of the company is requested; and an extended registry, in which more financial information, certifications and commercial experience are required. Two years after the implementation of the supplier registration and evaluation scheme, there is a database of more than 5,530 registered suppliers whose information is visible to buyers and user areas in the Comprehensive Supplier Information Tool (HIIP, by its acronym in Spanish). Nowadays, it is required for any company that wants to establish a business relationship with Pemex, to be registered so that we can know and evaluate its value offer. Moreover, the attention to suppliers was strengthened through the Pemex Access Point to the Supply System (PASS, by its acronym in Spanish) initiative, which has served and provided advice to more than 1,500 suppliers. Strengthening the compliance and risk management of our suppliers During 2016, we also strengthened the supplier risk management by the implementation of a comprehensive approach to assess their business situation. This comprehensive assessment includes the following aspects, depending on the criticality of the supplier’s business: verification of the information and documentation provided in the registry; business qualification taking into consideration legal, commercial, financial and certification aspects; risk reports prepared by an independent specialist; and, if necessary, audits at the facilities of the suppliers. Verification of supplier compliance was also strengthened with the formalization of collaboration agreements with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS, by its acronym in Spanish), Institute of the National Fund for Workers’ Housing (INFONAVIT, by its acronym in Spanish), the Tax Administration Service (SAT, by its acronym in Spanish), and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (STPS, by its acronym in Spanish), in order to exchange information regarding compliance with suppliers’ fiscal and labor obligations. In addition, there is an alert service to verify that companies are not sanctioned by national or international authorities for financial matters, money laundering, financing of terrorism and arms trafficking, among others. Verification is performed daily on more than 540 lists of published sanctions.

Since 2015, the Corporate Office of Procurement and Supply has promoted internal campaigns with contract managers to evaluate the performance of relevant suppliers of Pemex through a questionnaire that incorporates additional aspects to the management of contracts such as their understanding of business and customer service, innovation and human resources management, among others. By the end of 2016, there was a performance evaluation of 176 contracts from 66 relevant suppliers. The mediumterm objective is to progressively expand the universe of evaluated suppliers and strengthen the systematization of performance evaluation. The implementation of a solid supplier performance management system is essential to improve risk management and long-term competitiveness, as it provides the necessary elements to privilege longterm relationships with suppliers that demonstrate good performance, as well as to discard those with negative historic performance. Strengthening a sustainable procurement The company has made significant progress to strengthen the sustainability of its supply chain. On the one hand, the Supplier Evaluation and Accountability Program (PERP, by its acronym in Spanish) was implemented. It consists on conducting audits at the facilities of suppliers that are strategic to Pemex because of their criticality for business, recurrence and contracting amounts. This program aims to improve risk management and promote the sustainable development of our supply chain while strengthening long-term business relationship and enhancing industry standards through a transparent framework. Audits are conducted annually at the supplier’s facilities by an independent third party to ensure impartiality and transparency. The distinctiveness of the audit protocol is that it is comprehensive since it includes the review of five key aspects: Corporate Social Responsibility, Business Quality and Management, Environmental Management, Health and Safety, and Human Resources Management. Each of the evaluated aspects has a specific weight according to its importance for the oil and gas sector. During 2016, 47 audits were conducted and involved more than 547 executives from our suppliers. There were identified 176 areas for improvement for which correction plans were requested. This is the first time an exercise of this nature has been implemented. The purpose is to strengthen the buyer-supplier relationship and trust in a transparency framework that provides greater certainty that suppliers systematically comply with current regulations and industry standards. In the future, other suppliers will be incorporated to this program. Likewise, in order to promote a supply chain that is committed to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), a program was launched in collaboration with the Mexican Center for Philanthropy (CEMEFI, by its acronym in Spanish), which aims to recognize the CSR as an additional component of the cost-benefit assessment for decision-making in the field of contracting, as the big oil operators do, assuming a strategic attitude of relationship and development of our suppliers. Sustainability Report 2016 99 The program was divided in two stages; a first stage of diagnosis to know the supplier’s maturity level of Social Responsibility, and a second stage of implementation to drive a strategy of improvement, adoption and acknowledgement of CSR. In phase one of this program, 44 companies participated, 28 of which were SMEs. This program enabled Pemex to be recognized as an Entity Promoting Social Responsibility. Based on this commitment, we will continue working on promoting every year this aspect in our supply chain. Commitment to Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Given the contribution to the national GDP and its relevance as a source of job creation, Pemex is committed to continue promoting procurement strategies that enable the development of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that are competitive and committed to the development of their region. Pemex accounts for nearly 1,000 suppliers classified as MSMEs. In 2016, 2,911 million pesos were contracted to these MSMEs, mainly in services of installation, repair and maintenance of machinery, other equipment and tools. The main Federal States purchasing to MSMEs are Mexico City, Tabasco, Nuevo Leon, Veracruz, Estado de Mexico, Campeche, Tamaulipas, among others. Contracts by type of procurement from MSMEs Goods 46% Work 42% Services 12% Pemex participates in the Government Purchasing Program to MSMEs, implemented by the Ministry of Economy, by being part of the ten main purchasers. By 2017, the goal established for purchases to MSMEs is 2,933 million pesos. In this area, it is important to emphasize the participation of Pemex in the Program for Economic Reactivation and Productive Development for the states of Campeche and Tabasco promoted by the Federal Government, emphasizing the regularization of accounts payable to suppliers and schemes of non-consolidated open competitions for those goods and services in which there is local supply. Thus, in spite of the complicated situation of liquidity, we were able to regularize debts from year 2015 with suppliers and contractors at the end of 2016.
