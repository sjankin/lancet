In 2017, we plan to align our work in this area in line with ISO 37001. Measurement of outcomes Human Rights 4C Strategies became a corporate partner to the City of Stockholm’s Social Mission, a NGO whose mission it is to provide shelter, food, education, health care for the most vulnerable people in Stockholm. As part of this sponsorship, we have collected clothes, toys and other personal items for the poor. During 2017, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Human Rights has been received. Labour The average gender ratio for 2017 was 30 % women (34 % in 2014-2016). In other words, we have lost some ground and will have to regroup in 2018. We contracted an outside expert on the topic of master suppression technique to conduct a workshop with all employees at the Stockholm office, in order to increase awareness of deliberate and non-deliberate use. During 2017, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Labour has been received. Environment  We continue use 100 % fossil free electricity at the Stockholm office and changed supplier in 2017, to one that contributes part of their annual profit to charities (GodEl).  Our travel policy was changed to stipulate compulsory rental of most environmentally friendly choice of cars.  We started to fully climate compensate all our business flights.  Our recycling scheme now has more fractions as plastics have been added to the list. Anti-corruption Some employees participated in an ISO 37001 course and as a next step, they will run an inhouse workshop on the same topic. Train the trainer. During 2017, no complaint or legal issue related to Corruption has been received. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62
