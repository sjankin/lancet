ALL SYSTEMS GO! The Aitken Spence Group has spent the last 149 years building and honing a portfolio of key industry sectors that now includes tourism, maritime and logistics, strategic investments and services. The Group has endured nearly one and a half centuries of business by keeping our focus on the long term perspective and never losing sight of the fact that what we do today will have a significant influence on who we are tomorrow. Sustainability remains the key watchword, both in our businesses and the ‘green’ awareness and achievements that are synonymous with our brand. Last year’s report discussed how we made several major investments in order to serve our stakeholders with long term returns and enduring value. This report describes the development of those investments into dynamic channels of sustainable revenue, clearly demonstrating that we are ‘all systems go!’ for outstanding value creation to the many stakeholders we serve.
