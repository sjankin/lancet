Both as employees and executive team, we reaped all the benefits of acting in Equanimity and Discretion that we mentioned of last year when we were talking about the management philosophy of our company. In fact, the fact that companies exist with their principles and characters is proven once again. The onset of our P.A.S.S. (Practical, Applicable, Sustainable Solutions / Systems) Management system that is the major project launched in 2016 was actually consistent with this. While placing the finance and sales headings necessary for companies to survive in the last row as the survival column, we placed the heading of People that is the biggest asset of a company to the middle of the system as the main block and the heading of Character that a company should have in order to move the company to the future with firm steps and be proud of its achievements to the top row. While principles, strategies and systems are especially under the heading of Character of this integrity of systems comprising of 3 main blocks, we actually discussed the main theme of sustainability under the heading of People. With this perspective, obvious increases were obtained in our employee satisfaction surveys and we slightly improved our physical working conditions based on the observations and suggestions of our employees. While creating social spaces and environments, we crowned our internal portal, where all of our employees can freely express their opinions and have friendly chats, with an enjoyable infrastructure enriched with visual aspects that focuses on the interests of employees and where small competitions can be organized among employees. We have not forgotten the fact that we need to invest in the future as individuals leading lives apart from our business lives and to contribute to science and art and we were the generous supporter/donor of CERN (European Council for Nuclear Research) in 2016 and we tried to contribute by following closely CERN projects and expressing our opinions. MLS HOLDİNG BM GLOBAL PRINCIPLES CONTRACT PROGRESS REPORT 2016 Toward the end of this year, we started discussions with the creators of the project Turkey's Engineers Girls , which we believe to be very important for our country. With the conviction that gender-based business conduct is very primitive in the present day and that all business lines, including field work, should be considered independently of gender discrimination, we have formed a project team so that our field engineers can work with the young talents to be evaluated through the project and our discussions are progressing rapidly. In 2017, we have full faith in that we will carry out successful projects both in the field and in office with eligible candidates and take results that will support our faith. I heartily believe that these steps will be successful for increasing the number of female employees in the field branches of all our companies that create intense women employment opportunities in administrative positions. Notwithstanding our life and working conditions, we know that we will achieve success in a sustainable future with our investments in environment and human and without compromising our basic principles and characteristic traits perhaps with small but firm steps, and I would like to thank once again the Global Compact, which sheds light on this awareness.

The translation into Turkish of the comment by Mr. Sami Özdemir, who was appreciated by the foundation for his evaluations and comments, which appeared in the article in the magazine is: “Building the Future” We need more public involvement in science and evidence-based decision-making and policy making and talented young people who want to make a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics in order to overcome important challenges in the 21st century. These skills and knowledge are important factors that will form the basis for a sustainable planet and the foundation of the prosperity of all people. Since its foundation in 2014, CERN & Society Foundation has contributed to increase the influence of CERN on society and particularly, to ensure that young talented people are raised and transferred to the future. Cern & Society projects, inspired or launched by CERN, have gone beyond the specific research task of the organization. “I believe that the future is shaped by people who care about the civilization regardless of the differences and conditions”. MLS HOLDİNG BM GLOBAL COMPACT PROGRESS REPORT FOR 2016 09 ANTI-CORRUPTION Corruption can be defined as willingness to act in a dishonest and fraudulent manner for personal gains. Person(s) who holds/hold an executive/authorized position and to whom payment is made for making a decision in favour of the payer and similarly, the payer(s) are involved in the corruption. Corruption increases the cost of business transactions; leads to unfair competition, shatters creativity and damages social structures. In the grand scheme of things, it hinders economic development. Thus, Mls Holding adopts a transparent management understanding and acts in its practices within the limits of laws. As an indication of our determinism toward anti-corruption, we decided to set AntiCorruption Policy at the end of 2015 and Mls Holding Business Ethics Rules as of 2016.
