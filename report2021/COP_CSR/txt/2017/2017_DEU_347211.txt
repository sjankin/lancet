That is true for people and businesses alike. KRONES seeks to ensure that everything we do is as consistent with the principle of sustainability as possible. It is part of our corporate strategy. However, we can only be successful in this if we engage all of our stakeholders and work together to align our relationships and actions to this purpose – ourselves and our employees, our customers, and our s­ uppliers. We welcome every contribution to this process. We work continually to improve the way we develop sustainable ­approaches and integrate them into our business processes. Our sustainability report reflects the contributions we are making within our business environment and the results we have achieved. 2 Content KRONES compact Economic Environmental Statement by the Executive Board . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Economic responsibility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40 Environmental . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .78 Executive Board member statements . . . . . . . . . . 6 Economic responsibility Responsibility for the environment Further developing a high degree of Ecological aspects of our production . . . . . . . . . .80 Our products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 flexibility and efficiency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42 Energy and media conservation The KRONES Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10 Responding flexibly to market changes . . . . . 45 in production operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 82 Our attitudes and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Production: Our supply chain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 Reducing pollution and Compliance – Ensuring ethics hazardous materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .88 Transparent supply chain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 52 and integrity in all that we do . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 Making optimum use Lean manufacturing (TPM) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55 KRONES’ CSR strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 of production materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 95 Our products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .58 Report from the CSR Committee . . . . . . . . . . . . . .24 Environmental – Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . .98 Securing our future with Organisational framework for innovative solutions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60 sustainability activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 Technological leadership . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63 Our sustainability report . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .28 Energy and media efficiency and Materiality matrix for KRONES AG . . . . . . . . . . . . .30 environmental sustainability Big social picture informs of our products . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65 the details of our strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Programmes to ensure Stakeholder dialogue – long-lived machines . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .72 An overview of our stakeholders . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 Fast, individual service for all Company – Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .39 KRONES customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .73 Long-term, personalised relationships with customers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74 Economic – Goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76 About the KRONES Sustainability Report 3 This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Our commercial success is essential to the company’s future. As we continue to build our market position, we also accept our social responsibility. Our business strategy ensures secure employment for more than 14,000 people worldwide, not including the employees of our supply chain partners. Our primary objective is to be competitive and to operate sustainably. We review our strategies and orientation on an ongoing basis and adapt them to the prevailing economic environment. Within our Value strategy programme, we have amended our previous target set of 7/7/20 and are now aiming for 7/8/22 through the year 2020. Details on these targets can be found in our 2016 Annual Report. With higher earnings, we mean to generate more cash with which to invest in research and development, IT, and state-of-the-art production facilities and buildings. In this way, we are making our sites ready for a sustainable future. Profitability is crucial to our success here. But it is not everything. We promote our employees’ professional development with ongoing skill-building and training opportunities. We are currently ­developing a new programme for this purpose. Conserving resources is the second core aspect of our sustainable management apWe are improving material effiproach. We seek to minimise the environmental impact of our activities.

Thus, we are purposefully evolving our sites in line with the way our Lifecycle Services (LCS) team has already been operating for many years. Research and development is the third pillar of our sustainable business strategy. Our enviro management system, which has been certified by TÜV SÜD, gives us an excellent tool for developing resource-friendly technology. The enviro criteria for designing energy and media-efficient products are updated on a regular basis to always keep pace with the latest state of the art. As a result, our customers have access to a broad range of resource-friendly machinery. We expanded enviro 2.0 in 2016 and now conduct evaluations of entire systems as well as individual machines and process models. This programme expansion is especially important with respect to KRONES cOMPAcT | Statement by the Executive Board 5 machines and lines used in the production of beer and soft drinks as they can now be assessed as complete systems under enviro. In this way, we are tapping potential energy and media savings for our customers in the brewing process and in the bottling and canning of beer and non-alcoholic soft drinks. Thus, we are helping our ­customers improve their environmental performance in production. As we have ­indicated in past reports, there is still certainly room to expand the enviro options in our new machinery business. krones compact Our Lifecycle Service (LCS) portfolio includes a number of products and services Our Lifecycle Service team provides that help keep our machines and lines operating efficiently throughout their entire a wide range of products and services to help ensure long useful lives useful lives. It is designed for customers who are already using KRONES machines in of KRONES machines and lines at our their plants. As a “Partner for Performance”, we support these customers to ensure customers’ plants. efficient operation of our machines and lines for the long term. We operate in a market with a secure future. The world’s population is growing and, with it, so is the number of consumers. That means we can expect demand for our products to remain high for the long term. Nevertheless, the competition is stiff, not only in Europe but also in China. To address this fact, we are improving our processes and continually evolving our products. Digitalisation offers development potential for our company and for the sustainable design of production and all business processes. It enables us to help our customers develop their business models. For example, they can use available data to discover how they can operate their machines more efficiently and reduce downtimes and resource consumption. We have developed a comprehensive package of measures aimed at ensuring our competitiveness on the market, even when times are tough. We must further reduce our costs and lead times while at the same time maintaining our high standard of quality. I am confident that we will master the challenges that are yet to come with respect to corporate sustainability, in terms of both economics and the environment. That is due in large part to the untiring dedication of our employees, whom I would like to thank at this time. Our Code of Conduct provides excellent guidance for our activities. We are fully committed to abiding by and enforcing this code. It is based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, which inform our every action.

We are fair and forthright in our inter­ actions. Honesty, transparency and integrity inform all of our actions. We are interested in the thoughts and opinions of our employees and partners and are willing to learn from others. krones compact Krones – We do more. KRONES Code of Conduct Ensuring that our employees’ actions are ethical and lawful KRONES has been a constant in the beverage and packaging machinery market for Our Code of Conduct is available to the public.

It is intended to ensure that our actions are always lawful, ethical, and responsible, both within and outside the company. The clear, unequivocal rules laid out in the Code of Conduct are binding for all KRONES employees – including the Executive Board, management, and every member of our staff worldwide. The provisions of the Code of Conduct form an integral part of every employment contract at KRONES. All employees within the KRONES Group abide by local national laws in their im­ plementation of the Code of Conduct. In this way, we can be certain that our employees act in accordance with clear rules that are easy to understand and follow and therefore serve as a guide for their daily work. That is the basis for ensuring compliance with laws, standards, policies, and guidelines company-wide. All employees are expected to not only comply with the guidelines in the Code of Conduct in a formal sense but to live and breathe them. That engenders the culture of openness and compliance that informs our activities daily. To communicate this expectation credibly and reliably, both within and outside the company, we systematically investigate and take disciplinary action on ­violations of the Code of Conduct. KRONES compact | Our attitudes and actions 15 KRONES’ Supplier Code Responsibility is also an important factor within our value chain Our Supplier Code serves as the foundation for our relationships with suppliers. This The Supplier Code is available oncode compiles the high standards of ethical, sustainable action to which we hold our line at https://www.krones.com/ media/downloads/krones-suppliersuppliers. code_en.pdf. The most important message of the Supplier Code, which we revised in 2016, is that krones compact we expect our business partners to adhere to standards such as the ten principals of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines, and the UN Guiding Principles on ­Business and Human Rights. In addition, some requirements are worded more strongly and explicitly presented as requisite to having a business relationship with KRONES. These criteria include compliance with environmental regulations as well as comprehensive guidance with respect to fighting corruption and handling conflicts of interest. In order to disseminate these standards on ethical practices, the code also calls on our business partners to promote this dialogue with their own business partners. In that way, our business partners are further conveying the standards laid out in our Supplier Code to their own suppliers and subcontractors. The Supplier Code is part of the ordering process and, as part of our general terms and conditions, a binding component of every procurement contract.

In addition, our Compliance Committee serves an advisory role. In the committee, the Compliance Officer shares information and ideas with representatives of the highest levels of management for each area of Executive Board responsibility. Our Internal Audit department is another partner supporting our efforts to detect non-compliance. In keeping with the international nature of our group, we began in 2014 to introduce KRONES AG’s compliance system at our subsidiaries in Germany and worldwide. Since 2016, we now have regional compliance representatives in place who are given specific training and information before beginning their work. Their main tasks are in the realm of prevention since they are familiar with local circumstances in the ­regions and are available to respond quickly to important questions. Thus, they are able to support employees in their day-to-day work. Our aim is to ensure that our position with respect to all aspects of compliance is consistent and reliable worldwide. We thoroughly examine all foreseeable issues ­relating to compliance and train our employees so that they know how to handle them. We also conduct compliance risk analyses within our parent company and branch offices and closely monitor business processes. In addition, we may audit business partners with respect to compliance aspects on a case-by-case basis ­(third-party due diligence). Our Code of Conduct provides a framework for all matters relating to proper conduct. All policies are available and It is complemented by our Supplier Code, which communicates our requirements ­accessible to all employees in ­KRONES’ Intranet as a reference with respect to ethical practices to our suppliers. Our compliance management syswhen questions arise in their tem fills this framework with clear guidelines in the form of concrete policies for ­day-to-day work. each area of our business across the group. All policies are drafted by the departments and reviewed by our compliance team prior to approval by the Executive Board as a whole. Every employee is then informed about the policies that are important and relevant to his or her work by way of established communication channels. The compliance team also conducts training sessions on specific topics of ­relevance to specific employee groups to raise awareness among these employees. Besides this training, the internal communication network, KRONES inside, and the employee magazine KRONES world are also used as channels for conveying infor­ mation on all compliance-related matters. KRONES compact | Compliance – Ensuring ethics and integrity in all that we do 17 In addition, a compliance help desk provides our employees with rapid support in ­resolving questions. Employees can also report violations of laws or policies to the help desk.

To support our ­employees beyond their fundamental training in this respect, we have introduced the compliance programme at the national and international levels and made the e-learning programme a mandatory part of employee training across the board. £ In 2016, Compliance representatives for the regions were appointed and trained. £ At the international level, our main focus in terms of compliance training in 2016 was on our European offices. £ We intend to roll out the compliance programme in offices in South America and Asia in 2017. The newly consolidated companies SYSTEM LOGISTICS, Italy, and TRANS-MARKET in North America will also be integrated into the compliance programme. KRONES compact | Compliance – Ensuring ethics and integrity in all that we do 18 In order to establish transparent principals for business processes in all areas and for all employees, new policies were drafted by the individual business areas, reviewed by the compliance team, and approved by the Executive Board. £ With respect to compliance and corporate governance, our revision of the ­Supplier Code and new policies on competition and data storage and protection are of particular relevance. krones compact £ Other areas on which our compliance work focused include a transfer pricing policy from our finance department and a policy on the use of social media from our corporate communications department. The launch of our anti-corruption programme was an important focus of activities in 2016. This programme serves as basic training for all conceivable cases of corruption in relation to our business activities. £ The programme is designed as in-person training for employees who have regular contact with third parties. The primary target groups for this training are our sales, procurement, service, and installation teams as well as quality management, corporate communications, and human resources. £ In 2016, 1,186 people completed this training.

We are starting this roll-out at KRONES Inc. in the USA and KOSME S.r.l. in ­Italy. We intend to train approximately 1,600 employees at our international sites over an extended period. In terms of prevention, we stepped up our risk analysis efforts in 2016. £ Our nine-category risk analysis of KRONES AG and subsidiaries showed our compliance-related processes to be at a good level.

We joined the UN Global Compact in 2012 and have made its ten principles the imperative basis for action within our company.

We are committed to these principles and have made detailed risk analysis, which underlies all decision-making on product development them available at https://www. and the development of our production sites. krones.com/en/company/responsi­ bility/values-and-management. Our overarching corporate strategy, Value, also serves as the basis for defining our php#7180. CSR strategy. The four pillars of Value – quality, profitability, growth, and innovation – cover all sustainability-related tasks. Thus, our master strategy takes into account topics relating to economic, environmental, and social responsibility. Our employees are crucial to successful implementation of our Value strategy. With their innovative ideas, steady focus on customer needs, and high level of dedication, they enable us to strengthen and grow our position worldwide. For this reason, we will continue to ensure that our people have a secure, suitable framework in which to operate. In the medium term, our CSR strategy with respect to labour practices and decent work is aimed at further developing the framework for our employees at our sites worldwide (see pages 100 to 131). Offering a range of products that meet the highest sustainability criteria is another key part of our strategy. With the enviro programme, we offer our customers “bestin-class” machines and lines that operate as efficiently as currently possible with ­respect to resource and media consumption. This programme has been implemented across our entire product development process and offers reliable guidance for building eco-efficient machines. Certification of this management system enables us to apply standardised processes to the development of environmentally friendly machines (pages 65 to 75). This environmental awareness is also alive and strong within our production sites. Conserving resources and reducing energy consumption are the main points. By ­defining a CO2 reduction target, we have committed to taking responsibility for countering the possible consequences of climate change as a company. The CO2 ­reduction target applies to direct and indirect energy-related emissions and aims to reduce these emissions by 30% to 40% per €1 million in revenue using 2010 as the base year. We also look at other indirect (Scope 3) emissions (pages 78 to 97). KRONES compact | KRONES’ CSR strategy 23 Our society-related activities are constantly evolving. We see ourselves as a partner within our business environment and take our stakeholders’ concerns into account. We will define further actions to take in this regard to further expand our involvement in the community and increase communication with stakeholders (pages 132 to 143). Our sustainability efforts are based on the targets defined by the CSR Teams. Our krones compact ­annual CSR Report presents our CSR activities and the annual progress report required as part of our membership in the UN Global Compact. The CSR Teams review and, as needed, adjust the topics and aspects covered in our CSR Report on a regular basis. The CSR Report is reviewed and approved by the Executive Board prior to ­publication. Evolution of sustainability topics In 2016, in accordance with an Executive Board decision, we began expanding our CSR activities to our international sites and introduced the sustainability reporting guidelines there. Additional actions taken as part of our CSR efforts are described in the “Goals and actions” section of each chapter of this report. KRONES compact | KRONES’ CSR strategy 24 Report from the CSR Committee KRONES has bundled all of the company’s activities relating to sustainability and ­social responsibility in the CSR Officer and the CSR Committee. The committee consists of members from within and outside the company who enable the body to look at issues that are important to various stakeholder groups. As members of the committee, the Chairman of the Executive Board and Chairman of the Supervisory Board participate in CSR Committee meetings on a regular basis. In this way, decision-makers at the highest levels of management and supervision directly address the economic, envikrones compact ronmental, social, and societal aspects. Thus, important content is conveyed directly to the company’s most senior decision-makers. Experts from the individual departments give the members of the committee a comprehensive view of the company’s CSR activities and support decision-making on the direction these activities take. The results of this information exchange are then pursued further in the work of the ­Executive Board. In 2016, the CSR Committee held three meetings, thus achieving a close, regular ­exchange among the decision-making bodies, internal experts, and external parti­ cipants. Topics of focus for the CSR Committee in 2016 A comprehensive update of the measures relating to climate change worldwide The CSR Committee does not in accordance with the resolutions of the 21st Global Climate Conference (COP) in ­ex­plicitly deal with activities relating to economic aspects.

We base our efforts on ratings by the following third-party institutions: Oekom Research, ecovadis, and CDP. In addition, the certification company SGS conducted an audit on behalf of one of our key accounts in 2016 using a system that largely corresponds to that of the SMETA Audit conducted in 2015.

The programme will be rolled out groupwide starting in 2017.  enviro – sustainable products Besides assessing individual machines and process models under the enviro management system, we have also begun assessment of entire systems. In addition, a Lifecycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) was conducted for six KRONES systems for the bottling of sensitive high-acid beverages.  Status report: CO2 emissions target A review of the measures taken to implement our CO2 emissions target reveals that, despite shifts in our energy mix from year to year, we can expect to achieve our reduction target by 2020. Occupational health management A pilot project was launched in Nittenau that aims to gain information about occupational health, assess what needs to be done, and lay the foundations for strategic health management. Employee surveys, interviews with management, and analysis of the structures and measures currently in place were used to obtain a picture of the current situation at this site, which can then serve as a model. Internal communication Over a two-month period, 2,504 employees at our German plants participated in a survey on internal communication. The survey’s aim was to examine how relevant various channels of internal communication are to employees.  Social commitment We continued our collaboration with facilities for the education and care of children and youth in the Regensburg area on a Christmas celebration in 2016. This activity was also expanded to our Flensburg, Rosenheim, and Nittenau plants. Besides the holiday activity, KRONES also continues to support organisations that offer relief services for refugees. Regensburg’s CampusAsyl network was once again included in our charitable giving budget for 2016.

Similarly, we refer in this report to the Annual Report for the KRONES Group for each of the individual charts for information relating to risk and opportunity reporting. and tables. Consistency in the report’s scope The scope of this report is unchanged from the previous year. No new indicators have been measured and integrated into the report. The aspects presented here were once again submitted to the company’s management for review as part of the materiality analysis and were confirmed. The scope of this report is also unchanged with respect to the integration of our international sites. Thus, data for the KRONES Group are ­presented in the section on “Labour practices and decent work”. This is particularly relevant for the information on global workforce figures, the age structure of our workforce, and the information on gender, new hiring, and employee turnover in the regions. Acquisitions have changed the volume of data The volume of data, particularly in the “Labour practices and decent work” section, changed as a result of the addition of data from acquired companies, SYSTEM LOGISTICS, SpA, Italy, and TRANS-MARKET LLC, USA. The data for these companies has been included in our workforce data. However, no information on age structure is available for SYSTEM LOGISTICS. Any variations in the data sets are indicated in the marginal notes to each chart. There is also a small degree of imprecision in the presentation of the workforce age structure where birth dates are missing for some employees at some sites. The degree of imprecision is less than one percent. Another change can be seen in our presentation of employment types (job categories). Changes in the division of responsibilities among Executive Board members and the appointment of Christoph Klenk as Chief Executive Officer at the start of 2016 have ­resulted in some responsibilities shifting categories. As a result, some of the categories are no longer completely, directly comparable with the information from the ­previous year. As in the previous year, we are including emissions from freight forwarding as an ­estimate. We assigned the various shipments to their individual destination ports and linked them with emissions estimates provided by a shipping company. KRONES cOMPAcT | Our Sustainability Report 29 Additional information in some areas We are providing additional information on the compliance teams’ activities this year. In particular, activities relating to the anti-corruption programme are presented in greater depth. We have expanded the information presented for evaluating our stakeholder dialogue. We have also expanded the information reported on our CO2 reduction target through 2020 and now provide a table showing the progkrones compact ress we have made within our action plan. Another content change can be seen in our presentation of freight forwarding data. As a result of the new rail connection that went into operation last year, we have added a new figure to the chart on out­ going freight: the rail freight loads departing directly from our Neutraubling plant by way of our on-site platform. In order to present the rail containers in relation to truckloads, we have converted them into truckloads. We have expanded the information reported on the topic of occupational health and safety somewhat and now also include in an overview data on the duration of incapacity following a work-related accident and on days lost following a work-related ­accident in relation to the annual total number of working days. In addition, we are now reporting the rate of accidents per 1,000 employees separately for men and women. External assurance The 2016 Sustainability Report has been reviewed and approved by the Chairman of the Executive Board. As in the previous year, we commissioned external assurance of the report from TÜV SÜD in order to audit the information in terms of both quality and quantity. Details about the standards applied and the depth of the audit are presented in the auditing organisation’s certification, which is printed on the inside cover of this report. KRONES AG has no relationship with the auditing organisation beyond the engagement to perform an audit as part of the recertification of our management system. Our Executive Board and Supervisory Board supported the commissioning of external assurance.

This market is growing at a relatively stable rate of around 4% to 5% each year, driven by megatrends such as steady population growth, rising standards of living in the emerging markets, and urbanisation. Another factor driving growth is the rapidly increasing number and variety of packaging forms and beverage types. Broad portfolio secures KRONES’ market position Krones is one of the few one-stop shops in this market. We offer customers in the ­liquid food industry everything they need from a single source, from beverage ­production to filling to packaging. Intralogistics solutions and high-level after-sales service round out our portfolio. We offer products and services to cover everything from “simple” to “highly sophisticated”. Besides our big European competitors, a number of smaller providers are also active economic in our market. A growing number of those are in China. Most of our competitors only offer specific parts of a beverage plant or operate only in certain regions. KRONES’ turnkey approach puts the company in an excellent position and we intend to defend our strong market position in our core segment, machines and lines for product filling and decoration, and considerably strengthen our position in our two smaller segments, machines and lines for beverage production/process technology and ­machines and lines for the compact class. Responding to market volatilities with Value Just as the market offers opportunities, it also presents many challenges. Volatility in the global economy and at times acute crises in individual countries and regions are becoming almost standard. As a result, we must become more flexible, faster, and more regionally focussed. The Value strategy programme we launched in 2011 helped us to offset fluctuations in demand and meet our forecasts for revenue and earnings once again in 2016. All three segments contributed. Economic responsibility | Further developing a high degree of flexibility and efficiency 43 Actively managing risks Krones is exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to doing business globally. Comprehensive information on our We continuously monitor all significant business processes to identify risks early and risk management can be found on pages 118 to 129 of KRONES’ Annual to actively manage and limit them. Within our corporate strategy, we also identify, Report. analyse, and unlock opportunities. However, unlike risks, business opportunities are not documented within our risk management system. Krones’ risk management system consists of an internal control system with which we record, analyse, and ­assess all relevant risks. We monitor all material risks and any countermeasures ­already taken in a detailed, ongoing process that entails planning, information, and control. 7/8/22 – our new medium-targets through 2020 To keep moving the company forward for the long term, the Krones team has set new medium-term targets. 7/8/22 stands for: 7% revenue growth per year on average economic 8% EBT margin 22% working capital to revenue ratio As of 2017, working capital to revenue is Krones’ new third target, replacing ROCE. The main reasons for the change are that the new target provides greater trans­ parency and our employees can help shape it. These targets are certainly ambitious given the existing market challenges. The fight for orders remains intense. On the customers’ side of things, mergers and acquisitions are delaying capital investments and increasing customers’ buying power. Therefore, we do not expect prices to improve in the short or medium term. Moreover, increasing digitalisation and integration of production will forever change our market and its business models and require capital investment.

Revenue increased 6.9% year-on-year to €3,391.3 million. £ The increase is due in part to acquisitions. In 2016, the company purchased a ­majority stake in SYSTEM LOGISTICS and the majority of business operations of TRANS-MARKET. £ Adjusted for the acquisitions, revenue growth came to 4.2%. With that, KRONES has slightly exceeded its growth target of 3% for the year 2016. Our comprehensive range of products and services and our strong international presence supported the company’s growth. Balanced revenue The company’s revenue remains very well balanced internationally. The continuing trend towards ­beverage packaging made of PET £ As in 2015, KRONES generated 53.2% of consolidated revenue in the emerging plastic is an important factor for economic ­markets in the reporting period. Similarly, the mature markets (Germany, Western our business development. and Central Europe, and North and Central America) once again contributed 46.8% to consolidated revenue. The increase in consolidated revenue was sharper in Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East/Africa, and once again, North and Central America than elsewhere. £ New machinery and services business both contributed to our revenue growth in 2016. In terms of new machinery, KRONES benefited primarily from the continuing trend towards beverage packaging made of PET plastic. KRONES is the global ­technology leader in this area. £ The large installed base of existing machinery as well as our efforts to expand We received government subsidies our international service business and the resulting proximity to customers all totalling €63,530 in 2016. contributed to increasing our service revenue. Earnings stable despite heavy competition KRONES increased earnings again in 2016 despite the highly competitive markets. Thanks in large part to effects from the Value strategy programme, KRONES was able to keep its EBT margin stable in the reporting period despite the generally challenging market environment. £ Accomplishments under Value in 2016 include a higher degree of modularisation of our machines and lines and savings through local procurement of materials and services. Additional short-term cost savings also contributed to the better earnings. As expected, market prices provided no support. £ Earnings before taxes (EBT) rose 6.4% year-on-year, from €223.3 million to €237.6 million. The EBT margin remained unchanged year-on-year at 7.0%. Thus, Krones met its EBT margin target for 2016. Economic responsibility | Responding flexibly to market changes 46 Consolidated net income increased 8.2%, from €156.3 million in the previous year to €169.1 million in 2016, slightly more than earnings before taxes. That is because the company’s tax rate was lower year-on-year, from 30.0% to 28.8%. Earnings per share improved 8.4% in the reporting period, from €4.98 in the previous year to €5.40. £ Overall, KRONES exceeded its target for revenue growth in the reporting period and met its earnings target. KRONES’ third target, return on capital employed (ROCE – the ratio of EBIT to average net capital employed), decreased slightly from 17.7% in the previous year to 17.0% in the reporting period. With that, we did not achieve our ROCE target of 18% for 2016. Value creation at KRONES increased further The value added calculation presented here shows the KRONES Group’s contributions €68.5 million of our value added to the economy and society. It shows the value created by the company and how that went to the state in the form of tax payments. value is distributed among stakeholders. A company’s value added is calculated by economic ­deducting the expenses for production – that is, cost of goods and services purchased, depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets, and other operating expenses – from total operating performance (including other income and own work capitalised). KRONES generated €1,202 million in value added in 2016 (previous year: €1,136 million). £ The lion’s share of value added at KRONES (81.0% or €974 million) went towards our employees in 2016. Besides wages and salaries (€809 million), KRONES spent €165 million on social security contributions, pension plans, and employee benefits. Another €68.5 million or 5.7% of value added went to the state in the form of tax payments. £ In order to share the company’s success with shareholders, KRONES paid out €45.8 million in the form of dividends in the reporting period. In the year under ­review, €113.7 million in value added remained within the company and is available for investment in future growth.

Consistently high quality No complaints were filed regarding in our raw materials and third-party components is very important to us. Flexible, human rights or environmental ­impacts in 2016. on-time delivery of materials is also important for the reputation of KRONES machines on the market. Of course, comparing prices is also an essential part of our procurement policy. Orderly, well-managed processes across the entire supply chain are an essential part of how we operate at KRONES. For this reason, we focus on close, long-standing relationships with our suppliers, to ensure that we can count on the materials being of high quality. To ensure the stability of processes in this regard, we have incorporated the individual order processes into dedicated policies and codes which apply internally and ­externally. These policies and codes are: the Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code, our audit policy, and our procurement policy, to which we added a policy on supplier management in 2016. Process maps within our process model and the codes and policies listed above include specific provisions for auditing our suppliers and supply channels. In this way, KRONES ensures a verified procurement process. economic Suppliers thoroughly vetted Our supplier selection process uses a self-assessment form to gain an initial overview of a supplier’s capabilities, with questions on all relevant aspects of product range, technical qualifications, and current certifications. This self-assessment form requests that prospective suppliers confirm that they meet the requirements laid out in our Supplier Code. It also collects information on whether a prospective supplier has an environmental management system, environmental guidelines, and an occupational health and safety management system. In addition, we ask whether suppliers audit their own suppliers with respect to certifications and compliance with specific standards. In this way, our procurement decisions also take into con­ sideration issues further along the supply chain. Economic responsibility | Production: Our supply chain 51 Our central purchasing department bears responsibility for strategic procurement, for the organisation and execution of our procurement processes, across the entire KRONES Group. Our procurement policy, which describes all process flows and accountability, applies to 100% of our purchasing. Our purchasing activities take into account all legal requirements and standards that are relevant with respect to our suppliers. The self-declarations we require from suppliers and service providers enable us to ensure compliance with all laws and standards, including the core labour standards of the ILO (International Labour Organisation), as explicitly specified in our Supplier Code. System audits: Key aspect of supplier vetting We conduct on-site system audits on all potential new suppliers before establishing a supplier relationship. The procedure for system audits is laid out in our audit policy and is carried out in close collaboration between our purchasing department and our quality management team. For the selection, qualification, and development of economic suppliers, risk analysis on their environmental impact is done on the basis of the self-disclosure form and in the subsequent stages of qualification as part of the system audit. We also conduct renewal audits, particularly on strategically important suppliers. We perform construction site inspections to evaluate the situation at construction sites worldwide and the subcontractors working there. We conducted 181 such audits in 2016. Most of these were system and product audits. £ These audits did not result in any conclusions being made with respect to occu­ pational safety and health, environment, or human rights. £ As a result of cost-cutting measures, resource shortages, and more topic-specific audits, we conducted fewer construction site audits in 2016. £ In 2017, the number of audits is expected to be similar to the 2016 number. In ­determining which countries to focus on for our supplier audits, we closely follow our strategic purchasing department’s master sourcing strategy. Economic responsibility | Production: Our supply chain 52 Transparent supply chain KRONES produces the majority of its machines and lines in Germany – in Neutraubling, Nittenau, Rosenheim, Flensburg, and Freising. The subsidiary KOSME produces in Austria and Italy. KRONES manufactures spare parts at its Lifecycle Service (LCS) Centres in Franklin (USA), Taicang (China), and São Paulo (Brazil). We also produce machines for the Chinese market at our plant in Taicang. A line of fillers for water, a flash pasteuriser, and a palletiser are manufactured there specifically for our customers in China. Besides a total of seven LCS Centres at strategically important points, the company also has a global network of sales and service offices. Long-standing partnerships with our suppliers We rely on our close partnership with suppliers. Our Supplier Code serves as the New software for supplier manage­foundation for this partnership. It compiles all of our requirements and expectations ment will help ensure a high degree of transparency in our supply chain. of our suppliers and their responsibilities. Vendors can access the Supplier Code at economic krones.com. £ In 2016, we partnered with 2,002 suppliers with contract volumes of €50,000 or more. £ We terminated business relations with seven suppliers for legal, quality, or other reasons in 2016. This figure does not include suppliers with whom we did not place orders due to lack of need for their products or services. Comprehensive information as part of our sourcing process We have actively employed supplier management software since February 2017. £ We can use this software to evaluate supplier performance and individual sup­ pliers in accordance with the specifications of the relevant procurement category. Questionnaires can be customised to perfectly suit the respective procurement category, thus enabling us to refer much more specifically to the desired performance. £ All of the information collected on suppliers is stored in the sourcing tool and can be called up as needed by any member of our procurement team. £ As soon as the roll-out of the supplier lifecycle tool is complete, we will also be able to evaluate our suppliers on the basis of certifications (e.g. ISO 14001, ISO 50001) and available sustainability reporting. We expect to accomplish that by the end of 2017. Economic responsibility | Transparent supply chain 53 In 2016, we launched a stepped-up effort to conduct risk analyses of individual ­suppliers in collaboration with our corporate compliance team. £ Our risk analysis of new suppliers focuses on aspects that include D&B failure scores, country risk, debt ratio, currency risk, and political risk. In addition, we also query whether an environmental management system is in place, whether employees are properly trained, and whether separation of waste materials is practiced. Regional suppliers Krones is strengthening its global footprint. For this, the company will increasingly shift more procurement, engineering, and parts of production into the regions in which our customers operate their plants. Thus, local purchasing volumes will ­increase accordingly. £ This increased focus on local procurement is already in place in the USA, where We are further increasing our local we increased the portion of locally sourced material from 37% in 2015 to 46% in 2016. sourcing. Some of our LCS Centres economic already purchase more than 20% of £ In China, the share of locally sourced products has consistently been above 20%. needed materials locally. £ Our aim is to steadily enhance our presence worldwide and to further increase the share of local sourcing through 2020, with rates varying by region. £ We are gradually increasing our engineering capacity in the LCS Centres. Besides reducing the number of loads shipped by sea freight, this effort also serves to increase local value creation at our sites worldwide and, thus, promote sustainability. £ Our Supplier Code also applies to our local procurement activities in the regions. It is an integral part of purchasing agreements at our LCS Centres. Economic responsibility | Transparent supply chain 54 economic Our suppliers are multipliers Our Supplier Code specifies all of our expectations of our ­suppliers. It forms an integral part of every ordering process within our company. Our supply chain partners commit themselves to monitor and actively promote compliance with the basic principles at all of their sites and in all of their ­activities. The Supplier Code also formally requires that our business partners communicate the principals laid out in the Supplier Code to their subcontractors and other business partners. Thus, they call upon their own business partners to apply the same standards to their activities. Alois Bachfischer Head of Strategic Purchasing Lean manufacturing (TPM) 55 Lean manufacturing and total productive maintenance (TPM) are important to our ability to achieve our economic targets and ensure our company’s long-term success. They are part of our Value strategy and firmly established within the pillar entitled “profitability”. For this important aspect of our sustainability strategy, we have defined a number of approaches such as conserving materials, employing efficient machining processes, and optimising our use of consumables. Involving our employees directly in a number of optimisation projects enables us to integrate their practical ­experience. Efficient use of materials and supplies is the most important criterion for the manu­ facture of our machines and lines. £ The four main materials used in our machines are stainless steel, steel, aluminium, and plastic. In 2016, we used 16,700 metric tonnes of stainless steel, 2,800 metric tonnes of steel, 800 metric tonnes of aluminium, and 900 metric tonnes of plastic in Germany. economic £ In all, we purchased a total of 21,200 metric tonnes of these materials in 2016 ­(previous year: 20,560 metric tonnes). £ According to information from one of our suppliers, the share of recycled material in stainless steel is around 90%. £ The plastics used in our machines may contain a share of recycled material, ­depending on the parts in question. This share is defined in the specification sheet for the respective part and serves as a basis for our orders. Thus, certain parts contain 50% recycled plastic material. New machining centres increase efficiency We are continually evolving our production environment to further support cost-­ effectiveness in production. That includes investing in new, highly efficient machining centres. £ In 2016, a fibre laser cutting machine was put into operation in our sheet metal working shop. Instead of CO2, the laser’s light beam is created through fibre optic c­ able, which reduces energy consumption by 40% and increases efficiency and cutting speeds. Process steps that had to be completed manually in the past are now done ­automatically. For example, Liftmaster now automatically pulls the metal sheet from the adjacent storage area and places it on the work area. We receive improvement suggestions from employees working in our plants, which give us numerous ideas for improving efficiency. Employees enter their suggestions in the Brainpool portal, where they are then reviewed by department heads and a ­committee. £ In 2016, we received 1,353 submissions, which gave us great ideas with respect to sustainability. Of these proposals, we implemented 583 (or 43%). In the previous year, we registered 1,680 submissions and implemented 40% of them.

To secure our future, we are investing in innovation. As market demands and the needs of specific customer groups continue to evolve, we respond with targeted new and ongoing developments in our machinery port­ folio and in the services and software we offer. Responding to megatrends with targeted innovations The number and variety of beverage types and packaging forms is increasing ­unabated. To meet this trend, producers need highly versatile machines and lines. Another trend is the rising standard of living in the emerging markets and developing countries. These markets are very important for KRONES. In order to meet the needs of customers in these regions, we are adapting the technology of certain model series to regionally specific requirements. The digitalisation of production also offers good potential for long-term growth. We offer our customers products that are based on deep data integration and increasingly operate on the basis of new, economic digital business models. Our subsidiary SYSKRON plays an important role here. KRONES spent €171 million on research and development in the reporting period (previous year: €164 million). That represents 5.0% of consolidated revenue. The ­increase in the number of registered patents and utility models, from 4,450 in the previous year to 5,028 at the end of 2016, is evidence of our great capacity for ­innovation. Sustainability remains a crucial factor in our product development Innovation is a crucial part of our Value strategy.

We apply these criteria to our entire development programme. Economic | Our products | Securing our future with innovative solutions 61 Highest standards of compliance with regulations and customer ­specifications Regulations relating to machinery operation and safety are our guide. These include We do not use any parts based on applicable regulations of the EU as well as of the countries in which our machines nanotechnology in our machines and lines. will be used. We manufacture all machines in accordance with CE marking standards and can confirm that final acceptance of all machines is done in accordance with the EU’s Machinery Directive. In addition, we take into consideration numerous international norms and test noise emissions on new designs. Monitoring of compliance with regulations and standards is the responsibility of our quality assurance team. We also further test and document conformity with promised consumption values during the final acceptance process at our customers’ plant. Our plant planning activities are also conducted in accordance with the laws in ­effect where the plant is to be located. LEED certification requirements are available in our planning departments but are not yet in high demand among our customers. economic Our collaboration with large beverage groups often involves the incorporation of proprietary standards for plant planning and resource conservation. Compliance with these standards is always a binding part of any contract.

In conjunction with the use of new technologies such as increasing digitalisation in production, 3D printing, and digital direct printing of beverage packaging, we are developing innovative solutions for the future. Forward-looking machinery solutions ErgoBloc LC KT KRONES has synchronised the entire wet section of the line in the ErgoBloc L. The bloc converts PET preforms into PET bottles and then labels and fills them. To meet the specific needs of our customers in China, we have expanded the successful ErgoBloc model series to include an entry-level model, the ErgoBloc LC KT. This monobloc can fill still water into PET bottles sized between 0.25 and 2.0 litres. The entire system, from its speed to its simplified operation, is geared towards the needs of our customeconomic ers in China. It also offers a variety of other advantages including a small footprint. Additional elements such as conveyors and bottle dryers are unnecessary. Like its bigger brother, the ErgoBloc LC KT is very energy and resource efficient. The system can process up to 48,000 containers per hour depending on bottle size. Proportional flow regulator Conventional filling valves can only operate at two speeds: slow and fast. With the proportional flow regulator (PFR), KRONES has developed a new filling valve component that enables infinitely variable flow rates. That provides maximum flexibility for products with different characteristics and a wide variety of container geometries. Compared with conventional filling systems, handling time is shortened, which in turn increases both machine output and the robustness of the filling process. The filling system can then achieve the same output with fewer valves, which translates to lower costs and a smaller footprint. Savings of up to 20% can be achieved on filling valve maintenance alone. The proportional flow regulator has already been successfully tested in practice, filling carbonated soft drinks, vinegar, iced tea, milk, juice, soy sauce, and wine. Economic | Technological leadership 64 Contiroll gluing station The Contiroll labeller applies reel-fed labels to bottles and other containers. The ­gluing station is an important part of the Contiroll. It must always precisely transfer the right amount of glue to the labels. After a complete redesign, the gluing module now operates on the same principle as intaglio printing. The glue roller serves as the gravure cylinder. The roller is engraved with a grid matrix consisting of “cells”, or ­depressions, and the walls that separate them. That ensures that a precisely defined amount of glue is taken up and applied to the label. The geometry and depth of the cells and the width of the walls on the glue roller determine how much glue is transferred to the label. Excess glue is scraped off the roller by a new, user-friendly doctor blade system. A vacuum cylinder presses the cut-to-length label against the glue roller. On contact with the label, the surface tension of the hot melt glue in the glue roller’s cells pulls the glue out of the cell, transferring it to the label. This new technology saves customers glue and significantly reduces the amount of machine cleaning needed since the grid structure prevents significant build-up of glue strings. economic Poseidon – dynamic fermentation Breweries gain real added value when fermentation and lagering (cold conditioning) times are shortened, increasing cellar capacities. That is what our Poseidon dynamic fermentation development project is all about. It features a pipe-within-a-pipe mixing system that generates or supports different flow profiles in the tank to match the process at hand. Traditional methods circulate the tank’s entire contents. Poseidon circulates only the upper portion of the tank for sedimentation of residual yeast and other clouding factors, thus allowing for better, faster sediment removal. The cooling rate is also significantly higher. In all, dynamic fermentation makes the entire fermentation and conditioning process more economical for the brewer. The design can be quickly retrofitted inside existing tanks with no difficulty. The unit is also easy to clean. Economic | Technological leadership Energy and media efficiency and environmental sustainability 65 of our products Sustainability is a megatrend that KRONES picked up on in its early stages, creating the enviro programme. We have been developing and reviewing the criteria for ­energy and media efficiency and resource conservation in our products since 2008. The enviro sustainability programme is a TÜV SÜD-certified management approach that is deeply integrated into our product development process to ensure that all new designs are reviewed for resource-friendliness in accordance with a clearly defined process. All KRONES innovations aim to reduce energy and media consumption on our machines and lines. Thus, we are not only pursuing resource-savings targets within our own plants but also offer our customers the means with which to reduce resource consumption in their own operations. In this way, we are also providing an example for how our products can be used in the downstream supply chain with ­respect to Scope 3 emissions. Good progress made in enviro assessments The assessment of our products in accordance with enviro criteria continues. By the economic end of 2017, 84% of our machines and process models will have been assessed under enviro. £ An enviro solution is available for more than 62% of KRONES’ products. Another 22% of our machines will be assessed by the end of 2017. A share of 16% of the ­machinery portfolio will not be assessed under enviro since either the criteria ­cannot be applied to these machines or the machines in question are custom ­designs, laboratory machines, or third-party machines. £ We plan to have assessed all of the machines that will be presented at the drinktec 2017 trade fair under enviro 2.0. In this way, KRONES is disseminating information about our range of enviro machines on a regular basis. Besides our trade fair presentation, we also regularly include information about enviro in our customer publication, KRONES magazine. £ Energy and media-efficient machines can be configured in our quotation software by simply selecting the “enviro” option. This feature is available almost immediately after the machine assessment has been completed. Thus, our sales team can quickly select the right machines for a customer project and create a customised calculation of how long it would take for the resource-friendly version of a machine to pay for ­itself. Economic | Energy and media efficiency and environmental sustainability of our products 66 Potential savings in machines’ and units’ interaction With enviro 2.0, we are not longer limited to assessing individual machines and System assessments in our enviro management approach enable us ­process models. Instead, we can also examine entire systems for their media and to evaluate the energy efficiency of ­resource-efficiency. individual line components and how they impact each other. £ System assessment allows us to take a look at energy and media flows across multiple machines and systems and thus identify and realize potential savings. By comparing these consumption figures with figures for the industry or the state of the art, we can also present a picture of the savings our machines and systems offer by comparison. Thus, the enviro management approach is also now fully functional at the systems level. £ Because they have been assessed at the system level, systems such as EquiTherm Brew and EquiTherm Coldfill offer users assurance that their brewhouse or cold ­filling operations are working at the highest level of efficiency. economic £ By compiling the enviro options into energy or media-savings packages for the base machines, we are able to offer our customers solutions for resource-friendly ­operations.

Environmental Our Building Engineering Services team is collaborating closely with plant managers to work on all aspects of energy consumption and energy efficiency. We have ­adopted a separate budget specifically for implementing efficiency measures relating to our CO2 reduction target. The progress we have made so far is presented in this chapter. Besides the team responsible for energy management, we also have appointed an environmental management officer in accordance with the provisions of ISO 14001, who reports to the company’s management. In accordance with the laws and regulations on pollution control and waste management, we also have appointed officers for pollution control and waste management, who are integrated into the environmental management processes. This team also directly addresses the environmental aspects of freight forwarding. In 2016, we did not pay any fines or Strategies for resource conservation – such as the commissioning of a rail connecincur non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with environmention inside our plant in 2016 and the setting of emissions limits for vehicles in our tal laws or regulations. motor pool (based on ECE consumption values – are developed by this team and ­implemented with the support of departments such as engineering and/or strategic purchasing. Monitoring of our environmental performance takes place in accordance with the reporting cycles of our IMS system. Important developments or approaches with respect to environmentally friendly operations are also regular topics of discussion in CSR Committee meetings. We are also represented in the CDP monitoring process and communicate our environmental performance in accordance with CDP requirements.

In all, our consumption of heating energy and electricity came to 123,391 MWh (previous year: 116,644 MWh), which is up 5.8% over the previous year. This increase is smaller than the 6.9% increase in revenue. Once again in 2016, we leased or expanded production or storage spaces at some sites. The result is a 3.6% increase in the total area of our Neutraubling, Flensburg, and ­Rosenheim sites. £ The increase in energy consumption can be attributed entirely to consumption Consumption of heating energy ­ of heating energy. Energy consumption per m² of production area came to 0.365 per square metre of production area increased 1.1%. MWh and is therefore up only very slightly (previous year: 0.361 MWh). £ It is worth noting that absolute energy consumption was similar to 2013 levels. In fact, Germany’s National Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) correction factors were similarly high for both years. That suggests a link between weather conditions in 2016 and the higher energy consumption. £ We plan to further expand our production area in Germany by adding space and/ or transitioning from leased space to owned space. Planning is currently underway for the construction of a new 12,000 m² assembly hall at our Raubling site. The space is slated to go into operation in 2018. Environmental Energy intensity improved slightly At 36.3 MWh per €1 million in revenue, our energy intensity improved further (pre­ Key figures on our cogeneration vious year: 36.8 MWh). This development can be attributed in particular to the fact plants for 2016: that we had strong business growth while production area was relatively unchanged. 33% electricity production 41% heat production £ Thermal energy plays a lesser role in our production processes. Its main use is for 26% efficiency losses heating our buildings and firing our heat-lead cogeneration plants (CHPs). There is an obvious connection to prevailing weather conditions. £ Consumption figures for natural gas came to 17.1 MWh per €1 million in revenue (previous year: 16.4). The values for the other primary energy sources were virtually unchanged. Environmental | Energy and media conservation in production operations 83 Efficiency measures keep electricity consumption stable Our consumption of electricity increased only minimally (by 1%).

The increase in CHP is closely linked with the ­increase in natural gas consumption at our Neutraubling plant. We have increased the share of self-generated power in our consumption profile by 42% since 2014. £ Replacing metal vapour lamps with LED lamps in some areas of our production halls enabled us to reduce electricity consumption for lighting to around 25% in these areas. £ In 2017, we are continuing work to equip various areas of our plants with LED We plan to retrofit some areas of lighting. These conversion projects, which are part of our action plan for reducing our plants with LED lighting in 2017. CO2 emissions, focus first on areas in which lighting still uses older, more temperamental technology and hall areas that do not have optimal lighting. In all, we plan to retrofit 24,000 m² with new LED lighting in 2017. Environmental £ Energy-efficient LED lighting is already provided for in the plans for the new ­construction project at our Raubling site. Cooperation in the region krones is a member of the “energy cluster” established by Energieagentur Regensburg and the Regensburg Energy Efficiency Network (REEN). Sharing with other companies in the region enables us to better assess our own activities for improving ­energy efficiency and gain ideas about potential yet to be tapped. £ Within the REEN, we have set a shared CO2 reduction target for the greater ­Regensburg area. We also use the exchange with other members of the network to gain practical suggestions for improving energy efficiency. The first results of this exchange show that continually reducing energy consumption requires increased employee awareness.

In our production operations, we strive to use materials and supplies that may be ­categorised as water pollutants as sparingly as possible. £ In our Rosenheim plant, we significantly reduced our use of cooling lubricants by conducting intensive training, implementing oil removal systems, and closely monitoring the quality of cooling lubricants. Consumption of cooling lubricants at mid-year came to 3,474 kg from 2013 to 2015 and was down to 2,940 kg in 2016, a Environmental ­reduction of 15%. We operate installations that are subject to licensing at our sites in Neutraubling, ­Nittenau, and Freising.

We have set a CO2 emissions target for our German sites, which we seek to achieve by implementing an action plan that was adopted in 2015. This relates to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We also monitor emissions of other substances known to have an effect on climate and VOC emissions in accordance with the ­provisions of the law. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduced In 2016, our total direct and indirect energy-related emissions came to 35,899 metric tonnes (previous year: 38,164 metric tonnes). That is a reduction of 2,265 metric tonnes or 5.9%. Direct emissions totalled 12,433 metric tonnes (previous year: 10,979 metric tonnes) and indirect energy-related emissions came to 23,466 metric tonnes (previous year: 27,185 metric tonnes). £ The year-on-year increase in direct emissions can be attributed to the higher The higher share of electricity ­consumption of heating energy.

That in turn affected £ The generation of electricity in our own cogeneration (CHP) plants and the direct CO2 emissions. ­increased output of our CHPs resulted in a corresponding increase in natural gas consumption and, thus, higher direct CO2 emissions. Environmental £ Our Nittenau and Rosenheim sites use carbon-neutral district heating. £ The reduction in CO2 emissions from electricity consumption resulted from the higher share of electricity generated on-site at our Neutraubling plant. Our power mix is also much improved in 2016: Depending on the local utility provider, the share of renewables was between 40.4% and 50.8% (previous year: between 34.8 % and 48.9%). Our target of reducing direct and indirect energy-related CO2 emissions per €1 million in revenue by 30% to 40% by 2020 is realistic. £ At 10.6 metric tonnes, our CO2 emissions per €1 million in revenue were down Our CO2 reduction target for 11.7% year-on-year. Relative to the figure for the base year 2010 (16.85 metric tonnes 2020 is achievable. of CO2 per €1 million in revenue), we have already reduced these emissions by 37%. £ Our efforts with respect to the rest of our action plan are ongoing and we expect to achieve our target – even under varying weather conditions. Environmental | Reducing pollution and hazardous materials 89 Some other significant air emissions reduced We use R365mfc and R227ea in our foam manufacturing. The amounts of these ­substances used in 2016 came to 46.65 kg (R227ea) and 305.52 kg (R365mfc). £ Compared with the year 2015, when CO2 emissions totalled 511.3 metric tonnes, we reduced CO2 emissions by 21.4% in 2016 to 401.9 metric tonnes. This was achieved as a result of changed production processes and increased ­outsourcing of tasks in this area. Emissions of VOCs totalled 13.4 metric tonnes in the reporting period (previous year: We are monitoring VOC emissions 11.9 metric tonnes). These substances are generated primarily in our paint shops. from our paint shops. £ The pilot phase of a new dosing and painting process at our Rosenheim plant, which was mentioned in last year’s report, is not yet complete. £ While the systems at all of our other sites are below the reporting limit of 5 metric tonnes, we have recorded an increase in solvent use at the Rosenheim plant to 5.9 metric tonnes in 2016, which resulted from the pilot operation of a new painting and dosing process and changes in our supplier pool there. £ We have an internal action plan for 2017 under which we will assess solvent use in the first quarter of 2017 and use those figures to extrapolate total consumption for Environmental the year 2017. At present, we expect solvent use to return to levels below the reporting limit. Air emissions measured on a regular basis In accordance with the provisions of Germany’s Federal Act for the Protection against Harmful Environmental Effects Caused by Air Pollution, Noise, Vibration, and Similar Factors [Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz], measurements of emissions were taken on the CHP in Neutraubling and on our pickling plant in Freising in 2016. £ The measurements for the three plants, for 17,283 hours operating at full capacity, yielded the following average mass flows: NOx 0.685 kg/h, SO2 0.0017 kg/h, formaldehyde 0.035 kg/h, and CO 0.145 kg/h. £ In the pickling plant in Freising, a total annual load of 46.41 kg HF and 396.27 kg of NO2 was measured.

For 2016, this number came to 102.65 g of CO2 per kilometre. The increased activities of our LCS Centres have resulted in less travel and therefore reduced CO2 emissions arising from work-related travel. Sea freight is the main mode used for freight forwarding. Shipments are transported by air only in exceptional cases. Our aim is clear: We strive to reduce emissions from travel and freight forwarding. We will achieve this by continuing to shift more and more duties to the LCS Centres. By organising their travel, our employees contributed to climate protection, reducing CO2 emissions from work-related travel by 971 metric tonnes. £ A 12% reduction in the number of flights taken within Europe and Germany and a 3.6% reduction in long-haul flights have yielded a total reduction in CO2 emissions from air travel of 4.6%. Environmental £ KRONES is shrinking its motor pool and that also had an impact in 2016. CO2 emissions from car travel were reduced by 7.5%. An agreement with our mobility service provider, which limits CO2 emissions for its vehicles, also contributed. £ We intend to revise our company travel policy in 2017 in such a way that will help change travel habits. A large share of our outgoing freight is forwarded by sea. We ship around 75% of our products by way of environmentally friendly modes of transport, using a combination of rail and sea freight. £ 1.2% of our freight is forwarded by air. 23.6% is forwarded by truck – primarily to destinations in Central Europe. £ The volume of freight forwarded increased analogously to the 6.9% increase in revenue. The 4.2% increase in freight volume is still considerably less than the ­increase in revenue. The CO2 emissions cited here are estimates for the biggest part of our freight volume, sea freight. At 85,236 metric tonnes, CO2 emissions are roughly on par with the previous year (83,724 metric tonnes, +1.8%). £ In order to have reliable data in the future, we have launched a project that ­requires freight carriers to determine the volume of emissions in collaboration with our central purchasing department.

According to our materiality matrix, all aspects are of high importance. Overall, our human resources policy is geared toward strengthening our activities in the regions worldwide. Our presence in growth regions has been very important for some time now – after all, the lion’s share of our revenue is generated outside Germany. As we have stated in previous ­reports, we are taking a long-term approach to the internationalisation process. We are dedicating considerable energy and to all aspects of human resources development and to occupational safety and health programmes.

They safeguard our position as market leader and contribute to steadily increasing our profitability in all growth regions. That is possible because the employees at our local offices around the world are in direct, intensive contact with our customers. That is something we could not accomplish to the same extent from Germany. By strengthening our international activities, we are also reducing resource consumption associated with work-related travel. And that improves our global footprint. Our workforce in Germany is growing at a moderate pace. That ­remains important since – as the age distribution of KRONES AG’s workforce shows – we have to expect a larger number of employees to retire in the medium term.

As a result, we now have 14,443 employees worldwide. Workforce growth at our sites in Germany remained moderate at 3%. The number of employees at our offices and subsidiaries outside Germany increased by 803 in 2016 to 4,382. We intend to continue to grow our workforce at a moderate pace in Germany and at a higher rate outside Germany. £ Workforce growth in Germany reflects the need to prepare for increasing numbers of employees retiring in the years ahead. The share of employees aged 55 and older is up 11.3% year-on-year. That means we must begin planning now for a moderate increase in hiring. Effective succession planning In order to determine more precisely which employees and skill sets we will need, we have turned the talent pool programme that was launched last year into a pilot project for comprehensive succession planning in our research and development ­department. £ We have decided to begin using talent management software to ensure that we are pursuing the right professional development for our employees. £ With the help of this human capital management software, we expect to gain a comprehensive overview of all of the skills and qualifications of our workforce. For data collection, we will ask each employee to update his or her own profile and provide information that is important to the company. £ In 2017, we will test the programme on a small group of users and define the ­datasets needed for our HR development. Labour practices £ We expect the software to be available to all employees in Germany by 2019. At the international level, we plan to first use the software for our sales staff and their professional development. As in the previous year, we made only little progress towards reducing the share of temporary employees in 2016 £ KRONES AG permanently hired 133 employees who had been working for KRONES under temporary contracts.

Women ­currently make up 13.7% of our workforce (previous year: 13.6%). £ The overview of employment types shows that the low share of female employees overall stems primarily from our production operations. Women are well represented in non-technical departments, accounting for as much as 48% of those teams. £ The share of women in management improved to 5.9% (previous year: 5.3%), demonstrating our ongoing efforts to give women greater consideration for such ­positions. £ The share of female employees at our international sites is between 32.9% (CIS) and 12.0% (North America).

It is in our interest to win the loyalty of our employees for the long term. We have adopted flexible working time solutions in order to meet the ­varied needs of our employees with respect to their working lives. These include ­programmes for older employees approaching retirement age. We also adhere to the ­provisions of the law with respect to parental leave and long-term caregiver leave. We continually review employee requests regarding flexible working time options. Employee turnover is low in Germany, 2.2% (previous year: 1.8%). We interpret that as an indication of high satisfaction among employees with the conditions of their employment. £ Employee turnover rates worldwide are also stabilising. As in the previous year, the numbers for the different regions are between 4.7% and 12.7%.

The pilot project “Mobile working” kicked off at the start of 2017 and is being implemented in 11 areas. We expect to have initial results at the end of the year. For older employees who are approaching but not yet at retirement age, we offer ­partial retirement options that may entail alternating phases of working and leave or a continuous phase of part-time work over the entire duration of the partial ­retirement. £ In 2016, the share of employees in partial retirement was 3.5% (previous year: 3.6%). 284 people took advantage of the partial retirement option. £ In January 2016, a new company agreement on partial retirement was signed which set a cap of 4% on the share of employees who may be in partial retirement across all of our plants in Germany (incl.

A new software solution that enables us to better track the skills and professional development of our employees will be an important part of our strategy going forward.

In the last three years, we have successfully implemented measures under our existing professional development strategy for management and employees. We are currently working to develop this concept further. £ The competence management programme, with individual and group development reviews, was no longer sufficiently effective last year since the actions previously agreed on for individual employees had already been completed. Therefore, the number of reviews conducted decreased to 2,200 (previous year: 5,200). £ Our reconfiguration of the programme is now closely tied to implementation of a new software solution for collecting information on and developing our employees’ skills. We are currently testing the new programme in a pilot project. The pilot project is slated for completion in 2018. £ We are currently evaluating the existing programme for the continued professional development of our management employees for potential modi­ fications as well. High participation in continuing education opportunities It is important to us that we offer our employees comprehensive opportunities for Labour practices continuing education. In 2016, participation in continuing education courses was high, similar to the previous year. £ The number of participants in development opportunities was 15,800 in 2016 (previous year: 16,000). In addition to these courses, our employees also had access to e-learning opportunities. We have recorded 21,000 participants in e-learning, of which around 50% were from our offices outside Germany. £ The training portal currently offers around 600 different training options. £ Our professional development programme for management employees reached 78 participants in 2016, of which 56 were from Germany and 22 were from our sites outside Germany.

The number of apprentices we take on remains closely linked to the potential space available for new hires. The commitment to permanently hire apprentices upon completion of their training is part of our recognition agreement with the German metalworkers’ union. £ We permanently hired 118 young employees upon completion of their vocational training in 2016 (previous year: 127). Twenty-five young people had other plans ­following completion of their training or began work on additional qualifications. £ Since we are currently training more people than we have need for in-house, we may not offer permanent employment contracts to all apprentices completing their vocational training in 2017. We have also established vocational training concepts at sites outside Germany to bolster our company’s increased activities worldwide. Ensuring that young people have a solid foundation in the skills required for building special-purpose machinery is important to us. £ At our facility in Nairobi, Kenya, nine young talents completed their intermediWe are training young talent in ate examinations for industrial electronics in accordance with German standards.

Another ten young people began training under the programme in January 2017. £ In China, we are training 60 young people each year as mechatronics technicians or metal milling machinists. The training is done in collaboration with local schools, particularly the brewing academy in Wuhan. Labour practices £ The trainee programme we launched in China in 2016, has been a success. Four trainees are now ready for work at our site in China. £ In 2016, apprentices from Germany – seven international sales clerks and three aspiring engineers from our dual course of vocational training and university study – were able to gain international experience at various KRONES offices abroad.

For this reason, we have begun to bundle all ­aspects and activities relating to employee health in an occupational health management programme. A team of experts comprising members of our HR department, occupational safety and health team, counselling service, in-house medical service, and company health insurance fund is developing the programme’s framework. The core objective of an occupational health management programme is to promote the health and well-being of employees through preventive measures, to identify factors that may lead to illness, and – to the extent possible – to eliminate or prevent these factors. In this way, we can safeguard our employees’ health, increase employee ­satisfaction, and bolster employees’ ability to work for the long term. Survey on occupational health management In order to plan the occupational health management programme purposefully, we conducted a pilot project in 2016 which included a survey of employees at our ­Nittenau plant. £ The response rate to the survey was good, at 68%. The survey focused on ­questions such as a subjective assessment of one’s health and strengths, resources available at work, and the stresses and workloads experienced at work. Employees ­responded largely positively to questions about reconciling work with their personal lives and about their own ability to perform their work under current circumstances. However, the survey revealed areas that need work, particularly with regard to ­environmental factors at work. These include such things as noise, lighting, and drafts. Nittenau employees also expressed a wish for more support, for themselves and their supervisors, in increasing their own health awareness and knowledge. Labour practices £ Once the first measures have been successfully implemented in Nittenau and we KRONES provides in-house have seen initial results, we intend to roll out the occupational health management ­counselling as a voluntary, independent service for employees who programme in stages at our other plants. need help coping with difficulties relating to work or their personal Overarching measures for protecting occupational health will continue to be carried lives within a framework of con­ out across plants or at specific plants as relevant, independent of the occupational fidentiality. health management programme. £ Across-the-board rules for protecting non-smokers have been in place at all of our German sites since the second quarter of 2016.

Labour practices and decent work | Effective health management 123 Rehabilitating employees from long-term sick leave We have had great success with workplace rehabilitation management (WRM). ­Reintegrating employees who have been on long-term sick leave is an obligation ­under Germany’s German Social Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch) and our process has proven highly effective. Our WRM team consists of the employees themselves, their HR business partners, the Works Council, the disabled employees’ representative, and our counselling service, which coordinates the WRM process for our German sites. £ In 2016, we began communication with 103 employees on long-term sick leave The legal obligation of employers ­regarding their reintegration into the workplace. Through our WRM team’s work, we to conduct WRM is laid out in Section 84, Paragraph 2, Volume nine were able to permanently rehabilitate 58 employees (previous year: 27).

After successful WRM, that figure dropped to 12.8 days. The average age of employees in the WRM programme was 50 years. £ We were able to publish a WRM success story in our employee magazine, KRONES world, for the first time, featuring an employee who had been on long-term sick leave. This personal story will further promote trust in our WRM activities. £ We expect future WRM activities to be at a similar level. Further increasing the rate of employee rehabilitation will not likely be feasible due to the considerable time involved in coordinating and the limited capacity of those involved in the Labour practices ­process.

In his words, “For me, work was the best therapy.” Günther Schneider (left) with counsellor Wolfgang Bernkopf (right) 126 Effective occupational safety management We protect our employees at work with comprehensive measures under our occu­ pational safety management system. Our activities in Germany are based on the provisions of laws and employers’ liability insurance association rules and regulations. We also adhere to local laws on occupational safety at our sites worldwide. We are certified under the Occupational Health and Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) standard. This certification was expanded to cover all IMS-certified sites. Occupational safety data is monitored and presented to the Executive Board on an Evaluating the rules for occupaongoing basis.

An indication of the success of workforce. this continuous monitoring is the fact that we further reduced the rate of reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 employees in 2016. We have set ourselves a target of reducing the rate of reportable work-related ­accidents per 1,000 employees by 5% each year through 2020. £ In 2016, we were able to reduce the rate of reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 employees to 17.7 – a decrease of 23.7% year-on-year, which we consider a great success. The improved system for assessing hazards, which we described in last year’s report, was instrumental in our success here. £ The rate of reportable work-related accidents per 1,000 employees was 20.1% among men and 3.8% among women. This number is based on the number of work-related accidents resulting in one or more lost days of work. £ We use a matrix to specify our targets for the rate of reportable work-related ­accidents per 1,000 employees and the absolute number of accidents for the individLabour practices ual business lines. £ Our statistics show 23 different types of injury. Since our production workflows involve numerous steps that must be executed manually, injuries to fingers, arms, and feet were the most common. There were no work-related fatalities in 2016. Continuous improvement of the quality of data collection remains important. £ For example, we intend to better document smaller incidents and near-misses in the business units. £ We also see potential for improvement in our accident analyses, where we want to get to the root cause.

It is an integral part of the job preparation process for project leads and is often a fundamental requirement made by customers. £ Construction site audits on occupational safety are conducted on an ongoing ­basis. Our most urgent objective is to visit regularly with all construction site foremen to improve awareness and thus to more firmly establish the topic of occupational safety within our on-site installation operations.

We have defined our partnership with stakeholders and specified concrete expectations and rules regarding these relationships and their use in our Code of Conduct and other policies. That ensures that we are a dependable partner. We abide by the provisions of the law regarding the publication of important information. That applies to our financial reporting as well as documentation of operational information as required by law. Maintaining a good, regular dialogue with the public is also important to us. Our CSR Committee therefore includes members who represent various stakeholder groups and present their concerns. We use various communication channels as appropriate to the occasion and stakeholder group. We firmly believe that in order to properly meet the expectations of our stakeholder groups, decisions must be made and communicated on an individual basis, bearing the respective ­situation in mind. Of course, a high degree of transparency in all of our activities and accurate information about the circumstances of our actions are essential. As part of our social engagement efforts, we have a budget for charitable giving Our charitable giving policy and sponsoring. Here, too, we have developed a policy that guides our activities and strictly prohibits donations to ­political parties. clearly defines which activities KRONES will support. An important point here is that our charitable giving policy prohibits any donations to political parties or ­related ­organisations. We have always adhered strictly to this principal in years past and will continue to do so in the future. We take ideas gained from various activities and carry them on within our company. We strive to better monitor actions taken by conducting surveys where reasonable and where questions can be clearly framed. In addition, we use social media channels to obtain a general picture of the mood among individual interest groups. Our monitoring of charitable giving and sponsoring has room for improvement, particularly with respect to tracking the long-term impact of our activities. We are currently developing a concept for this purpose, which will go into effect in 2018.

In particular, these visitors were able to see machinery models that had recently been designed specifically for the region. £ The team at our local UK office examined the topic of craft brewing and requirements for the craft brewing process. Evaluating our internal communications Which channels do our employees use to find out information about the company? Which media do they prefer and what would they like to know more about? We put these questions to employees at our sites in Germany in a corporate communications survey conducted between 25 July and 30 September 2016. £ The survey focussed on preferences relating to various channels for internal communication, frequency of use, and content. £ In all, 2,504 employees across Germany gave their opinions about internal ­communications; 91% of them had access to their own computer. £ 69% of respondents feel that the information provided is “just right” and 80% use the Intranet daily or more than once per day. Interest in the employee magazine, whether the printed version or the online version, was similarly high: 72% of res­ pondents said they read it regularly. A number of open-ended questions allowed ­employees to express their wishes or provide ideas for internal communications. Society £ The survey results were used for the relaunch of our employee magazine. We also added one more issue to the editorial calendar. As requested, we are working to develop a structured, manageable connection among the various internal communication channels along the lines of a “social intranet”. The launch of the “Executive Board dialogue” project promotes direct communication.

Tours are particularly geared toward employees and their families. £ In 2016, we registered considerable interest from universities and other schools, which make up 34.3% of our visitors and are therefore certainly a primary target group. Something new this year: We hosted tours for four groups of asylum seekers. £ The number of tours and visitors was up compared with 2015. Since tours are an effective and personal means of presenting our company, we will continue to offer them in 2017. Open communication with communities As part of our community, we consider it important that we provide timely information about our activities. That includes presenting plans and construction projects and responding to questions from the public. £ Before starting construction on the expansion of our Raubling plant, we presented the plans in an informational meeting co-hosted with the district council. Citizens’ questions related to items such as development rights on the proposed site, the routing of transport vehicles, and employee parking. We also announced at the meeting that the construction project would create new jobs. Associations and universities as a platform for knowledge sharing We work closely with trade associations. Such collaboration gives us access to important information such as economic data and current standards work. Our participation in technical conferences also keeps us abreast of topics in the various fields and enables us to participate in knowledge sharing. £ Our membership in the German Engineering Federation (Verband Deutscher Maschinenund Anlagenbau e.V.) is important. We are represented in various working groups within the trade association for food processing and packaging machinery (Fachverband Nahrungsmittelmaschinen und Verpackungsmaschinen). Our ­Supervisory Board Chairman, Volker Kronseder, is involved in that organisation’s board. £ BlueCompetence is a sustainability initiative of the VDMA that presents sustainable product and machine concepts. It makes information available to the public Society about solutions that help conserve resources. Our CEO Christoph Klenk made a statement in an April 2017 publication on the importance of sustainable business ­practices. £ Besides our participation in the UN Global Compact, we are members of Sedex, ecovadis, and CDP. These memberships make our sustainability practices available for review, for example, by our customers. These organisations audit the company’s sustainability performance, each with a different focus. Society | Improved stakeholder dialogue Use of industry knowledge and research findings 139 Our activities with respect to academia and industry representatives focus on two areas. First, we collaborate with universities by offering thesis-writing opportunities. That enables us to be in close communication with universities and to integrate young research talents into our work flows. We also provide funding and/or equipment for concrete projects that are conducted on site at universities. The second area of focus is our participation in technical seminars, lectures, and conferences. KRONES experts speak at selected events, presenting current techno­ logies and machinery concepts. Communication at these events helps us gain new ideas and share with other industry specialists. Partnering with universities Our research and development department selects and supports the research projects that we conduct with universities.. £ As part of our participation in the Robofill project conducted by the packaging Close collaboration with colleges machinery department of the Technical University of Munich, and in collaboration and universities gives us access to scientific findings on a wide range with industry partners, we are developing solutions that can serve as model applicaof subject matter relevant to the tions for digitalisation in the packaging industry. beverage and packaging industry. £ A development project conducted in collaboration with the brewing technology department of the Technical University of Munich studied continuous fermentation and yielded new approaches to changing the fermentation process in beer production. In this project, researchers also determined a way to improve energy use in the brewhouse. £ KRONES Innovation Lab offers a new approach to fleshing out creative ideas. The team, which is based in the TechBase in Regensburg, translates project ideas submitted by KRONES employees into concrete concepts. Students from a variety of fields – from medical, mechanical, industrial, and systems engineering to informatics and economics – take an unbiased approach to the projects, exploring unique, innovative approaches to translating the latest trends in research and science into practical solutions for KRONES. A very important opportunity for exchanging knowledge and ideas in the industry is the drinktec trade fair, which takes place in Munich every four years. £ Our exhibits at drinktec in September 2017 will showcase the developments we Society have been working on for the beverage and packaging machinery market. We will also present recent research findings and possible pilot applications and make them available to the trade public. Many students also use this platform. KRONES makes admission tickets available to students free of charge so that they, too, can benefit from the trade fair.

The committee consists of one member each of the Executive Board, the ­finance department, corporate communications, and the CSR team. An important criterion for approval of contributions is that the project or cause must A connection with local projects have a direct relation to or impact on the communities where our production sites and activities is an important ­criterion for funding approval. and offices are located in Germany and abroad. In this way, we ensure that we are supporting the economic, social, and cultural environment at our business locations. We give priority to projects that also enable our employees to get involved. As a matter of policy, we do not contribute to any political parties. We adhered to this policy in 2016. Our charitable giving and sponsoring policy also applies to our subsidiaries abroad. That ensures that all activities are based on the same principals. £ Contributions made by our subsidiaries are not included in our current charitable giving and sponsoring budget. When we publish our new charitable giving and sponsoring strategy, we will request information from our subsidiaries with respect to their charitable giving and sponsorship activities beginning in 2018. Social projects In 2016, more than two-thirds of our €691,000 charitable giving and sponsoring ­budget went towards social projects. £ That includes our financial support of the KROKI day care centre in Neutraubling, which provides care for children of employees as well as parents in the surrounding communities, beginning as early as 4 months of age. Our charitable con­tributions are paid out in full to their recipients. The cost of internal processes, including expenses relating to payment transactions, is not passed on to recipients. They are ­simply counted as part of our own administrative expenses. £ A cause that is very important to our company is Leukämiehilfe Ostbayern e. V., an organisation that provides assistance to leukaemia patients by providing for ­better housing for patients and their families at the University Clinic in Regensburg, which in turn helps improve treatment outcomes and patient recovery. Society £ Supporting organisations that offer relief services for refugees and asylum seekers also remains an important cause for KRONES. We made a monetary donation to the organisation CampusAsyl e.V. in Regensburg in 2016. The second area of focus of our social engagement in 2016 was making grants to schools and continuing education events. 20% of our charitable giving and sponsorship budget went towards such grants.. £ Our sponsorship activities afforded us a strong presence at technical conferences and events. In 2016, the anniversary year of the German Beer Purity Law, this also included cultural events.

GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) An international network that supports companies in their efforts to measure, understand, and report on their performance with respect to sustainability. GRI has established a ­reporting framework that serves as a guideline for companies and is free of charge. GRI ­reporting relies on transparency and aims to provide standardised, comparable information. Integrated management A single system that incorporates the requirements and specifications from various areas system (IMS) such as quality, environment, occupational safety, and security into a uniform structure and documents the methods used for oversight LEED (Leadership in Energy and Internationally recognised certification system for the development and planning of Environmental Design) ­buildings with extremely high environmental performance. Evaluation of a construction project all the way through to its commissioning and final acceptance and subsequent ­monitoring are aimed at ensuring that the resulting building can operate at the planned ­level of efficiency. OHSAS OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series) is used in many countries as the basis for certification of management systems for occupational safety.

UN Global Compact The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic policy initiative for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. Value chain The value of a product or service consists not only of the product or service itself. In some cases, it may consist of many various components that are produced along the stages of ­value creation. Several stages of value creation constitute a value chain. Value creation calculation The value created is determined by subtracting from the company’s performance (sales ­revenues and other income) the advance payments necessary for bought-in goods and ­materials, depreciation and amortisation, and other expenditures. The origination of the value creation is set against its use. glossary ziele/massnahmen GLOSSARy KRONES at a glance Business model, business areas, KRONES reports on its three segments: and organizational structure “machines and lines for product filling and decoration”, “machines and lines for KRONES offers machinery and systems for beverage production/process technology”, filling and packaging and for beverage and “machines and lines for the compact production.
