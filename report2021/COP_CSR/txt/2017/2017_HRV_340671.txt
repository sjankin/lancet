Apart from the dynamics of day-to-day business, the year 2016 was also marked by major changes in the ownership structure, as shown in more detail in the Report. During 2016, the Management Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, decided to conduct a business analysis with the aim of increasing the synergy effects of KONČAR Group and establishing measures for the rationalization and the optimization of operations and the improvement of the Group’s market position. In conducting all these activities, the responsibility as an integral part of business processes across the stages, was always taken into account.

This year’s Report is also aligned with the GRI G4, following the development of reportinto account. ing and routing according to GRI Standards. Respectfully, Darinko Bago Chairman of the Management Board STRATEGY AND ANALYSIS 5 Group KEY IMPACTS, The Group is exposed to various market and financial operating conditions. The business enviRISKS AND ronment risk results from political, economic and social conditions existing in the markets of OPPORTUNITIES companies’ operations. G4-2 All Group companies regularly monitor and manage their balance sheets, liquidity and capital adequacy as well as set of measures focused on prevention or elimination of illiquidity causes. Also, they take measures focused on companies’ sufficient long-term funding sources in view of the scope and type of their business activity and regularly monitor the capital adequacy performance. The Group manages the risks that might impact its business operations by means of monitoring business processes and internal risk reports, identifying and analysing risk exposure based on its degree and significance. • Market Risk Market risk emerges as a consequence of potential losses resulting from less-than-favourable economic conditions and a decline in market demand. KONČAR annually exports to seventy countries on all continents, resulting in increased market risks caused by various influences. First of all, it refers to global political relations, internal instability, armed conflicts and riots, and all the impacts that may arise as a result of such events. Apart from geopolitical disturbances, national, regional or global economics can also have an important imapct on investment cycles. Market regulation is particularly present in the field of energy and transport, purcheses being of higher value and of strategic importance, so the economic policy of certain countries often depends on the beginning or continuation of major projects. The regulation of market relations sometimes changes during the execution of the contract, which may further complicate the delivery, installation and payment for equipment. • Procurement Risk Raw materials and materials that are most used in the production process such as copper, tin, oil, wire and steel are subject to price changes on the world market thus affecting the final price of the product. In 2016 there was a significant drop in the price of transformer sheet (about 25 percent) and the growth of price of copper (about 20 percent). The Group companies are protected against these risks in many ways, primarily by contracting annual or perennial quantities and prices, and by incorporating these risks into final product prices with longer delivery deadlines. • Technological and Development Risks KONČAR products are based on our own research and development in accordance with customer requirements and market needs. Permanent investment in new products, the application of modern technologies and compliance with the requirements of the technical standards are the usual part of the business activities that are approached with the utmost care. All these activities, with the investment and application of modern manufacturing technologies, high quality materials and expert knowledge, enable high quality products, customer satisfaction and reduced risk of lagging behind competition. 6 STRATEGY AND ANALYSIS CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 • Human Resources Risks Although there is a significant outflow of experts into other countries, KONČAR does not have such occurrences on an enlarged scale. By investing in lifelong workplace education, co-operation with educational institutions and employee incentives, human resources risks do not affect the stability of the business. • Capital Risk Management KONČAR manages its capital in accordance with changes in economic conditions in the market, ensuring continuous and stable operations and enabling the payment of dividends to shareholders. In accordance with the laws of the Republic of Croatia, the Group companies shall make decisions on the management of its own capital, taking all stakeholders into account. • Currency Risk Due to operations in various markets, currency risk is constantly present in business, primarily through exchange rate differences and changes in the monetary systems of the countries to which the products are delivered. There are several activities to protect against currency risks in companies, primarily by continuous monitoring cash flow, contracting sales and procurement in the same currency where possible, adjusting the cash flow rate and other measures both in the company and in co-operation with banks and financial institutions. • Interest Rate Risk Due to continuous operations, production with longer delivery times, investments in the modernization of production and business processes, the Group borrows under the most favourable conditions. In their business and borrowing, they are exposed to interest rate risk, especially when part of the loan is agreed at variable interest rate, so various methods are used to reduce or avoid such risks in accordance with financial market conditions. • Credit Risk In terms of the credit relations of the company, the data of the competent institutions and opinions collected from rating agencies, the Croatian Chamber of Economy, publicly disclosed information on companies’ financial status and other sources are used to rate major customers. The impact of credit risk on the Group, as well as the changes in partner’s credit rating, is being constantly monitored. In principle, contracts are concluded with creditworthy counterparties when appropriate payment insurance instruments have been obtained. • Liquidity Risk The Group manages liquidity risk by constantly monitoring the estimated cash flow, comparing and adjusting it to actual income and expenses. There was no significant exposure of the Group to liquidity risk. More detailed information on key impacts, risks and opportunities are available in the 2016 Business Report, available on www.koncar.com/Investors (Chapter 8, “Risk Exposure”).

PRODUCTS AND SERVICE UN GC 9 Following the market trends and meeting the demands of its customers in recent years, KONČAR Distribution and Special Transformers invested in the design and development of increased efficiency transformers. The use of new materials and technologies provides the possibility to meet all environmental design requirements that require improved energy efficiency and compliance with environmental requirements, reducing CO2 emissions, as well as reducing transformer electrical losses. All ecological designs transformers have a highlighted CE mark, as proof of conformity, as well as a Declaration of Conformity with Ecological Design Requirements. High-voltage transformers of high power produced by KONČAR Instrument Transformers are intended for power transmission directly from high to low voltage. Each energy conversion inevitably follow a certain amount of losses, however, as these units eliminate the use of distributive voltage levels, which completely overcomes one energy conversion and the losses that follow, only their use is more energy efficient. Continuous development of materials, production technology and calculation methods KONČAR Instrument Transformers is actively working to reduce losses in this type of transformers. As a result, standard design transformers delivered during 2016 had losses reduced by 15-25 percent depending on the model, compared to the transformers produced in the previous years.
