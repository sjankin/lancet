Participation in the Blue Number Initiative bluenumber In January 2017, the ANA Group became the first Japanese company to take part in the Blue Number Initiative, a global initiative developed by the Blue Number Foundation, which is headquartered in New York, with the aim of building ethical food supply chain platforms. Concern is growing around the world for food safety and traceability, environmental preservation, and respect for human rights during food production processes. Amidst this trend, the ANA Group aims to use the platform provided by this initiative going forward to enhance its food supply chain management practices as they pertain to in-flight meals and other food-related areas of its operations. We thereby hope to provide customers with safe and trustworthy food while also offering support to food producers across Japan. Creation of an Inclusive Society Collaboration with the Japan Blind Football Association ANA concluded a partnership agreement with the Japan Blind Football Association in June 2016. Through this partnership, we have created a training program for employees that uses blind soccer as a venue for cultivating internal understanding regarding diversity. In addition, we are also a partner to the Japan Blind Football Association’s sports class activities that entail dispatching instructors to give blind soccer lessons to elementary and junior high school students. In this capacity, we help encourage ­children to be understanding toward differently abled individuals, practice compassion, Training program using blind soccer and always be cooperative. Sponsoring Belgian Olympic and Paralympic Committees As an only airline to connect Belgium and Japan, ANA signed a 4-year sponsorship agreement with the Belgian Olympic and Paralympic Committees starting from 2017. ANA will help assist transportation of the Belgian athletes, as well as joining various events planned in Belgium, to help raise its brand awareness. Furthermore, ANA will receive service feedback from the Paralympians so that necessary improvements may be implemented to its universal services. 58 ANA HOLDINGS INC. ANA’s Olympic Promotion System ANA has established the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games Promotion Headquarters to accelerate exchanges with relevant companies and organizations, activities for fostering mutual understanding, and other initiatives.

Note: ANA is an official airline partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020. High Expectations for ANA Contributions When I look at ANA, I see a company that stands ahead of its peers in its devotion to sustainability. This devotion is visible in efforts such as ANA’s participation in the Blue Number Initiative for achieving food and other products’ supply chain traceability and ANA’s strides in promoting human rights and diversity. The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is also seeking to ensure the success of the Tokyo 2020 Games from an environmental perspective, as indicated by its establishment of the Tokyo 2020 Games Sustainability Plan and the Tokyo 2020 Games Takeo Tanaka Sustainable Sourcing Code. Similar consideration is being given to labor and human rights. Director, Sustainability Department Game Operations Bureau The world currently has its eyes on Tokyo, where the games will be held, and on Japanese The Tokyo Organising Committee of the companies. It is therefore my hope that ANA can come to be recognized as a leading Olympic and Paralympic Games ­company in the area of sustainability.

Statement Regarding a Flight Pushing Back with an Exceeding Capacity In regard to ANA256 from Fukuoka to Tokyo (Haneda) on September 30, 2016, which started operation with capacity exceeded, ANA received a severe warning, or administrative guidance, from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) on October 11, 2016. We once again offer our sincerest apologies to customers and other related parties for causing significant worry and trouble. To prevent the reoccurrence of such an incident, we have analyzed the causes, formulated and steadily implemented reoccurrence prevention measures, and strengthened our security management system. 1) Causes and Background of This Event This event happened due to the occurrence of multiple problems, as outlined below.

Background Issues with the IT-based self-boarding model In regard to this matter, we received directions from MLIT for improvement of the following three points. Foundation Supporting Value Creation ① Reevaluation of system for check-in procedure confirmation process at the security checkpoint, and formulation of reliable countermeasures ② Reevaluation of boarding procedure confirmation process at the boarding gate, and formulation of reliable countermeasures ③ Formulation of a reliable method for ascertaining boarded passengers and their number onboard 2) Reevaluation of Processes / Systems at Each Stage We launched an urgent project led by ANA’s Senior Executive Vice President and Representative Director, who is in charge of the operation division. Based on analysis and verification of the causes of the incident, we thoroughly considered and formulated measures to prevent reoccurrence. Security checkpoint Boarding gate Onboard • Reevaluated security checkpoint layout • Reevaluated procedures for error displays • Updated procedures so that • Installed covers on barcode readers at the security • Strengthened gate passage confirmation departure takes place after ­checkpoints in certain airports • Implemented the issuance of a “boarding guidance form” confirmation that all passen• Implemented issuance of “security check verification” at the gate delivered by hand by an attendant gers are in their seats and confirmation by checkpoint attendants Groupwide training • ANA’s president, vice president, and other related officers made on-site visits to the operation division.  • Direct dialogue with Group employees has been repeatedly implemented to strengthen safety.  Due to the implementation of the above countermeasures, there has been no incident of this type since October 2016. 3) Looking Ahead The move toward self-service for a variety of procedures through the use of IT leads to increased passenger convenience and the provision of stressfree service. It also facilitates increased efficiency in personnel allocation and time-saving, thereby increasing management efficiency. However, it is all the more necessary to thoroughly verify risks arising due to the move toward self-service and to establish countermeasures in advance, as well as to establish easy-to-understand services for passengers who are not accustomed to these boarding and other procedures. Moving f­orward, we will continue working steadily to achieve safety and on-time operation so that passengers can board with peace of mind.

Proceeds from issuance of bonds and from long-term loans were recorded, while outlays were made in the forms of payment for dividends and repayment of long-term debt Fundamental Approach to Aircraft Procurement and finance lease obligations. Aircraft are major investments that are used over the long term for more than 10 years. Decisions regarding the selection of aircraft types suited to routes and networks and the pursuit of the best fleet composition are among the most important issues for airline management. The ANA Group’s fleet strategy is based on three basic policies: strengthening cost competitiveness by introducing fuel-efficient aircraft, optimizing supply to demand by increasing the ratios of narrowand medium-body aircraft, and enhancing productivity by integrating aircraft types. Fundamentally, the Group purchases and owns strategic aircraft it intends to use over the medium to long term. Also, we employ operating leases to procure aircraft to use over the short term or for capacity adjustment. The Group may also utilize sale and lease-back as a means of diversifying corporate financing methods. In these and other ways, the Group constantly pursuits to select the most economical aircraft procurement method. 98 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C .

A N N UA L R E PO RT 2017 111 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries Year Ended March 31, 2017 1. Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, certain reclassifications have been made in the 2016 consolidated financial statements to conform to the classifications used in 2017. 2. Translation of financial statements The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen and, solely for the convenience of readers outside of Japan, have been translated into United States dollars at the rate of ¥112.19 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2017. This translation should not be construed as a representation that the amounts shown could be converted into United States dollars at that or any other rate. Translations of United States dollars are rounded down to the nearest thousand and, therefore, the totals shown in tables do not necessarily agree with the sums of the individual amounts. 3. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Consolidation The consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017, include the accounts of the Company and its 63 (62 in 2016) significant subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”). Under the control and influence concepts, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to exercise control over operations are fully consolidated, and those companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in 17 (18 in 2016) unconsolidated subsidiaries and significant affiliates are accounted for by the equity method. The difference between the cost and the underlying net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 10 years. Investments in 85 (82 in 2016) subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at cost. If the equity method of accounting had been applied to the investments in these companies, the effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements would not be material. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Group is also eliminated. Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 28, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made on consolidation. (b) Foreign currency translation All short-term and long-term monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differences arising from the translation are included in the consolidated statement of income. The balance sheet accounts of consolidated foreign subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments in net assets. 112 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . (c) Marketable securities and investment securities Marketable securities and investment securities are classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. Under the accounting standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are carried at cost, determined by the moving-average method. See Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” for additional information. (d) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is stated in amounts considered to be appropriate based on the Group’s past credit loss experience and an evaluation of potential losses in the receivables outstanding. (e) Inventories Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries, and are stated at cost, principally determined by the moving-average method. The net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when their net realizable value declines. See Note 21 “Supplementary information for the consolidated statement of income” for additional information. (f) Property and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property and equipment, excluding leased assets, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on the estimated useful lives. Major assets are depreciated by the following method: Buildings............................. Straight-line method Aircraft................................ Straight-line method The Company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives for major property and equipment, based upon the Company’s estimate of durability: Buildings............................. 3–50 years Aircraft................................ 9–20 years Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. The Group reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assets of the Group are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets determined to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the discounted cash flows from the continued use and eventual disposition of the asset or the net selling price at disposition. See Note 20 “Impairment loss” for additional information. (g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets) Financial / Data Section Intangible assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software. (h) Retirement benefits The retirement benefit plans of the Group cover substantially all employees other than directors and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the Company and subsidiaries. The Company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments. The Company and certain consolidated subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans. The Company accounts for the liability for retirement benefits based on the projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the balance sheet date. The projected benefit obligations are attributed to periods on a benefit formula basis. Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that are yet to be recognized in profit or loss are recognized within net assets (accumulated other comprehensive income), after adjusting for tax effects, and are recognized in profit or loss over the average remaining service years of employees. A N N UA L R E PO RT 2017 113 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (i) Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income included in the consolidated statement of income. The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted income tax rates to the temporary differences. See Note 9 “Income taxes” for additional information. (j) Leases Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of the contract as the useful life. (k) Derivatives The Group uses derivatives, such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity options and swaps, to limit its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The Group does not use derivatives for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses charged or credited to income, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses. (l) Revenue recognition Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are provided. (m) Cash equivalents Cash equivalents are short-term investments that are readily convertible into cash and exposed to insignificant risk of changes in value. Cash equivalents include time deposits and negotiable certificates of deposit, all of which mature or become due within three months of the date of acquisition. See Note 19 “Supplementary cash flow information” for additional information. (n) Transactions of delivering the Company’s own stock to employees, etc., through trusts The Company has been conducting transactions of delivering its own stock to the Employee Stock Ownership Group through trusts for the benefit of its employees. (1) Transaction outline The Company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Plan” (the “Plan”) on July 12, 2013 as an incentive for the Group’s employees to work in unison to overcome the current harsh business environment and achieve further growth, and as a measure to advance employee welfare. The aim of the Plan is to promote the employees’ asset building by encouraging stock acquisition and holding through the expansion of the “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association,” “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Association” and “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS TRADING CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association” (the “Stock Ownership Association”). The Plan is an incentive plan for all employees who participate in the Stock Ownership Association. Under the Plan, the “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOT”), which was established to transfer the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, will acquire a portion of the Company’s shares in a single purchase and sell them to the Stock Ownership Association over a certain period of time. If a gain on sale of shares is then accumulated within the ESOT through the sale of the Company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association by the termination of the trust, it will be distributed to the Group employees who meet the beneficiary requirements (all individuals who have participated in the Stock Ownership Association during the trust period, including retirees) as residual assets. The Company guarantees the borrowings for the ESOT’s acquisition of the Company’s shares, and repays any borrowings outstanding at the termination of the trust pursuant to the guarantee agreement. (2) Accounting method for transactions of delivering the Company’s own stock through trusts The Company has adopted the “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc. through Trusts” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 30 issued on March 26, 2015). In accordance with PITF No. 30, upon transfer of treasury stock to the employee stock ownership trust (the “Trust”) by the entity, any difference between the book value and fair value of the treasury stock is recorded in capital surplus. At year-end, the Company shall record (1) the Company stock held by the Trust as treasury stock in net assets, (2) all other assets and liabilities of the Trust on a line-by-line basis, and (3) a liability/asset for the net of (i) any gain or loss on delivery of the stock by the Trust to the employee shareholding association, (ii) dividends received from the entity for the stock held by the Trust, and (iii) any expenses relating to the Trust. 114 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . (3) Matters concerning the Company’s own stock held by trusts The book value of the Company’s own stock held by trusts was ¥1,346 million ($11,997 thousand) as of March 31, 2017 and ¥2,433 million as of March 31, 2016, and is recorded as treasury stock in net assets. The number of shares held by the ESOT as of March 31, 2017 was 6,379 thousand, the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was 8,493 thousand, the number of shares as of March 31, 2016 was 11,531 thousand, and the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was 13,352 thousand. For the purpose of calculating per share information, the number of shares at the end of the fiscal year and the average number of shares during the fiscal year are included in treasury stock. (o) Share remuneration plan for directors The Company has been conducting transactions of delivering its own stock through a trust as a share remuneration plan (the “Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors”) in order to improve its operating performance, increase its corporate value and raise the directors’ awareness of shareholder-oriented management. (1) Transaction outline Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors is a system in which funds are contributed by the Company, and shares acquired are distributed to the Company’s directors in accordance with to the Company’s operating performance, etc. (2) The Company’s own stock remaining in the trust The Company’s own stock remaining in the trust is recorded at the book value (excluding associated expenses) of the trust and is reflected as treasury stock in net assets. The book value is 429 million yen for the previous fiscal year and 417 million yen for the current fiscal year. The number of shares is 1,357 thousand shares for the previous fiscal year and 1,318 thousand shares for the current fiscal year. (p) Changes in accounting policies Application of Practical Solution on a change in depreciation method due to Tax Reform 2016 In accordance with the revision to the Corporation Tax Act, certain consolidated subsidiaries within Japan apply “Practical Solution on a Change in Depreciation Method due to Tax Reform 2016” (ASBJ Practical Issues Task Force No. 32 of June 17, 2016) as of April 1, 2016, and changed the depreciation method for buildings and accompanying facilities and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016 from the declining-balance method to the straight-line method. The impact of these changes on the profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 is immaterial. 4.

Asset retirement obligations (a) Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (1) Overview of asset retirement obligations The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and certain other offices. As the Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations. (2) Calculation of asset retirement obligations The Group estimates the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculates the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%. The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2017 2016 2017 Balance at beginning of the fiscal year ¥ 949 ¥825 $8,458 Liabilities incurred due to the acquisition of property and equipment 5 4 44 Accretion expense 15 14 133 Liabilities settled (14) (83) (124) Other 119 189 1,060 Balance at the end of the fiscal year ¥1,074 ¥949 $9,573 (b) Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet The Company and its domestic subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts with such entities for land and office at airport facilities, including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the above airports are considered to be critical infrastructure, it is beyond the control of the Company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the Company and its domestic subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities. 120 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . 9. Income taxes The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are subject to Japanese national and local income taxes which, in the aggregate, resulted in normal effective statutory tax rates of approximately 30.86% and 33.06% for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Group files a tax return under the consolidated corporate-tax system, which allows companies to base tax payments on the combined profits or losses of the parent company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries.

Financial / Data Section The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus), depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends, until the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts within equity under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders.

Financial instruments and related disclosures Overview (a) Group policy for financial instruments The Group limits its fund management to short-term time deposits and raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions, including banks. The Group uses derivatives for the purpose of reducing the risks described below and does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments and related risk Trade receivables (notes and accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers. Marketable securities and investment securities are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed mainly of the shares of other companies with which the group has business relationships. Substantially all trade payables have payment due dates within one year. Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments, and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term interest-bearing debt at variable rates, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as hedging instruments. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses. For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from the receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, the Group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk of the commodity prices of fuel and stabilize operating profit. 1) Management of Credit Risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers) The Group manages its credit risk from receivables on the basis of internal guidelines, which include monitoring of payment term and balances of major customers by each business administration department to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. As for derivatives, the Group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with sound credit profiles. 2) Management of Market Risks (fluctuation risks of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates) In order to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks, the Group principally utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks of the debts, the Group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. As for marketable securities and investment securities, the Group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. There are internal management regulations for derivative transactions which set forth transaction authority and limits on transaction amounts. Financial / Data Section The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, the Group reports plans and results of methods and ratios for offsetting risks at the quarterly meetings of the Board of Directors. 3) Management of Liquidity Risks Related to Financing (risks that the Group cannot meet the due dates of payables) The Group manages liquidity risks by establishing a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds that are necessary for the operation of the Group over a certain period of time, in accordance with the Group’s business operating plan and budget. (c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value estimates. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives presented in Note 15 “Derivatives and hedging activities” are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. A N N UA L R E PO RT 2017 125 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Estimated fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and estimated fair value, are shown in the following tables.

(b) Notes and accounts receivable The carrying values of notes and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of their short maturities. 126 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . (c) Marketable securities and investment securities The fair values of marketable and investment securities are measured at the quoted market price of the stock exchange for the equity instruments, and at the quoted price obtained from the financial institution for certain debt instruments. The information on the fair values of marketable and investment securities by classification is included in Note 4 “Marketable securities and investment securities” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Liabilities (a) Notes and accounts payable The carrying values of notes and accounts payable approximate fair value because of their short maturities. (b) Short-term loans The carrying values of short-term loans approximate fair value because of their short maturities. (c) Bonds The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is measured at the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk. (d) Long-term loans The fair values of long-term loans are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the debt at the Group’s assumed corporate borrowing rate. 2.

Derivatives and hedging activities The Group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and jet fuel prices. In order to manage these risks, the Group utilizes forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the Group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to their outstanding debt. In addition, the Group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to the jet fuel prices. The Group does not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The Group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The Group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, are generally monitored by management on a quarterly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically. The Group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial i­nstruments; however, it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, as the majority of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions. Summarized below are the notional amounts and the estimated fair values of the derivative financial instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 for which hedged accounting has been applied.
