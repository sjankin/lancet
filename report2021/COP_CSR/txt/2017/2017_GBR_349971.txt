This is the seventh occasion on which I have written We continue to support the UN Global Compact and the introduction to this annual review which reports confirm our commitment to the initiative and its principles our continued commitment to corporate responsibility as demonstrated in this Communication on Progress. Over initiatives across the firm and once again I am both pleased the coming year we will continue to challenge ourselves to and grateful for the commitment shown by so many drive further progress across all strands of our CR strategy. colleagues from around our network. Please enjoy reading about the work captured in this This review details many of the firm’s activities in this annual review and my thanks again to everyone who has regard, but should be seen as an overview of the highlights contributed to our programme this year. from another year when many individuals have given their time and professional service to support the firm’s objectives in relation to CR. In a year when we marked our 30th year of supporting the Battersea Legal Advice Centre (BLAC), I am immensely proud of the work of our lawyers through our Access to Justice Programme under the UK Collaborative Plan on pro bono. Social welfare lawyer, Diane Sechi, continues to Colin Passmore lead the programme which delivers end to end case work Senior Partner for welfare benefit appeals (focusing on disability) an area of law no longer covered by Legal Aid. This year, we have been able to extend the programme to selected clients, increasing the number of vulnerable individuals who can receive this vital support. We continue to look for ways to materially improve gender diversity within the firm and this year we have collaborated with a number of our clients and with external organisations and networks to accelerate progress. This approach has worked well and has created new and challenging opportunities. There have been detailed and ongoing discussions within the partnership about gender diversity and there is a real desire to bring about a noticeable and lasting change. While there is still much to be done, I believe we have begun to make changes within our organisation that will make a positive impact not only on the number of women to achieve partnership and to occupy senior management roles in the future, but also on the culture of our firm as a whole. Page 1 Corporate responsibility We are proud of our continuous commitment to corporate responsibility (CR) and its embodiment across the firm which seeks to govern how we operate, how we interact with our clients and each other, and how we participate and contribute to our local communities. We monitor our improvement and impact within our workplace and across the local communities in which we work, specifically focusing on the theme of access across our five key strands: Social inclusion Raising the aspirations of young people in education through access to work experience and opportunities Diversity & inclusion Ensuring that our organisation and profession more widely is accessible to people from a diverse range of backgrounds and circumstances Pro bono Promoting rule of law and access to justice in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. Charitable giving Access to funding and donations from the Simmons & Simmons Charitable Foundation to support those in pressing need Environmental sustainability Supporting environmental issues and minimising our environmental impact We are committed to upholding the ten UN Global Compact principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption and incorporating them in to our policies, operations and culture to consistently ensure we are operating to the highest ethical standards. We seek continuous improvement and increased participation in our CR programme across our network and engage our clients and our suppliers to collaborate in our community projects to strengthen our overall impact. Page 2 Pro bono 2016 marked the firm’s longstanding commitment to pro bono, as we celebrated our 30 year relationship with Battersea Legal Advice Centre, a clinic the firm helped set up in 1986. We celebrated the occasion with a 30 year celebration dinner during National Pro Bono Week in November 2016. We also marked National Pro Bono Week with a recognition luncheon, including a speech by Prof Sara Chandler. We have continued our Access to Justice Programme under the UK Collaborative Plan on pro bono and our UK Access to Justice Programme received recognition with a Highly Commended for Excellence in Pro Bono at the 2016 Law Society Excellence Awards. All 18 Simmons & Simmons offices outside of our alliance firms are currently involved in pro bono work, and in 2016/17 the firm carried out 14,123 pro bono hours. In 2016/17 the firm committed to strategic partnerships with 15 of our major pro bono clients. Additionally, the firm continues to take referrals from clearing houses including Advocates for International Development, TrustLaw, LawWorks, the International Senior Lawyers Project (ISLP) and Pro Bono Connect (in the Netherlands). Our strategic pro bono partnerships Acumen Oxfam HK and UK Alzheimer’s Research UK Prisoners’ Advice Service Big Issue Foundation PURE Leapfrog British Red Cross RNIB Christian Aid Social Finance Five Talents South West London Law Centres Global Witness (SWLLC) NSPCC UNICEF Netherlands Pro bono is governed by an International Pro Bono Committee, chaired by Pro Bono Partner Richard Dyton, which meets monthly to set the direction of the Pro Bono Programme and approve new pro bono clients. In 2016 the Pro Bono Committee set the following strategy (developing from the central position in the firm’s business plan): To continue to support access to justice in the United Kingdom through the UK Collaborative Plan on pro bono and the provision of individual casework. To link our pro bono strategy to the broader CR strategy of responding to our clients’ concerns in relation to CR. To support sustainable ways to alleviate poverty, consistent with the UN Sustainable Development Goal 16, and in particular the following parts of that goal: Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms Develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels Page 3 Page 4 Our communities We take our responsibilities to contribute to our local communities seriously, and look for ways to engage with and support organisations and individuals and to share with them our time, knowledge, experience and expertise. Access to work experience and opportunities We are committed to a number of innovative and sustainable community projects that provide fair and equal opportunities to help people to realise their potential and develop their skills. We have a longstanding commitment to support young people in education to develop their future aspirations and assist them in their readiness for the world of work. Young Talent Programme Our ambitious and award-winning secondary school programme with Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, London has now been in place for five years and continues to develop with increased volunteer participation. The programme is designed to raise students’ aspirations through a series of ongoing, longer-term initiatives that provide access to the legal profession and wider work opportunities. Each year our firm, in collaboration with the school, selects a group of twelve Year 10 students to be part of the programme. The programme itself consists of a series of activities and mentoring, including work experience, presentations, workshops and paid internships. We make a commitment to support these students for up to seven years – during Years 10, 11, 12 and 13 whilst they are at school and college, and, if they decide to go on to university, the firm continues to provide on-going mentoring and an opportunity for them to apply for a bursary from the firm’s Charitable Foundation. There are currently 74 students enrolled on to the programme, all of whom have completed one week of work experience at the firm. 50 students have also completed a week’s paid summer internship. To date, six students have been awarded the Simmons & Simmons bursary to assist them through university. Supporting young people in Bristol Our Bristol office works with Envision and supports Redland Green School on the annual city-wide Community Apprentice programme under which Simmons & Simmons volunteers support 20 local students from disadvantaged backgrounds who develop community-focused projects over ten months before being assessed by the Mayor of Bristol. The Bristol office also continues to participate in a weekly reading scheme with Kingfisher Primary School to support students with lower reading abilities. Lawyers in Schools In our London office, we continued our long-standing partnership with both the Citizenship Foundation and a key client working on the Lawyers in Schools programme for students at Saint Saviour’s and Saint Olave’s School in Southwark, London. Volunteers from the firm lead small groups of students in interactive sessions about various legal issues including social media, consumer law and youth justice. These popular sessions are designed to foster debate and discussion, as well as to encourage critical thinking from the students so as to develop their awareness and understanding of the law and the legal system, their rights and responsibilities and how the law affects their everyday lives.

Law Centre (SWLLC) but as the programme aims to provide assistance to the most vulnerable, other referring agencies include disability organisations such as Disability Rights UK and mental health trusts. Page 7 Secondment to the Prisoners’ Advice Service The Prisoners’ Advice Service (PAS) is the only independent registered charity offering free information, legal advice and support to adult prisoners in England and Wales. They do this through their telephone advice line; through written correspondence; by delivering advice clinics within prisons; by training prisoners to become peer advisors; through legal casework; by publishing a quarterly prison law bulletin; and by providing information within the sector. PAS is run by 10 staff members (who together amount to around seven full-time staff). The availability of legal aid to fund prisoners’ legal cases has dramatically reduced since 2013: around 80% of prison law matters are now beyond the legal aid remit. Olivia Tattarletti, then a trainee solicitor with the firm, completed a six month secondment at PAS in 2016/17. Reflecting on her experiences in a series of internal blogs, Olivia observed: “Once you get used to the working environment, you start to see the real wonder of the silent revolution unfolding at each person’s desk. One by one, thanks to these individuals, thousands of prisoners each year are having better healthcare, are being allowed to see their families more often, are able to have an oral hearing to review their parole, are being treated equally to other prisoners, and are no longer feeling helpless due to rights violations. I left PAS on a positive note, on great terms with the team and with a newfound understanding of the ways in which, for many prisoners in an arbitrary system, their basic human rights are simply not being respected.” Battersea Legal Advice Centre – 30 years In 2016 the firm marked its 30th year working with Battersea Legal Advice Centre, and its umbrella organisation; South West London Law Centres (SWLLC). To mark this occasion, the firm held a celebration dinner in November 2016 attended by current and former SWLLC employees and trustees and former and current Battersea volunteers, and secondees of the firm. The firm subsequently received a letter from Patrick Marples, Chief Executive of SWLLC, reflecting upon the pioneering work carried out by the firm: “30 years ago you took forward the development of Battersea Law Centre... there was a clear need for good legal advice for ordinary people about every day matters [that] exceeded the law centre’s capacity. You started and helped pioneer a further partnership with the law centre and Wandsworth CAB with a new type of surgery that was staffed entirely by volunteers from your firm. This new type of surgery (a departure from a general rota of volunteer lawyers) was very successful and from this, further surgeries were developed that were linked with other firms.” Today, there are some 500 lawyers from across London volunteering with SWLLC each year. Page 8 Shelter – Advice on planning legislation We advised Shelter, one of the most prominent housing charities in the UK, in relation to the town planning aspects of the Neighbourhood Planning Bill particularly the reform of compulsory purchase powers. Shelter believes that the complex provisions for the payment of compensation for land taken that form part of the reform of the compulsory purchase process, may be key to the assembly of land and to incentivising developers to bring forward land for housing development. The bill has received royal assent in the first quarter of 2017. Germany Our Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Munich offices work with Law & Legal, one of the first German student pro bono legal advice non-profit associations by regularly reviewing the students’ research and advice. Our Frankfurt office hosted students for their regular meeting in March 2017 at which a get together with our lawyers also took place allowing those attending to exchange experiences and to strengthen our relationship with Law & Legal. The Arts The firm continues to support the Law for the Arts programme ran by Queen Mary University (QMU) Legal Advice Centre, where a group of lawyers from across the firm supervise QMU lawyers in providing advice and guidance to artists, designers, photographers and arts entrepreneurs helping them protect, enforce and respect intellectual property rights. The year just passed has seen lawyers and students advise on a huge variety of subject matter, from a documentary on British graffiti to the design of two of David Bowie’s iconic album covers. In the UK, the firm also provides advice to Help Musicians UK and The London Mozart Players Trust. The Brussels office supports Jeugd & Muziek Brussel (JMB), a non-profit organisation, part of the global Jeunesses Musicales International (JMI) network. JMB provides opportunities for children and young people to engage with all styles of music. This happens via school activities, music camps, music workshops and interactive concerts. In 2016, JMB went through a period of restructuring, and Simmons & Simmons Brussels supported them with employment advice. Supporting local communities Hong Kong Our Hong Kong office continues to closely support Sunshine Action Group to provide financial aid and material support to the poorest areas and people of Hong Kong. We have held several events this past year with all proceeds going to Sunshine Action, including our annual bake sale and a Christmas charity lunch. Spain Our Madrid office purchases and donates milk each week to Hijas de la Caridad, a charity social canteen that focuses on reintegrating people who are at risk of social exclusion, particularly immigrants, and those with mental illnesses and/or addictions.
