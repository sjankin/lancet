Net sales increased by 13.7 per cent to SEK 8,987 million on the back of growth in all three business areas. Organic growth was 2.5 per cent while acquisitions accounted for 11.3 per cent of the increase in net sales. The market situation was generally good in all business areas. Profitability improved during the year as EBITA* increased by 16.1 per cent to SEK 1,377 million. The EBITA margin* increased by 0.3 percentage points to 15.3 per cent. Market-leading niche companies Our businesses in Dental are leading suppliers of consumables, equipment and technical service for dentists across Europe, and the business area also has operations in the US. We sell dental technology to dentists in the Nordic countries and Germany, and develop and sell medical record systems in Denmark and Sweden. Dental increased net sales by 4.5 per cent while the EBITA margin* increased by 18.2 (17.9) per cent, mainly through acquisitions. Five acquisitions were consolidated during the year. Demolition & Tools is a world leader in the markets for demolition robots and crane attachments. We are also one of the leading global manufacturers of excavator attachments. Net sales grew by 9.7 per cent, driven by a robust performance in most markets. The business area’s product range was expanded through the acquisition of Aquajet Systems, which makes hydro demolition robots. Although Demolition & Tools saw good sales growth, margin growth was disappointing. The EBITA margin* was 23.0 (25.1) after being hit by a less favourable sales mix, inventory impairment and a weak pound. The Systems Solutions business area consists of five divisions that are leading players in their geographic markets: Interiors for Service Vehicles, Contract Manufacturing, Environmental Technology, Forest (formerly Sawmill Equipment) and Construction Materials (formerly Relining). Net sales in the business area increased by 26.9 per cent in 2016, resulting in an EBITA margin* of 11.5 (9.1) per cent. All divisions apart from Forest increased their sales. Five acquisitions were consolidated in Systems Solutions in 2016 while two companies in the Forest division were sold. We work continuously to improve our product portfolio, strengthen distribution systems and raise the productivity of our companies. Although we would like to see greater stability in the earnings impact of these measures in Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions, it is likely that earnings in these business areas will fluctuate from one quarter to the next. An efficient governance model Lifco is a highly decentralised organisation in which the subsidiary companies enjoy a high degree of autonomy. We want the companies we acquire to continue to operate as previously, simply because they know best what works in their market. We do not want to push central processes onto our subsidiaries. The coordination that takes place among our subsidiaries has been initiated by the companies themselves after they identified the synergies, with limited involvement from head office. Our governance model allows the subsidiaries to retain their entrepreneurial spirit and short lines of command. This is a key argument for entrepreneurs that are looking for a new ownership structure and it is also a key reason why our companies retain and strengthen their market positions in their respective niches. 6 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 COMMENTS FROM THE CEO Financially strong Cash flow was strong in 2016 and our financial position remains good. Net interestbearing debt increased by SEK 1,068 million to SEK 3,018 (1,950) million while Lifco made net acquisitions of SEK 1,608 million and paid dividends of SEK 285 million in total. This means that Lifco at year-end had the capacity to make further acquisitions for around SEK 2,000 million without exceeding a net debt of three times EBITDA. Our financial position enables us to continue to pursue our strategy of growth through acquisitions, but any potential takeover candidate face tough requirements. The company needs to be stable and a leading player in its niche. We want it to have an attractive position in the value chain and not be dependent on specific suppliers or customers. And it needs to be able to demonstrate well documented profitability and limited or no exposure to technological risk. Fredrik Karlsson, CEO We believe our decentralised governance model with a high degree of autonomy for our subsidiaries is an important factor when in negotiations with potential takeover candidates. In many cases a key factor is that the entrepreneur who built the company wants to remain, partly because these individuals are often important for customer relations and partly because they are important for the company culture and the way the company operates. A criterion for the successful operation of our decentralised model is that we have clear Group-wide ethical principles. Our ethical principles are set forth in our code of conduct. The chief executives of all subsidiaries are required to ensure that they abide by the code of conduct and senior management regularly monitors compliance with the code. The code of conduct covers the company’s relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, society and the environment as well as shareholders. Lifco signs Global Compact To further underline our support for internationally recognised business ethical standards and our long-term commitment to sustainability issues, Lifco joined and signed the UN’s sustainability initiative, Global Compact, in December 2016. As a member, we undertake actively to implement the Global Compact’s ten principles for sustainable development in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. The core values by which we live Our core values lie at the heart of our code of conduct and guide us in our everyday work. Our core values are: Respect for others: Affirming that all people have the same value, we should make an effort to listen to and respect the opinion of each individual, even if we do not share it. Openness: It is of the utmost that we create an atmosphere in which people dare to be open. To achieve this, we need to openly acknowledge our mistakes. It is natural for human beings to make mistakes. Pragmatism: We should strive to make the best possible decision in each situation. Our decisions must be based exclusively on facts, without preconceptions. Decisions must not be influenced by prejudices, convictions or pride. Going into 2017 The most important factor for Lifco is our employees. We have 3,627 employees in 26 countries. I would like to say a big thank you to each of you for your hard word in 2016. Our focus remains on acquiring and developing profitable, market-leading niche businesses with the potential to deliver sustainable earnings growth and robust cash flows. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 7 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Directors´ report Business concept and objectives Lifco’s business concept is to acquire and develop profitable, market-leading niche businesses with the potential to deliver sustainable earnings growth and robust cash flows. Lifco is guided by a clear philosophy that is centred on profitability, a highly decentralised organisation and a long-term approach. The objective is sustainable earnings growth Lifco’s primary objective is to generate sustainable earnings growth. The Group and subsidiaries’ goal is to ensure that organic EBITA growth exceeds GDP growth in the relevant geographic markets over the course of a business cycle. Additional growth should be achieved through acquisitions. Efficient use of capital is another important objective for Lifco. Return on capital employed after deduction for goodwill and other intangible assets should therefore exceed 50 per cent for the last twelve-month period. A decentralised organisation Lifco consists of 132 subsidiaries, which are organised in about 30 operating units.The heads of the operating units report directly to Lifco’s Chief Executive Officer or the head of the Dental business area. The operating units operate in eight divisions, which in turn form part of the three business areas Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. This decentralised organisation is one of the cornerstones of Lifco’s governance philosophy. The individual subsidiaries are given a large degree of freedom, which encourages a strong entrepreneurial spirit. As the subsidiaries are managed independently, each company is able to retain its specific culture. They can also continue to employ the methods that are used in the industries and markets in which they operate. A strong entrepreneurial spirit is one explanation for the Lifco Group’s ability to retain key individuals in the companies which it acquires. In many cases, the key individuals are attracted by Lifco’s decentralised structure, which allows them to maintain a high degree of independence also after the acquisition. Minimal bureaucracy Lifco has developed a model for developing its subsidiaries. The model is based on Lifco’s philosophy centred on earnings, decentralisation and a long-term approach. It is the fruit of many years’ experience of building businesses. In simplified terms, the model can be described as follows: • Motivated and dedicated heads of subsidiaries • Minimal bureaucracy and simple processes • A focus on customers with the potential to generate sustainable earnings growth • An efficient cost structure with a focus on value-creating functions • Monthly monitoring of the subsidiaries’ income statements and balance sheets with a focus on EBITA*, changes in capital employed and cash flow A clear strategy for acquisitions Expansion through acquisitions is a central element of Lifco’s business concept. The Group’s acquisitions include the acquisition of new companies that can constitute separate divisions as well as acquisitions of additional businesses for the existing divisions. An acquisition must either generate profitable growth and good cash flows or meet a strategic objective. The risk taken must also be limited for Lifco. 8 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT EMPLOYEES 3,627 COUNTRIES 26 COMPANIES 132 The map shows the countries where Lifco has employees.

A high ethical standard A fundamental requirement for Lifco’s decentralised structure is that the subsidiaries operate in accordance with Lifco’s ethical principles. The ethical principles are set forth in the code of conduct, which all subsidiaries are required to follow. Compliance with the code is monitored regularly by the Group Management Team. The code of conduct includes Lifco’s core values: respect for others, openness and pragmatism. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 9 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Financial performance 2016 was another year of solid growth for Lifco. Net sales and earnings improved through acquisitions as well as organic growth. Eleven acquired businesses were consolidated during the year. Net sales increased by 13.7 per cent to SEK 8,987 (7,901) million. Acquired growth was 11.3 per cent and organic growth 2.5 per cent. Changes in exchange rates had a negative impact of 0.1 per cent on net sales. EBITA* increased by 16.1 per cent to SEK 1,377 (1,186) million, driven by organic growth and acquisitions, and the EBITA margin* improved to 15.3 (15.0) per cent. During the year 40 per cent of EBITA* was generated in EUR, 28 per cent in SEK, 13 per cent in NOK, 6 per cent in DKK, 5 per cent in USD, 4 per cent in GBP and 4 per cent in other currencies. Investments in intangible and tangible fixed assets totalled SEK 123 (111) million. Net financial items amounted to SEK -33 (-25) million, the increase being due mainly to higher interest expenses. Earnings before tax grew by 12.7 per cent to SEK 1,219 (1,082) million. Acquisition cost-related items had a negative impact of SEK 18 (13) million on earnings for 2016. Net profit for the year grew by 12.4 per cent to SEK 927 (825) million and earnings per share increased by 12.1 per cent to SEK 9.99 (8.91). The Group’s tax expense was SEK 292 (257) million, which represents 24.0 (23.8) per cent of earnings before tax. Tax paid was SEK 295 (239) million, which equates to 24.2 (22.1) per cent of earnings before tax. Inventories were SEK 1,155 (960) million and trade receivables SEK 1,046 (863) million. Average capital employed excluding goodwill increased over the year to SEK 974 (966) million while EBITA* in relation to average capital employed excluding goodwill was 141 (123) per cent at year-end. The improvement was due to increased profit and good control of capital employed. Goodwill and other intangible assets totalled SEK 6,824 (5,010) million at year-end. The Group’s net interest-bearing debt increased by SEK 1,068 million in 2016 to SEK 3,018 (1,950) million while the net debt ratio was 0.6 (0.5) at year-end. At the same date, 40 per cent of the Group’s interest-bearing liabilities were denominated in EUR. Equity was SEK 4,758 (3,964) million and the equity/assets ratio 47.0 (49.2) per cent. Cash flow from operating activities improved by 14.4 per cent to SEK 1,084 (948) million compared with 2015. The continued strong cash flow was due to increased profit and good control of capital employed. Cash flow from investing activities was SEK -1,721 (-664) million, which was mainly attributable to acquisitions. Cash flow was also affected by total dividend payments of SEK 285 (252) million. Dividend The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer propose that the Annual General Meeting authorise the payment of a dividend of SEK 3.50 per share for 2017, representing a total distribution of SEK 318.0 million. This is equal to 35 per cent of the net profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders, which is consistent with Lifco’s dividend policy. Under the dividend policy, the long-term objective is to ensure stable dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio of 30-50 per cent of after-tax earnings. Dividends should be based on the company’s earnings performance having regard to future development opportunities and the company’s financial position. 10 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Product development Net sales by Innovation and product development are key success factors, especially in Demolition business area & Tools and Systems Solutions. Innovation and product development enable Lifco to strengthen its customer offering and establish sustainable organic growth. Acquisitions of businesses complement the Group’s internal product development. Developments in the market are monitored continuously by all subsidiaries and a large number of potential projects are evaluated each year. In 2016 product development costs totalled SEK 88 41% 40% (73) million. Acquisitions after the end of the year 19% On 30 December 2016, it was announced that Lifco had acquired Haglöf Sweden, a world-leading supplier of instruments for professional forestry surveyors. Haglöf Sweden generated sales of around SEK 60 million in the financial year 2015/16 and has 43 Dental employees. In February 2017, Haglöf Sweden was consolidated in the Systems Solutions Demolition & Tools business area, Forest division. Systems Solutions On 14 February 2017, Lifco announced the acquisition of Hultdin System, a leading manufacturer of tools and attachments for forestry and construction machinery.

Environmental The subsidiary companies Lövånger Elektronik AB, permits Modul-System HH AB, Rapid Granulator AB, Texor AB and Zetterströms Rostfria AB are engaged in environmentally hazardous activities pursuant to the Swedish Environmental Code, which means that they are regulated by the environment committee at the relevant local authority. Sustainability activities in some of Lifco’s subsidiaries Labour standards Modul-System is one of the world’s leading suppliers of modular interiors and equipment for service vehicles that sells its products and human rights in more than 50 countries around the world through subsidiaries and a global network of business partners. Modul-System works strategically on monitoring quality and sustainability issues at the supplier stage, in China and other countries. The company conducts audits of strategic suppliers and in some cases also of subcontractors to ensure that they comply with Lifco’s code of conduct with regard to labour standards, human rights and other issues. In 2016 eight audits were conducted and no deviations from Lifco’s code of conduct were observed. Environment Lövånger Elektronik AB (Leab) is one of Sweden’s leading contract manufacturers of electronics. The company has taken a focused approach to reducing its environmental impact through continuous improvement and has been ISO 14001-certified since 2001. The company’s environmental activities are guided by Lifco’s code of conduct and Leab’s own environmental policy, and by environmental targets that are defined on an annual basis. For example, in 2016 Leab worked to replace at least five chemicals with greener alternatives. It is also working continually to reduce the share of hazardous waste in the total volume of waste. In 2014 Leab switched from the use of oil-fired boilers for heating to purchasing renewable electricity, which has resulted in a slightly higher heating cost but has significantly reduced the company’s carbon footprint. In 2016 Leab continued its efforts to map energy use. It is also working to reuse waste heat from the processes used for heating the factory. Anti-corruption As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of remote-controlled demolition machines, Brokk has customers across the world, including in Russia, China and India. The company’s products are sold by its own sales staff and through partners in the sales markets. Brook works continuously to inform its staff and distributors about Lifco’s code of conduct. In 2016 an initiative aimed at mapping corruption risks at Brokk was initiated in order to strengthen the company’s anti-corruption work. The developed monitoring processes are planned to be implemented in the coming year. Diversity Lifco strives to conduct its business in a way that makes a positive and sustainable contribution to the society in which the company operates. For example, in 2016 DAB Dental and Directa, two of Lifco’s subsidiaries in the dental industry, arranged two cost-free training days for dentists that have received their education outside the EU/EEA and therefore need to take the knowledge test arranged by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare to be able to work as dentists in Sweden. By taking part in the training days, the foreign dentists, most of whom are from Syria and eastern Europe, improve their chances of passing the knowledge text and obtaining their Swedish dentist’s licences. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 13 XXXXXXX 14 LIFCO ÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT 2016 2015 XXXXXXX Lifco's distribution companies in the Nordic region are for instance reseller of dental equipment from Sirona. LIFCO LIFCOÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT 2016 2015 15 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Business Area Dental The companies in Lifco’s Dental business area are leading suppliers of consumables, equipment and technical service for dentists based mainly in northern and central Europe. In 2016 Dental acquired a more significant operation in the United States through the acquisition of Parkell. Lifco also sells dental technology to dentists in the Nordic countries and Germany, and develops and sells medical record systems for dental clinics in Denmark and Sweden. The business area also includes a number of small manufacturers which produce disinfectants, saliva ejectors, bite registration, dental impression and bonding materials as well as other consumables that are sold to dentists through distributors around the world. A stable, non-cyclical market Dental care is a significant market, accounting for around 0.5 per cent of GDP in Lifco’s main markets. Demand for dental care in Europe has remained stable and relatively non-cyclical. During the period 2007-2012 expenditure on dental care in Lifco’s main markets (excluding Norway) grew by an average of 1.6 per cent annually. The market has grown modestly also in the last few years. A dental clinic needs a large number of products, ranging from consumables such as tissues and gloves to advanced technical equipment such as X-ray machines and dental chairs. Lifco fills an important role in the dental market by bringing together a large number of suppliers in what is otherwise a fragmented market. The market for dental care products can be divided into consumables, equipment and technical service, and dental technology. Consumables account for around 70 per cent of total sales. Demand for consumables is non-cyclical and is characterised by small but frequent orders, which requires a high level of delivery reliability and a broad product range. Demand for equipment is relatively stable and depends mainly on the age of the installed equipment, the length of the replacement cycle and the number of new dental clinics. Shared warehouses Although Lifco’s subsidiaries mostly operate independently of each other, they collaborate to some extent on goods purchases. Lifco has three central warehouses for consumable goods, located in Enköping in Sweden, outside Aarhus in Denmark and in Büdingen, Germany. The Enköping warehouse offers around 44,000 products, the Danish warehouse around 18,000 and the German warehouse around 58,000. Lifco as a whole offers products from about 500 suppliers. A part of the range consists of own brands, which focus mainly on less complex products. Own brands account for around ten per cent of net sales in the subsidiaries. Lifco is working actively to increase the share of own brands. In dental technology Lifco operates mainly in Germany but also in the Nordic countries. Lifco provides most of the products, including crowns and bridges, which are made in China, the Philippines and Turkey. This enables Lifco to achieve cost advantages over local dental laboratories. Lifco handles the central parts of the process, such as dental prosthesis design and contacts with dentists. This ensures a high level of quality and proximity to the customers. Online sales Consumables are sold through three main channels: the subsidiaries’ sales forces, catalogue sales and online.

Lifco is the world’s leading supplier of demolition robots and crane attachments. The company is also one of the leading global suppliers of excavator attachments. The operations are divided into two divisions, Demolition Robots and Crane & Excavator Attachments, which are of roughly equal size in terms of sales. Demolition robots The remote-controlled demolition robots are sold under the Brokk brand. The machines are easy to manoeuvre and can be deployed without time-consuming preparations. They can also handle hot and stressful environments. The arms have a long reach and a wide range of attachments increase the machines’ flexibility and applications. In addition to demolition, Brokk’s machines are also used for renovation of cement kilns and removal of linings. As the machines can be remote-controlled, they are suitable for use in elevated-risk environments such as nuclear power plants and for handling contaminated materials. The company’s main market is the global construction and demolition industry. Its sales follow the trend in the global market for construction machinery. The demolition robots are sold directly to the end customers or to selected distributors and agents. The components are produced by contract manufacturers and the products are assembled in Sweden. The company also has some production in Germany. Crane and excavator attachments Lifco’s crane and excavator attachments are sold under the Kinshofer, Demarec, RF-System and Auger Torque brands. The attachments make it possible to use the same crane or excavator for different purposes. Typical applications include construction and earthworks, snow clearing, demolition, pipe and cable laying, forestry work, scrap handling and railway works. Sales of crane and excavator attachments largely follow global machinery sales. As purchasing an attachment from Lifco is a smaller investment for the customer than buying a new machine, the market is less cyclical than construction machinery. Crane attachments are sold directly to the crane manufacturers while excavator attachments are sold mainly through resellers. The products are sold under Lifco’s brands or under the crane and excavator manufacturers’ own brands. In 2016 Lifco acquired a majority stake in Aquajet Systems of Sweden, which manufactures hydro demolition robots. Aquajet Systems is a world leader in its market niche. After the end of the year, in February 2017, Lifco announced the acquisition of Hultdin System of Sweden, a leading manufacturer of tools and attachments for forestry and construction machines. 18 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT NO SE CA GB DE FI US NL CH FR AE CN AT IT CZ SG au The map shows countries where employees within business area Demolition & Tools are in place.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 8-74 of this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as at 31 December 2016 and of its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at 31 December 2016 and of its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance report on pages 29-35. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopt the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group. BASIS FOR OPINIONS We conducted our audit in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section Auditor’s responsibility. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. OUR AUDIT APPROACH Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We paid particular attention to those areas where management made subjective judgements, such as significant accounting estimates that were based on assumptions and forecasts of future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures, and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters which, in our professional judgment, were of greatest significance for the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts for the period concerned. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of, and in the preparation of our opinion on, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not present a separate opinion on these matters. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 37 AUDITOR’S REPORT Key audit matters How the key audit matter was addressed in our audit Impairment testing of intangible assets In our audit, we have assessed the calculation model used by management Reference to Note 4 Significant estimates and judgements and Note 14 and have confirmed that the key assumptions applied in the model are Intangible assets. consistent with the company’s budget and strategic plan. We have also assessed the reasonableness of management’s assumptions and The value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives was SEK judgements, without arriving at a deviating view of such assumptions and 5,531 million at 31 December 2016. Under IFRS, management is required judgements. This assessment took the form of an analysis of the outcome to test the assets for impairment annually. of assumptions applied in previous years and of any adjustments made to No impairment has been identified by management. In our audit, we have assumptions from previous years in response to operational changes and focused on the risk that goodwill and trademarks are too highly valued and external factors. may be impaired. With regard to the businesses acquired during the year in the Systems Of the total value of goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives Solutions business area, our audit was aimed specifically at challenging of SEK 5,531 million, SEK 3,594 million is attributable to the reporting the assumptions concerning market conditions contained in the business segment Dental, which is showing stable growth and profitability and plans of the individual companies, in respect of the future construction where the value in use calculated in the impairment test significantly market in Norway, as well as regards the global shipping market. exceeds the carrying amount.

This applies companies. We have also carried out our own sensitivity analyses to test particularly to the following: the safety margins in each operating segment, with a view to determining • Estimates of the future growth rate and discount rate, where small the degree to which the key variables can change before giving rise to deviations have a significant impact on the calculation of value in use; impairment.

The uncertainty inherent in assessments of the future performance of these businesses is more significant, as they operate in niche areas of markets, such as shipping and construction materials, which are new to the group. Recognition of acquisitions We have verified the disclosures on the acquisitions made in the annual report In the financial year 2016, Lifco made 11 acquisitions across all business and have examined the source documents used as a basis for the recognition areas. Information on these acquisitions is presented in Note 32. of the acquisitions. In examining the initial recognition of the acquisitions, we have reviewed the acquisition agreements, as well as source documents for The total purchase price for the acquisitions, net of acquired cash and cash opening balances. We have also evaluated the implemented adjustments for equivalents, was SEK 1,649 million, of which SEK 976 million refers to adaptation to the group’s accounting principles. identified fair value adjustments in the acquisition analyses for trademarks, customer relationships and licences and SEK 697 million refers to goodwill. Our audit has also included a review of significant estimates and judgements made in connection with the allocation of fair value in acquisition analyses, The recognition of acquisitions involves a high degree of judgement by which has involved assessing the basis for the judgements and comparing management. Significant estimates and judgements refer to the allocation of those judgements with similar acquisitions in the group in previous years. fair value in acquisition analyses for assets and liabilities, as well as referring to adjustments for adaptation to the group’s accounting principles. Our examination did not result in any significant deviations.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives Each year the Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment in accordance with the accounting principle described in Note 2. Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units have been determined by calculating value in use. For these calculations, certain estimates need to be made (see Note 14). Valuation of loss carry forwards Each year the Group assesses whether there is reason to recognise deferred tax assets in respect of loss carry forwards for the year. A deferred tax asset is recognised for loss carry forwards only to the extent that it is probable that these can be used to offset future taxable profits and taxable temporary differences.

Other senior executives refer to the three individuals who, together with the CEO, make up the senior management team. For the composition of the senior management team, see page 35. The balance between basic salary and variable remuneration must be proportionate to the executive’s responsibilities and authority. Variable remuneration: For the CEO variable remuneration is capped at 70 per cent of the fixed salary and based on achieved results. For other senior executives, variable remuneration is based on the outcome in relation to individually defined targets. Pensions: The retirement age for the CEO is 60 years at the earliest. Lifco sets aside an amount equal to 60 per cent (excluding payroll costs) of the CEO’s fixed salary to pension and capital redemption pension plans, and life and health insurance policies. Other senior executives are entitled to pension benefits of up to 35 per cent of their fixed salary and the earliest retirement age is 60. All pension benefits are vested, i.e. they are not conditional on future employment with Lifco. 54 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Termination salary: The CEO’s employment contract is terminable on 12 months’ notice in case of termination by the company and six months’ notice in case of termination by the CEO. The employment contracts of other senior executives are terminable on 12 months’ notice in case of termination by the company. The right to a salary and other benefits are retained during the notice period. Drafting and decision-making process: During the year the Remuneration Committee submitted recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning principles for remuneration of senior executives. The recommendations covered the proportion between fixed and variable remuneration, and the size of any salary increases. The Remuneration Committee has also proposed criteria for assessing bonus outcomes. The Board has discussed the Remuneration Committee’s proposal and made decisions on the basis of the committee’s recommendations. The remuneration payable to the CEO for the financial year 2016 was approved by the Board based on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration paid to other senior executives was approved by the CEO in consultation with the Chairman of the Board. In 2016 the Remuneration Committee convened on two occasions.

The assumptions used in estimating value in use are the same for goodwill and trademarks. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is determined based on calculations of value in use. These calculations are made on the basis of estimated future cash flows before tax based on five-year financial budgets that have been approved by senior management. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate. The estimated growth rate is assumed to represent the growth rate in the fifth year, which is expected to be around 2 per cent for all operating segments in both 2016 and 2015. Assumptions have also been made for gross margin, overheads, working capital requirements and investment requirements. The parameters have been set to represent an annual growth rate of 2 (2) per cent for all operating segments. The pre-tax discount rate used is 10.5 (10.8) per cent for Dental and 11.5 (11.7) per cent for other the operating segments. The calculation as at 31 December 2016 shows that value in use exceeds the carrying amount for all cash-generating units. There is thus no impairment. Nor was any impairment identified as at 31 December 2015. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 57 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis shows that the remaining goodwill value for all cash-generating units would remain warranted if the discount rate were raised by 1 percentage point or the growth rate, terminal growth or gross margin were reduced by 1 percentage point. Lifco’s reportable operating segments are Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. For the purpose of performing impairment tests, goodwill is allocated, with the exception of the reportable segments Dental and Demolition & Tools, to the five cash-generating units: Construction Materials (formerly Relining), Interiors for Service Vehicles, Contract Manufacturing, Environmental Technology and Forest (formerly Sawmill Equipment).

The carrying amount of defined benefit obligations is SEK 37 (39) million. For salaried employees in Sweden defined benefit pension obligations for retirement and family pensions under the ITP 2 plan are secured through an insurance policy with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 3 Classification of ITP Plans Funded through Insurance with Alecta, this is a defined benefit plan covering several employers. For the financial year 2016 the company has not had access to information that would enable it to account for its proportionate share of the plan’s obligations, assets and expenses. It has therefore not been possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. The ITP 2 pension plan secured through an insurance policy with Alecta is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The premium for defined benefit retirement and family pensions is calculated individually and depends on factors such as salary, previously earned pension and expected remaining period of service. Expected fees in the next reporting period for ITP 2 insurance policies with Alecta are SEK 9 (11) million. The collective funding ratio is defined as the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of its commitments to policyholders calculated using Alecta’s actuarial methods and assumptions, which do not comply with IAS 19. The collective funding ratio may normally vary within a range of 125 and 155 per cent. If Alecta’s collective funding ratio were to fall below 125 per cent or exceed 155 per cent it would be necessary to take measures that will enable the ratio return to the normal range. In case of a low collective funding ratio one measure that can be taken is to raise the agreed price for new subscriptions and expansion of the existing benefits. A high collective funding ratio can be addressed by introducing premium reductions. At the end of 2016 Alecta’s surplus, as defined by the collective funding ratio, was 149 per cent (2015: 153 per cent). Lifco has made pension promises to two persons and in connection therewith purchased endowment policies which have been posted as collateral for the pensions of these employees. Under the arrangement, the individuals concerned will receive the value of the endowment policies less payroll tax. As there are no guaranteed remuneration levels, the Group’s net obligation will always be zero. These endowment policies are considered to be plan assets and are recognised on a net basis after deducting the obligation. 62 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 27 Provisions Restructuring SEK million Guarantee reserve reserve Premises costs Other provisions Total 1 January 2016 46 2 3 14 65 Additional provisions 22 4 26 Acquisition of companies 3 3 Utilised during the year -10 -1 -1 -7 -19 Reversal of unused provisions -17 -17 Reclassifications 2 -1 1 Translation differences 2 1 3 31 December 2016 48 1 1 12 62 of which long-term provisions 30 1 1 9 41 of which short-term provisions 18 3 21 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 years 30 1 1 9 41 Within 3 years 6 1 7 Within 5 years 9 2 11 After more than 5 years 3 3 31 December 2016 48 1 1 12 62 1 January 2015 37 3 2 13 55 Additional provisions 27 1 4 32 Acquisition of companies 2 1 1 4 Utilised during the year -12 -2 -1 -2 -17 Reversal of unused provisions -6 -6 Reclassifications -1 -1 Translation differences -1 -1 -2 31 December 2015 46 2 3 14 65 of which long-term provisions 14 2 1 6 23 of which short-term provisions 32 2 8 42 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 years 32 2 8 42 Within 3 years 4 2 1 1 8 Within 5 years 9 1 10 After more than 5 years 1 4 5 31 December 2015 46 2 3 14 65 The warranty provision is based on outstanding commitments at the balance sheet date and the calculation is based on previous experience. Other provisions refer mainly to commissions to agents in the Dental business area. In addition, the company has issued guarantee commitments for SEK 1 (1) million while other contingent liabilities total SEK 134 (108) million. As it has been deemed that no outflow of funds will take place for these commitments, no provisions have been made (see also the information in Note 31). Note 28 Transactions with related parties Transactions between Lifco AB and its subsidiaries, which are associated companies of Lifco AB, have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales of products and services between Group companies are subject to commercial terms and conditions and made at market prices. Intercompany sales were SEK 2,138 (2,071) million during the year. Carl Bennet AB owns 50.1 per cent of the shares of Lifco and is deemed to control the Group. Other related parties include all subsidiaries in the Group as well as senior executives in the Group, i.e. the Board of Directors and senior management. Lifco AB, the parent company of the Lifco Group, has purchased administrative services from Carl Bennet AB worth SEK 1 (1) million.

The acquisitions of Redoma Recycling, Dens Esthetix and Endodontiprodukter were asset deals. In the fourth quarter AriVislanda and Renholmen were sold. The sales had no significant impact on the Group’s results or financial position. The purchase price allocation includes all acquisitions that were made during the year. The purchase price allocations are preliminary until one year after the acquisition date. Out of the resultant goodwill, SEK 167 million is tax-deductible. Acquisition-related expenses of SEK 18 million are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for 2016. Since the respective consolidation dates the acquired companies have added SEK 852 million to consolidated net sales and SEK 136 million to EBITA. If all acquired units had been consolidated from 1 January 2016 net sales for the year would have increased by a further estimated SEK 401 million to SEK 1,253 million and EBITA by approximately SEK 68 million to SEK 204 million.

No repurchases of shares held as treasury shares by the parent company were made during the period. SEK million 2016 2015 Profit attributable to parent company shareholders 908 810 Weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares 90,843,260 90,843,260 Earnings per share (SEK) 9,99 8,91 After dilution: Earnings per share after dilution are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for the dilutive effect of all potential ordinary shares. There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares in 2016 or 2015. Earnings per share were thus the same before and after dilution. Note 34 Dividend per share Dividend payments made in 2016 and 2015 totalled SEK 273 million (SEK 3.00 per share) and SEK 236 million (SEK 2.60 per share), respectively. At the Annual General Meeting on 4 May 2017 the Board will propose a dividend for the financial year 2016 of SEK 3.50 per share, for a total dividend payment of SEK 318 million. The proposed dividend has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. Note 35 Sale of subsidiaries In the fourth quarter AriVislanda and Renholmen were sold. The sales had no significant impact on the Group’s results or financial position. In the fourth quarter Proline Iceland EFT and Proline Relining Sl were sold in accordance with a resolution of the Annual General Meeting 2016. The sales had no impact, resulting in a consolidated capital gain of zero. In June 2015 NETdental was sold in accordance with a resolution of the Annual General Meeting 2015. The sale had no impact, resulting in a consolidated capital gain of zero. Note 36 Events after the end of the reporting period In January 2017 Lifco finalised the acquisition of Haglöf Sweden, a world-leading supplier of instruments for professional forestry surveyors. Haglöf Sweden generated sales of around SEK 60 million in the financial year 2015/16 and has 43 employees. Haglöf Sweden will be consolidated in the Systems Solutions business area, Forest division (formerly Sawmill Equipment). In February 2017 Lifco finalised the acquisition of Hultdin System, a leading manufacturer of tools and attachments for forestry and construction machinery. Hultdins, with 66 employees, generated net sales of SEK 152 million in the financial year 2015/16. The business will be consolidated in the Demolition & Tools business area. The acquisitions will not have a significant impact on Lifco’s results and financial position in the current year. Preliminary purchase price allocations will be presented in the interim report for the first quarter of 2017.

The parent company applies other accounting principles than the Group in those cases which are indicated below. Format The format prescribed in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act is used for the income statements and balance sheets. The income statement is divided into two statements: one for profit or loss and one for comprehensive income. The parent company has no items which are accounted for as other comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income is therefore the same as net profit for the year. The statement of changes in equity follows the format used in the Group but contains the columns specified in the Annual Accounts Act. The formats for the parent company have different names compared with the consolidated financial statements, primarily with regard to financial income and expense, provisions, and items in equity. Holdings in subsidiaries Holdings in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment. Cost includes acquisition-related costs and any additional considerations. When there is an indication that holdings in a subsidiary are impaired, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses are recognised in the items “Profit/loss from holdings in Group companies”. Financial instruments The parent company does not apply IAS 39 for financial instruments. All financial assets are classified in the category “Loans and receivables”. Leases All leases, both finance leases and operating leases, are classified as operating leases. Revenue Other operating revenue in the parent company includes costs billed to subsidiaries. Group contributions Group contributions paid and received are both accounted for as appropriations in the income statement. Note 39 The parent company’s sales to and purchases from Group companies During the year, the parent company invoiced the subsidiaries SEK 90 (84) million for Group-wide services. The parent company has not purchased services from subsidiaries.

Audit services in addition to audit engagement refer to the examination of interim reports and similar work. Other services refer to advice on financial reporting as well as services in connection with acquisitions.
