B3: BORN FROM THE MERGER OF BM&FBOVESPA AND CETIP. B3 was created in March 2017 as the result of a merger between BM&FBOVESPA and CETIP. BM&FBOVESPA: The combination gave rise to a world-class financial market infrastructure company, consolidating BM&FBOVESPA’s position in listed products trading a future without borders and post-trading, and CETIP’s position in registration and depositoAnnual Report 2016 ry services for OTC securities. The merger extended the range of products and services offered to B3’s customers, as well as creating efficiencies for both the company and the market. However, because this report covers the period between January 1 and December 12, 2016, its contents refer solely to BM&FBOVESPA S.A. Securities, Commodities & Futures Exchange. Message from the Board of Directors G4-1 Transformational decisions that make our business even more robust The year 2016 stands out as one of the most important years in the Company’s history in light of the approval by our shareholders in May of the proposal to combine our activities with those of CETIP. The merger was evaluated by the regulators (CVM, BCB and CADE) and consummated in March 2017. This important strategic step will enable the Company to expand and diversify its portfolio of products and services, and create an even more complete world-class market infrastructure company capable of serving customers more efficiently than ever. Another key aspect of the merger is that it has been engineered without impairing the Company’s robustness and financial solidity. This was made possible by the use of a structure that combined a stock swap and cash payment for equity in CETIP. Funding for the cash payment was obtained by selling our remaining investment in the equity of CME Group and issuing bonds in late 2016. This debt is practically provisional as it will be repaid in the next three years. Now, in 2017, we are enthusiastically facing the challenges of integrating these two winning business organizations: creating a new corporate culture that preserves their strengths and makes them even stronger; always seeking to surprise our customers, participants and regulators positively; and continuing to lead the development of the financial and capital markets in Brazil. We have decided to adopt a new name and logo. Now we are B3. This symbolizes our focus on the future, on the new Company that will always strive to be more than the sum of the two organizations from which it was born. I There will also be significant changes in our leadership. After an outstanding professional career, including a fundamental role in building and developing Brazil’s financial and capital markets and creating B3, Edemir Pinto has stepped down as Chief Executive Officer. The new CEO is Gilson Finkelsztain, who has headed CETIP for the past several years and whose career includes more than 20 years in the financial service industry. We are confident that with the support of the Company’s senior officers and other staff Gilson will continue the legacy left by Edemir. The Board of Directors, which has also undergone changes and been joined by new outside members with complementary experience, continues to support the Executive Board in strategic matters and to monitor topics of relevance to the Company through its committees. To return to 2016, the political and economic scene around us was marked by very significant political changes and changes in expectations, both globally and in Brazil. Events such as the British referendum decision to leave the European Union, the rebound in prices of several commodities and the US election outcome brought acute volatility and heightened uncertainty to global markets. In Brazil the year began with negative expectations regarding the level of economic activity and fiscal disequilibrium, both of which were directly linked to the domestic political situation that culminated with the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. Some of these expectations were confirmed, and the economic recession dragged on for a second year. However, the political transition and new economic policy improved the mediumand long-term outlook. A series of fiscal adjustment measures and structural reforms were announced with the aim of addressing the imbalances and restoring confidence in the business sector and among consumers and financial markets. Despite the continuing recession, these changes had a direct impact on the performance of the equity market (Bovespa segment), which displayed gains in both turnover and market capitalization of listed companies. In the case of derivatives (BM&F segment), the increase in volume was neutralized by a fall in the average price charged by the Company, especially owing to significant changes in the mix of contracts traded. For example, there was a rise in the share of mini contracts, which are priced below average. Nevertheless, net revenue rose 4.7% compared with 2015, demonstrating the resilience of our business even in an adverse environment. II We continued to focus on executing our strategic plan. We proceeded with the development and testing required to implement the new BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse and CORE risk model in the equity market, a transformational project for the Company that should be completed in 2017. We advanced in the process of reviewing the special listing segments, Novo Mercado and Corporate Governance Level 2, which seeks to enhance the governance practices required from listed companies, and hence assure the competitiveness of the Brazilian equity market and its attractiveness to local and international investors. We also continued to seize opportunities for cooperation and development as part of our strategy for expansion in Latin America by investing in minority holdings and building long-term relationships with exchanges in the region. In 2016, we also proceeded with our projects to promote responsible investment toward genuinely sustainable development. It is worth recalling that we were the first exchange in the world to sign up to the UN Global Compact in 2004. Finally, we reaffirm our commitment to the execution of our strategic plan via the merger with CETIP, investment in projects, and product, commercial and risk management initiatives. This will enable us to capture growth opportunities, strengthen relationships with customers, regulators and market participants, and contribute to the development of the Brazilian markets in order to generate growing value for our shareholders in the long term.

About this Report back to summary This report presents information on the management and performance of our main activities, products and services, as well as topics we consider material to our business and to our stakeholders. Year after year BM&FBOVESPA seeks to enhance the construction of its annual report. This is the eighth consecutive annual report to follow the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The 2016 edition is based on GRI G4, “in accordance” with the Core option. G4-30/ G4-32 The report addresses the aspects that create shared value in the short, medium and long term for the company’s key stakeholders: shareholders, investors, issuers, market participants (banks, brokerage houses, custody agents and clearing agents), regulators (CVM, the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission; and BCB, the Central Bank of Brazil), employees, and suppliers (especially of technology). G4-24 In this direction, the Materiality Matrix structured in 2015 spotlights six drivers deemed most relevant for the company and its stakeholders: technological and operational excellence; risk management, self-regulation and market supervision; governance practices; development of markets, products and services; financial solidity; and people management. G4-27 These pillars were defined by consultations with several of the company’s departments (Investor Relations; Media Relations, Sustainability & Communications; HR; Internal Controls, Compliance & Corporate Risk; and Finance) and with key stakeholders including customers, analysts and market participants. These sources were fundamental to correlate the indicators and produce the contents of this publication. G4-18 BM&FBOVESPA also engages continuously with stakeholders through its strategic areas and relationship channels, including the Ombudsman, whose report includes representative samples of the main suggestions and complaints received, always seeking to improve services and appraise their impact on the activities of priority stakeholders.

We partner with our customer throughout the process and stimulate discussion of corporate sustainability. BM&FBOVESPA is a global reference in exchange operations. Recognized worldwide for risk management, and for excellence in operational and technological infrastructure and service delivery, the Company reaffirms its vision of positioning the capital markets as one of the main alternatives for companies and investors in Brazil to raise and allocate funds, and of promoting the importance and presence of derivatives as hedging instruments. In accordance with this vision, constant dialogue with the Company’s different stakeholders and the development of innovative and efficient solutions are values intrinsic to BM&FBOVESPA’s activities. The core values that play a key role in the company’s business strategy and decision making processes, thanks to a corporate governance structure that stimulates discussion of sustainability internally and externally in various ways, as established by its Sustainability Policy. Among other initiatives that have a positive impact on society and businesses generally, include the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) – a reference in sustainable management practices in Brazil and the world – and the Socio-Environmental Investment Exchange (BVSA), a groundbreaking initiative adopted as a Case Study by the United Nations Global Compact and recommended for all exchanges worldwide. Thus BM&FBOVESPA believes its competitive differentiators derive largely from its innovative potential, which is strongly rooted in the professional capacity of its team, as well as investment in technologies and products that enable it to create and seize new opportunities, increase and diversify revenue, reaffirm its role as a self-regulatory organization and inducer of good practices, and implement positive changes for its stakeholders. The key drivers of the Company’s performance and development are detailed below. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 17 3.1 Technological and operational excellence Post-trading is acknowledged to be one of the strengths of BM&FBOVESPA’s business model. In 2016, the company redoubled its efforts to bring to fruition the unification of its clearinghouses, a major technology infrastructure project that will consolidate all of its key infrastructures and processes while extending to the equity market the benefits of CORE (Closeout Risk Evaluation), its highly efficient risk management system, already available in the financial and commodity derivatives market. Implementation of the BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse has been under way since 2012. The project entails the staggered transfer of the operations performed by four clearinghouses (derivatives, equities and corporate bonds, foreign exchange, and government bonds) to a new unified structure. The Derivatives Clearinghouse was the first to migrate, in 2014. The rest remained in their original structures. Completion of the second phase, which will integrate the Equities & Corporate Bonds Clearinghouse, is scheduled to take place in 2017, depending on the results of tests and on regulatory approvals. The Company’s two largest market segments will have a new state-of-the-art platform with sufficient processing capacity to support future market growth. BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse: for the market, more security With the conclusion of this strategic project BM&FBOVESPA will reach a new level of operational excellence and will be strongly and efficiency; for the world, an positioned to continue meeting the needs of customers and innovative project. participants. Cost savings Increased Optimization daily liquidity Integrated Clearinghouse of margin requirement calculations Faster response to market needs Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 18 The BM&FBOVESPA PUMA Trading System, an electronic platform implemented in 2011, has steadily set new records in volume terms with no delays or downtime even during high volatility episodes. The Company’s investment in this platform puts it in a privileged position to satisfy market growth expectations. Strategically located in Santana do Parnaíba, São Paulo State, near São Paulo City but far from its traffic congestion and similar urban problems, the BM&FBOVESPA Data Center is equipped with cutting-edge technology including advanced generators and next-generation uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs), as well as a substantial supply of telecommunications resources. The facility features a restricted, controlled environment with 72 hours operational autonomy without resupply, and a monitoring and image recording system. The building is also certified to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), the US Green Building Council’s sustainable building standard, and has sustainable equipment such as very high energy efficiency generators and chillers. Façade of the BM&FBOVESPA Data Center building It is also part of the Company’s strategy to seek new technologies and analyze how they can enhance its business model. The IT Committee added by the Board of Directors to its advisory bodies in 2016 assesses new technologies, supports the analysis of their feasibility, and tracks indicators that measure customers’ perceptions of BM&FBOVESPA’s IT services. In pursuing innovations from the standpoint of business and IT infrastructure, the Company joined the consortium established by R3 to develop solutions based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), a platform inspired by the blockchain concept of tamper-proof databases and applicable to global financial markets. BM&FBOVESPA Operations Center Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 19 3.2 Risk management, self-regulation and market supervision The Company continuously seeks excellence in risk management and collateral management, given its role as a central counterparty (CCP) whereby to guarantee the settlement of transactions performed in its exchange environment it intermediates between the parties, acting as buyer to all sellers and seller to all buyers. To manage the risks inherent in this function, the CCP focuses on calculating, controlling and mitigating the credit risk posed by participants and customers. Pre-trade risk monitoring is performed using a tool called LiNe (short for Limite de Negociação, “trading limit”). BM&FBOVESPA has also developed its own integrated risk calculation system called CORE (Closeout Risk Evaluation), which performs billions of calculations to determine the amount of collateral that must be posted according to each investor’s open position and risk parameters entered into the system. In the event of default, the CCP’s safeguard structure, which includes specific settlement funds and part of the Company’s own equity as well as the collateral posted by customers and participants, can be used to cover losses relating to settlement failure. CORE numbers 10,000 4 billion 45,000 risk prices portfolios have risk calculated scenarios simulated every five minutes Management of corporate and operational risks – The Company’s routine practices also include constant analysis of the risks to which it is exposed or that may affect its business activities. Management of these risks is based on the Corporate Risk and Operational Risk Management Policies, which establish principles, guidelines and responsibilities for the process. Compliance with these policies is assured by a corporate risk management methodology that aligns the Company’s strategic objectives (“tone at the top”) with its risk appetite and tolerance. This methodology calls for a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches to the identification, evaluation, treatment, monitoring and communication of strategic, operational, financial and regulatory risks. Top-down Bottom-up The top-down approach identifies the main risks affecting The bottom-up approach creates a risk profile based on the company by means of historical events, interviews with the analysis of processes, as a tool for the identification board members and executives, and references from other of operational risks and classification metrics, which can exchanges and financial market infrastructures. Once identithen be responded to and continuously monitored using fied, the risks are evaluated against the risk appetite criteria indicators. approved by the Board of Directors. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 20 The results of this monitoring and the evolution of the risks concerned are documented in monthly and semiannual reports for the Board of Directors and its Audit and Financial & Risk Committees, as well as the Corporate Risk Committee that advises the CEO. The latter committee, which comprises more than half the Company’s executives, preventively monitors the operational, strategic, financial and regulatory risks that make up BM&FBOVESPA’s corporate risk profile. In 2016 it held 12 regular meetings and was convened once on an extraordinary basis. G4-14 / G4-45 / G4-46 / G4-47 Another aspect of BM&FBOVESPA’s corporate and operational risk management is that the Company is unremittingly concerned to guarantee information security both internally and externally, ensuring that everyone with authorized access to the company’s information, systems and/or technological environments protects, preserves and assures data confidentiality, availability and integrity, and that potential vulnerabilities and threats are identified, assessed, treated, monitored and disclosed. In addition to these controls, in the social and environmental agenda, since 2009 the company has answered the annual questionnaire of the Climate Change Program run by CDP (Driving Sustainable Economies). It keeps a close watch on domestic and international laws and agreements linked to mandatory carbon emission reduction targets and product offerings relating to climate change. The main agricultural commodities traded on the Exchange are susceptible to physical events, but regulatory risk and the risks relating to climate uncertainties are considered indirect and hard to quantify. G4-14 / G4-EC2 Self-regulation and market supervision – The Company’s total commitment to risk control is also evidenced by its constant investment in self-regulation and supervision. BM&FBOVESPA Market Supervision (BSM), an independent organization that acts as an ancillary arm of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), enforces compliance with the applicable laws and regulatory requirements by everyone authorized to trade in the company’s markets, reports any instances of non-compliance, and verifies the measures taken to remedy them. In 2016, BSM undertook several initiatives to strengthen and enhance the instruments of securities market regulation and self-regulation, including publication of a new version of its Procedural Rulebook. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 21 3.3 Governance practices BM&FBOVESPA’s corporate governance model is deeply committed to best practice in order to maintain the integrity of its business and assure professionalism in all of its activities. To guarantee continuous improvement, this structure is a permanent item on its agenda for strategic discussions. The main features of BM&FBOVESPA’s corporate governance structure are as follows:  An active Board of Directors with broad knowledge of the Company’s business and the markets in which it operates; and advisory committees with clearly defined roles, especially the Corporate Governance & Nomination, Audit and Financial & Risk Committees.  Advisory committees to the CEO to ensure that matters of material importance to the company are treated in depth and in compliance with specific rules and regulations; and sectoral committees providing an important channel for communication with investors, market participants and other companies.  An organizational structure with a Department of Internal Controls, Compliance & Corporate Risk and a Department of Internal Auditing that report not just to the CEO but also to the Board’s advisory committees.  Corporate bylaws, codes, policies and rules forming its governance framework.

Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 22 The company does not tolerate any practices designed to conceal or dissimulate the origin, location or movement of assets, rights and other property. Any suspicious transaction in this respect is reported to the Anti Money Laundering & Concealment of Property Committee, one of the advisory committees to the CEO. G4-58 BM&FBOVESPA also offers channels for reporting unethical behavior or conduct incompatible with the law for use by its professionals, business partners and other stakeholders. The confidentiality of all personal information furnished is guaranteed, whatever the mechanism used. In 2016, most of the complaints made via the available channels (Direct Line, Code of Conduct Channel and Audit Committee Channel) involved possible moral harassment, discriminatory practices, suspected fraud, and the soliciting or securing of undue advantages. All messages were analyzed and responded. G4-57 / G4-58 Code of Conduct – In addition to stating the company’s values, principles and standards, the Code of Conduct offers guidance on personal and professional conduct, and on relationships with suppliers and partners, among other items, to ensure the adoption of best practices and avoid the occurrence of unlawful actions. G4-56 Among the channels available for communication with stakeholders, the Company offers the email address codigodeconduta@bvmf.com.br. Internal Controls, Compliance & Corporate Risk monitors emails daily and takes the appropriate steps to forward any complaints to the Code of Conduct Committee. This committee is responsible for analyzing queries and complaints, and for taking action on proven infringements. G4-57 / G4-58 In 2016, the Code of Conduct channel received 217 messages, many of which asked questions about the rules on insider trading, acceptance of gifts and participation in events sponsored by other companies. G4-57 / G4-58 The Code of Conduct applies to BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries, and is available with other policies on the IR website, in Corporate Governance Bylaws, Codes and Policies. G4-56 Ombudsman – The Ombudsman is BM&FBOVESPA’s channel for permanent communication with external stakeholders: investors, market participants, listed companies, public and private institutions, regulators, suppliers and the media. G4-26 / G4-57 / G4-58 The Ombudsman is responsible for analyzing and formally treating all the suggestions and complaints it receives by phone or contact form via BM&FBOVESPA’s website, for responding conclusively, and for proposing corrective measures or improvements to procedures and routines. This channel is the next instance up from the general helpline (SAP) on +55 11 3272 7373. In 2016 the Ombudsman received 600 complaints, 80% of which were against market participants (brokerage houses), 7% against BM&FBOVESPA, 12% against banks, and 1% against issuers. It analyzed and responded to every single complaint. A breakdown by subject-matter shows that most complaints referred to problems with the execution of investor orders to brokerage houses (25% of the total), difficulties in transferring custody (22%), and problems with the “home broker” online trading platform (11%). G4-57 / G4-58 3.4 Development of markets, products and services Increasing the liquidity of existing products and expanding the instrument portfolio to attract new customers are among BM&FBOVESPA’s strategic commitments. Some of the most noteworthy activities carried out in 2016 are described below. Market makers – The Company continued expanding its market maker programs in accordance with the conviction that market makers significantly foster liquidity, assure better conditions for price formation, and reduce volatility in the equity market. It launched 18 new programs in 2016, taking the total from 27 to 55. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 23 In November 2016, BM&FBOVESPA began accepting exclusive investment funds (Fundos Exclusivos) as market makers, increasing the number of participants that can perform this activity. Products – Shares in the exchange-trade fund It Now Ibovespa Fundo de Índice (BOVV11) were admitted for trading in 2016, taking the total number of ETFs available to 15. The Company also invested in developing the DI x IPCA Spread Futures Contract (ticker symbol DAP), which was relaunched in 2016. Market makers for this contract began operating in May and several changes were made to the settlement price calculation methodology in response to demand from market agents. Also in 2016, several improvements were made to the Treasury Direct platform with the aim of refining the process of communication with investors, introducing new trading procedures, and automating the process for the use of government bonds purchased via Treasury Direct as collateral for trades on BM&FBOVESPA. Special listing segments – To continue assuring the constant evolution of corporate governance standards in Brazil, in 2016 BM&FBOVESPA began discussions with regulators, listed companies, investors, market participants and other stakeholders with the aim of improving the rules for its special listing segments. The program was divided into three stages: a public consultation, a public hearing and a closed hearing for the Novo Mercado and Level 2 segments. The final draft of the rules will be submitted to a closed hearing in first-half 2017 for approval by the companies listed on these segments. Inducing good practices – To intensify relationships with its various stakeholders, BM&FBOVESPA encourages good practices in transparency and management through projects and programs that contribute to advances in the socio-environmental agenda. These include the Report or Explain for Sustainability or Integrated Reporting initiative (launched in 2012), recommending that listed companies voluntarily state in the Reference Form whether they disclose environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, and if so where. Companies that do not report ESG information to investors are urged to explain why not. In 2016, CVM revised the Reference Form and, in addition to the already-established sustainability practices, made item 7.8 exclusively about this subject. Companies are now required to state whether they publish ESG information and explain the methodology used. They must also say whether the information is audited or assured by an independent body, and where the information can be found. Thanks to this decision, companies are now accountable to the regulator in this regard. Incentivizing technical knowledge and financial education – As the only exchange in operation in Brazil, BM&FBOVESPA acknowledges its role in training the professionals who work in its markets and promoting projects that extend knowledge of its activities and help expand its investor base, as well as initiatives to engage, sensitize and inform stakeholders. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 24 The Company incentivizes a range of financial education programs and projects through its Education Institute, such as participation in the National Financial Education Strategy BM&FBOVESPA works hard to (ENEF) and the BM&FBOVESPA Challenge, a contest for high school students from public and private schools in São Paulo develop not just the market but State that teaches them in practical terms how the stock society, through investment in market works. financial education, culture, social inclusion and sports. Students of Colégio Prisma, champion of the Challenge BM&FBOVESPA 2016 Other highlights include the MBA in Economic and Financial Information and Capital Markets for Journalists; Resenha da Bolsa, a publication that diffuses technical knowledge about securities markets and best practice in risk management and trading; and New Value – Corporate Sustainability, a guide with pointers on including sustainability in company’s dayto-day activities. In 2016 a newly-edited version was published that included socio-environmental KPIs and a version for private companies. To drive technical knowledge and market development, the Company also promotes or participates in many events and discussion forums. The highlights in 2016 were organization of the 15th Agribusiness Outlook Seminar and support for a seminar on 40 years of Brazil’s corporation law (Lei das S.As., Law 6404/1976). 15th Agribusiness Outlook Seminar Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 25 3.5 Financial solidity In 2016, BM&FBOVESPA continued to focus on the pursuit of efficiency. As a result, the growth of adjusted expenditure was kept in line with average inflation in the Brazilian economy. Adjusted expenditure totaled R$653.1 million, rising 6.3% year over year. In accordance with its commitment to continue enhancing its technology infrastructure and operating efficacy while also optimizing its risk management system, BM&FBOVESPA invested R$223.7 million in 2016. The Company also maintained its commitment to returning capital to shareholders by a combination of dividend distribution and repurchasing of shares without jeopardizing the robustness of its balance sheet, which is vital to the Company’s role as central counterparty. In 2016 it distributed R$900 million to shareholders in interest on equity (JCP), which corresponded to 62.2% of recurring net income for the year. In preparation for the business combination between BM&FBOVESPA and Cetip, in December 2016 the company raised funds to discharge financial obligations deriving from this transaction, including a three-year debenture issue worth R$3 billion and a one-year loan of US$125 million, increasing its indebtedness. Gross debt amounted to R$5.463 billion at end-2016, with long-term maturities accounting for 91.8% and short-term debt for 8.2%. The debt consists of senior unsecured notes issued abroad in July 2010, debentures, and a foreign-currency loan. The total includes principal and accrued interest. Financial leverage will be reduced over the next three years by repayment of the debentures and loan. Management is confident, based on the strong cash generation assured by its business model, that the Company will be able to continue distributing results to shareholders at attractive levels while at the same time reducing its indebtedness. 3.6 People management People are considered a valuable asset by BM&FBOVESPA, which sees the development of its professionals as fundamental to a strong performance by the organization. Through training programs, and by stimulating education, assessing performance and providing feedback, it encourages everyone to be aligned with the company’s organizational culture and hence to give of their best. The assessment process, in which 100% of its employees participate (395 women and 943 men), considers planning and targets (what), and behaviors and competencies for each level and function (how). Two structured formal conversations between employee and manager take place during the year. G4-LA11 Measurement starts with self-assessment by each employee and continues with the manager’s assessment, followed by alignment at meetings of the leaders in each department. The employee then receives feedback and begins drafting an individual development plan. To align interests and retain key personnel, the Company also provides longand short-term variable remuneration, embodied respectively in a profit-sharing program (PLR) and a stock grant program. As part of its structured pursuit of professional development for employees, the Company also offers ample support for them to explore their potential and in exchange encourages their engagement to benefit the organization, improve their performance and gain recognition. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 26 An important part of this process is the Leaders Day program, comprising structured training activities and optional individual development activities. The program is for executive officers, managing directors, associate directors and managers. Activities held in 2016 to develop competencies, disseminate internal knowledge and strengthen the Company’s leadership profile included motivational lectures and workshops. During the year, 200 managers took part in Leaders Days. Estagiários da BM&FBOVESPA Speakers for the Leaders Day program: maestro João Carlos Martins; José Roberto Guimarães – coach of the Brazilian Women’s Volleyball Team; and Mario Sergio Cortella – philosopher, writer and educator. Other initiatives included a program of case studies involving an exchange of experiences between different functional areas, with practice in collective decision making; and a mentoring program in which executive officers and managing directors train to mentor a group of associate directors as they develop the competencies considered fundamental to the Company. To accelerate the development of competencies for future leadership, managers take an online program delivered by Harvard Business School, focusing on behavioral training. Retaining and attracting qualified professionals is also one of the company’s priorities. In 2016 BM&FBOVESPA invested in activities for young talents, including a vacation internship proBM&FBOVESPA strives to gram and a program for Brazilian undergraduates abroad. maintain a climate of respect for In 2016 the Company also delivered several modalities of corpeople grounded in fundamental porate training (in-house, online and external), which totaled values and objectives in human 24,882.5 person-hours.

The entire workforce was located in the Southeast Region. All except for interns were employed full-time and had indefinite duration employment contracts. G4-11 The lowest salary paid in 2016 corresponded to 200% of the federal minimum wage for male employees and 254% for female employees. It is important to stress that no employee or intern was paid the state minimum wage.

Quality of Life Program The program has three pillars, comprising interlocking activities in work-life balance (Mais Equilíbrio), wellness (Mais Saúde), and leisure and culture (Mais Lazer e Cultura). The 2016 highlights are summarized below:  Mais Você, a free personal counseling and support service from a multidisciplinary team available 24x7 by phone and email – 19,130 cases processed.  Social center and walk-in clinic with medical care, cardiology, dermatology, acupuncture, nutri¬tional and psychological counseling, physical therapy, and massage – 8,195 cases processed, of which 8,056 were walk-ins.  Flu vaccine campaign for employees, interns and on-site suppliers – 1,812 beneficiaries.  Fitness centers (discount agreement) for employees and interns – 365 people enrolled.  Annual checkups for managing directors, associate directors and senior specialists – 36 participants.  Facilities Exchange (Bolsa de Facilidades), providing access to goods and services that contribute to employee wellbeing through partnerships in sports, culture, recreation and leisure. Diversity & Voluntary Service Week in 2016 involved activities organized by BM&FBOVESPA Institute and HR, including a lecture by athlete Ana Moser, presenting her social volleyball project, an Exchange Panel on Women in Leadership, and a stand-up comedy session on Empowering Women, with 137 people participating. Talk by the athlete Ana Moser Pink October and Blue November Campaigns at BM&FBOVESPA Health plan G4-LA7 The Company’s workplace and operations present a low level of risk to health and safety. All employees have access to a corporate health and dental care plan, which also covers spouses and children up to the age of 21, or 24 for university students. In cases of serious illness requiring care not covered by the plan, benefits may be granted on the basis of an individual analysis. Employees can also use two outpatient clinics located on Company premises at Praça Antonio Prado and Rua XV de Novembro, and staffed by physicians and nursing technicians every day of the week. Pension plan G4-EC3 BM&FBOVESPA offers a defined-contribution pension plan for voluntary participation by all employees. The number of participants totals 1,015. Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 32 The plan for employees enables participants and sponsor to invest more – employees contribute 1%-7% of their monthly salary, with a matching contribution from the Company equivalent to 100%. Employees who leave before the specified retirement date can keep their plans according to the rules stipulated by the bylaws or cancel. In this case they can opt to transfer 100% of the accumulated employee contributions and, based on length of service, up to 90% of the accumulated sponsor contributions, or withdraw 100% of the accumulated employee contributions and up to 50% of the accumulated sponsor contributions based on length of service. Health and safety G4-LA5 / G4-LA8 Pursuant to agreements with the union, the workforce at BM&FBOVESPA is represented on formal health and safety committees comprising employees from different hierarchical levels who help monitor and oversee occupational health and safety programs.  Accident Prevention Committee – To discuss matters relating to accident and occupational disease prevention, BM&FBOVESPA has an occupational safety technician and an Internal Workplace Accident Prevention Committee (CIPA) with 18 members (1.4% of the workforce). In the 2016-17 CIPA election, 931 votes were cast (70% of the workforce). Five members and four alternates were elected.  Internal Workplace Accident Prevention Week (SIPAT) – The seventh edition presented health and accident prevention-related activities designed to encourage more conscious and positive behavior, including workshops on healthy living and eating, happiness, and disease prevention, as well as an eye examination and measurement of waist circumference, cholesterol and blood sugar. Employees also benefited from ergonomics blitzes including workstation interventions with guidance on posture and relaxation massages. The number of participations during the five-day SIPAT in 2016 totaled 2,675. Human rights and labor practices BM&FBOVESPA’s employees, interns and service providers have formal contracts and the Company assures respect for human rights in the workplace. Registered cases of discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin, color, gender, religion, ideology, nationality or social status are dealt with in confidence by the Code of Conduct Committee and are therefore confidential information. G4-HR3 In 2016, 35 labor claims were filed against the Company and 49 were settled; of these, 46 had been filed the previous year. G4-LA16 The Company does not perform any activities that are hazardous to health or the environment. It requires responsible practices in selecting and contracting with suppliers, such as appropriate management of environmental impact, ethical conduct, compliance with health and safety legislation, and non-involvement in proven cases of corruption, bribery or forced and child labor, on pain of unilateral contract termination. BM&FBOVESPA maintains its commitment to select and certify suppliers in accordance with its Policy for Acquisition of Goods and Services to mitigate risks relating to image, labor relations, child labor and forced labor. The standard service agreement contains specific human rights clauses. G4-12 To guarantee compliance with some of these aspects, moreover, the Company requires prospective suppliers to complete a socio-environmental questionnaire and analyzes their sustainability practices, including policies, procedures, social information and other initiatives. G4-12 The supplier selection and certification process also entails a detailed analysis of credit and tax clearance, including the regularity of social security contributions, a financial assessment, and verification of socio-environmental practices. G4-12 Back 3 Strategy and Analysis 33 At end-2016 the Company had 498 contractors, of which 113 were new, and 100% complied with the requisite standards regarding human rights and labor practices. There were no complaints or reports of actual or potential material negative impacts on human rights in the supply chain. G4-12 / G4-LA14 / G4-LA15 / G4-HR10 / G4-HR12 / G4-SO9 / G4-SO10 It is important to note that owing to the complexity of BM&FBOVESPA’s technological infrastructure and its importance to the Company’s development, the main suppliers are technology companies and providers of hardware and software solutions, such as servers, network equipment, mainframes, equipment maintenance, technical support, and skilled personnel for specific projects. G4-12 Anti-corruption practices In accordance with the guidelines established by Law 12,846/2013 (the Anticorruption Law), BM&FBOVESPA has an Integrity Program to detect and remedy misappropriation, fraud, wrongful practices and similar crimes against government entities, whether domestic or foreign. In 2016, the Internal Control, Compliance & Corporate Risk Department evaluated the internal control environment with regard to the impact of fraud and corruption, analyzing 25 processes to detect possible fraud scenarios and mitigate the respective risks prioritized by the Executive Board for risk monitoring purposes. G4-SO3 The Company also periodically trains employees, interns and service providers to identify and report suspected cases of corruption and money laundering. In 2016 all members of governance bodies, employees, interns and service providers working on the Company’s premises were told about its anti-corruption policies and procedures including the new Code of Conduct. G4-SO4 An Anti-Corruption Primer was issued to ensure that all employees, interns and service providers physically allocated to the Company’s premises were aligned with best practice in combating corruption. During the year, 1,517 people (100% of the workforce) including executive officers completed anti-corruption training.

Social Investment and Environmental Management back to summary We are well aware of our responsibility as inducers of sustainability. We are proud of the recognition received for leading this agenda and of the distinctive position we occupy among the world’s exchanges as a member, affiliate and/or signatory of economic, environmental and social institutions. A strong financial performance is no longer the only criterion by which a company is considered valuable and a good investment. Investors and analysts increasingly pay attention to the way companies deal with environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. ESG-related criteria are now widely used in investment analysis, portfolio management and decision making. This is the principle underlying responsible investment, which gained enhanced visibility in 2006 with the creation of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a partnership between the United Nations and private institutional investors – to which BM&FBOVESPA is a signatory in the “service provider” category – to mainstream sustainability principles in business and investment activities around the world. Learn about BM&FBOVESPA’s other commitments and institutional representations in leading this agenda. 4.1 Private social investment G4-EC8 / G4-SO1 BM&FBOVESPA Institute is a public-interest civil society organization (OSCIP) whose remit is to integrate and coordinate the Company’s social investment projects relating to education, culture, sports and voluntary service with the overarching goal of building bridges that permit the development of Brazilian society as a whole. Its main projects are the Socio-Environmental Investment Exchange (BVSA); the Job Training Association; the Athletics Club; and the “In Action” (Em Ação) voluntary service program. These initiatives focus on engagement with the poor and have an indirect impact by enabling participants in the programs concerned to improve their socioeconomic conditions. For example, young people who receive job training and develop the core competencies required to enter and remain in the labor market have the wherewithal to change their reality. It is important to note that 80% of the Company’s engagement and local community development programs take place in the city in which BM&FBOVESPA’s head offices and all of its operations are located. BM&FBOVESPA Institute’s strategic objectives • To bring donators and nonprofit organizations together in a safe and transparent virtual fundraising platform. • To promote social and economic inclusion through vocational training and sports. • To support high-performing athletes and youth teams, seeking Brazil’s development through sports. Socio-Environmental Investment Exchange (BVSA) – A pioneering initiative in the world, BVSA is the bridge that links social investors with Brazilian organizations in need of financial support. It is a virtual environment with a format similar to an exchange, featuring projects aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It has a partnership with BrazilFoundation to identify, select and qualify organizations. BVSA is recognized by UNESCO and backed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The UN Global Compact has spotlighted the initiative as a model to be followed by other exchanges around the world. Back 4 Social Investment and Environmental Management 36 BVSA was chosen to partner with Bloomberg Tradebook for Charity Day Brazil 2016, part of a worldwide fundraising campaign to support those in need by donating trading commissions to a variety of Bloomberg-supported charities. Since its creation, BVSA has raised more than R$17.2 million for 158 projects throughout Brazil with proven results that help build a fairer, more equal society. In 2016 the total amount raised was R$ 1.5 million for 31 projects. Twenty of them reached the funding target. For more information, visit bvsa.org.br. Charity Day Brazil Job Training Association (AP) – Social inclusion program for low-income youth in metropolitan São Paulo. In 2016 AP commemorated 20 years of activity to promote the social and economic inclusion of young people in situations of social vulnerability by helping them enter the labor market. Through its three courses – Training for Employability, focusing on clerical and administrative jobs; Handyman, on construction and building maintenance; and Beauty Space, which turns out freelance and salaried beauticians – some 3,500 youngsters have graduated from AP, contributing to the development of society and consequently of the labor market. BM&FBOVESPA Athletics Club – The main aim of this program is to foster social inclusion and Brazilian development through sports. In 2016, 20 of the Club’s athletes took part in the Brazilian Olympic delegation and two set personal records – Luiz Alberto de Araújo in the decathlon, and Darlan Romani in the shot put. Sports & Cultural Center – Located in São Paulo City’s Paraisópolis community, the program promotes sports, culture and education activities attending, on average, 300 youngsters aged 6-15 per year. In Action – Program to promote and support engagement by employees, interns and service providers and their families as volunteers in social actions in the community. It developed 18 voluntary activities in 2016. More information on these projects and their impact is available at institutobmfbovespa.org.br BM&FBOVESPA also supports initiatives and institutions that contribute to the development of education and culture. In 2016 it entered into partnerships with cultural entities: the São Paulo Symphony Orchestra (OSESP) and Pinacoteca.

Scope 1 emissions rose 4.68% compared with 2014 (57.76 tCO2e) because of fixed-source emissions relating to the use of generators. Scope 2 emissions remained practically unchanged, rising less than 1% year over year (3,280.82 tCO2e), owing to an increase in electricity consumption in 2015 following startup of the Data Center. Scope 3 indirect emissions varied significantly, rising 33% year over year (1,399.49 tCO2e), owing mainly to quantification of employee commuting, which was extended to include emissions by train and subway transportation.

Operational and Financial Performance back to summary We are committed to seeking new opportunities to grow and strengthen our relationships with customers, regulators and market participants, with the aim of creating ever more value for our shareholders in the long term. The year 2016 was marked significant changes in the political scenario and economic expectations, both abroad and in Brazil. Events such as the popular vote in favor of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, the recovery in prices for some commodities and, lastly, the elections in the United States of America prompted great volatility and increased uncertainty in global markets. In Brazil, the year began with very negative expectations regarding the country’s level of economic activity and its fiscal imbalance. Some of these negative expectations were confirmed and the economy has now its third year of recession. However, with the political transition and a new direction in the management of the economy, there was an improvement in the medium and long-term scenario. These improved expectations, despite the recession, directly impacted the performance of the equities market in the Bovespa segment, which presented higher turnover velocity and market capitalization. In the case of the derivatives market in the BM&F segment, higher volumes were neutralized by lower average prices charged by the Company, mainly due to a significant change in the mix of contracts traded, with a higher share of mini contracts, which prices are below the average. In addition, the Company continued investing to enhance its products and markets, in particular by developing inflation-indexed derivatives. 5.1 Operational performance Financial and commodities derivatives (BM&F Segment) The average daily volume (ADV) on the financial and commodity derivatives market reached 3.2 million contracts in 2016, up by 12.4% over 2015, reflecting an 87.7% growth in the ADV for mini contracts. Mini contracts are composed substantially of mini contracts of Stock Index (62.0%) and FX rate contracts (37.9%), which posted a 66.2% and 138.0% growth, respectively, over the previous year, reflecting an increased activity in this type of contract by individual and non-resident investors, especially those characterized as high frequency traders.

Average Revenue per Contract (RPC) was down by 13.3% over 2015, mainly as a result of mini contracts’ higher share on the total ADV (from 18.3% in 2015 to 30.6% in 2016), since the average RPC of this contracts is substantially lower than the average of other contracts in the segment. In addition, there was an increase in the share of day trades and high frequency investors, for whom the prices charged are also lower, thus negatively impacting average RPC.

With regard to the participation of different groups of investors in the financial and commodity derivatives markets, ADV by individual investors was up by 88.2% and their share of total ADV rose from 7.7% in 2015 to 12.7% in 2016. Most of this growth is related to mini contracts, as mentioned above. Foreign and institutional investors, the most representative in this segment, increased the average volumes of contracts traded by 13.9% and 14.6%, respectively, in 2016, but their share of total volume traded remained practically unchanged in the period. On the other hand, the ADV of financial institutions fell by 9.8% and their share of the total was down from 21.7% to 17.1% in the period, reflecting the process of reducing risk exposure shown by some of these institutions over the last few years.

This increase is a result of the 8.6% adjustment under the annual collective bargaining agreements of Aug’16, and higher stock grants expenses. Excluding the impact related to stock grant expenses, personnel and payroll-related charges would have totaled R$359.9 million, which would represent a rise of 4.6%. Expenses related to the stock grant plan reached R$145.2 million in 2016, 46.7% higher over the previous year. Of this total, recurring expenses amounted R$93.7 million and include R$48.9 million in principal and R$43.0 million in provisions for payroll charges to be paid upon the delivery of the shares to the beneficiaries, which was impacted by a higher price of the BM&FBOVESPA shares. Extraordinary expenses – principal and charges – totaled R$51.5 million and consisted of: (i) R$25.0 million related to severance expenses; and (ii) provision of R$26.5 million due to the adequacy of the accrual methodology applied to expenses related to stock grant programs, which were granted but not transferred yet, in accordance with Company’s stock grant plan.  Data processing: totaled R$144.6 million, an increase of 18.5% over the previous year, mainly due to: (i) IT maintenance contracts adjustments; and (ii) the impact of the appreciation of the US Dollar against the Brazilian Real between Jan’15 and Dec’15, given that a cash flow hedge was set up for a portion of the contracts denominated in foreign currency with competence in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Depreciation and amortization: totaled R$98.3 million in 2016, down by 11.3% over 2015 due to (i) conclusion of depreciation and amortization for equipment and systems; and (ii) longer useful life periods used when calculating depreciation and amortization for certain equipment items and systems.  Transaction with Cetip: totaled R$65.6 million in 2016 composed by extraordinary expenses connected to the proposed business combination with Cetip, R$50.3 million in transaction costs and R$15.3 million in expenses related to planning of the business integration that will take place after regulatory analysis.  Other: totaled R$316.5 million, a 274.8% increase over the previous year, including: (i) an extraordinary provision in the amount of R$183.9 million related to a lawsuit for which the chances of loss were changed from possible to probable; (ii) R$47.4 million in provisions for success fees to legal advisors, that, as from 3Q16, was made for cases in which the chances of loss are rated possible or remote, as from 3Q16, was made for legal proceedings classified as possible or remote loss chances, since in the case of success of these cases the Company must pay the success fee contracted; and (iii) R$18.0 million to transferred to our self-regulatory entity in 4Q16, with the purpose of financing the activities of this institution. Indebtedness The Company’s gross debt at the end of 2016 was R$5,463.6 million (including principal and accrued interest), of which 91.8% was long-term and 8.2% short-term. In Dec’16, BM&FBOVESPA increased its level of indebtedness by issuing debentures and obtaining a foreign currency loan to meet the financial obligations arising from the business combination with Cetip. Details of the Company’s indebtedness are shown below. Debenture issue – First issue of simple, non-convertible debentures in the amount of R$3.0 billion settled on December 15, 2016. This issue is for a term of three years with payment of 50% at the end of year 2 and 50% at the end of year 3 at an interest rate corresponding to 104.25% of the DI rate. Interest will be paid on semi-annually basis, on June 1 and December 1 each year. Loan – A loan in the amount of US$125.0 million was agreed on December 15, 2016 at an interest rate of 2.57% p.a. to be paid on a monthly basis due on January 2, 2018. A cash flow hedge was set up between the loan and revenues denominated in US Dollar, while tying monthly amortizations with most of the receivables linked to derivatives contracts denominated in US Dollar (FX rates and Interest rates in USD contracts). Thus, for the dollar amount protected by the hedge instrument, any gains or losses related to exchange rate variations will be recognized in shareholders’ equity, and therefore no longer have a direct impact on the Company’s quarterly results in both operating income and financial Back 5 Operational and Financial Performance 49 expenses. The impact will affect the income statements only when the loan matures. This hedge is expected to reduce change in revenues from derivatives reported as a result of exchange rate variations. 2020 Notes – Senior Unsecured Notes issued abroad in Jul’10 for the amount of US$612.0 million, maturing in Jul’20 with semi-annually 5.5% coupons in July and January each year. In Mar’16, the Company entered into swap transactions for the principal amount of the 2020 Notes and has since then held a short position at the local interest rate, at an effective cost of 79.1% of the CDI rate applied to the balance in Brazilian Real on the hedge date (R$2,210 million). Additionally, in Sep’16, the Company entered into non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) to hedge certain coupons from FX variations. Financial result Financial result totaled R$152.0 million in 2016 and was mainly impacted by the recognition of the divestment in CME Group shares, its debenture issued and the loan, as shown below. Financial income: totaled R$1,167.3 million in the year, an increase of 56.5% over 2015, mainly due to high average cash in the period, which included: (i) R$5,487.7 million in proceeds from the sale of CME Group shares in Sep’15 and Apr’16; and (ii) the proceeds from its R$3.0 billion debenture issuance and US$125 million loan contracted in Dec’16. Financial expenses: totaled R$442.5 million in 2016, up by 86.8% over the previous year, mainly due to: (i) R$189.8 million related to the hedge against FX variation on the 2020 Notes; (ii) R$17.6 million connected to interest on the debentures issued in Dec’16; (iii) R$16.4 million related to IOF tax on repatriation of proceeds from the sale of CME Group shares; and (iv) R$20.6 million expenses regarding the stand-by facilities amounting to R$2.7 billion, which were not drawn, in connection with the transaction with Cetip. Divestment from CME Group shares: totaled a non-recurring loss of R$572.8 million in 2016, of which: i) R$460.5 million, with no cash impact, reflecting changes in the CME Group share price and the Brazilian Real vs US Dollar exchange rate from Sep’15 to the date of total divestment from CME Group shares; and (ii) R$112.3 million, with cash impact, related to PIS and COFINS levied on the capital gain generated on the sale of 4% of the CME Group shares. Income tax and social contribution Income tax and social contribution amounted to R$199.5 million (positive) and was mainly impacted by:  a reversal of the provision for taxes payable in the amount of R$477.0 million (positive), resulting from the adjustment in the acquisition cost for the calculation of taxable capital gain on the sale of CME Group shares, held in Sep’15 and Apr’16, which resulted in a reversal of part of the accrued provisions;  tax benefit amounting to R$306.0 million as result of the distribution of R$900.0 million in interest on capital in the year;  R$144.7 million reversal of tax assets related to accumulated taxes paid abroad, as a result of the sale of CME Group shares, since this tax asset can only be offset against gains obtained abroad. Cash taxes totaled R$21.5 million in 2016, of which R$7.3 million were taxes paid by BM&FBOVESPA Settlement Bank. The items that impacted the cash taxes were:  R$439.3 million on capital gains taxes on the sale of the CME Group shares, including the above mentioned calculation base adjustment;  change in the tax regime for exchange variations recognized in the Company’s balance sheet from cash to accrual basis, which reduced tax due by R$337.6 million;  tax benefit of R$541.2 million resulting from goodwill amortization. Back 5 Operational and Financial Performance 50 Net income Net income (attributable to shareholders) reached R$1,446.3 million, down by 34.3% over 2015. Excluding extraordinary items, notably the reversal of a provision for tax payable relating to the divestment on CME Group shares in 2016, net income would have been R$1,814.9 million, a 7.1% increase over the previous year. Net income for 2016 excludes extraordinary impacts related to the sale of shares in the CME Group (R$136.4 million, after tax), the transaction with Cetip (R$43.3 million after tax), extraordinary stock grant expenses (R$35.2 million after tax) and extraordinary expenses relating to provisions for contingencies and success fees (R$155.0 million after tax).

As mentioned above, in Dec’16, the Company raised funds to meet financial obligations arising from the business combination with Cetip through R$3.0 billion debenture issuance and a US$125.0 million loan, both of which impacted the balance sheet. The main changes in assets, in comparison with 2015, involved cash and cash equivalents and financial investments (current and non-current), which totaled R$14,847.6 million, an increase of 47.7% over 2015, due to the funding raised in Dec’16 and a higher retention of the Company’s cash generation to meet the financial obligations arising from the business combination with Cetip. Current liabilities totaled R$3,657.8 million, 74.4% higher over Dec’15, and accounted for 11.7% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity. The most significant changes are: (i) financial instruments used to hedge the principal of the 2020 Notes at the end of Mar’16, which totaled R$406.0 million (zero in Dec’15), which were affected by the appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar; (ii) loan totaling R$373.9 million (zero in Dec’15) consisting of a 1-year loan in US Dollar obtained in Dec’16; and (iv) dividends and interest on equity payable in the amount of R$318.8 million referring to interest on capital paid out on January 12, 2017.

Shareholders’ equity at the end of Dec’16 stood at R$19,076.4 million, which represented 61.2% of total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, and consisted mainly of R$14,327.5 million capital reserve and R$2,540.2 million share capital.

BM&FBOVESPA organizes, develops and provides for the operation of free and open securities markets, for spot and future settlement. Its activities are carried out through its trading systems and clearinghouses, and include transactions with securities, interbank foreign exchange and securities under custody in the Special System for Settlement and Custody (SELIC). BM&FBOVESPA develops technology solutions and maintains high performance systems, providing its customers with security, agility, innovation and cost effectiveness. The success of its activities depends on the ongoing improvement, enhancement and integration of its trading and settlement platforms and its ability to develop and license leading-edge technologies required for the good performance of its operations. With the objective of responding to the needs of customers and the specific requirements of the market, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Banco BM&FBOVESPA de Serviços de Liquidação e Custódia S.A. provides its members and its clearinghouses with a centralized custody service for the assets pledged as margin for transactions. Subsidiaries BM&FBOVESPA (UK) Ltd. located in London and BM&F (USA) Inc., located in the city of New York, USA, and a representative office in Shanghai, China, represent BM&FBOVESPA abroad through relationships with other exchanges and regulators, as well as assisting in the procurement of new clients for the market. As part of the strategic partnership between BM&FBOVESPA and CME Group, in the third quarter of 2015, BM&FBOVESPA organized the wholly-owned subsidiary BM&FBOVESPA BRV LLC registered in Delaware (USA), in order to ensure to the parties the full exercise of the rights contractually agreed upon. BM&FBOVESPA BRV LLC, jointly with BM&FBOVESPA, is co-owner of all intellectual property rights related to the stock module of PUMA Trading System platform and any other modules jointly developed by the parties, the ownership of which is assigned to BM&FBOVESPA.

Significant accounting practices a) Consolidation The following accounting practices are applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of BM&FBOVESPA and of its subsidiaries at December 31, 2016. BM&FBOVESPA holds control over the subsidiaries whenever it its exposed or is entitled to variable earnings based on its involvement with the investee and whenever it has the capacity of influencing these earnings through its power exercised. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to BM&FBOVESPA. Consolidation is discontinued from the date on which control ends. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between companies included in the consolidation are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred. The accounting practices of subsidiaries are altered where necessary to ensure consistency with the practices adopted by BM&FBOVESPA. Associates Investments in associates are recorded using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. BM&FBOVESPA’s investment in associates includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment. BM&FBOVESPA applies the equity method to assess investments in companies capable of causing a significant impact. BM&FBOVESPA’s judgment as regards the level of influence on investments takes into consideration key factors, such as ownership interest percentage, representation by the Board of Directors, participation in the definition of policies and businesses and material intercompany transactions. For investments in CME Group, the corresponding financial statements were originally prepared pursuant to the United States accounting standards (USGAAP), adjusted to the accounting standards effective in Brazil before calculation of the referred to equity pickup. In September 2015, BM&FBOVESPA disposed of part of its shares held in CME Group, which is therefore no longer considered an associate. 11 Notes to the Financial Statements Equity method discontinued When there is loss of significant influence over an associate, the equity method is discontinued and any remaining interest in the investee is remeasured at its fair value, and effects therefrom are recognized in P&L for the period. The amounts recognized in equity, under other comprehensive income, related to the investee are reclassified by BM&FBOVESPA from equity other comprehensive income to P&L for the period, according to the criteria defined in CPC 18 (R2)/IAS 28. b) Revenue recognition Revenues from the rendering of services and from trading and settlement systems are recognized upon the completion of the transactions, under the accrual method of accounting. The amounts received as annual fees, as in the cases of listing of securities and certain contracts for sale of market information, are recognized pro rata monthly in P&L over the contractual term. c) Financial instruments i) Classification and measurement BM&FBOVESPA initially classifies its financial assets and liabilities depending on their characteristic and purpose of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents The balances of cash and cash equivalents for cash flow statement purposes comprise cash and bank deposits. Receivables This category includes non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. The loans and receivables of BM&FBOVESPA mostly comprise customer receivables. Receivables are initially recorded at transaction cost and subsequently at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method less any impairment loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for active and frequent trading or assets designated by the entity on initial recognition. Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of financial instruments are recorded in the income statement under “Financial result” for the period in which they occur. Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives which are classified in this category or not classified in any other category. Available-for-sale financial assets are recorded at fair value. Interest on available-for-sale securities, calculated using the effective interest rate method, is recognized in the income statement as finance income. The amount relating to the changes in fair value is record in comprehensive income, net of taxes, and is transferred to the income statement when the asset is sold or becomes impaired. Loans and debentures Loans and debentures are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently stated at amortized cost. Any difference between the funds raised (net of transaction costs) and the amount repayable is recognized in the income statement over the period of the loans, using the effective interest rate method. Collaterals for transactions These comprises amounts received from market participants as collateral for default or insolvency. Amounts received in cash are recorded as liabilities and other collaterals are managed off-balance sheet. Both types of collateral received are not subject to interest or any other charges. ii) Derivative financial instruments BM&FBOVESPA uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its assets and liabilities against market risks, especially those related to foreign currencies. Derivative financial instruments designated in hedging transactions are initially recognized at fair value on the date in which the derivative agreement is entered into, being subsequently revaluated also at fair value. Derivatives are recorded as financial assets when the financial instrument fair value is positive, and as financial liabilities when fair value is negative. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of derivatives during the fiscal year are recorded directly in P&L, except for the effective portion of the cash flow hedge, which is recognized directly under equity in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to P&L when the hedge item affects P&L. iii) Hedge accounting Upon entering a hedging transaction, BM&FBOVESPA prepares formal documentation containing: (i) hedge objective; (ii) hedge type; (iii) nature of hedged risk; (iv) identification of hedged item; (v) identification of hedging instrument; (vi) assessment of the correlation between hedge and hedged item (retrospective effectiveness test); and (vii) prospective effectiveness assessment. Hedge accounting is applied in accordance with the criteria defined in CPC 38/IAS 39. Fair value hedge Any gain or loss from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments, as well as hedged assets or liabilities (hedged item) are recognized in Financial result. Cash flow hedge Any gain or loss in the hedging instrument related to the effective hedge portion is recognized under equity, in “Other comprehensive income”, net of tax effects. Consequently, the exchange rate variation in hedging instruments, previously recognized in financial result prior to its recognition as a hedging instrument, accumulates in equity and is transferred to P&L for the same period and the same account group under which the hedged transaction is recognized. When the hedged transaction implies recognition of a non-financial asset, gains and losses recognized in equity are transferred and included in the initial measurement of the asset cost. The non-effective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in the P&L. 12 Notes to the Financial Statements Hedge effectiveness analysis BM&FBOVESPA adopts the dollar offset method as the methodology for retrospective effectiveness test, which takes into consideration the ratio at fair value or present value of accumulated gains or losses in the hedging instrument with gains or losses on hedged item for hedged risk. The approaches used for analyses consist of the hypothetical derivative approach and benchmark rate approach for retrospective tests and sensitivity analysis approach for prospective tests. BM&FBOVESPA assesses whether the results from tests carried out are within the range from 80% to 125% of effectiveness. d) Noncurrent assets held for sale Noncurrent assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying value is recoverable, particularly in the case of a sale and when the completion of such sale is practically certain. These assets are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell. e) Intangible assets Goodwill The goodwill recorded in intangible assets arises from acquisitions conducted by BM&FBOVESPA and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Recognized impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed. Software and projects Software licenses acquired are capitalized based on incurred costs and amortized over their estimated useful life, at the rates mentioned in Note 9. Expenditures associated with the development or maintenance of software are recognized as expenses as incurred. Expenditures directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software, controlled by BM&FBOVESPA and which will probably generate economic benefits greater than the costs for more than one year, are recognized as intangible assets. Amortization expense is recognized in the income statement unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. In such cases, amortization of intangible assets used for development activities is included as part of the cost of another intangible asset. Expenditures for development of software recognized as assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the assets’ useful lives, at the rates described in Note 9. f) Property and equipment These are recorded at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated under the straight-line method and takes into consideration the estimated useful lives of the assets and their residual value. At the end of each year, the residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if necessary. Subsequent costs are included in the carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits will be obtained and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance costs are recorded in P&L, as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized in P&L unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset. Depreciation of property and equipment used for development activities is included as part of the cost of the related intangible asset. g) Contingent assets and liabilities, provisions for tax, civil and labor contingencies, and legal obligations The recognition, measurement, and disclosure of provisions for tax, civil and labor contingencies, contingent assets and liabilities and legal obligations comply with the criteria defined in CPC 25/IAS 37. h) Judicial deposits Judicial deposits are related to tax, civil and labor contingencies and are adjusted for inflation and presented in noncurrent assets. i) Other assets and liabilities These are stated at their known and realizable/settlement amounts plus, where applicable, related earnings and charges and monetary and/or exchange rate variations up to the balance sheet date. j) Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment, and in case of indications of possible impairment, they are reassessed in shorter periods. The assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized at the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For purposes of impairment test, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (CashGenerating Units (CGU)). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed subsequently for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. k) Employee benefits i) Pension obligations BM&FBOVESPA maintains a defined contribution retirement plan with voluntary participation open to all employees. The Company has no obligations to make additional payments as a sponsor. The regular contributions are included in personnel costs in the period they are due. 13 Notes to the Financial Statements ii) Share-based remuneration BM&FBOVESPA maintains a long-term remuneration plan. By 2014, BM&FBOVESPA had granted stock options under the “Stock Option Plan” and there is an inventory of outstanding shares not yet exercised therefrom. From 2015 onwards, BM&FBOVESPA started to grant shares under the “Stock Grant Plan”. The objective is to give the employees of BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries the opportunity to become shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA, obtaining a greater alignment between its interests and the shareholders’ interests as well as allow BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries to attract and retain their management and employees. The fair value of options and of options granted is recognized as an expense during the vesting period (the period during which the specific vesting conditions must be met). At the balance sheet date, BM&FBOVESPA reviews its estimates of the number of options and shares that will vest based on the established conditions. BM&FBOVESPA recognizes the impact of any changes to the original estimates, if any, in the income statement, against a capital reserve in equity. iii) Profit sharing BM&FBOVESPA has semi-annual variable remuneration, organized and paid in cash through the Profit Sharing Program. The program defines the potential multiple of monthly salary, based on individual performance indicators, which consider factors specific to each function (job level), and indicators of the overall performance of BM&FBOVESPA. The provision for such profit sharing program is recognized in P&L under the accrual method of accounting. iv) Other post-employment obligations BM&FBOVESPA offers post-retirement health care benefit to the employees who have acquired this right until May 2009. The right to this benefit is conditional on the employee remaining with the Company until the retirement age and completing a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accumulated over the period of employment or the period in which the benefit is expected to be earned, using the actuarial methodology which considers life expectancy of the group in question, increase in costs due to the age and medical inflation, inflation and discount rate. The contributions that participants make according to the specific rule of the Health Care Plan are deducted from these costs. The actuarial gains and losses on the health care plan for retirees are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the rules of IAS 19 and CPC 33 (R1) Employee Benefits, based on actuarial calculation prepared by an independent actuary, according to Note 18(d). l) Foreign currency translation The items included in the financial statements for each of the consolidated companies of BM&FBOVESPA are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“functional currency”). The financial statements are presented in Brazilian reais, which is the functional currency of BM&FBOVESPA. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Brazilian reais using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions or the date of evaluation when items are remeasured. The foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of these transactions and from the translation, at the exchange rates at the end of the year/period, of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, are recognized in the income statement, except when deferred in comprehensive income relating to hedging transactions of a foreign investment. Exchange rate variation of foreign investment, whose functional currency is different from that of BM&FBOVESPA, is recorded under “Equity adjustments” in comprehensive income, and are only taken to the P&L for the period when the investment is sold or written off. m) Taxes BM&FBOVESPA is a for-profit business corporation and accordingly its results are subject to certain taxes and contributions. i) Current and deferred income tax and social contribution Current and deferred income tax and social contribution for the year of BM&FBOVESPA and Banco BM&FBOVESPA are calculated at 15%, plus a 10% surtax on taxable profit exceeding R$240 for income tax, and 9% (20% for Banco BM&FBOVESPA) on taxable profit for social contribution tax on net profit, and take into account the offset of income tax and social contribution losses, if any, limited to 30% of taxable profit. Deferred income tax and social contribution are calculated on respective tax losses, and temporary differences between the tax base on assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts contained in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be future taxable profit available to offset temporary differences and/or tax losses. The Bolsa de Valores do Rio de Janeiro (BVRJ) is a not-for-profit entity and, therefore, exempt from income tax and social contribution. ii) Other taxes The other taxes charged over trading, clearing and settlement fees and other services were calculated at the rates of 1.65% for PIS and 7.60% for COFINS, and are recorded in P&L under “Revenues”. Banco BM&FBOVESPA calculates PIS and COFINS at the rates of 0.65% and 4%, respectively. Bolsa de Valores do Rio de Janeiro (BVRJ) pays PIS at the rate of 1% on payroll. BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries pay Service Tax (ISS) on the services rendered at rates ranging from 2% to 5% depending on the nature of the service. 14 Notes to the Financial Statements n) Earnings per share For purposes of disclosure of earnings per share, basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA by the average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated similarly, except that the quantity of outstanding shares is adjusted to reflect the additional shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive shares had been issued for granted stock options. o) Distribution of dividends and interest on equity The distribution of dividends and interest on equity to shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA is recognized as a liability in the financial statements at the end of the period, based on the BM&FBOVESPA’s Articles of Incorporation. Any amount above the mandatory minimum dividend is accrued only on the date it is approved by the shareholders at an Annual General Meeting. The tax benefit over the interest on equity is recorded in the income statement. p) Segment information Operating segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reports provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for making the main operational and strategic decisions of BM&FBOVESPA and for implementing the strategies defined by the Board of Directors. q) Significant accounting estimates and judgments Preparation of financial statements requires use of certain significant accounting estimates, as well as use of judgment by management in the process of applying the accounting policies of BM&FBOVESPA. Those more complex areas that require higher degree of judgment, as well as those where the assumptions and estimates are significant for the consolidated financial statements, are the following:  Equity pickup – Note 3(a)  Impairment of assets – Notes 3(j) and 9  Financial instrument fair value calculation and classification Note 3(c)  Share-based payment – Note 3(k)  Post-retirement health care plan – Note 18(c)  Provisions for tax, civil and labor contingencies, contingent assets and liabilities (Note 14)  Estimated useful lives of property and equipment and intangible assets r) Accounting pronouncements recently issued and applicable to future periods The pronouncements below have already been published by IASB and are mandatory for the subsequent fiscal years, without early adoption by BM&FBOVESPA. Such pronouncements will be adopted after a technical pronouncement is issued by the Brazilian Financial Accounting Standards Board (CPC), and after their approval by the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM).  IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Issued in May 2014, and effective on or after January 1, 2018. IFRS 15 replaces the current rules IAS 11 – Construction Contracts and IAS 18 – Revenue, and establishes the principles for measurement, recognition and disclosure of revenue.  IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments – The final version was issued in July 2014, and will be effective on and after January 1, 2018. It replaces IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and the previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 establishes new requirements for classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting of financial instruments.  IFRS 16 Leases – Issued in January 2016, effective as from January 2019, replaces IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 establishes principles for lessors and lessees to identify, recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. No significant impacts from these new standards were detected for BM&FBOVESPA financial statements. s) Current and noncurrent assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities are classified as current whenever their realization or settlement term is one year or less (or another term that follows the normal cycle of BM&FBOVESPA). They are otherwise stated as noncurrent. 4.

The consolidated balances of investment funds are presented according to the nature and maturity of the portfolio. The net assets of the main investment funds included in the consolidation process of the financial statements are: (i) Bradesco FI Renda Fixa Letters – R$4,580,778 (R$1,776,830 at December 31, 2015); (ii) BB Pau Brasil FI Renda Fixa R$2,307,655 (R$502,002 at December 31, 2015); (iii) Bradesco FI Renda Fixa Longo Prazo Eucalipto – R$1,661,262 (R$217,586 at December 31, 2015); and (iv) Imbuia FI Renda Referenciado DI – R$211,708. (2) Issued by first-tier banks and backed by government securities. (3) Refers mainly to investments in gold. (4) The primary non-exclusive investment funds are: (i) Bradesco Empresas FICFI Referenciado DI Federal, amounting to R$24,225 (R$30,071 at December 31, 2015); (ii) Araucária Renda Fixa FI – R$1,509,559 (R$207,818 at December 31, 2015); and (iii) Santander Fundo de Investimento Cedro Renda Fixa R$1,759,749 (R$93,469 at December 31, 2015). (5) These basically refer to shares of Santiago Stock Exchange amounting to R$44,231(R$48,565 at December 31, 2015), Mexico Stock Exchange R$103,785 and Colombia Stock Exchange R$43,565, acquired by BM&FBOVESPA within its strategy to explore opportunities of partnerships with other stock exchanges, classified as available for sale. The government securities are held in the custody of the Special System for Settlement and Custody (SELIC); the investment fund shares are held in the custody of their respective administrators; the shares are in the custody of BM&FBOVESPA’s Equity and Corporate Debt Clearinghouse; the Santiago Stock Exchange, Mexico Stock Exchange and Colombia Stock Exchange shares are in the custody of BTG Pactual Chile, Mexico and Colombia, respectively. There was no reclassification of financial instruments between categories in the year. Management periodically monitors its outstanding positions and possible risks of impairment of its financial assets. Therefore, based on the nature of these assets, BM&FBOVESPA has no significant impairment history. The carrying amount of financial assets is reduced directly for impairment impacting P&L for the period. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognized in P&L for the period. c) Disposal of shares – CME Group Inc. To raise funds to meet the needs of BM&FBOVESPA as regards the business combination proposal with CETIP S.A. Mercados Organizados (“CETIP”) in April 2016, BM&FBOVESPA disposed of all shares that it held in CME Group (equivalent to 13,582,176 Class A Common Stocks, or 4% of total shares issued by CME Group) for R$4,309,172, as informed on April 7, 2016 through a material facts release. 16 Notes to the Financial Statements The loss recorded for the period on the disposal of shares of CME Group reflects the variations in share price and in the US dollar quotation after the reclassification of shares from “Investment in associate”, measured under the equity method, to “Financial investments and marketable securities available for sale”, measured at fair value, in September 2015, in addition to other impacts as follows: Accumulated 2016 Reclassification of other comprehensive income Mark-to-market of shares (235,308) Exchange rate variation of shares (413,543) Income from cash flow hedging instruments Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDF) (1) 68,392 Exchange rate variation of foreign debt securities 120,319 PIS and COFINS (112,291) Other (369) Gross loss on disposal of CME Group’s shares (572,800) Write-off of taxes recoverable CME GROUP (2) (3) (144,674) Income tax and social contribution current (3) (378,950) Income tax and social contribution deferred 920,875 Net loss on disposal of CME Group’s shares (175,549) (1) This refers to income on early settlement of Non-Deliverable Forwards hedging (cash flow hedge) the shares of CME Group against currency risk, as mentioned in Note 4 (d). (2) The income tax paid by CME Group abroad could be offset against IRPJ and CSLL due in Brazil by BM&FBOVESPA solely on profits generated by this ownership interest. Due to this limitation, the balance of the income tax paid by CME Group not used in prior periods and accumulated for offset in future periods was written off as a result of the disposal of all its shares by BM&FBOVESPA. (3) BM&FBOVESPA reviewed the tax treatment of the book value portion of this investment corresponding to the accumulated exchange variation for the period in which this investment was measured under the equity method (through September 2015), and began considering the portion of this exchange variation as part of the acquisition cost for purposes of determining capital gain, thus reducing the tax base for the 2015 and 2016 periods. Accordingly, IRPJ and CSLL tax bases were reviewed, with reversal of a portion of the provision amounting to R$381,727 and recording of a deferred tax credit amounting to R$49,951. d) Derivative financial instruments Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value of BM&FBOVESPA are recognized at quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market (Level 1), except for derivative financial instruments together with the principal of the debt issued abroad due to hedge accounting and for Santiago Stock Exchange shares, classified as Level 3. Trade accounts receivable and payable approximate their book value given their short-term maturities, and the fair values of related parties equal their book values. BM&FBOVESPA reclassified Santiago Stock Exchange from Level 2 to Level 3, adopting the profitability method, the shares of the future dividend flow discounted to present value. BM&FBOVESPA investment held in Santiago Stock Exchange, which is classified as Level 3, is periodically tested so its book value will not exceed its fair value. Future dividend flow was projected considering a five-year explicit flow (2017 to 2021), and its main assumptions were: (i) history of dividend payment by Santiago Stock Exchange, (ii) interest held by BM&FBOVESPA in December 2016 and (iii) perpetuity, which was determined by extrapolating the 2021 cash flow at a growth rate equivalent to that expected for the Chilean nominal GDP in the long term.

These contracts are included in the investment fund portfolios BB Pau Brasil Fundo de Investimento Renda Fixa and used to cover fixed interest rate exposures, swapping fixed interest rate for floating interest rate (CDI). The net result between the derivative transactions and the related financial instrument refers to the short position in future interest rate contracts, with negative market value of R$302 (R$173 at December 31, 2015). DI1 contracts have the same maturity dates as the fixed interest rate contracts to which they relate. Risk factor currency BM&FBOVESPA entered into derivative financial instruments to hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In 2016, there are hedging contracts for the total principal of foreign debt, part of half-yearly interest and for approximately 90% of the position in Mexican pesos regarding the Mexican Stock Exchange shares. Fair value hedge In March 2016, BM&FBOVESPA entered into swap transactions with a first-tier financial institution to hedge against impacts from the exchange rate variation related to the principal of debt securities issued abroad in 2010 (Note 12), due to the discontinuance of the cash flow hedge previously adopted. BM&FBOVESPA adopted the fair value hedge accounting for accounting records. Accordingly, both the hedged loan principal and the hedging instrument (swap) are measured at fair value against P&L, thus hedging P&L from the impacts of exchange rate variation. At December 31, 2016, swap transaction amounts measured at fair value are as follows: BM&FBOVESPA and Consolidated Financial Assets Reference Maturity of Fair value instrument /Liabilities value transaction Average interest Curve value adjustment Book balance Assets US$ 612,000 1,995,340 (3,058) 1,992,282 Swap 04/03/2017 Liabilities R$ 2,166,800 79.07% of CDI (2,392,218) (2,392,218) Swap result (396,878) (3,058) (399,936) 18 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year, hedge had no significant element of inefficiency.

In April 2016, due to full disposal of the shares of CME Group, the NDF transaction was settled. (2) In September 2016, BM&FBOVESPA took out with a first-tier financial institution a Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF), in order to hedge the investment in the shares of Mexico Stock Exchange and four installments of half-yearly interest of Senior Unsecured Notes (Note 12) from currency risk. (3) In December 2016, BM&FBOVESPA set up a new cash flow hedge, designating the loan taken out in foreign currency to hedge against currency risk of a portion of future income to be incurred from February 2017 to January 2018. In December 2016, the foreign loan designated as hedge amounted to R$ 407,388 the the amount recorded in equity was R$ 9,248, net of tax effects. (4) The method to determine the fair value, used by BM&FBOVESPA, is based on the conditions of transactions taken out, and then the present value based on current market curves, as disclosed by BM&FBOVESPA. In December 2015, BM&FBOVESPA has allocated part of its cash in foreign currency to cover foreign exchange impacts of certain firm commitments in foreign currency (cash flow hedge), in accordance with IAS 39/CPC 38.The hedged cash flows refer to payments to be made until December 31, 2016, even if the agreement terms exceed that date. In 2016, negative amount of R$521 was transferred from “Other comprehensive income” to profit or loss, and negative amount of R$1,761 to financial assets, in connection with payment flows that were hedged items beginning January 2016, net of tax effects. Also in 2016, R$1,379 was disregarded for cash flow hedge purposes, given the review of firm agreements. The amount was transferred from “Other comprehensive income” to financial expenses, net of tax effects. e) Financial instrument and risk management Financial risk management and financial investment policy BM&FBOVESPA’s policy is for highly liquid financial investments, whose performance is substantially tied to the SELIC/CDI rate, resulting in a significant proportion of government securities in its portfolio, purchased directly, via repurchase agreements backed by government securities and also through exclusive and non-exclusive funds. The Company carries out transactions with derivative instruments solely and exclusively for equity hedge purposes. Acquisition or disposal of strategic investments, such as CME Group shares, the shares of Santiago, Mexican and Colombian Stock Exchanges, is assessed individually and performed only in accordance with the strategic planning approved by the Board of Directors. In addition, BM&FBOVESPA has a Corporate Risk Management Policy, whose purpose is to establish principles, guidelines and responsibilities to be observed in the risk management process of BM&FBOVESPA, so as to allow identification, assessment, treatment, monitoring and communication of operational, technological, market, liquidity, credit, image and socio-environmental risks. The Risk and Financial Committees assess market, liquidity, credit and systemic risks of the markets managed by BM&FBOVESPA, with a strategic and structural focus. Sensitivity analysis The table below presents the net exposure of all financial instruments (assets and liabilities) by market risk factors. At December 31, 2016, BM&FBOVESPA's main market risk was represented by the fall in the floating interest rate (CDI/SELIC). Exposure to Risk Factors (Consolidated) 2016 2015 Risk factor Risk Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Share price Lower share price 1.64% 188,137 66.67% 4,853,598 Interest Floating interest rate Lower CDI / Selic rate 98.85% 11,305,635 65.18% 4,744,965 Foreign exchange USD Higher currency 0.07% 8,538 33.34% 2,426,859 Foreign exchange EUR Lower currency 0.15% 16,825 0.55% 40,161 Foreign exchange GBP Lower currency 0.01% 1,196 0.07% 5,001 Foreign exchange CLP Lower currency 0.36% 40,782 0.67% 48,575 Foreign exchange MXN Lower currency 0.08% 8,985 Foreign exchange COP Lower currency 0.38% 43,565 Gold Lower gold price 0.11% 12,037 0.19% 13,610 19 Notes to the Financial Statements The ownership structure at Santiago, Mexican and Colombian Stock Exchanges is subject to two risk factors simultaneously: currency and share price. Share price risk This risk arises from the possibility of fluctuations in the prices of the Santiago, Mexican and Colombian Stock Exchange shares, which BM&FBOVESPA holds in its portfolio and that may impact the amounts involved. The table below shows a sensitivity analysis on possible impacts from a variation of 25% and 50% on the probable scenario for share price, for the next three months, obtained from Bloomberg. Impact Probable Risk factor -50% -25% scenario +25% +50% Santiago Stock Exchange shares in BRL (20,233) (9,958) 317 10,591 20,866 Share price in CLP 846,520 1,269,781 1,693,041 2,116,301 2,539,561 Mexican Stock Exchange shares in BRL (51,094) (24,748) 1,597 27,943 54,288 Share price in MXN 13.86 20.78 27.71 34.64 41.57 Colombian Stock Exchange shares in BRL (21,782) (10,394) 663 11,719 22,776 Share price in COP 11.02 16.52 22.03 27.54 33.05 The possible impacts shown by the sensitivity analysis would affect equity, net of taxes. Interest rate risk This risk arises from the possibility of BM&FBOVESPA incur losses due to fluctuations in interest rates, affecting its assets and liabilities, resulting in effects on its Financial result. Floating-rate position As a financial investment policy and considering the need for immediate liquidity with the least possible impact from interest rate fluctuations, BM&FBOVESPA maintains its financial assets and liabilities substantially indexed to floating interest rates. The table below shows a sensitivity analysis on possible impacts of a variation of 25% and 50% on the probable scenario for the CDI and SELIC rate for the next three months, obtained from Bloomberg. Impact Probable Risk factor -50% -25% scenario +25% +50% CDI 100,807 149,522 197,187 243,853 289,567 CDI rate 6.36% 9.55% 12.73% 15.91% 19.09% SELIC 66,919 99,241 130,856 161,799 192,102 SELIC rate 6.47% 9.70% 12.93% 16.17% 19.40% Fixed-rate position Part of BM&FBOVESPA’s financial investments and marketable securities bears fixed interest rates, resulting in a net exposure to such rates. However, in terms of percentage, their effects on the portfolio are not considered material. Currency risk Currency risk refers to variations in foreign exchange rates that may cause unexpected losses to BM&FBOVESPA. In addition to the amounts payable and receivable in foreign currencies, including interest payments on the senior unsecured notes in the next six-month period, BM&FBOVESPA has third-party deposits in foreign currency to guarantee the settlement of transactions by foreign investors, own funds abroad, and also shareholding interest in stock exchanges abroad (the Santiago, Mexican and Colombian Stock Exchanges). The table below shows a sensitivity analysis on possible impacts of a variation of 25% and 50% on the probable scenario for currency risk for the next three months, obtained from Bloomberg.

In view of the net amounts of other currencies, their impacts are not deemed material. 20 Notes to the Financial Statements Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the cash need related to the obligations assumed and as a form of management, and BM&FBOVESPA constantly evaluates its cash flows, thus ensuring liquidity to fulfill all its obligations. The following table shows the main liability financial instruments of BM&FBOVESPA Group by maturity (undiscounted cash flows basis): From 1 to 2 From 2 to 5 No maturity Within 1 year years years Collaterals for transactions 1,653,835 Debt issued abroad 129,060 129,060 2,252,690 Swap (1) 381,888 NDFs (2) 8,151 Debentures 332,448 1,799,424 1,684,012 Loan 373,439 33,949 (1) The swap considers the amount to be settled on April 03, 2017 under the transaction taken out. For the adjustment calculation, CDI curve was used from December 31, 2016 up to the swap settlement date, the dollar at the closing of month (PTAX) was also used. (2) NDFs take into consideration the amount to be settled in 2017 on contracted transactions. For the adjustment calculation, the dollar at the closing of month (PTAX) and MXN/BRL sale rate disclosed by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN) were used. Credit risk The main credit risk of BM&FBOVESPA arises from its financial investments. As a way of managing this risk, BM&FBOVESPA has a financial investment policy that focuses mainly on investments in Brazilian federal government securities. Currently approximately 98% of financial investments is in connection with federal government securities with ratings set by Standard & Poor's and Moody's of “BB” and “Ba2”, respectively, for long-term issues in local currency. The counterparties of Swaps, NDFs and loans taken out as hedging transactions are substantially first-tier banks. Capital management BM&FBOVESPA’s objectives in managing its capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide return for its shareholders and for other stakeholders, as well as to maintain an optimal target capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, BM&FBOVESPA may revise its practices for payment of dividends, return capital to shareholders, raise loans and issue marketable securities in the financial and capital markets. In addition, as described in Note 17, BM&FBOVESPA is subject to capital regulatory requirement and must keep a safeguard and risk management structure exclusive for a proper settlement of transactions carried out and/or recorded in its systems. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the consolidated position of free cash and cash equivalents exceeds the financial indebtedness by R$7,277,540. 5.

With the consolidation of the strategic partnership made in 2010, and the natural development of the knowledge and technology transfer process between the two companies, in addition to the disposal of part of the investment held by the Company, management reviewed its assessment on the Company’s significant influence on CME Group, considering current quantitative and qualitative factors, and concluded that it should no longer be characterized as a significant influence , as defined by CPC 18, on CME Group. Such assessment made the Company reclassify its shareholding interest in CME Group, as from September 14, 2015 (date of the disposal financial settlement), from “Investments in associate”, measured by the equity method, to “Financial investments – available for sale”, measured at fair value. The previous net investment hedging structure was discontinued, and other comprehensive income of the hedged item and instrument was recorded in income or loss for the period.

In the period, BM&FBOVESPA absorbed as part of the project development cost the amount of R$7,591 (R$4,330 at December 31, 2015) related to the depreciation of equipment used in developing these projects. BM&FBOVESPA’s properties with a carrying amount of approximately R$92,441 (R$93,894 at December 31, 2015) were pledged as collateral in lawsuits. BM&FBOVESPA is not allowed to assign these assets as collateral for other lawsuits or sell them. Property and equipment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Annual depreciation rates of property and equipment items at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 2016 2015 Buildings 2.5% 2.5% Furniture and fixtures 10% 10% Computer devices and equipment 10% to 16.67% 10 to 25% Facilities 10% 10% Other 11% to 33% 11% to 33% 24 Notes to the Financial Statements 9. Intangible assets Goodwill Balance at December 31, 2015 16,064,309 Impairment of assets (1,662,681) Balance at December 31, 2016 14,401,628 Goodwill from acquisition of Bovespa Holding in 2008, amounting to R$16,064,309, is based on the expected future profitability, supported by an economic and financial valuation report of the investment. According to the guidelines of CPC 01/IAS 36, the goodwill attributed to expected future profitability must be tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indicators that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is recorded at cost value less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses recognized on goodwill are not reversed. BM&FBOVESPA uses an external and independent specialist to assist it in measuring the recoverable amount of an asset (value in use). The report submitted by the specialist identified that a negative adjustment to the goodwill book value at December 31, 2016 is not necessary. The assumptions adopted for future cash flow projections of BM&FBOVESPA, in the BOVESPA segment (Cash Generating Unit (CGU)), were based on analysis of performance over the past years, and expected growth in the market (based on estimated average yield of capital markets in the long term) and management’s expectations and strategies. Based on the growth expectations of the Bovespa segment, the projected cash flow considers revenues and expenses related to the segment’s activities. The projection period of these cash flows covers the period from December 2016 to December 2026. The perpetuity was determined by extrapolating the 2026 cash flow at a growth rate corresponding to that expected for the nominal GDP in the long term, of 6.60% p.a. Management understands that a ten-year projection period (and not five) is based on the perception that the Brazilian capital market, in the variable income segment, should undergo a long period of growth, reflecting the time required for indicators such as share of stocks in investors' portfolios, and Brazil's Market Cap / GDP ratio, among others, to reach levels recorded in other countries, indicating that the longterm maturity has been reached. To determine the present value of the projected cash flow, an average after-tax discount rate of 14.81% p.a. was used, which is equivalent to a 16.88% rate before taxes (2015 equivalent to 15.6% and 17.4% respectively). The three major variables impacting the value in use computed for the investment are the discount rates, net revenue growth rates and perpetuity growth rates. BM&FBOVESPA management carried out sensitivity analyses to determine the impacts of changes in such variables on the calculated value in use: increase of 90bps in the pre-tax discount rate (a standard deviation in discount rates over the last five years), decrease of 180bps in the average annual revenue growth from 2017 to 2026 (15% decrease), and decrease by 60bps in the perpetuity growth rate (a standard deviation of the 10-year series averages of changes in the Brazilian GDP). The sensitivity analyses revealed value in use of the CGU between 4% and 14% lower than the value in use estimated in the external expert´s report.

In the year, BM&FBOVESPA absorbed as part of the project development cost the amount of R$6,236 (R$5,674 at December 31, 2015) related to the amortization of software used in developing these projects. The ongoing projects refer mainly to the development of a new electronic trading platform for different kinds and classes of assets and the construction of a new business and IT architecture to support integration of the post-trade infrastructure. 10. Earnings and rights on securities in custody These comprise dividends and interest on equity received from listed companies, which will be transferred to the custody agents and by them to their customers, who are the owners of the listed companies’ shares. 11.

Debt issued abroad, loans and debentures a) Debt issued abroad With the adoption of the fair value hedge accounting in March 2016 (Note 4 (d)), the principal amount of debt securities issued abroad in 2010 are now measured at fair value. The restated loan balance at December 31, 2016 amounts to R$2,046,463 (R$2,454,265 at December 31, 2015), which includes the amount of R$58,794 (R$70,181 at December 31, 2015) referring to interest incurred until the reporting date. In December 2016, BM&FBOVESPA has entered into a Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) and designated it as a hedging instrument to hedge the currency risk of four installments of half-yearly interest of Senior Unsecured Notes (Note 4 (d)). Changes in debt issued abroad and hedge effects are as follows: BM&FBOVESPA and Consolidated Current Noncurrent Total Foreign loan at 12/31/2015 70,181 2,384,084 2,454,265 Exchange rate fluctuation (3,762) (394,128) (397,890) Exchange rate variation cash flow hedge (63) (63) Interest paid (143,774) (143,774) Interest payable 137,827 137,827 Fundraising cost amortization (1,615) (1,615) Foreign loan at amortized cost 58,794 1,989,956 2,048,750 Fair value adjustment fair value hedge (2,287) (2,287) Foreign loan at 12/31/2016 58,794 1,987,669 2,046,463 The market value of securities, considering principal and interest, amounts to R$2,064,997 at December 31, 2016 (R$2,380,489 at December 31, 2015), which is obtained from Bloomberg. b) Unsecured Loans In December 2016, BM&FBOVESPA entered into a loan agreement with a first-tier bank in the amount of US$125,000, at a rate of 2.57% per annum (p.a.), maturing within thirteen months. This loan was designated as a hedging instrument to hedge the foreign exchange risk of part of future revenues (Note 4 (d)). The loan is repayable in 12 equal installments of US$ 10,417, on the first business day of each month, the first installment falling due in February 2017. The funds obtained from the dollar-denominated loan were used to increase BM&FBOVESPA’s cash. As at December 31, 2016, the balance of the loan principal amount plus interest is R$ 407,868. 26 Notes to the Financial Statements c) Issuance of single series debentures On December 15, 2016, BM&FBOVESPA completed its first issuance of simple unsecured non-convertible debentures in a single series, with BM&FBOVESPA being rated by Moody's as “Aaa.br”. The debentures totaled R$3,000,000 and will mature after three years from the date of issuance but no later than December 30, 2019. Contractual Unit par value rate Number in R$ Total issuance First issuance (single series) 104.25% DI 3,000,000 1,000.00 3,000,000 The debentures will yield interest equivalent to 104.25% of the DI Rate with amortization of principal in equal installments in the 24th and 36th months, and semiannual payment of interest on the 1st of June and December each year, with the first payment on June 1, 2017 and the last on January 1, 2019. The net proceeds from the issuance will be fully used in the business combination between BM&FBOVESPA and CETIP, or in the settlement of loans obtained by BM&FBOVESPA for use in its operations or in the normal course of its business. As at December 31, 2016, the balance of the principal amount plus interest less costs incurred in the issuance of debentures is R$3,009,301.

(2) These refer to open market funding made by Banco BM&FBOVESPA, comprising repurchase agreements maturing on January 2, 2017 (January 4, 2016 for 2015) and backed by Financial Treasury Bills (LFT) and National Treasury Bills (LTN). 14. Provisions for tax, civil and labor contingencies, contingent assets and liabilities, judicial deposits and other provisions a) Contingent assets BM&FBOVESPA has no contingent assets recognized in its balance sheet and, at present, no lawsuits which are expected to give rise to significant future gains. b) Provisions for tax, civil and labor contingencies BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal and administrative proceedings involving labor, tax and civil matters arising in the ordinary course of business. The legal and administrative proceedings are classified by their likelihood of loss (probable, possible or remote), based on the assessment by BM&FBOVESPA’s legal department and external legal advisors, using parameters such as previous legal decisions and the history of loss in similar cases. The proceedings assessed as probable loss are mostly comprised as follows:  Labor claims mostly relate to claims filed by former employees of BM&FBOVESPA and employees of outsourced service providers, on account of alleged noncompliance with labor legislation;  Civil proceedings mainly relate to aspects of civil liability of BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries;  Tax proceedings for which provisions were set up mostly relate to PIS and COFINS levied on (i) BM&FBOVESPA revenues and (ii) receipt of interest on equity. 27 Notes to the Financial Statements BM&FBOVESPA figures as defendant in a civil proceeding filed by a commodities broker in bankruptcy that operated in the former BM&F. The provision for this contingency amounts to R$186,305 and comprises: estimated amount regarding the delivery of 3,278,554 BVMF3 shares, plus corresponding earnings; ii) restated indemnity of R$32,589; and iii) related attorney’s fees. c) Legal obligations These are almost entirely proceedings in which BM&FBOVESPA seeks exemption from additional social security contribution on payroll and payments to self-employed professionals. d) Other provisions BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiary BVRJ have contracts that provide for the payment of attorneys’ success fees arising from tax and civil proceedings, in which they figure as defendants. Within its best estimates, BM&FBOVESPA determined and provisioned the amounts for which it understands that there is likelihood of future disbursement, related to attorneys’ success fees from proceedings whose likelihood of loss is assessed as possible and remote. e) Changes in balances Changes in provisions for contingencies and legal obligations are detailed as follows: BM&FBOVESPA Civil Labor Legal Tax Other proceedings claims obligations proceedings provisions Total Balances at December 31, 2014 8,791 30,675 42,084 16,111 97,661 Provisions 2,589 7,193 9,782 Provision expenditure (3,876) (3,876) Reversal of provisions (1,412) (1,412) Reassessment of risks 463 463 Monetary restatement 898 4,277 3,988 1,341 10,504 Balances at December 31, 2015 9,689 32,716 53,265 17,452 113,122 Provisions 183,938 3,868 7,403 41,165 236,374 Provision expenditure (2) (4,941) (828) (1,248) (7,019) Reversal of provisions (1,669) (1,669) Reassessment of risks (23) 111 88 Monetary restatement 3,560 3,792 5,847 1,418 1,043 15,660 Balances at December 31, 2016 197,162 33,877 65,687 18,870 40,960 356,556 Consolidated Civil Labor Legal Tax Other proceedings claims obligations proceedings provisions Total Balances at December 31, 2014 14,051 30,743 42,084 16,111 102,989 Provisions 2,589 7,193 9,782 Provision expenditure (3,876) (3,876) Reversal of provisions (1,433) (1,433) Reassessment of risks 462 462 Monetary restatement 1,516 4,285 3,988 1,341 11,130 Balances at December 31, 2015 15,567 32,770 53,265 17,452 119,054 Provisions 183,938 3,868 7,403 49,054 244,263 Provision expenditure (2) (4,960) (828) (1,248) (7,038) Reversal of provisions (1,681) (1,681) Reassessment of risks (23) 111 88 Monetary restatement 4,495 3,796 5,847 1,418 1,138 16,694 Balances at December 31, 2016 203,975 33,904 65,687 18,870 48,944 371,380 Considering the characteristics of the provisions, the timing of the cash disbursements, if any, cannot be predicted. f) Possible losses The proceedings assessed as possible loss are so classified as a result of uncertainties surrounding their outcome. They are legal or administrative proceedings for which case law has not yet been established or which still depend on check and analysis of the facts, or even involve specific aspects that reduce the likelihood of loss. BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries are parties to tax, civil and labor lawsuits involving risks of loss classified by managemen t as possible, based on the assessment of their legal department and external legal advisors, for which no provision has been recorded. These proceedings comprise mainly the following:  Labor claims mostly relate to claims filed by former employees of BM&FBOVESPA and employees of outsourced service providers, on account of alleged noncompliance with labor legislation. At December 31, 2016, lawsuits assessed as possible loss amount to R$18,173 in Company and Consolidated (R$47,558 in Company and R$54,812 in the Consolidated at December 31, 2015); 28 Notes to the Financial Statements  Civil proceedings mainly relate to aspects of civil liability for losses and damages. The amount involved in civil proceedings classified as possible losses at December 31, 2016 totals R$102,718 in BM&FBOVESPA (R$165,917 at December 31, 2015) and R$324,388 on a consolidated basis (R$355,700 at December 31, 2015); The amount at December 31, 2016 is almost entirely related to two legal proceedings. The first one refers to the possibility of BVRJ being required to indemnify an investor for alleged omission in an audit report, brought before the Special Guarantee Fund Commission of BVRJ, of shares that allegedly resulted from transactions carried out by the investor through a broker, which were not included in the custody account. The second proceeding involves the possibility of BM&FBOVESPA being sentenced, jointly with BVRJ, to indemnify the broker, which, for not meeting the requirements, was not authorized to exchange the membership certificates of BVRJ which it alleged to own, with membership certificates of the then São Paulo Stock Exchange, which, in turn, would entitle to shares issued by BM&FBOVESPA. In addition to these proceedings mentioned above, at December 31, 2015, the proceeding filed by a commodity broker in bankruptcy, which operated in the former BM&FBOVESPA, was assessed as risk of remote loss by BM&FBOVESPA, as described in Note 14 (b).  The total amount involved in the tax proceedings classified as possible loss R$566,780 at BM&FBOVESPA and R$566,987 on a consolidated basis (R$671,320 at December 31, 2015 Company and consolidated). The main tax proceedings of BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries refer to the following matters: (i) Classification of the former BM&F and Bovespa, in the period prior to the demutualization, as taxpayers of the Contribution Tax on Gross Revenue for Social Security Financing (“COFINS”), which is the subject matter of two declaratory judgment actions pleading the declaration that the plaintiffs have no tax obligations owed to the federal tax authorities and seeking non-levy of COFINS on revenue arising from the exercise of the activities for which they were established, the revenue of which does not fall under the concept of billing. The amount involved in the aforementioned proceedings as of December 31, 2016 is R$63,892 (R$59,693 at December 31, 2015). (ii) Collection of Withholding Income Tax (IRRF) relating to the calendar year 2008, since the Brazilian IRS understands that BM&FBOVESPA would be responsible for withholding and paying IRRF on the alleged capital gains earned by non-resident investors in Bovespa Holding S.A., due to the merger of shares of Bovespa Holding S.A. into BM&FBOVESPA. The amount involved in this administrative proceeding at December 31, 2016 is R$204,695 (R$197,935 at December 31, 2015). (iii) Alleged levy of social security taxes on options granted under the Stock Option Plan of BM&F S.A., assumed by BM&FBOVESPA S.A., and of BM&FBOVESPA S.A. itself, exercised by the beneficiaries of the Plan in 2011 and 2012, as well as one-time fine due to the non-withholding at source of income tax allegedly due on those options. The inquiries of the Brazilian IRS are based on the understanding that the stock options were granted to employees in the nature of salary as they represent compensation for services rendered. The amounts involved in these administrative proceedings at December 31, 2016 are: (i) R$88,075 (R$79,094 at December 31, 2015), relating to social security contributions allegedly due, assessed as possible loss, and (ii) R$36,010 (R$31,750 at December 31, 2015), relating to one-time fine for the non-withholding of income tax, assessed as remote loss. (iv) Alleged differences in payment of IRPJ and CSLL stemming from questioning of the limits of deductibility of interest on equity paid by BM&FBOVESPA to its shareholders in calendar year 2008. The total amount involved in this administrative proceeding is R$151,623 (R$144,088 at December 31, 2015), including late-payment interest and automatic fine. g) Remote losses On November 29, 2010, BM&FBOVESPA was served a assessment notice from the Brazilian IRS challenging the amortization, for tax purposes in 2008 and 2009, of goodwill generated upon the merger of Bovespa Holding S.A.’s shares into BM&FBOVESPA in May 2008. In October 2011, the Brazilian IRS Judgment Office in São Paulo handed down a decision on the challenge presented by BM&FBOVESPA, upholding, in substance, the assessment notice. In December 2013, the Administrative Board of Tax Appeals (CARF) handed down a decision denying the voluntary appeal filed by BM&FBOVESPA, thus upholding the assessment notice. On March 25, 2015, CARF denied the motions for clarification filed by BM&FBOVESPA. On May 29, 2015, BM&FBOVESPA filed a Special Appeal with the Superior Chamber of the CARF. On February 6, 2017, BMF&BOVESPA filed a writ of mandamus challenging the effects of Executive Order 765/2016 on the judgment of this administrative proceeding. On February 7, 2017, an injunction was granted to remove the Special Appeal from the trial calendar of the Superior Chamber of the CARF. BM&FBOVESPA understands that the risk of loss associated with this tax matter is remote and will continue to amortize the goodwill for tax purposes as provided for by prev ailing legislation. The amount involved in this administrative proceeding at December 31, 2016 is R$1,184,514 (R$1,083,566 at December 31, 2015). On April 2, 2015, BM&FBOVESPA was served a assessment notice from the Brazilian IRS challenging the amortization, for tax purposes in 2010 and 2011, of goodwill generated upon the merger of Bovespa Holding S.A.’s shares into BM&FBOVESPA in May 2008. On April 27, 2016, BM&FBOVESPA was notified by Brazilian IRS Judgment Office’s (DRJ) decision denying the Company’s appeal and BM&FBOVESPA will file an appeal with the Administrative Board of Tax Appeals (CARF) within the term prescribed by applicable regulations. BM&FBOVESPA understands that the risk of loss associated with this tax matter is remote and will continue to amortize the goodwill for tax purposes as provided for by prevailing legislation. The amount involved in this administrative proceeding at December 31, 2016 is R$2,347,853 (R$2,111,622 at December 31, 2015). BM&FBOVESPA, as successor of the former BOVESPA, and subsidiary BVRJ figure as defendants in a claim for property damages and pain and suffering filed by Naji Robert Nahas, Selecta Participações e Serviços SC Ltda., and Cobrasol Companhia Brasileira de Óleos e Derivados, on the grounds of alleged losses in the stock market sustained in June 1989. The amount attributed to the cause by the plaintiffs is R$10 billion. In relation to property damages and pain and suffering claimed, the plaintiffs ask that BM&FBOVESPA and BVRJ be sentenced in proportion to their responsibilities. A decision was handed down whereby the claims by the plaintiffs were considered completely unfounded. This decision was confirmed by the High Court of Justice of Rio de Janeiro State by means of a decision published on December 18, 2009. The plaintiffs filed special and extraordinary appeals, both of which were denied. Interlocutory appeals were filed with the High Court of Justice and with the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil, and the appeal was 29 Notes to the Financial Statements granted for appreciation by the High Court of Justice, so that the special appeal lodged by the plaintiffs may be examined by a higher court. The special appeal was partially disclosed and was unanimously denied in connection with this portion. The plaintiffs lodged motions for clarification against this decision, which were unanimously denied, then they lodged motions for reconsideration which were also overruled. Considering this decision, the plaintiffs filed a request for reconsideration and, alternatively, a special appeal. The High Court of Justice considered the request for reconsideration as a special appeal and dismissed it, against which the plaintiffs lodged a motion for clarification, which was also rejected. The appeal filed by plaintiffs was not recognized by the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil. Considering this decision, the plaintiffs filed a request for reconsideration and, alternatively, a special appeal. The Federal Supreme Court dismissed the special appeal. The proceeding is currently awaiting a final decision on the filing of a motion for clarification. BM&FBOVESPA understands that the likelihood of loss in this suit is remote. BM&FBOVESPA, as the successor of Bolsa de Mercadorias e Futuros BM&F ( BM&F ) and as disclosed in its Form of Reference (item 4.3), figures as a defendant in civil public actions and class actions filed in order to investigate the practice of possible acts of administrative impropriety, and to receive compensation for alleged damages to the federal treasury as a result of transactions conducted by the Central Bank of Brazil in January 1999 in the US dollar futures market run by the former BM&F. On March 15, 2012, those proceedings were deemed valid in the trial court and sentenced most of the defendants, among them, BM&F. The total amount arising from this unfavorable decision is R$7,005 million, and, according to one of the decisions handed down, the gains that the Central Bank of Brazil obtained by reason of the non-use of international reserves, amounting to R$5,431 million, may be deducted. BM&FBOVESPA was also sentenced to pay a civil penalty of R$1,418 million. The figures were measured in January 1999 and should be adjusted for inflation, plus interest and burden of defeat. BM&FBOVESPA believes that these actions are fully groundless and will not recognize in its financial statements any provision for such lawsuits as the risk of loss is remote. Appeals were filed, which have caused the execution of the trial court judgment to be suspended. Currently, BM&FBOVESPA awaits the analysis of these appeals by the Federal Court of Appeals of the 1st Chapter. h) Judicial deposits BM&FBOVESPA Consolidated Description 2016 2015 2016 2015 Legal obligations 65,800 52,989 65,800 52,989 Tax proceedings 79,569 73,895 79,908 74,185 Civil proceedings 5,941 5,577 5,941 5,577 Labor claims 10,968 7,658 11,111 7,816 Total 162,278 140,119 162,760 140,567 Out of the total judicial deposits, the following are highlighted: (i) R$58,576 (R$54,149 at December 31, 2015) relates to the disputes over the classification of the exchanges as subject to the payment of COFINS, which are assessed as possible loss by BM&FBOVESPA, as described in item “f” above; and (ii) R$14,207 (R$13,127 at December 31, 2015) refers to cases regarding PIS and COFINS on interest on equity received. Of the total deposits relating to legal obligations, R$65,788 (R$52,541 at December 31, 2015) relates to the proceedings in which BM&FBOVESPA claims non-levy of additional social security contribution on payroll and payments to self-employed professionals, and challenges the legality of FAP (an index applied to calculate the occupational accident insurance owed by employers). Due to the existence of judicial deposits related to tax proceedings classified as possible losses, the total tax contingencies and legal obligations are less than the total deposits related to tax claims. 15. Equity a) Capital BM&FBOVESPA’s fully subscribed and paid-up capital is R$2,540,239 comprising 1,815,000,000 (1,815,000,000 at December 31, 2015) registered common shares with voting rights and no par value, including 1,787,429,549 common shares outstanding at December 31, 2016 (1,782,094,906 at December 31, 2015). BM&FBOVESPA is authorized to increase its capital up to the limit of 2,500,000,000 common shares, through a resolution of the Board of Directors, without any amendment to its Articles of Incorporation. b) Treasury shares Share buyback program At the meeting held on December 10, 2015, the Board of Directors approved the new Share Buyback Program, starting on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2016.

The changes in treasury shares for the year are as follows: 30 Notes to the Financial Statements Number Amount Balances at December 31, 2014 91,821,444 983,274 Purchase of shares Share buyback program 26,187,400 287,030 Shares cancelled (85,000,000) (903,975) Shares sold stock options (103,750) (1,094) Balances at December 31, 2015 32,905,094 365,235 Shares sold stock grant (5,334,643) (59,213) Balances at December 31, 2016 27,570,451 306,022 Average cost of treasury shares (R$ per share) 11.100 Market value of treasury shares 463,459 c) Revaluation reserves Revaluation reserves were established as a result of the revaluation of works of art in BM&FBOVESPA and of the properties of the subsidiary BVRJ in 2007, based on independent experts’ appraisal reports. d) Capital reserve This refers substantially to amounts originated in the merger of Bovespa Holding shares in 2008, and other corporate events allowed by the Brazilian Corporation Law, such as (i) capital increase through merger, (ii) redemption, repayment or purchase of shares, and (iii) events associated with the stock option and stock grant plan. e) Income reserves (i) Legal reserve Legal reserve is annually set up with allocation of 5% of net income for the year, capped at 20% of capital. The legal reserve aims at ensuring integrity of capital and may only be used to absorb losses and increase capital. The legal reserve is not required to be set up considering that its amount plus the capital reserves exceed 30% of the Company capital. (ii) Statutory reserves Represent funds and safeguard mechanisms required for the activities of BM&FBOVESPA, in order to ensure the proper settlement and reimbursement of losses arising from the intermediation of transactions carried out in its trading sessions and/or registered in any of its trading, registration, clearing and settlement systems, and from custody services. Pursuant to the Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may, when the amount of the statutory reserve is sufficient to meet the purposes for which it was originally established, propose that part of the reserve be distributed to the shareholders of the Company. f) Other comprehensive income The purpose is to record the effects of (i) exchange variation of the investments abroad, (ii) hedge accounting on net foreign investment (Note 12), (iii) cash flow hedge (Note 4), (iv) comprehensive income of subsidiaries,(v) actuarial gains/losses on post-retirement health care benefits, (vi) mark-to-market of financial assets available for sale. g) Dividends and interest on equity As provided for in the Articles of Incorporation, shareholders are entitled mandatory minimum dividends of 25% of net income for the year, adjusted under Brazilian Corporation Law. 2016 2015 Net income for the year 1,463,754 2,202,238 Dividends 223,581 Interest on equity 900,000 1,019,033 Total approved for the year 900,000 1,242,614 Dividends and interest on equity approved in relation to P&L for the year are as follows: Date Date of Gross amount Total gross Description approved payment per share (R$) amount Interest on equity 5/12/2016 6/6/2016 0.094973 169,663 Interest on equity 8/11/2016 9/6/2016 0.120616 215,592 Interest on equity 11/11/2016 12/2/2016 0.082090 146,730 Interest on equity 12/16/2016 1/12/2017 0.205891 368,015 Total proposed/approved for 2016 900,000 Dividends 5/14/2015 5/29/2015 0.124110 223,581 Interest on equity 8/13/2015 9/8/2015 0.142749 254,392 Interest on equity 11/12/2015 12/4/2015 0.176557 314,641 Interest on equity 12/10/2015 12/29/2015 0.252512 450,000 Total proposed/approved for 2015 1,242,614 31 Notes to the Financial Statements h) Earnings per share Basic Consolidated 2016 2015 Numerator Net income available to shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA 1,446,263 2,202,238 Denominator Weighted average number of outstanding shares 1,786,929,084 1,791,892,507 Basic earnings per share (in R$) 0.809357 1.229001 Diluted Consolidated 2016 2015 Numerator Net income available to shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA 1,446,263 2,202,238 Denominator Weighted average number of outstanding shares adjusted by effects of stock grant and stock option plans 1,799,833,802 1,805,320,403 Diluted earnings per share (in R$) 0.803555 1.219860 16.

BM&FBOVESPA follows a policy on transactions with related parties, approved by the Board of Directors, which aims to establish rules to ensure that all decisions involving related-party transactions and other situations of potential conflict of interest are taken to the interests of BM&FBOVESPA and its shareholders. The main recurring transactions with related parties are described below and were carried out under the following conditions:  The amounts owed by Banco BM&FBOVESPA to BM&FBOVESPA refer to the Company’s funds used by Banco BM&FBOVESPA in performing its activities under a formal agreement signed by the parties. 32 Notes to the Financial Statements  Accounts payable to CME Group refer to the remaining portion for the acquisition of the perpetual license of modules related to the multi-asset class electronic trading platform, PUMA Trading System, which was developed together with the CME Group. In September 2015, CME Group ceased to be a related party to BM&FBOVESPA given the disqualification of its significant influence and consequent discontinued use of the equity method (Note 7).  BM&FBOVESPA Supervisão de Mercados BSM has entered into an agreement with BM&FBOVESPA for the transfer and recovery of costs, which establishes the reimbursement to BM&FBOVESPA for expenses incurred for resources and infrastructure made available to BSM to assist in the performance of its supervision activities. Such costs are determined on a monthly basis using the methodology specified in the agreement signed by the parties and also include the activities related to the Mecanismo de Ressarcimento de Prejuízos (Loss Recovery Mechanism), as this mechanism is administered by BSM.BM&FBOVESPA makes transfers in order to supplement financing for the activities of BSM and regular transfers of fines for failure to settle debts and deliver assets by BSM, as set out in Circular Letter 044/2013 of BM&FBOVESPA.  BM&FBOVESPA monthly pays BM&F (USA) Inc. and BM&FBOVESPA (UK) Ltd. for representing it abroad by liaising with other exchanges and regulators and assisting in bringing new clients to the Brazilian capital market.  Associação BM&F, Associação Bovespa, Instituto BM&FBOVESPA and Associação Profissionalizante BM&FBOVESPA periodically reimburse BM&FBOVESPA for expenses associated with the resources and infrastructure provided by BM&FBOVESPA to assist them in performing their activities.  BM&FBOVESPA pays the cost of courses taken by its employees directed to the financial and capital markets offered by Instituto Educacional BM&FBOVESPA, administered by Associação BM&F.  Sundry expenses with other related parties consist mainly of lawyer’s services provided by law firm Barbosa Mussnich Aragão Advogados (BMA) in the operation with Cetip. Management understood that law firm BMA is a related party, since one of its partners is member of the Board of Directors of BM&FBOVESPA. The engagement was in line with the criteria set by the related party policy and other situations involving conflict of interest of BM&FBOVESPA. In addition to the transactions with related parties, within the context of the operation with Cetip and under the terms of its policy for related parties and other situations involving potential conflict of interest, BM&FBOVESPA contracted services provided by companies whose managers are also members of the BM&FBOVESPA’s Board of Directors. The services were contracted under normal market conditions. The companies contracted are Banco J.P.Morgan S/A; Banco Bradesco BBI S/A; and Itaú Unibanco S/A, with expenses totaling R$27,612. b) Key management personnel compensation Key management personnel include Members of the Board of Directors, Executive Officers, Internal Audit Officer, Corporate Risk Officer, Officer of Banco BM&FBOVESPA and Human Resources Officer. 2016 2015 Management fees Short-term benefits (salaries, profit sharing, etc.) 37,063 30,695 Share-based payment (1) 52,135 31,127 Consideration cancellation of Stock Options and labor and social security charges (Note 18) 35,093 Severance pay benefits (2) 31,483 (1) Refers to expenses computed in the year relating to share-based payment, increased by labor and social security charges, and stock options of key management personnel. These expenses were recognized according to the criteria described in Note 18. (2) Refers to severance pay benefits to key management personnel (Stock Grant plan). 17. Collateral for transactions BM&FBOVESPA operating as a central counterparty (CCP) manages four clearinghouses considered systemically important by the Central Bank of Brazil: BM&FBOVESPA (former Derivatives Clearinghouse), Foreign Exchange and Securities Clearinghouses and the Equity and Corporate Debt Clearinghouse (CBLC). In its Circular Letter 046/2014, dated August 07, 2014, the Central Bank of Brazil granted BM&FBOVESPA authorization to operate its new clearinghouse, the BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse. The new clearinghouse is part of the post-trade integration (IPN) project, an initiative adopted by BM&FBOVESPA to start an integrated clearinghouse that will consolidate the activities performed by the four clearinghouses. The activities of BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse will be limited, in this first phase of the project, to the financial derivative and commodity market and gold market, including exchange-traded and OTC contracts. The activities carried out by the clearinghouses are governed by Law No. 10214/01, which authorizes the multilateral clearing of obligations, establishes the central counterparty role of the systemically important clearinghouses and permits the utilization of the collateral obtained from defaulting participants to settle their obligations in the clearinghouse environment, including in cases of civil insolv ency, agreements with creditors, intervention, bankruptcy and out-of-court liquidation. Through its clearinghouses, BM&FBOVESPA acts as a central counterparty in the derivatives market (futures, forward, options and swaps), spot foreign exchange market, government securities market (spot, forwards, repurchase operations, futures and lending of securities), variable income (spot, forward, option, futures and lending of securities) and private debt securities (spot and lending of securities). In other words, by assuming the role of a central counterparty, BM&FBOVESPA becomes responsible for the proper settlement of trades carried out and/or registered in its systems, as established in the applicable regulations. The performance of BM&FBOVESPA as a central counterparty exposes it to the credit risk of the participants that utilize its settlement systems. If a participant fails to make the payments due, or to deliver the assets or commodities due, it will be incumbent upon BM&FBOVESPA to resort to its safeguard mechanisms, in order to ensure the proper settlement of the transactions in the established time frame and manner. In the event of a failure or insufficiency of the safeguard mechanisms of its Clearinghouses, BM&FBOVESPA m ight have to use its own equity, as a last resort, to ensure the proper settlement of trades. 33 Notes to the Financial Statements The clearinghouses are not directly exposed to market risk, as they do not hold long or short positions in the various contracts and assets traded. However, an increase in price volatility can affect the magnitude of amounts to be settled by the various market participants, and can also heighten the probability of default by these participants. Furthermore, as already emphasized, the clearinghouses are responsible for the settlement of the trades of a defaulting participant, which could result in losses for BM&FBOVESPA if the amounts due surpass the amount of collateral available. Accordingly, despite the fact that there is no direct exposure to market risk, this risk can impact and increase the credit risks assumed. Each clearinghouse has its own risk management system and safeguard structure. The safeguard structure of a clearinghouse represents the set of resources and mechanisms that it can utilize to cover losses relating to the settlement failure of one or more participants. These systems and structures are described in detail in the regulations and manuals of each clearinghouse, and have been tested and ratified by the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN), in accordance with National Monetary Council (CMN) Resolution No. 2882/01 and BACEN Circular No. 3057/01. The safeguard structures of the clearinghouses are based largely on a loss-sharing model called defaulter pays, in which the amount of collateral deposited by each participant should be able to absorb, with a high degree of confidence, the potential losses associated with its default. Consequently, the amount required as collateral for participants is the most important element in our management structure of the potential market risks arising from our role as a central counterparty. For most contracts and operations involving assets, the required value as collateral is sized to cover the market risk of the business, i.e. its price volatility during the expected time frame for settlement of the positions of a defaulting participant. This timeframe can vary depending on the nature of contracts and assets traded. The models used for calculating the margin requirements are based, in general, on the concept of stress testing, in other words, a methodology that attempts to measure market risk into account not only recent historical volatility of prices, but also the possibility of the occurrence of unexpected events that modify the historical patterns of behavior of prices and the market in general. The main parameters used for margin calculation models are the stress scenarios, defined by the Market Risk Committee for the risk factors that affect the prices of contracts and assets traded on our systems. For the definition of stress scenarios, the Market Risk Committee uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis. The quantitative analysis is done with the support of statistical models for estimating risk, such as EVT (extreme value theory), estimate of implied volatilities, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) models, and historical simulations. The qualitative analysis considers aspects related to domestic and international economic and political conditions and their impacts on the markets managed by BM&FBOVESPA. On March 05, 2014, according to BM&FBOVESPA Circular Letter No. 003/2014, new versions of BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouses rules became effective, aiming towards convergence with international capital requirement rules under Basel III Accord by financial institutions subject to credit risk of clearinghouses. These changes were approved by BACEN in January 2014. The operations in the BM&FBOVESPA markets are secured by margin deposits in cash, government and corporate securities, letters of guarantee and shares among others. The guarantees received in cash, in the amount of R$1,653,835 (R$1,338,010 at December 31, 2015), are recorded as a liability under Collateral for transactions and other non-cash collaterals, in the amount of R$264,899,075 (R$303,824,243 at December 31, 2015), are recorded in memorandum accounts. At December 31, 2016, collaterals amounted to R$266,552,910 (R$305,162,253 at December 31, 2015), as follows: a) Collaterals deposited by participants 2016 Equity and Corporate Foreign Assets BM&FBOVESPA Debt Clearinghouse Exchange Clearingho Clearinghouse (CBLC) Clearinghouse use Government securities 160,398,544 46,358,618 6,191,501 100,196 Letters of guarantee 1,695,568 559,700 Shares 5,036,052 37,200,918 International Securities (1) 5,557,198 Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs) 1,168,940 344,193 Cash amounts deposited 1,352,920 137,760 162,955 Gold 8,557 4,942 Other 44,646 229,702 Total 169,705,227 90,393,031 6,354,456 100,196 2015 Foreign Equity and Corporate Exchange Assets BM&FBOVESPA Debt Clearinghouse Clearingho Clearingho Clearinghouse (CBLC) use use Government securities 216,955,868 37,116,275 8,644,122 280,222 Letters of guarantee 3,552,464 397,000 Shares 3,458,610 27,241,604 International Securities (1) 4,151,480 Bank Deposit Certificates (CDBs) 1,394,602 277,305 Cash amounts deposited 1,027,657 134,437 175,716 Gold 12,012 3,162 Other 176,345 163,372 Total 226,577,558 69,484,635 8,819,838 280,222 (1) American and German government securities as well as ADRs (American Depositary Receipts). 34 Notes to the Financial Statements b) Other safeguard mechanisms i) BM&FBOVESPA Clearinghouse  Joint liability for paying the broker and clearing member that acted as intermediaries, as well as collaterals deposited by such participants.  Minimum Non-operating Collateral, composed of collaterals transferred by BM&FBOVESPA clearing members and by full trading participants, intended to guarantee the transactions.

Employee benefits a) Stock options Long-term benefit Pursuant to the Notice to the Market published on February 04, 2015, BM&FBOVESPA decided to offer to the beneficiaries of the Company’s Stock Options Plan (respectively “Beneficiaries” and “Options”) the following choices: (i) remaining as holders of their Options, or (ii) cancelling their outstanding Options and receiving an amount in cash with respect to those Options which had already vested (“Vested Options”), or receiving shares of the Company, to be transferred on future dates, with respect to those Options which had not yet vested (“Non-vested Options”). Nearly all of the beneficiaries opted for their share cancellation and the shares received with respect to the cancellation of Non-vested Options were subject to the Stock Grant Plan approved by the Company in an Extraordinary General Meeting on May 13, 2014. BM&FBOVESPA believes that the resulting long-term incentive model will more effectively align the interests of beneficiaries to those of BM&FBOVESPA and its shareholders in the long term, as well as retain key personnel. The amounts paid in cash and granted in shares for cancellation of the Options, as defined in CPC 10 (R1) approved by CVM Rule No. 650/10, were calculated based on the fair value of the Options on January 5, 2015, and the results of these calculations were reviewed and validated by specialized external consultants. The cancelled vested Options resulted in cash payments equivalent to the Fair Value of those Options. The cancelled Non-vested Options, meanwhile, resulted in the granting of a number of Company shares which was calculated based on the Fair Value of the Non-vested Options on January 05, 2015 and on the closing price of the shares on the same date (R$9.22).

Out of these, 837,389 options were cancelled, resulting in a cash payment of R$665 while 422,000 options were not converted, since there was no program enrollment by the terminated employees. Total cash payment was R$56,198. (2) 12.5 thousand options were not converted, since there was no enrollment by the beneficiaries. The shares granted in exchange for the cancelled Non-vested Options will be subject to the same rules in cases of dismissal, disablement, death or retirement. Furthermore, these shares will have dates for transfer that are the same as the vesting periods established for each Option program and will be transferred to the Beneficiaries in January each year: 3,139,275 in 2016; 3,192,082 in 2017; 1,523,046 in 2018; and 784,882 in 2019. The guidelines and conditions for the cancellation of options, as well as the cash and equity settlement, were approved by the Board of Directors of BM&FBOVESPA at a meeting held on December 24, 2014, and all of the actions required for its implementation were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at a meeting held on February 04, 2015. BM&FBOVESPA recognized expenses related to grants of the Option Plan in the amount of R$267 for the year ended December 31, 2016 (R$276 at December 31, 2015), matched against capital reserves in equity. BM&FBOVESPA entered into commitments with beneficiaries to hold them harmless from any potential liabilities related to assessment notices. At December 31, 2016, the potential liabilities are recognized for R$27,017 (R$24,300 at December 31, 2015). Effects arising from the exercise of options 2016 2015 Amount received from the exercise of options 897 (-) Cost of treasury shares disposed of (1,094) Effect from disposal of shares (197) 36 Notes to the Financial Statements Pricing model Major assumptions considered in pricing options are as follows: (a) Options were evaluated considering the market parameters in force on every grant date of different Stock Option Programs; (b) To estimate the risk-free interest rate, the future interest contracts negotiated for the maximum exercise period of each option were considered; and (c) The maximum exercise period of options granted in each Stock Option Program was considered to be the maturity term. Other usual assumptions related to option pricing models, such as inexistence of arbitrage opportunities and constant volatility over time were also considered in the calculation. b) Stock Grant Long-term benefit The Special Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 13, 2014 approved the Stock Grant Plan, which replaced the grant mechanism for the Stock Grant Plan shares as a long-term benefit. The conditions under the Stock Grant Plan include achievement of goals by the beneficiaries and an individual evaluation of performance and potential. The granting of shares relating to a specific fiscal year will always occur at the beginning of the next fiscal year. The shares will be transferred to the beneficiaries observing the grace periods established in the Stock Programs and the previously established contractual conditions. The Stock Grant Plan vests the Board of Directors with full powers to approve stock grants and manage them, through Stock Grant Plans, which should define, among other specific conditions: (i) the beneficiaries; (ii) the total number of BM&FFBOVESPA shares under the grant program; (iii) criteria for election of the beneficiaries and determining the number of shares to be assigned; (iv) splitting shares into lots; (v) vesting periods for the transfer of shares; (vi) any restrictions on the transfer of shares received by the beneficiaries; and (vii) any provisions on penalties. For each Stock Grant Program, there should be a minimum total period of three (3) years from the grant date of the shares in a given program and the last date of transfer of shares granted under the same program. Moreover, a minimum vesting period of twelve (12) months should be observed from: (i) the grant date of a program and the first date of transfer of any shares under that Program, and (ii) between each of the transfer dates of shares of that program after the first transfer. The Stock Grant Plan also defines a specific mechanism for granting shares to the members of the Board of Directors, whereby: (i) the members of the Board of Directors are eligible to be beneficiaries of the grant from the date the General Meeting elects them to office, or another period as defined by the General Meeting; (ii) the beneficiaries members of the Board of Directors as a whole may annually receive a total 172,700 shares of BM&FBOVESPA, which will be distributed on a straight-line basis among the members of the Board of Directors, as approved at the General Meeting; (iii) stock will be granted to members of the Board of Directors in one single lot on the same dates the Programs approve stock grants to other beneficiaries; (iv) the stock considered in the contracts with beneficiaries that are members of the Board of Directors will be transferred 2 years after the end of term of each Board member in which the contract was executed. BM&FBOVESPA recognized expenses related to Stock Plan grants in the amount of R$86,159 for the year ended December 31, 2016 (R$40,050 at December 31, 2015), matched with capital reserves in equity, based on the fair value of the share at the grant date of the plans. BM&FBOVESPA also recognized charges in the amount of R$54,865 as personnel expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 (R$26,442 at December 31, 2015), calculated based on the fair value of the share as at December 31, 2016. BM&FBOVESPA records the expenses relating to the Stock Grant Program which were granted for replacement of unvested options of the Stock Option Plan, for the same fair value of options previously granted, in accordance with CPC 10 (R1)/IFRS 2. 37 Notes to the Financial Statements Stock Grant – Summary/Changes Transferred in Canceled in Shares Fair value of Number of the period the period outstanding shares on the Dilution Conversion/ shares at New ended ended contracts at grant date percentage Program grant date Grace period 12/31/2015 programs 12/31/2016 12/31/2016 12/31/2016 (R$ per share) (1) Stock Grant – Converted Options 01/05/2015 01/05/2016 2,599,703 (2,599,703) 9.22 0.00% 01/05/2015 01/05/2017 1,804,267 (141,506) (10,867) 1,651,894 9.22 0.09% 01/05/2015 01/05/2018 1,041,252 (79,296) (6,656) 955,300 9.22 0.05% 5,445,222 (2,820,505) (17,523) 2,607,194 Stock Grant – Additional Converted Options 01/05/2015 01/05/2016 451,850 (451,850) 9.22 0.00% 01/05/2015 01/05/2017 1,325,998 (121,708) (2,594) 1,201,696 9.22 0.07% 01/05/2015 01/05/2018 451,844 (38,374) 413,470 9.22 0.02% 01/05/2015 01/07/2019 784,882 (65,704) 719,178 9.22 0.04% 3,014,574 (677,636) (2,594) 2,334,344 Stock Grant Program 2014 01/02/2015 01/04/2016 923,974 (923,974) 9.50 0.00% 01/02/2015 01/02/2017 923,962 (61,579) (12,632) 849,751 9.50 0.05% 01/02/2015 01/02/2018 882,903 (61,579) (12,632) 808,692 9.50 0.05% 01/02/2015 01/02/2019 882,897 (61,579) (12,632) 808,686 9.50 0.05% 3,613,736 (1,108,711) (37,896) 2,467,129 Stock Grant – Additional Program 2014 01/02/2015 01/04/2016 384,968 (384,968) 9.50 0.00% 01/02/2015 01/02/2017 376,495 (35,809) 340,686 9.50 0.02% 01/02/2015 01/02/2018 376,482 (35,809) 340,673 9.50 0.02% 1,137,945 (456,586) 681,359 Stock Grant – Board of Directors Grant 2014 01/02/2015 04/30/2017 172,692 172,692 9.50 0.01% 172,692 172,692 Stock Grant Program 2015 01/08/2016 01/13/2017 844,371 (55,609) (2,852) 785,910 10.52 0.04% 01/08/2016 01/15/2018 844,348 (55,608) (2,852) 785,888 10.52 0.04% 01/08/2016 01/14/2019 844,306 (55,608) (2,851) 785,847 10.52 0.04% 01/08/2016 01/13/2020 844,285 (55,608) (2,851) 785,826 10.52 0.04% 3,377,310 (222,433) (11,406) 3,143,471 Stock Grant – Additional Program 2015 01/08/2016 01/13/2017 280,891 (21,257) 259,634 10.52 0.01% 01/08/2016 01/15/2018 280,891 (21,257) 259,634 10.52 0.01% 01/08/2016 01/14/2019 280,881 (21,257) 259,624 10.52 0.01% 842,663 (63,771) 778,892 Stock Grant – Board of Directors Grant 2015 01/08/2016 04/30/2019 172,697 172,697 10.52 0.01% 172,697 172,697 Stock Grant programs 13,384,169 4,392,670 (5,349,642) (69,419) 12,357,778 0.69% (1) The number of outstanding shares at December 31, 2016 is 1,787,429,549.

Income tax and social contribution a) Deferred income tax and social contribution Changes The balances and changes of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: BM&FBOVESPA and Consolidated (Debt) credit in the (Debt) credit in the statement of 2015 income statement comprehensive income 2016 Deferred tax assets Tax, civil and labor contingencies 24,487 81,995 106,482 Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards 30,581 38,411 68,992 Exchange variation on issue of debt abroad (1) 445,562 (445,562) Mark to market CME 69,243 (69,243) Effect of exchange rate variation on shares abroad 14,022 14,022 Mark to market 138,013 138,013 Other temporary differences 62,123 27,258 89,381 Deferred tax liabilities Goodwill amortization (2) (2,834,715) (541,159) (3,375,874) Mark to market shares abroad (374) (1,124) (1,498) Effect of exchange rate variation on cash flow hedge (755) 755 Effect of exchange rate variation on shares abroad (455,872) 450,006 (5,866) Discontinued use of equity method CME (589,862) 589,862 Other temporary differences (22,694) 9,505 3,412 (9,777) Deferred taxes, net (3,272,276) 343,885 (47,734) (2,976,125) (1) The write-off of deferred tax asset balance corresponding to the foreign exchange variation on foreign debt issue arises from the effects, in 2016, of the change in the regime for recognition of foreign exchange variations for tax purposes in a period to be declared in 2017, giving rise to other less significant impacts. (2) Deferred income tax and social contribution liabilities arising from temporary differences between the tax base of goodwill and its carrying amount on the balance sheet, considering that goodwill is still amortized for tax purposes, but is no longer amortized for accounting purposes as from January 1, 2009, resulting in a tax base smaller than the carrying amount of goodwill. This temporary difference may result in amounts becoming taxable in future periods, when the carrying amount of the asset will be reduced or settled , this requiring the recognition of a deferred tax liability. 39 Notes to the Financial Statements b) Estimated realization period Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences are recorded in the books taking into consideration their probable realization, based on projections of future results prepared based on internal assumptions and future economic scenarios that may, accordingly, not materialize as expected. Deferred tax assets (including tax loss carryforwards of R$68,992) are expected to be realized in the amount of R$53,058 within one year and R$363,832 after one year and realization of deferred tax liabilities is expected to occur after one year. At December 31, 2016, the present value of the deferred tax assets, considering their expected realization, is R$223,311. Since the income tax and social contribution base arises not only from the profit that may be generated, but also from the existence of nontaxable income, nondeductible expenses, tax incentives and other variables, there is no immediate correlation between BM&FBOVESPA net income and the income subject to income tax and social contribution. Therefore, the expected use of tax assets should not be considered as the only indicator of future income of BM&FBOVESPA. The balance of goodwill that is deductible for income tax and social contribution purposes amounts to R$1,565,336 at December 31, 2016 (R$3,156,980 at December 31, 2015). The realization of the deferred tax liabilities will occur as the difference between the tax base of goodwill and its carrying amount is reversed, that is, when the carrying amount of the asset is either reduced or settled. c) Reconciliation of income tax and social contribution expense Reconciliation of the income tax and social contribution amounts recorded in P&L (Company and consolidated) and their respective amounts at statutory rates is as under: BM&FBOVESPA Consolidated 2016 2015 2016 2015 Income before income tax and social contribution 1,239,467 2,800,221 1,246,570 2,807,222 Income tax and social contribution before additions and exclusions computed at the statutory rate of 34% (421,419) (952,075) (423,834) (954,455) Additions: 319,966 (44,119) 317,490 (41,774) Stock option plan and stock grant plan (347) (94) (347) (94) Nondeductible expenses permanent 1,741 (14,056) (735) (11,711) Dividends received abroad (13,876) (29,860) (13,876) (29,860) IRPJ impairment – CME (Note 4 (c)) (144,674) (144,674) Recognition of deferred tax credit (Note 4(c)) (49,951) (49,951) Reversal of deferred tax 527,077 527,077 Income (loss) abroad (4) (109) (4) (109) Exclusions: 308,411 398,541 306,000 392,795 Equity pickup 2,411 52,070 46,324 Interest on equity 306,000 346,471 306,000 346,471 Other (162) (330) (162) (330) Income tax and social contribution 206,796 (597,983) 199,494 (603,764) Effective rate -16.68% 21.35% -16.00% 21,51% d) Taxes recoverable and prepaid Taxes recoverable and prepaid are as follows: BM&FBOVESPA Consolidated Description 2016 2015 2016 2015 IRRF Financial investments current year 146,828 66,010 146,828 66,010 IRPJ and CSLL tax losses prior years 22,749 39,987 22,749 39,987 Recoverable taxes paid abroad (2,352) 61,131 (2,352) 61,131 PIS/COFINS recoverable 1,541 1,618 1,541 1,619 Other taxes 10,787 6,261 10,928 6,264 Total 179,553 175,007 179,694 175,011 40 Notes to the Financial Statements 20.

Other information a) BM&FBOVESPA seeks advice from insurance brokers to ensure that it has a sufficient level of insurance cover for its size and operations. The maximum insurance coverage taken out at December 31, 2016, according to insurance policies, is as follows: Maximum Insurance line indemnity Amounts at risk, property damages, buildings and equipment 223,810 Civil liability 309,000 Works of art 16,133 b) Associação Profissionalizante BM&FBOVESPA (APBM&FBOVESPA) is a not-for-profit entity engaged in promoting educational, social welfare and sports activities. The sports-related initiatives included offering support to the BM&FBOVESPA Athletics Club and sponsorship to athletes (these activities were incorporated by specific association, known as Clube de Atletismo BM&FBOVESPA in July 2013). APBM&FBOVESPA is supported by the BM&FBOVESPA Institute, a not-for-profit association that has BM&FBOVESPA as its founding member. APBM&FBOVESPA figures as a defendant in legal and administrative proceedings involving tax matters, classified as probable loss, most of which are related to challenges by Brazilian IRS about social security contributions allegedly owed by APBM&FBOVESPA on payments made to third parties and on sponsorships to athletes of the BM&FBOVESPA Athletics Club. If the outcome of these proceedings is not favorable to APBM&FBOVESPA, BM&FBOVESPA may have to provide funds to maintain the activities of such club. The amount involved in the aforementioned proceedings at December 31, 2016 totals R$20,518 (R$18,912 at December 31, 2015). 25. Subsequent events As disclosed in the Notice to the Market dated January 26, 2017, BM&FBOVESPA acquired 8.59% equity interest in the Lima Stock Exchange (BVL), in an investment of approximately R$49 million. 43 Notes to the Financial Statements Independent Auditor’ Report 44 Independent Auditors’ Report To the Board of Directors and shareholders of BM&FBOVESPA S.A. – Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros São Paulo – SP Opinion We have audited the individual and consolidated financial statements of BM&FBOVESPA S.A. Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros (“Company”), identified as BM&FBOVESPA and Consolidated, respectively, which comprise the balance sheet as at December 31, 2016, and the related statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting practices and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the individual and consolidated financial position of BM&FBOVESPA S.A. Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros as at December 31, 2016, its individual and consolidated financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Brazilian and international standards on auditing. In accordance with such standards, our responsibilities are described in section “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the individual and consolidated financial statements”. We are independent of the Company and its subsidiaries, in accordance with the relevant ethical principles set forth in the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants and in the professional standards issued by Brazil’s Association of State Boards of Accountancy (CFC), and we comply with the other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these standards. We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the financial statements taken as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter, including any commentary on the findings or outcome of our procedures, is provided in that context. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the individual and consolidated financial statements” section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements. 1. Technology environment Due to the volume of transactions and the fact that the operations of BM&FBOVESPA are highly dependent on the proper operatio n of the technology structure and its systems, in addition to the complexity involved with its trading, compensation and settlement platforms due to the nature of its business, we consider the technology environment one of the key audit matters. How our audit addressed this matter Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of the IT General Controls (“I TGC”) implemented by the Company relating to the IT applications considered relevant to the audit process. The ITGC evaluation included audit procedures on the logical access, manage change and other ITGC. In relation to the logical access, for a sample of transactions, we evaluated the adequacy of new user authorization and concession processes, the timely revocation rights to improper users such as former employees or transferred ones, and periodic review of user privileges. In addition, we evaluated the password and general system security settings, and limitations of physical access to computer hardware. We have evaluated the manage change process, including authorization and approval by Management of BM&FBOVESPA for the changes to the systems. We have also evaluated the IT operations, focusing on the data backup policy and timely resolution of IT problems or incidents. We have identified the key application or IT dependent controls in the processes considered significant to the financial statements, and for a sample of transactions, we carried out tests focusing on their design and operational effectiveness. In addition, we have evaluated whether guidelines of the business continuity plan were adherent to market standards and if incidents reported throughout the year were addressed to the Business Continuity Committee. We involved of our IT professionals in the performance of these procedures. Our testing of the design and operation of the IT General Controls and on the application controls considered relevant to the audit process provided a basis for us to plan the nature, timing and extend of our detailed audit procedures. 45 Independent Auditors’ Report 2. Role of central counterparty clearinghouse BM&FBOVESPA is a multi-asset and multi-market exchange vertically integrated, in which model it acts as the sole responsible for all the phases of the trading and post-trading activities. Accordingly, the Company acts as central depositary, clearinghouse and settlement system, and central counterparty (CCP). In the role of central counterparty, BM&FBOVESPA acts as the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer for settlement purposes. This requires the Company to establish mechanisms to estimate and call margin from participants to cover any defaults. At December 31, 2016, BM&FBOVESPA has R$ 267 billion in guarantees deposited by the market participants, as described in Note 17. We consider this a key audit matter given the amounts involved and its role as a financial market infrastructure (FMI). How our audit addressed this matter Our audit procedures included, among others, understanding the clearinghouses activities, focusing on the Risk Modelling, Risk of Central Counterparty, Collateral Management and Pricing. In these processes, we evaluated the organizational and governance structure, strategy definitions, limits, policies and measurement methodologies. We also identified and evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls related to pricing, calculation and margin call. Considering the methodology used and disclosed by BM&FBOVESPA, we reperformedan independent calculation of the margin call required in a given scenario and period, and recalculated the collateral allocation. We have evaluated the reconciliation of the information in the notes to the financial statements with the reports from the operating systems at December 31, 2016, in addition to checking the custodian reports for a sample of assets. We involved our risk professionals in the performance of these procedures. The results of our evaluation of the guarantees deposited by the market participants were consistent with Management’s assessment and disclosures in the Note 17 to the financial statements. The results of our procedures were considered in reaching the opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. 3. Bovespa goodwill impairment assessment The Company has R$ 14.4 billion on its balance sheet related to goodwill generated on the acquisition of BovespaHolding. We c onsider this to be a key audit matter due to the relevance of the carrying amount, and because the impairment test of the asset is complex and involves a high degree of judgment by Management in determining the assumptions on the future performance of the cash-generating unit (CGU), as described in Note 9. How our audit addressed this matter Our audit procedures included, among others, the evaluation of the methodology and models used by Management in assessing goodwill, including the definition of the assumptions to support cash flow projections considered in the impairment tests. We have also compared Management’s accuracy applied in prior years’ projections in relation to the actual performance of BM&FBOVESPA. We performed an independent calculation of the discount rate, using our assumptions such as on the market premium, beta of similar companies and country risk, among others. We involved our valuation professionals in this evaluation. We have evaluated Management assertion on prior projections in parallel with the performance of BM&FBOVESPA. We analyzed the behavior of those assumptions in comparison with stress scenarios, in order to anticipate sensitivities of the model. The results of our evaluation on the goodwill impairment testing were consistent with Management assessment. The results of our procedures were considered in reaching the opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. In addition, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made by Management of BM&FBOVESPA of the key assumptions used in the impairment test of goodwill in the Note 9 to the financial statements. 4. Provision for tax, civil and labor claims As described in Note 14, BM&FBOVESPA and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal and administrative proceedings involving labor, tax and civil matters arising from the ordinary course of its business. Attributing a loss probability to processes involves a high degree of judgement by the legal advisor sponsoring the defense of matter and by Management of BM&FBOVESPA, including in the measurement of an eventual cash disbursement. In this process, aspects such as the existence of jurisprudence for the dispute and/or the recurrence of the claims are taken into consideration. In this context and considering the amounts involved, we consider the provision for tax, civil, and labor claims as a key audit matter. How our audit addressed this matter Our audit procedures included, among others, obtaining legal letters directly from the Company’s legal advisors and crosschecking their classification of the likelihood of loss and attributed amounts, with the Company’s controls and accounting records. For the most relevant lawsuits, we tested the calculation of the amounts recorded and its disclosure and evaluated the expectation of the prognoses in relation to the jurisprudence and well-known legal theses. We involved our tax professionals in the performance of these procedures. We also analyzed communications received from supervisory bodies related to lawsuits, notices and disputes to which the Compa ny is party of, and the sufficiency of the disclosures made in relation to issues arising from contingencies and provisions recorded. The results of our evaluation of the Company’s provision for tax, civil and labor claims were consistent with management’s assessment. The results of our procedures were considered in reaching the opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures made by Management of BM&FBOVESPA on the provision for tax, civil and legal claims in Note 14 to the financial statements. 46 Independent Auditors’ Report 5. Disposal of investment in CME Group As described in Note 4, in order to obtain funds to meet the proposed business combination with CETIP S.A. -MercadosOrganizados, on April 13, 2016 the Company sold its stake at CME Group. The amounts involved in this transaction and the effects on the Company’s financial position and on the statement of income were significant, reason why we consider this one of the key audit matters for the year. How our audit addressed this matter Our audit procedures included, among others, testing of the financial settlement of the transaction, the recalculation of the foreign exchange effect on the investment, the derecognitionaccounting and the recognition of the realized results. We involved our technical accounting professionals in the evaluation of the adequacy of the main accounting effects arising from the discontinuance of the cash flow hedge accounting structure. The results of our evaluation of the accounting for the disposal of the stocks of CME Group are consistent with management’s assessment. The results of our procedures were considered in reaching the opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole. We have also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures on the disposal of investment in CME Group made by Management of BM&FBOVESPA in the Note 4 to the financial statements. Other matters Statements of value added The individual and consolidated Statements of Value Added (SVA) for the year ended December 31, 2016, prepared under the responsibility of Company management and presented as supplementary information for IFRS purpose, were submitted to the same audit procedures performed in accordance with the audit of the Company’s financial statements. For the purposes of forming our opinion, we evaluated whether these statements are reconciled with the financial statements and accounting records, as applicable, and whether their layout and content are in accordance with the criteria set forth in Accounting Pronouncement CPC 09 -Statement of Value Added. In our opinion, these statements of value added were prepared fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set forth in Accounting Pronouncement CPC 09 and are consistent with the individual and consolidated financial statements taken as a whole. Other information accompanying the individual and consolidated financial statements and the auditor’s report Company’s management is responsible for such other information, which includes the Management Report. Our opinion on the individual and consolidated financial statements does not cover the Management Report and we do not express any form of audit conclusion thereon. In connection with the audit of the individual and consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management Report and, in doing so, to consider whether this report is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise whether this report appears to be materially misstated. If based on our work we conclude that there is material misstatement in the Management Report, we are required to report this fact. We have nothing to report on this matter. Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the individual and consolidated financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the individual financial statements in accordance with accounting practices adopted in Brazil and of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of these financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the individual and consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process and include Management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the individual and consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the individual and consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Brazilian and international standards on auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they can be reasonably expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of the audit conducted in accordance with the Brazilian and international standards on auditing, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: ► Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the individual and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. ► Obtain an understanding of the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ internal controls. 47 Independent Auditors’ Report ► Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management. ► Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the individual and consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and its subsidiaries to cease to continue as a going concern. ► Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of financial statements, including disclosures and whether the individual and consolidated financial statements represent the corresponding transactions and events consistently with the appropriate disclosure objective. ► Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or business activities of the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group’s audit and, consequently, for the audit opinion. We communicate with those in charge of governance regarding, among others, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those in charge of governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements, including the applicable independence requirements, and communicate any relationships or matters that could significantly affect our independence, including, when applicable, respective safeguards. Based on the matters that were communicated to those in charge of governance, we determine those that were considered most significant in the audit of the financial statements for the current year and, therefore, that represent the significant audit issues. We describe these matters in our audit report, unless the law or regulation has forbidden public disclosure of the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine that the matter should not be reported in our report because the adverse consequences from such disclosure may, within a reasonable perspective, overcome the benefits from communication to the public interest.
