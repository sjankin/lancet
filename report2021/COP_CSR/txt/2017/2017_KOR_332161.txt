In addition, KORAIL’s safety management system was been reinforced still more, accident and defect has decreased more than in the past and it is still decreasing. However, as accidents great and small which can threaten the life of people and become the social issue often take place, it is true that the people’s anxiety has not been relieved perfectly. As both KORAIL and the parties have great damage in case an accident take place, management’s detailed safety plan and implementation and labor’s active participation and practice are required. Thus, I look forward to the happy KORAIL without any railroad accident and the world best KORAIL loved by the people. 29 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Safety-First Management KORAIL regards safety as its top priority mission, and emphasizes with CEO as the center that ‘Safety is the absolute value as well as the core value which cannot be traded for anything.’ Therefore, we have established the safety system putting the people’s safety first and reinforced a whole range of safety management cooperation system. Performance Management System on the Safety Management Organizational System of the Railroad Safety Management Purpose of establishment Contributing to development of the railroad industry and the national economy Chief executive in overall charge of safety management (CEO) by enhancing the professionalism and efficiency of the railroad operation Executive Director of the Safety Innovation Headquarters Business goal Safer KORAIL!

We have standardized the emergency response manual so as to be able to apply at the site immediately at times of crisis, and providing for emergencies by assigning mission to each employee and implementing training repeatedly. In 2015, we implemented totally 4,697 times of emergency response trainings and carried out the expediency education to 8,291 employees. In reality, we carried out the expediency to 620 urgent patients in the stations or trains. In the situation that the overturning accident of a tower crane in the vicinity of Bupyeong Station and the conflagration accident at the Uijeongbu Station could get serious, we took steps promptly and, thus, could save lives and prevent the full-scale accident. Having achieved recognition of such Citizens’ Participation Training prepared for the Subway Accident endeavor, KORAIL was awarded ‘the Citation of the Excellent Institute for Establishing the Emergency Preparedness (Prime Minister)’ and ‘Citation of the Excellent Institute for the Disaster and Safety Training of Korea (Minister of Public Safety and Security)’ in 2015. Response for Preventing Spread of MERS When MERS was rampant throughout the country, rendering all the people frightened, KORAIL exerted the corporation-wide effort in order to prevent its spread. For two months from June to July, we operated the Day-and-Night Emergency Operation Measures for Preventing Spread of MERS Facility headed by CEO and maintained the close cooperation system for 24 hours a day with the Government and related agencies. We frequently fumigated and cleaned the station buildings and vehicles, and furnished 154,199 pieces of equipment for preventing spread of MERS, including installation of thermo-vision cameras at major stations. As for the passenger suspicious of MERS, we provided them with masks, checked their body temperature, let them get off the train at the nearby station and guided them to the public health center. In addition, by issuing the white paper on response to MERS, we enhanced understanding and recognition on response of all the people to MERS. 30 KORAIL Sustainability Report 2015 Management Focused on Safety based on Cooperation and Communication Safety Budget (Excluding the Vehicle Purchase Expense) Based on CEO’s strong will for the safety management, KORAIL has increased the amount invested for safety by KRW164.3 (Unit : KRW100 million) billion vis-à-vis the previous year, while pursuing the “safety by 100%”. We solve the challenges on safety intensively by implementing the management meeting focused on safety regularly, and the management including CEO share the vision of the 5,830 safety management and implement the communication activities, crisscrossing the entire country. We have unified the dispersed 4,187 safety education departments into the Human Safety Center, and enhanced the safety consciousness of all the employees 3,240 through operation of ‘the day of safety inspection’ and development of education program for fostering safety · ownership. We implemented the joint inspection 5 times a year by carrying forward ‘the joint safety control of constructions adjacent to the railroad track’, including Korea Transportation Safety Authority, Korea Rail Network Authority et al, and discovered and solved 47 2013 2014 2015 improvements. In addition, we have prepared for ‘the Safety Innovation Measure of the Railroad’ with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport for realizing the Railroad Safety 3.0 Era, and established the business cooperation system with the safety representative institutes of road, railroad and aviation. Removing the blind Spot for Safety In order to drastically reduce the train accident · breakdown felt by the people vividly, KORAIL has prepared for the Safety Operation Service (Defect and Accident ratio) (Unit : occurrence number/million km) comprehensive management plan by introducing the knowhow and scientific analysis technique for the railroad operation. 2,359 Especially, for the new route of Honam High-speed Railroad, we have a perfect operational system by analyzing the risk factors 1.942 comprehensively at the initial stage of the opening and establishing and implementing the proactive safety approach, such as 1.757 competency reinforcement of the operating personnel, reinforcement of the safety management for the new facilities, establishment of emergency preparedness, establishment of the safety investigation system et al. By operating the Operational Preparation Division with the Executive Vice President as the head and Early Stabilization Task Force, we realized the early 2013 2014 2015 stabilization, reducing the number of accident and defect by 96% vis-à-vis the opening of Gyeongbu High-Speed Railroad in 2004. In addition, we discovered and improved the goal of the blind spot for safety prone to neglect at the site, and reinforced the prior elimination of the risk factors from the stage of planning and design by improving the safety verification system. Especially, by verifying safety after checking the site for the high-risk projects and implementing the planning and investigation for the accident of high risk and repetitiveness, we strive for grasping the root cause and preventing recurrences. As a result, we have accomplished an all-time high performance in the safety operation service ratio (defect and accident ratio) of which the level is 38.4% of that at the time of foundation of the Corporation. Installing the Image-recoder in the Driver’s Cabin of the Train KORAIL has been continuously improving the safety system and facilities for preventing human errors. In 2015, we installed the Image recorder in the Engine Locomotive image recorder in the driver’s cabin of the train for the first time in Korea for identifying the cause clearly when the accident occurs and preventing recurrences. By drawing the labor-management agreement with a ceaseless effort for forming the bond Exclusive program of employees’ sympathy, we have revised the Railroad Safety Act to make it obligatory to install the image recorder in all the railroad vehicles, and we plan to complete installation until the end of 2016. Preventing the Human Error through Improvement of the Safety System and Facilities In order to prevent the human error, KORAIL has expanded the number of employees subject to prohibition of using the mobile Removal or backup of Reading device / SSD USB et al the storage media phone while on duty and reinforced the safety-related company regulations and guideline, such as development of app blocking the smart phone. In addition, by installing the triple supplementation facility of preventing employees’ careless handling in Transfer advance, protecting the system in spite of the mistake, and blocking expansion of the 2nd accident when accident occurs, we have prevented human errors caused by employees’ careless handling. Owing to these efforts, the occurrence number of the human error in 2015 was 0.611/million km, reduced by 12.8% vis-à-vis the previous year. Occurrence number of the human error (Unit : occurrence number/million km) Triple Supplementation Facility of Preventing the Human Error 0.781 0.701 Preventing in advance Installing the suspended signal apparatus for securing the signal legibility of the signal apparatus likely to error (51 places) Defense system Changing the Automatic Train Stop (ATS) system for preventing the engineer’s human error (340 places) 0.611 Doubling the power source equipment in the cab for emergencies (509 units) and installing the radio-controlled train protection Blocking the expansion device for constant local control chamber (60 places) 2013 2014 2015 31 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Settlement of the Safety Culture Promoting the Safety Industry Exposition Fostering People-Participating Safety Culture KORAIL has conducted various activities for enhancing the people’s safety consciousness. By selecting 820 Railroad Safety Keepers, we have educated them on the railroad safety and cases of accident, method of using various train safety devices et al. We developed ‘the safety culture campaign’ in our lives at major station plazas, crosswalks et al once a month, and set up the one-company-one-school sisterhood relationship with the schools adjacent to the control station and the track and then implemented the safety education. In addition, by participating in ‘the K-SAFETY EXPO 2015’ visited by daily average of 4,800 persons, we introduced and promoted the railroad safety technology. As a result of these efforts, we were uniquely awarded ‘the 2015 Korea Safety Technology Grand Prize (Minister of Public Safety and Security)’ among public institutions. Imbuing the Employees’ Safety Consciousness In order to imbue the employees’ safety consciousness, KORAIL has been encouraging them to report various hazards around Safety Culture Campaign our livelihood using ‘the Safety Sinmungo (a website where citizens voice their complaints) of the Ministry of Public Safety and Security’, and established ‘the KORAIL Safety Sinmungo’ and invested it with the role of ‘the Safety Keeper’ reporting the risk factors while all the employees work or use the train. In addition, we run an idea contest for enhancing the safety culture in the workplace and put such ideas into practical use. Also, by implementing the special lecture by the parties of grave accidents 6 times, we have spread the will of the accident prevention. As for employees’ safety culture level, we measure quantitatively measure the 36 items out of 8 indicators including safety consciousness, effectiveness of safety norms and systems, job safety, safety activities et al, every two years and reflect them in the safety management, policy making et al. The level of the safety culture in 2015 was 85.1 points, increased by 7.7% vi-a-vis 2013. Fostering the Safe and Healthy Workplace KORAIL strives for fostering the safe and healthy workplace for happy life of the executives and staff members. While Realization Rate of the Safe Workplace (Unit : %) maintaining the certification of the Safety and Health Management System for all 22 departments, we have expanded the labormanagement cooperation for diffusing and developing the railroad safety culture by holding labor-management joint workshop, organizing the labor-management joint committee et al. By forming the consultative body of industrial safety and health 2013 0.304 together in conjunction with subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors et al, we have established the safety management system and performed the customized support for the safety management, such as provision of risk information, consulting, education et al. 2014 0.273 Owing to the active effort for fostering the safe workplace, the industrial disaster victims were decreased to 69 persons in 2015 from 76 person in 2014, and we were awarded the grand prize in the Service Sector of the 2015 Excellent Cases of Safety and 2015 0.250 Health Activities. * Number of the disaster victim / number of the employee Supporting the Systematic Psychological Counseling KORAIL is supporting the systematic psychological counseling for relieving employees’ mental stress. After installing the Human Safety Center in 2013, we have remedied employees’ anxieties about job stress, home problems et al considerably through continuous consultations, and supported the employees to solve their worries caused by home problems through programs, such as ‘the camp where both parents and children get together’, ‘Knowing our kid’s career and aptitude’ et al. Especially, by Record of the Customized Support to the Consultative Body of concluding the business agreement with 36 psychological counselling centers all over the country, we support the employees to the Occupational Safety and Health get counselling at any time in the vicinity of their residence Meetings 1.073 times Overview of Supporting the Psychological Counselling Consulting & benchmarking 41 times July~December, 2013 2014 2015 (146 persons) (276 persons) (210 persons) Support of education and instructors 652 times •Implementing the visiting counseling •Opening the lecture regarding the •Installing the Human Safety Center service psychological counselling •Employing experts of the psychological •Resolving the avoidance phenomenon •Consultation by visiting the department counselling (promotion, education et al) where accident occurred Provision of the risk information 700 times 32 KORAIL Sustainability Report 2015 Enhancing Safety of the Railroad Vehicles Accomplishing an All-Time low Rate of Vehicle Breakdown KORAIL has recorded an all-time low rate of vehicle breakdown through the fundamental preventive maintenance for enhancing Vehicle Breakdown Ratio (Unit : number of case / million km of vehicle running) the safety of the railroad vehicles. We have intensively improved the parts vulnerable to breakdown through the goal of ‘TOP 10 for Prevention of Breakdown’, eradicated the breakdown caused by the human error through improvement of the vehicle 0.098 0.092 system, and secured the quality of the newly manufactured vehicles through the reliability verification of such vehicles. In 0.063 addition, we have reinforced the management through proper-time disuse of the decrepit vehicles and analysis of the breakdown and strengthened the system to obligatorily implement the precise safety diagnosis for the 20-years-old vehicles after manufacturing and registration. Owing to these efforts, the vehicle breakdown rate in 2015 recorded an all-time-low 2013 2014 2015 0.063item/million km, which is very low level of one breakdown per 15.788 million km. Early Stabilization of Honam High-speed Train Service Initial Breakdown of Honam High-speed Vehicles As we improved the technical faults of KTX-Sancheon and reflected them (401 items) in the Honam High-speed vehicles, only 8 (number of case) initial breakdowns for the Honam High-express vehicles took place, drastically decreased compared with KTX-Sancheon (28 items) opened in 2010. In addition, we strengthen the initial response by operating ‘the Task Force for the early stabilization KTX-Sancheon Honam High-speed vehicle measure of the Honam High-speed Railroad’, and carried forward not to reach a deadlock for maintenance and stabilization of 28 the Honam High-speed vehicles by expanding the technical training and workforce for the maintenance of the Honam High8 speed vehicles. 2010 2015 Securing Quality of the Railroad Vehicles and Enhancing the Technological Prowess KORAIL is improving the technological problems at the manufacturing stage of the vehicles through organization and operation of ‘the Vehicle Manufacturing and Management Team’, and has established the Task Force for stably introducing the distributedtraction-type high-speed vehicle (EMU-250) which will be developed for the first time in Korea. In addition, through the technological monitoring for the railroad vehicles by the engineering department, we have drawn 91 items for improvement and reflected them in the design and manufacturing of new vehicles, and are striving for enhancing the technological prowess of the railroad vehicles through continuous technological education and research and development. Enhancing the Facility Safety Realizing zero of the Track Breakdown or defect Number of track breakdown and defect For the first time since its foundation, KORAIL has realized zero of the track breakdown or defect. We implemented the safety (Unit : number of case) management measure of summer and winter period one month earlier prepared for the seasonal vulnerability of the railroad, and managed intensively the factors incurring defects, such as rail flaw caused by accumulated fatigue. By analyzing the 5 accidents and defects for the last 10 years, we have improved the safety management for the priority control target facilities, and 3 strengthened the safety management for the unsafe facilities beside the tracks, like operating the Safety Check Division exclusively in charge of constructions adjacent to the running track and revising the safety management manual. The 0 breakdowns or defects have been decreasing continuously since 2007 (24 cases), and not a single breakdown or defect took place in 2015. 2013 2014 2015 Preventing the Daily-Life-Oriented Safety Accident by Strengthening the Safety Facilities Installation Ratio of the Safety Door at the Platform We have solidified the safety facilities of the railroad for preventing the safety accident of the passengers using the train. We are (Unit : %) continuously installing the safety foothold and the safety door of the platform in order to prevent foot-falling and falling 44 accidents between the platform and the train. Out of the targeted 232 stations, we have installed them at 93 stations, and plan 36 to complete installation at all the targeted stations by 2017. In addition, we protect the transportation vulnerable by installing 31 the stair slip-resistance facility and the handrail, and install the crash barrier in order to block any jaywalking of the track. Owing to this effort, there were 4 falling and overturning accidents in the platform in 2015, and 14 jaywalking accident beside the track, decreased by 60% and 17.6% respectively vis-à-vis the previous year. 2013 2014 2015 33 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Establishing the Initial Response Measure Putting Lifesaving First While setting up safety as the top priority and core value, KORAIL is constantly striving for establishing the absolute safety system.

KORAIL is striving for the Joint Chairman establishment of the labor-management relation observing the relevant legislation and principle and the active cooperation and (CEO, Head of the Union) communication between labor and management. In order to vitalize the labor-management communication, we have launched the Labor-Management Joint Committee which is the first standing organization for communication between labor and Railroad Safety Subcommittee management in KORAIL. CEO and Head of the union become the joint chairman respectively of the Labor-Management Joint (Executive vice president, union’s first deputy chief) Committee, and the management and the executive of the labor union jointly fill the position of the subcommittee director in the railroad safety subcommittee, the system innovation subcommittee, and the logistics subcommittee. By holding the System Innovation Subcommittee committee meetings totally 26 times in 2015, we resolved the conflicts in advance by discussing the core challenges between (Head of Human Resources Management Office, labor and management, such as enhancement of the railroad safety, system innovation et al, and the directions of management. Secretary General) In addition, by establishing ‘the Hope Railroad Foundation’ which is the first labor-management joint foundation of the public sector and performing the social contribution activities altogether, we have enhanced the labor-management relation and Logistics Subcommittee reinforced the foundation for realizing the social responsibility. Both CEO and the union head fulfill the position of the joint (Executive Director of the Logistics Headquarters, Head of Policy Office) chairman of the Hope Railroad Foundation respectively, and the executive office is also operated jointly by both the labor and the management. Forming the bond of sympathy through vitalization of communication between labor and management KORAIL has difficulties in communicating and sharing information rapidly due to 673 stations and 243 business places scattered all over the country and diverse patterns of duty, such as shift, alternation, alternate-day et al. In this context, we have Hope Railroad Foundation established the two-way communication channel with the employees, reinforced the communications with the employees through the joint labor-management conference, the labor-management joint committee, various briefing sessions et al, and Joint Chairman smoothly settled significant challenges between labor and management, such as closing of the seniority-based Promotional (CEO, Head of the Union) System, concluding the wage bargaining and collective agreements, introduction of the work sharing program et al. 3 Directors 2 Auditors Endeavor to communicate between labor and management Executive Secretary (Head of the Operation and 60 times 26 times 3 times 5 times Major performance •Closing the seniority-based Communication Department, Joint labor-management Labor-management Labor-management Briefing sessions for the Promotional System meeting joint committee joint workshop labor •Concluding peacefully the wage Policy Director) •Enhancing welfare •Discussing core challenges •Introducing the wage peak •Personnel expenditure and operation of workforce bargaining and collective •Resolving employees’ •Resolving employees’ system •Establishment SR(new HSR operator) and agreement problems difficulties •Railroad safety policy divided accounting •Introducing the work sharing Management Team Planning Team •Operating 3 subcommittees •System innovation and challenges •Sale of the Airport Railroad program 45 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Resolving Challenges through Vitalization of the KORAIL-type Two-Track Communications between labor and management KORAIL-type Two-Track Communication Activities As a large organization lying scattered all over the country, KORAIL has diverse interregional tendencies and there are difficulties KORAIL-type Two-Track Communication Strategy of taking a long time to communicate between labor and management. However, we have overcome the difficulty of the communicative environment in significant decision making with the KORAIL-type Two-Track communications separating the union leaders from the site employees. We ceaselessly asked for negotiations with the union executive and reinforced both official and unofficial dialogues with them, such as labor-management panel discussion, labor-management representative meeting et al, and for the site employees, we formed the bond of sympathy with the employees by such efforts as announcement of CEO’s letter of plea and statement of the management, face-to-face communication activities with all the employees, real-time provision of information and operation of the opinion collection center, employees’ signature collecting movement, the rally calling for agreement between labor and management et al. As a result of such endeavor, we successfully CEO, Head of Union, Negotiation elicited the union executive’s acceptance of the negotiation on the seniority-based promotion and participation in the Union Leaders Team negotiation on the work sharing program.

The seniority-based Promotional System, allowing promotions of the employees automatically if only a certain period passes, incurred problems, such as hampering the productivity of the organization and lowering the individual competitiveness, as well as causing occurrence of imbalance of personnel by rank. Thus, by drawing the final agreement through active development of labor-union discussions, such as 13 times of negotiation request, 25 times of labor-management meeting and panel discussion et al, and active communications, such as face-to-face site communication activities, operation of on-line opinion collection room, conduction of survey et al, we diffused the performance culture and marked a milestone for resolving the imbalance of personnel. Introduction of the Work Sharing Program Both labor and management agreed on the introduction of the wage peak system on October 2015 for creating jobs for youth and taking off for the first year of the second foundation of the Corporation. Both labor and management agreed to reduce the salary of the employees for two years prior to the regular retirement as follows: 1st grade by 100%, 2nd grade by 90%, 3rd~4th grade by 80%, and 5th grade or lower by 60%. With the saved financial resources through such reduction, we plan to create the jobs for about 2,000 youth for two years from 2016. In addition, by utilizing the employees becoming the object of the wage peak system as the personnel of technology transfer and safety, we will reinforce our competitiveness continuously. 46 KORAIL Sustainability Report 2015 The World, sharing dreams and hopes Promise 4.

The mutual growth is also an exit for solving Korea’s social problems getting serious day by day, such as income inequality, employment instability et al. KORAIL has actively taken the initiative in establishing the public transaction orders, expanding market and supporting reinforcement of the technological prowess for SMEs. I expect KORAIL to keep on promoting continuous endeavor for technology development with its affiliates and employment stability and dominating new technologies together with the affiliates, thereby establishing a foothold for leading the world. 49 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Mutual Growth KORAIL is reinforcing cooperation for securing the best competitiveness of the railroad industry together with SMEs.

In this sense, it is the most appropriate method for a balanced development of the national land and the most efficient mode of freight transport beyond national borders. By operating nationwide railroad networks, KORAIL contributes to socioeconomic development of Korea as well as economic development of the country’s provinces. The long-term vision of KORAIL’s railroad operation would be to help Korea rise to the transportation and logistics hub of Northeast Asia. On the Korean Peninsula, railroads will run through the Military Demarcation Line, opening a channel for communication among the Korean people and facilitating economic cooperation between North and South Koreas. Then, this will lay the foundation for Korea’s reunification and make it possible to link with the Trans-China Railroad and the Trans-Siberian Railroad. I expect KORAIL to maintain its R&D efforts until this vision is realized. 61 KORAIL SUSTAINABILITY OVERVIEW The People, dreaming of the world where everyone is happy The World, sharing dreams and hopes The Future, creating the brighter future Appendix Creating the Economic Value Distribution of the economic value * Based on consolidated K-IFRS KORAIL creats the economic value through the railroad transportation business transporting passengers and freight, the tourism Turnover (Unit : KRW 100 million) business, the property development projects, the overseas projects et al.

Fair Operating Practices KORAIL strengthened its supports for SMEs and cooperation for mutual growth by expanding its exclusive unit for mutual growth (Mutual Growth Center) while maintaining anti-corruption policy and systems. To prevent illegal acts from taking place occasionally, we recommend KORAIL to facilitate a reporting channel in which identity of those reporting illegal acts cannot be traced and strengthen penalties for negligence and illegal acts. Consumer Issues Thanks to the creation of the next-generation passenger transport system, increased convenience of online purchase and updates of its mobile application, KORAIL achieved the highest consumer satisfaction level ever.
