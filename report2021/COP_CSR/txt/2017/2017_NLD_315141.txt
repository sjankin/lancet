Statement of continued support from the CEO P a g e 3 of 4 6 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2. Introduction and scope of COP B&S is a leading partner in the wholesale, distribution and retailing of fast moving consumer goods and has its headquarters in the Netherlands. The Company operates in several niche markets including maritime markets, duty-free shops, peace-keeping forces and air and cruise lines. This often means thinking globally but acting locally. We continuously strive to be an enterprising, well-respected and trustworthy organisation that makes a sustainable contribution towards society. In the interests of our stakeholders we further maintain the highest ethical standards in all aspects of our business with high respect to Human Rights and Labour conditions. In accordance with legal regulations, it is the responsibility of our Company to strive continually to apply sustainable practices in order to rank among the leading enterprises in our industry. In this Communication on Progress, we provide an update of the Company’s activities and measurement of outcomes in respect of the 10 UN principles by reflecting on the reporting period February 2016 to January 2017. This report also includes the Company’s profile, mission, vision, DNA, corporate structure, key financial data and other Company data. It gives a broader picture of B&S and its activities. Additionally we incorporated information on Corporate governance and Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the Company’s Risk management. These are all standard elements in our day-to-day business, being regularly reviewed and updated. They are stated in our Annual Reports and based on Company policies, guidelines and procedures. In this “Communication On Progress” we have included our updated Corporate Social Responsibility policy where we show our commitment to the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption by incorporating these principles in our own policy and encourage others to embrace them as well. P a g e 4 of 4 6 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 3. B&S’ strategy 3.1. Strategy The Company’s strategy is based on adding value for both its clients and its suppliers by making their interests converge. We deliver a wide assortment of goods to our clients in markets in which our suppliers are unable to deliver. These niche markets are often remote and difficult to reach, which means clients’ demands cannot easily be met. By balancing the needs of both parties we add value to the chain. Our current position in the market is unique. We combine wholesale activities with the role of a distributor and retailer. This puts us in a perfect position to oversee the entire consumer goods supply chain, from producer to end-consumer. Thanks to our position we are able to make the supply chain more transparent and more efficient. Our main focus is playing an active role in the convergence of the supply chain between wholesalers and retailers, where making use of modern online tools and innovative investments is a key aspect. 3.1.1. Balanced growth Growth is the lifeblood of B&S and the main pillar of its strategy. We firmly believe that growth is based on innovation and quality, fuelled by entering into new markets and by continuously making use of new business opportunities. Growth certainly leads the Company further and energizes the organisation. Balanced growth means the following for B&S:  Organic growth and growth through acquisitions  Innovation  Quality growth  Diversified growth  Profitable growth  Sustainable growth Our balanced growth strategy is based on three basic aspects, the pillars of our organisation.

Management Team C.E. van Esch; Managing Director, B&S Bosman Global J. Smit; Managing Director, B&S Global Transit Center A.R. van der Ster; Managing Director, B&S Köpcke Global M.R. Riegel; Managing Director, B&S Paul Global P. Kruithof; Finance Director, B&S Offices and employees The Company operates from the headquarters in Dordrecht. the Netherlands that comprises 30,000 m2 of logistics facilities. The Company operates another warehouse in Spijkenisse. the Netherlands with 10,000 m2 warehouses. B&S also operates a logistics centre and offices in Kabul, Afghanistan. B&S has always invested in state-of-the-art equipment and materials. The average number of staff employed by the Company during 2016 was 276 (2015:278). Page 11 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 5. Corporate governance B&S B.V. is a private limited liability company established under the laws of the Netherlands. The Company considers the interests of all its stakeholders, from clients and suppliers to staff and shareholders and from financiers to governmental institutions, to be important. The desire to pursue best practices is embedded in the Company’s corporate philosophy and policies. The Company’s governing bodies are aware that the environment is constantly changing as well as of the necessity of having consistent Corporate Governance guidelines that assist them in carrying out their responsibilities. Corporate Governance is about more than compliance with rules and regulations. It is an integral part of how the Group chooses to do business. While our internal control, risk management and audit procedures ensure that proper controls are in place, we also encourage our employees to review their own and each other's activities and outputs. This helps them to make sure they have acted correctly – and confirm that correct decisions have been made – and to challenge each other if they think something is the matter, if something appears unusual or they think there is a better way of doing things. An integral part of Corporate Governance has been assigned to the Internal Audit Department. On behalf of the Board of Directors the Internal Audit Department monitors compliance by analysing and testing critical business processes. The Board of Directors is responsible for the Company’s day-to day affairs, its strategy and the advocacy of the general stakeholders’ interests and is based on the creation of an optimum span of control. Details of the composition of the Board of Directors have been included in this report. A number of centralised corporate departments, (legal affairs, HRM, Internal Audit, M&A, marketing, logistics, ICT and Finance & Control), assist the management at the helm of the Group in making effective steering decisions. As much authority as possible is delegated to the divisions and their business units. Within agreed guidelines the Group’s staff, especially its senior managers, enjoy a high degree of autonomy and responsibility. This philosophy encourages staff to develop as experts in their business. The composition of the Board of Directors does not reflect a situation as described in article 276 Book 2 Dutch Civil Code. Control over the Company through the Board of Directors is to a large extent influenced by the ultimate shareholders. A balanced situation as outlined in the above mentioned article would only be realised if and when vacancies may become available and only to the extent that compliant candidates are of equal quality. Page 12 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 6. Corporate Social Responsibility The importance of operating a sustainable business lies in the unique concept of our Company, which is down to the drive and spirit of our people, the Company structure, and the relationship we have with our stakeholders. In the new economy it’s all about being the most adaptable business rather than the fittest. For us, sustainable business means putting long-term vision ahead of short-term profits. This long-term vision, which is embedded in our DNA, goes further than any bottom line result; it is adding value in everything we do. It’s about our relationship with clients and suppliers, the wellbeing and development of our employees, as well as our relationship with the environment. Developing sustainable relationships with our employees and clients is already one of our core values, but the role of sustainability will take on even greater importance within the business as we go forward. This is one of the reasons why we joined the largest network for Corporate Social Responsibility: the UN Global Compact. The Company truly believes that sustainability is of great importance for corporate culture to increase long-term success and to minimize risks for future development. This long-term success can only be accomplished if we create added value while acting responsibly towards communities we are part of and the environment. This report discusses the three CSR pillars environmental responsibility, economic enhancement and social engagement. 6.1. Environmental responsibility We continually improve our environmental performance by applying sustainable principles along our entire value chain. We recognise the importance of protecting the natural environment, and work to reduce our CO2 emissions and mitigate any negative effects from our activities, while ensuring the health and safety of our people. In 2016, we made the decision to invest in an ultramodern warehouse, that will be constructed by our landlord next to our current warehouse in Dordrecht. Keeping in mind our environmental responsibility, the new high-tech warehouse will be equipped with the most up-to-date and efficient storage systems, integrated with the newest climate controlling technology, robot storage systems and warehouse automation which will even further empower our environmental performance. 6.2. Economic enhancement Following a number of regulatory changes in 2016, we critically reviewed our business portfolio. We focused on developing the quality rather than the quantity of our earnings. That focus involved cutting parts of the business that made a marginal contribution to our bottom line result. Our clients expect and demand that we adhere to the most extensive and continuously stricter compliance standards. In 2016 we introduced stricter customer and supplier acceptance procedures, and set quality standards that suppliers and customers need to comply with. Page 13 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Implementing these procedures enables us to ensure that compliance is safeguarded along our entire supply chain, benefiting our customers, suppliers, the company and our staff. We follow strict internal policies and guidelines regarding business agreements with new clients, as well as the setting of payment terms and credit risk management. 6.3. Social engagement The Company strongly believes we have a responsibility in giving back to communities we work in to build a lasting social value. We strive to involve ourselves in social initiatives which are meaningful to our business by improving people’s lives through community and societal participation. In 2016 we have intensified our initiatives with local employment departments to establish programs to train and hire people with a distance to the labour market. Our employees’ performance, well-being and knowledge have a significant impact on our company’s success. The Company considers education to be an important factor for personal development. We continue to develop our management team by focusing on our internal talent, and believe that the growth of the company means there is enough potential for everyone within the company to follow their own career path. In 2016 we have expanded our intensive training programmes throughout the Company based on which we offer talented graduates to follow a range of education courses during their career, including management studies, logistics training, and language coaching. Page 14 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 7. Risk management and internal control Risk management and internal control form an integral part of the Company’s day-to-day business operations. The corporate strategy is focussed on seizing entrepreneurial opportunities while, at the same time, managing risks effectively. The corporate policy is to safeguard the Company’s continuity while maintaining a balance between risk appetite and financial returns. The Board of Directors, supported by senior managers within the organisation, is responsible for identifying, prioritising and mitigating risk and maintaining a robust risk management system and internal control mechanisms The Company’s risk profile is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors and is discussed with the Supervisory Board. Although the Company’s risk profile did not change fundamentally, the risk review in 2016 led to adjustments to the risk management framework, which is now classified in accordance with the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework. As a result the Company’s risk profile has been divided into the following risk categories:  Strategic risks  Operational risks  Legal compliance risks  Financial and reporting risks Strategic risks are the risks that can prevent the Company from achieving its strategic ambition. Operational risks are closely related to the business operations. Legal compliance risks relate to risks arising from changes in regulations and applicable laws. The Financial and reporting risks are limited to financial matters and transparent reporting, both internally and externally. Particular risks can fall into more than one category or have overlapping determinants. This risk management framework is firmly embedded in the Company guidelines and policies and supports the achievement of the Company’s strategic, operational and financial targets while complying with legislation and regulations. The Company’s risk opinion is determined by the likelihood of the risk occurring and its potential impact on the achievement of the Company’s strategy. The following table shows a brief summary of the main risks that the Board of Directors has identified. These risks and the measures that have been taken to mitigate these risks are described in more detail on the subsequent pages. Although the Board of Directors believes that the risks and uncertainties described in the next few pages are the most material risks, other risks might be present. When deciding whether the Company will be exposed to certain risks these risks are valued on the basis of the balance of Page 15 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress the potential risks and returns. The Company then assesses the extent to which these risks are mitigated by current internal control procedures and whether additional internal controls procedures are necessary. The Company only accepts risks that, based on this assessment, are well balanced and, to an acceptable extent, controllable. All the risks mentioned in the Risks management summary are risks the Company is prepared to take. 7.1. Sensitivity analysis and benchmarking Throughout the year the Board of Directors, senior managers, financial controllers, internal compliance officers and risk officers carry out self-assessment tests. These are combined with various external audits in relation to the defined key risk areas. For several risks the Company is used to go through various sorts of sensitivity analysis. Carrying out a sensitivity analysis of key risk areas enables the approximate exposure in the event that certain specified parameters were to be met under a specific set of assumptions to be estimated. The range of changes chosen reflects the changes which, in the Company’s view, are reasonably possible during a one-year period. The scenarios that are tested relate to, but are not limited to, rapid changes in market conditions, changes in gross margin, increases in interest rate and currency fluctuations. The effects on the Company’s net result, cash flow and equity are analysed. These scenarios do not reflect any action the Board of Directors could take which might mitigate the effects. In 2016, although the outcome of these tests revealed some negative effects on the Company’s overall financial standing, they also showed that the Company remains within its long-term targets and financial guidance. This demonstrates that the Company has adequate buffers for dealing with substantial effects of potential risks. As a Company that holds sizeable levels of inventory with a certain volatility during the year, we also carry out critical stress tests on the theoretical financial boundaries of inventory positions versus equity, covenants and working capital financing. In addition to the sensitive analysis the Company also applies benchmark assignments within the organisation. A benchmark analysis involves comparing various metrics with the averages of peer organisations and best practices for individual business segments within the Group. These benchmark analyses are supporting strategic decisions, but also provide forward-looking insight. The results of control self-assessments, audits, scenarios and benchmarks are reported frequently and discussed with and between the Board of Directors and the Supervisory Board. The outcome is further used for internal staff training and for improving the risk awareness within the organization amongst staff members.

Human Rights principles  Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and  Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 8.1. Overview The B&S organisation is mainly based in the Netherlands and the majority of the business is directed from the Netherlands, where the key offices and staff are situated. Furthermore, the Company is active in sizeable operations in Afghanistan and Mali. B&S is a modern and professional company that adheres to national laws, rules and regulations in the countries in which it is active. All employees are offered the best possible conditions. As a minimum these conditions exceed the ILO labour conventions. Our Company respects human rights and always treats people with respect and dignity. Our stakeholders respect us because we keep our promises, and act with honesty and integrity by conducting ethical and professional business at all times. We have operations in many countries and goods are transported worldwide and therefore respecting human rights is a core part of how we conduct our daily business. We are convinced that the human rights of every individual should be respected, no matter where we do business. In Afghanistan where we also operate a warehouse, the national Human Rights conditions may be found different from what we are used to in Europe. With the standard Human Rights conditions that the Company is accustomed to and following our own beliefs and standards, we apply Human Rights similarly in Afghanistan. This is applicable for our own staff as well as for all other stakeholders in and around the Company. 8.2. Assessment, policy and goals We emphasize our support to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The protection of the Human Rights is derived from group ethics, rules and policies and further based on applicable policies from the ILO and UN conventions, all as far as relevant for the activities of our Company and our industry. Our human rights procedures are firmly embedded in our Code of Conduct, which is applicable to all staff members working within the company. This includes ensuring that we are never involved in child labour, nor forced labour. All staff members should understand the principles, procedures and guidelines stated in this Corporate Code of Conduct. It is expected that staff members work in the spirit of those principles and actively propagate them in order to protect or to improve the Company’s integrity and reputation. Company managers are expected to lead according to our standards of ethical conduct, in both words and actions. Managers are responsible for promoting open and honest two-way communications. Managers must be positive activists and role models and must be diligent in reporting unethical or illegal conduct. Being part of the UN Global Compact highlights our commitment to the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. Page 20 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 8.3. Implementation in 2016 Topic 1. Procedure review and discussion with senior management on breaches The Company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2: “Local first” policy in Mali After showing a successful operation of five retail outlets in Mali, we received a special request from the United Nations (MINUSMA) to provide their staff with proper nutrition so they can continue making positive changes in this challenging area. This unique opportunity and situation has been established by our previous activities in this area. We did all deemed necessary and beyond to serve MINUSMA, especially sourcing goods in the region where hardly anything is available on the local market and conditions are tough. The set-up of a food service for bakery items and fresh fruits and vegetables is just one example. We opened the doors of the new restaurant, at the airport area in Bamako, in a record time of one week after receiving the written request. The restaurant has been running for almost half a year now and is organized and structured professionally to the satisfaction of many frequent visitors. In the meantime we have opened a second restaurant in Badalabougou. To support the Malian people, we actualize our “local first” policy in all our stores and restaurants, which created numerous jobs for the locals. Due to their expertise and know-how of our dedicated experts, B&S was able to successfully support MINUSMA and is continuing to do so for the years to come. Page 21 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 3: Organising events for the community We strongly believe that our responsibility to communities goes beyond only doing business, it is also about giving back to the communities in which we work and live. To attract talented people we organise educational events frequently. Our educational activities include guest lectures, sales career days, and internship events. Dedicated learning projects are organised in cooperation with universities. Sales Career Day Each year, we organise a Sales Career Day to meet the best of the best talents who have just graduated. The Sales Career Day is an event where starters and graduates get acquainted with the career opportunities within B&S. Throughout this day, experts explain more about their business activities, challenges and experiences as we believe these personal stories will help these young professionals. Furthermore, conversations with recruiters are held and the graduates get the opportunity to see our office and warehouse. Internship events B&S is present at different internship events from the universities in our region to attract students for practical internships or graduation assignments. Page 22 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Guest lectures We give several guest lectures each year and try to add value to the academic programmes of international studies. Our employees conduct guest lectures about their area of expertise on a regular basis. This point of view from practice, combined with the existing academic content of the lectures, give students real-life insights into specific business experiences. Topic 4. Heineken promotion material B&S is committed to the social environment of every country in which it is present. Together with our business partners we continually strive to make a contribution to the well-being of the local community. For example, in 2016, Heineken promotional items have been send to our shops in Mali to empower the overall shopping experience. Page 23 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 8.4.

Labour principles  Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;  Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;  Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and  Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 9.1. Overview As it’s our people who make the difference when it comes to serving our stakeholders, human resources are considered a strategic factor. B&S has set itself challenging but realistic goals and, as a consequence, human resources management is a decisive factor and primarily focused on supporting the sustainable growth of the Company through an operational staff of talented people. The human resources function within B&S is set to ensure the quality of our human capital and has the opportunity to help shape the Company’s future by focusing on the career development, retention, work safety and well-being of staff members. The Company offers an international and high-quality working environment in which performance and world-class leadership are promoted. 9.2. Assessment, policy and goals Our ambition is to be amongst the most attractive and active employers within our industry. All employees have standard working hours, based on local regulations and industry standards and in accordance with the ILO conventions. All employees receive fair compensation for their work in line with local minimum requirements specified by the law and by the industry standards in relevant countries as well as by ILO conventions. Our people have the right to a healthy and safe workplace. Good working conditions and a positive working environment help contribute to a lower absenteeism rate. Our people are given autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. This has led to the exploration of new markets, the sale of new products, and the opening up of new regions.

We gave special attention to the following topics:  Contract terms and conditions  Working and rest hours  Payment and wages  Accommodation, food and catering  Health and safety  Complaint handling Employees on board of Thomson Majesty Page 27 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 3. Labour conditions of shop employees in Afghanistan and Mali By adhering to our own policies and the ILO conventions and rights as a minimum, we strive to upgrade the labour rights of the local staff in Afghanistan and Mali. Along with the growth of our organisation and activities in Afghanistan and Mali the number of staff increases. The personnel policy in Afghanistan and Mali is basically the same as our personnel policy that is used in the Netherlands, only partly is modified to the local conditions and circumstances. The main points of our Human Resources policy include:  Employment is recorded by means of a contract;  Agreements are in line with local laws and regulations;  Salaries are competitive with ILO convention as a minimum; and  Each employee will receive internal training and work guidance. The fair salary payment for B&S staff is reflected in competitive salary conditions offered by B&S. Besides a fair salary, staff receives a monthly food allowance and a monthly transport allowance. Working overtime is paid at a rate of 150% and working on Official Public and Religious Holidays is paid at a rate of 200%. Staff is entitled to 10 days paid leave for every six months worked. The working hours are based on the Labour and Employee Law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and depend on the season:  April 1st – October 31st 08.00 hrs. until 17.00 hrs.

Secure working conditions in Afghanistan The security of the offices and warehouses in Afghanistan is an important aspect. As we store consumer goods in warehouses, the premises need to be protected in relation to potential attacks, theft and other breaches. The B&S compound is located in a relatively safe area just past the city gate of Kabul. The nearest police and military post is only 0.5 kilometre away. The compound is secured by 34 guards on location (working in two shifts), equipped with adequate defence tools. The compound is surrounded with a high fence. There are separate guarded exit and entry gates. All vehicles entering the compound are thoroughly inspected. In addition, the visitors are registered and searched before entering. B&S has an extensive training program to ensure that employees in Afghanistan are competent to perform their jobs and to improve efficiency in relation to food safety, personal health and hygiene. Training courses are provided in terms of workshops, presentations or training-on-thejob. Examples of training that are given: 1. Introduction training 6. Fork-lift safety 2. HACCP Awareness 7. Fire safety 3. Food Safety 8. First aid 4. Personal Hygiene 9. PPE 5. Manual Handling Page 28 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 5. Training for employees at B&S Dordrecht Security is also an important aspect in our warehouses in the Netherlands, albeit in a different capacity. We use equipment such as forklifts, electric pallet trucks, pallet jacks and electric wrapping machines. The staff is well trained to use this equipment safely. Furthermore, the warehouse is well organized and clean which also contributes to the safety of our staff. The training of staff is an on-going process. B&S has an extensive training programme to ensure that employees in the Netherlands are competent to perform their jobs and to improve efficiency in relation to food safety and security. It is crucial for us that employees are properly trained. First of all, it ensures their own safety and security, and second, it all our processes are strictly followed. In 2016 we have implemented the following training sessions:  HACCP & ISO22000 training (154 employees): internal training about our quality management systems, HACCP and ISO22000.

Topic 6: B&S as knowledge centre Our people are given autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. This has led to the exploration of new markets, the sale of new products, and the opening of new regions. We consider education to be an important factor for personal development. We develop our management team by focusing on our internal talent, and believe that the growth of our company means there is enough potential for everyone within the company to follow their own career path. We believe that investing in our employees encourages motivation on our employees at the same time brings the complete company to a more professional stage. B&S Academy We attract a valuable source of talented individuals through our traineeship programme, called B&S Academy. This programme prepares trainees for leadership tasks by placing them on international assignments with hands-on experience. The trainee programme consists of certain modules which cover subjects such as the company’s history, its corporate strategy and main policies. Practical subjects related to commercial aspects, logistics, customs affairs, IT solutions and finance are also included. Experienced employees are actively involved in giving on-the-job training to them, an ideal way to share knowledge with colleagues. After seven months of traineeship, trainees have a clear and in-depth view of the company that supports their development on the job. Trainings have been professionalized even further by combining theory and daily practice on a higher level, providing practical cases and interactive assignments. Page 30 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Internships We maintain close relationships with universities, high schools and teachers in the areas in which we are active, with the intention of contributing towards the education of the community and sharing knowledge. Every semester a number of students participate in our internship programme or undertake graduation assignments in our organisation. Topic 7: Promoting a healthy lifestyle amongst employees A healthy lifestyle leads to better workplace performance. At B&S International, we actively support employees’ goal of staying fit and healthy. We encourage them to exercise during working hours, provide access to a gym, and promote a range of healthy foods in our lunchrooms, including a salad bar, fruit juices, fresh soups and sandwiches. Studies have shown that not only does engaging in regular physical activity raise energy levels, it also increases mental alertness and reduces workplace stress, which enhance productivity. And we believe this is a win-win situation. Page 31 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 9.4. Measurement of outcomes Labour rights Company relevance Relevant for all B&S staff.

Environmental principles  Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;  Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and  Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 10.1. Overview Using less, and generating less waste, is one of our CSR priorities. We recognise that certain resources are finite and must be used in an efficient, sustainable and responsible way. Whenever possible, we reduce, reuse, recycle and recover to utilize resources in the most environmentally prudent manner. We continually improve our environmental performance by applying sustainable principles along our entire value chain. We recognise the importance of protecting the natural environment, and work to reduce our CO2 emissions and mitigate any negative effects from our activities, while ensuring the health and safety of our people. 10.2. Assessment policy and goals We look for ways to be energy efficient by sustainably managing our procurement activities. While most of our goods are distributed by road, we continually look for the most CO2-efficient transportation method. Optimizing transportation and minimizing fuel consumption are areas that we strive to improve in. We optimize the use of technology within our warehouses, which helps us improve efficiency and lower our fuel and resource requirements, reducing our overall environmental impact. We use a range of technologies within our buildings to help cut emissions, including motiondetecting lights and energy-saving bulbs in our offices. When we make investments in our warehouses, offices and shops, we incorporate the most up-to-date standards, including looking for ways to save energy and use recycled material. Page 36 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 10.3. Implementation in 2016 Topic 1. Procedure review The Company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Reducing our footprint Each business unit works to reduce its CO2 emissions, with the goal of enhancing its environmental and economic performance. AutoStore In our warehouses in the North of Holland, we expanded the automated storage system for an affiliated company. The system AutoStore is completely automated and will allow us to store our products more efficiently and with reduced consumption of power and maintenance costs. Space requirements are also up to 60 percent lower and we are able to prepare orders four times faster. It has brought us new clients, who now benefit from a more advanced and reliable picking process and shorter lead times in the ordering process. At the same time, it has resulted in lower energy use and less maintenance costs. Page 37 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Automated warehouse in Dordrecht For example, at our new automated warehouse in Dordrecht we are introducing state-of-the-art equipment that ensures we can operate as effectively, efficiently and comfortably as possible. We also invest in the most modern internet and communication technology (ICT) across our offices and facilities, boosting efficiency and cutting energy use. B&S Shop Fly: engagement with Eindhoven Airport Eindhoven Airport wants to be a CO2 neutral airport. The Airport Carbon Accreditation programme connects all partners of Eindhoven Airport to jointly reduce carbon emissions. During 2016, we have initiated several activities regarding corporate social responsibility. First of all, the management needs to make sure that the Airport Carbon Accreditation programme is an ongoing focus. Therefore, it is important to create awareness among the employees. This is done by using posters about waste separation, energy consumption and printing. Second, B&S Shop Fly works with food banks to ensure that surplus food, which is too close to its expiration date to be sold, is distributed to those in need. Third, the amount of freight movements has been reduced from twice a week to once a week. Topic 3. Waste management Using less, and generating less waste, is one of our CSR priorities. We recognise that certain resources are finite and must be used in an efficient, sustainable and responsible way. Whenever possible, we reduce, reuse, recycle and recover to utilize resources in the most environmentally prudent manner. We raise awareness of waste disposal and reduction among our people, and embed this in our company culture. For example, waste paper is collected in special bins and then recycled. We also invest in digital administration systems, reducing our paper use. Topic 4. Food safety and procurement B&S purchases, stores, handles and sells large quantities of food products. Maintaining and observing safety standards and ensuring transparency of the food products we handle, are Page 38 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress priority for us. All food products that enter the logistics centres are subject to comprehensive quality controls, are handled with the utmost care and are stored in climate-controlled environments. The proper handling of food is a key priority within the organisation. We have a risk management system for food processing in place at the highest level and our processes are ISO 22000 and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control points) certified. All compliance and safety procedures are rigorously checked with a special attention to highrisk products, such as meat and poultry. Our logistic centres are checked by the European Food Safety Authority on a regular basis. Documents are examined to ensure they conform to the correct standards and random product samples are taken for laboratory analysis. To improve transparency related to our own GoodBurry products we have further improved the product information on our product packaging. The information on our product labelling fully complies with the most stringent regulations for product labelling, such as the most current EU and UN regulations. Addition of nutritional values;  Clear declaration of ingredients;  Better traceability through the addition of EU registration number. or EU Health mark. and on seafood products the FAO fishing areas;  Better legibility through amending the label structure. In 2016, we continued to invest in our product information management system, which is crucial to the launch of our wholesale-of-the-future program. We expect that in the years to come systems and platforms of suppliers, wholesalers such as B&S, and our customers will be intelligently linked, enabling more transparency in the supply chain. 10.4.

Anticorruption  Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 11.1. Overview Our Company has a long history with diverse activities dating back for more than a century. Our Company is rightly proud on its background. It has evolved over time and determines the professional Company that we are today. The way we do business, our Corporate Code of Conduct has evolved alongside. It is a sustainable and strong pillar on which the Company has earned the trust of its business partners. Whereas the Corporate Code of Conduct is firstly applicable for the Company’s own staff members, we considered it important that our stakeholders follow similar good governance and business ethics. We actively promote our ethical behaviour to stakeholders, even in other languages if needed for a better understanding. Our integrity should be beyond all doubt. In view of the important social role of our Company, it is imperative that all our employees comply with the legislation and regulations of the countries in which we are active and also comply with the values and standards that apply within our Company and which have been laid down in this Corporate Code of Conduct. We expect our employees to show integrity and honesty in their mutual relationships and in relationships with stakeholders. We also expect integrity and reliability from our business partners, such as clients, suppliers and other business partners. The Company abides by the local legislation, industry minimum standards, ILO and UN conventions and other statutory requirements. 11.2. Assessment, policy and goals Our Company will not cooperate in illegal transactions or transactions suspected to aim on the laundry of money. We do business on the basis of honest and ethical management, trust and integrity and we expect the same from everyone with whom we do business. Our Company will not accept any influence in the decision making by people based on promises, gifts, bribes or kickbacks, or by any other measure that is unethical or that will tarnish our reputation for honesty and integrity. Even the appearance of such conduct shall be avoided. Gifts, favours and hospitality are to be handled with great caution. Excessive gifts and hospitality can affect our business judgment and can create expectations from third parties. As a result the Company can be embarrassed by its disclosure. Gifts, favours and hospitality may only be accepted when they are consistent with general accepted business practices and ethical standards and do not in any way violate applicable law. In accepting gifts, favours or hospitality any attempt of bribery or kickback should be avoided. Page 42 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Staff members who are engaged in procurement activities should safeguard their freedom of action to deal impartially and to avoid conflicting loyalties. Therefore, gifts, favours and hospitality of any kind which would obligate or tend to obligate the staff member must not be accepted. We expect our suppliers to respect our gift policy when doing business with us, just as we will respect the similar policies of our clients. Our Company maintains a zero tolerance attitude towards fraud. This is applicable for all our staff members but we also expect our business partners to refrain from fraud. All the divisions and business units are subject to general policies, procedures and control mechanisms to prevent and detect fraud. Reports of fraud or attempt of fraud will be seriously investigated and reported to the Board of Directors, followed by appropriate sanctions, if necessary. 11.3. Implementation in 2016 Topic 1. Procedure review The Company reviews procedures yearly and has discussions between the Board of Directors and senior managers on the effectiveness and completeness of these procedures, breaches, and incidents. Topic 2. Know Your Customer principle The Company has intensified its activities aimed at gaining a better understanding of its customers and suppliers and sophisticated CSR software filled with all kind of client details is in place. As the Company works with a large number of business to-business clients and suppliers there was a need to analyse the availability of complete information per relation. The Know Your Customer (KYC) procedure includes all relevant customer data, including name, address, e-mail address, website, VAT number, bank account number, and so on. This procedure is applicable for all new relationships, and the data of each relationship is updated annually. Creditworthiness of new clients is checked upfront in order to avoid corruption, bribery, fraud and other unethical behavior. Client relationships are checked with the OFAC and EU Sanctions list. Throughout the Company, there is extensive knowledge of the content and impact of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The KYC procedure is further relevant to some of our Key suppliers, for example manufacturers that work in the Liquor and Tobacco industry. In order to avoid corruption, bribery, fraud and other unethical behaviour, these large suppliers are extremely satisfied with our initiatives to uphold professional procedures and need to be assured that the Company has an effective KYC procedure in place, also in relation to applicable legislation. Page 43 of 46 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress Topic 3. Know Your Supplier principle As a result of the increasing interest regarding complete chain transparency, we have developed a Know Your Supplier principle which helps to optimise these procedures, ensures a transparent supply chain and helps us to maintain the highest product and safety standards for environmentally-friendly packaging designs and materials. Using the right packaging is crucial to prevent waste and guarantee high-quality standards, which is why we don’t use materials and methods that pose environmental or health risks when suitable alternatives are available. We actively promote the transparency of products from the moment they enter the supply chain, to the moment they are delivered to clients. For our own private labels, for example, we continually improve transparency by updating the product information on product packaging. The information on our product labels fully comply with the most stringent regulations for product labelling, including from the European Union and the United Nations. We have also intensified our actions related to our suppliers. To optimise procedures and to ensure a transparent supply chain of goods, the Company has set-up a UN project team of specialists from purchasing, sales and logistics. The Royal Capi-Lux division operates retail outlets at a number of airports. At Amsterdam Schiphol airport the division runs a total of 6 shops divided over landside and airside. As far as the products sold in the shops are concerned, mainly a variety of electronic items, Royal Capi-Lux has been recognised by the Dutch Government (Royal Marechaussee) as a ‘Known Supplier of Inflight Supplies’. This status implies that the security measures taken by Royal Capi-Lux are approved by the Government and comply with National and European legislation. Topic 4. External recruitment agency in Mali We work with a recruitment agency in Mali to make sure that we comply to all local regulations regarding hiring people as it is not easy to hire people ourselves there. All our employees are sub contracted to this agency to make sure that everything is in line with local laws in Mali. The policy is basically the same as our personnel policy that is used in the Netherlands, only partly is modified to the local conditions and circumstances. The main points of our Human Resources policy comprise of:  Employment is recorded by means of a contract;  Agreements are in line with local laws and regulations;  Salaries are competitive with ILO convention as a minimum; and  Each employee will receive internal training and work guidance.
