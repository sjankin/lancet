Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 Highlights 6 Our progress in advancing the 10 Principles in 2015 Protecting human rights In this section, we describe how we uphold the first two principles of the UN Global Compact. Principle 1 Principle 2 Business should support and respect Business should ensure that they are the protection of internationally not complicit in human rights abuses proclaimed human rights We maintain respect for all human beings and acknowledge U.S. 8% their rights as laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations. Rest of the World 27% Beyond the protection of human and labor rights in our own operations, our approach applies throughout our supply network and in the markets we serve around the world, Generic specifically in support of the right of access to affordable launches in medicine and patient rights. 2015 We are strong advocates for our patients, as we believe all individuals should be able to expect to enjoy better, healthier Europe lives. In addition, we support our communities around the 65% world in the countries and cities where we operate. Supporting healthier lives through increasing access to affordable medicine Generic medicines revolutionize the pharmaceutical landscape, enabling billions of people to live better by reducing the price of medicines, which in turn creates affordable alternatives and savings for patients. These savings also allow healthcare systems to better manage health-related economic challenges and offer more therapies, more coverage and overall better healthcare to their patients. Our commitment to enhancing affordable healthcare is built on two fundamental cornerstones: increasing access by (1) entering new markets to provide the best available treatments to patients, and (2) continually investing in research and innovation to provide additional high quality, affordable medicines to meet a range of healthcare needs. Teva offers the broadest range of medicines of any pharmaceutical company anywhere – that’s why we often call ourselves the world’s largest medicine cabinet. Our cabinet includes more than 16,000 specialty and generic products based on 1,800 different molecules used in the development of medicines in critical therapeutic areas. We have capabilities to deliver these medicines through different delivery systems – tablets, liquids, capsules, injectable, inhalers and more to ensure that our medicines treat patients via the most effective route. We make the world’s largest (and growing) medicine cabinet accessible and affordable for millions of people each day. According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, generic drugs that entered the U.S. market between 2002 and 2014 reduced the price of medicines by 51% to 66% in the first year and up to 80% after five years. The reduced cost of medicine enables healthcare systems in most countries to provide more treatment for more patients from their increasingly pressured budgets. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 8 In 2015, we launched many new generic products and medicines, offering millions more patients access to the benefits of affordable medicines. Saving billions for healthcare systems and patients Recently, we started to analyze the economic impact of generics in our different markets and can share initial results from four markets which we believe are indicative of Teva’s global contribution. Teva saved $215 billion for U.S. Teva saves $5.8 billion in three families, insurers and government European countries each year over 10 years Savings from generic drugs in the U.S. healthcare In the UK, Teva is the largest generic drug company, system are estimated at $1.68 trillion over the last filling 1-in-8 prescriptions and supplying more than decade, according to the Generic Pharmaceutical 700 generic medicine lines. Generic drugs save the Association. UK’s National Health Service more than $18 billion per year, of which Teva is responsible for more than $4 While generics comprise 65% of prescriptions in billion. the U.S. Medicare program, they account for only 25% of spend. In fact, the Congressional Budget In Italy, generic drugs save Italian patients and the Office estimates that if there were no generic drugs, Italian Health Service approximately $4.7 billion each the effect would be an extra $120 billion in U.S. year. As the largest generic drug company in Italy, prescription costs each year. Teva fills 1-in-5 prescriptions and is responsible for annual savings of approximately $870 million. As the largest manufacturer of generics, filling 1-in-5 generic prescriptions in the U.S. (more In Spain, the story is similar. Generic drugs save than any other company), Teva has been uniquely Spanish patients and the Spanish National Healthcare instrumental in delivering healthcare savings. We System approximately $1.1 billion annually. As one of account for almost 13% of savings generated from the largest generic drug companies in Spain, filling generics prescriptions in the U.S., equating to 1-in-4 prescriptions, Teva is responsible for annual approximately $215 billion over the last ten years. savings of approximately $275 million. Enabling the UN to treat more patients One specific example of the many ways we contribute to lowering healthcare costs is our supply of linezolid to the UN in 2016 and 2017. Linezolid is used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) which affects around half a million people per year. After successfully bidding in a UN tender, in 2016 and 2017, we will supply 2.3 million linezolid treatments at a price that is 70% lower than other sources. In other words, many more people can be treated by the UN with the same amount of funding. Expanding our reach with generics In 2015, we laid the groundwork to expand our portfolio of medicines. For example, we established a partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company to meet the wide-ranging needs of patients and growing importance of generic medicines in Japan. Also, in August 2016, we completed our acquisition of Actavis Generics, the generics division of Allergan plc. Actavis brings to Teva a prominent and successful generics business as the third largest generics manufacturer in the U.S., with more than 1,000 generic products. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 9 Teva’s unique innovation enhances the availability of new treatments Our Global Public Health Program harnesses these capabilities to address global public health challenges in emerging markets. In this program, we provide essential R&D resources to develop solutions to treat conditions that are untreated or inadequately treated to date. Our investments and resources are provided at cost. That means we take no profit in the development stage, in order to give these new solutions the best chance of economic viability and progress to market for the benefit of the patients who need them. In 2015, we advanced two Global Public Health Program initiatives: Innovative treatment for diarrhea Improving contraceptive use One of the pressing challenges in treating acute We are working in collaboration with FHI 360, watery diarrhea (mortality: 1,600 /day) in children a nonprofit human development organization, is ease of preparation of available Oral Rehydration to develop an injectable contraceptive that aims Salts (ORS). to provide protection for six months – twice the length of protection provided by current injectable We developed a unique treatment concept to contraceptives. reduce diarrhea-related mortality in children aged six months to five years.

The unique combination burden on medical systems, facilities and providers. treatment first purifies water and then supplies necessary volume of clean water and electrolytes This project is supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates combined with zinc to halt diarrhea. Foundation. In addition, we add flavor to the combination to achieve high acceptance by children. This program enabled Teva to initiate a Diarrhea Innovations Group (DIG) under the United Nations Commission for Life-Saving Commodities' Pneumonia & Diarrhea Working Group. Advocating and supporting patient rights and wellbeing We go beyond providing medicines, aiming to advance the patient’s voice in the healthcare system and support patients in coping with their medical conditions. Our many partnerships with patient organizations enable us to better understand the many ways health impacts life and help us explore new solutions for patients to live better. Global patient support programs: We develop, implement and operate a wide range of patient support programs worldwide that deliver high impact personalized support services. These programs play a critical role in empowering the Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 10 patient and delivering better outcomes. In 2015, Teva managed 49 patient support programs in 30 countries supporting nearly 300,000 patients. Complementing Teva’s core business activities, these programs encourage better outcomes by supporting adherence to prescribed therapy and the physician’s treatment plan, and achieving more consistent results through positive behavior change. Global health patient advocacy: In May 2016, we hosted the inaugural Improving Health Global Patient Advocacy Dialogue in Amsterdam, bringing together 12 patient advocacy organization representatives from around the globe with many specialists and executives on behalf of Teva. Working collaboratively with the patient community, the dialogue helped Teva identify the opportunities to enable the patient voice to be more clearly heard within Teva and to build and strengthen relationships with each organization centered on common goals for supporting patients and those that care for them. Transparency: Teva endorses the Medicines for Europe Code of Conduct which provides standards for relationships between the pharmaceutical industry and patient organizations. As a member of Medicines for Europe, we actively supported the development of this Code. In line with the Code’s requirements, we published our first European Patient Organization and Advocacy Disclosure in March 2016. This is a detailed list of all our patient engagement activities in 2015 in Europe, with cash costs and contributions recorded by activity. See the disclosure here Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 11 Contributing to the wellbeing of our communities Our contribution to our communities regularly exceeds $100 million per year and in 2015, amounted to $106 million. Almost 25% of this was in product donations in different countries. In most cases, our contributions mainly support issues related to improving healthcare or supporting different patient groups. Supporting communities in times of emergency The need for access to medicines is especially acute when climate disasters strike vulnerable communities. We believe we have a duty to assist, and we do so by donating medicine through well-established humanitarian organizations that coordinate and support relief efforts. In 2015, for example, a devastating earthquake of 7.9 magnitude hit Nepal and the surrounding areas, the largest to hit the country since 1934, taking the lives of at least 5,000 people in Nepal, Tibet and Bangladesh with thousands more injured. At least 15 aftershocks caused further damage to buildings and increased the risk of collapse. Acting upon our values and our lasting commitment to reach out to the most vulnerable communities affected by such tragedies, we partnered with Direct Relief and the Red Cross to respond to the most pressing needs with Teva products and medicines. We sent medicines of a total value of $1M to help those affected in Nepal. Teva employees also donated directly and we matched their contributions with corporate funding. The CEO of Direct Relief, Thomas Tighe, sent a short video to thank Teva and note that our contribution was the largest medical shipment that had been received in Nepal since the start of relief operations. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 12 U.S.: FRANCE: GERMANY: Volunteers in Medicine clinics, Again this year, 150 Teva For the fourth successive year in staffed primarily by volunteers, colleagues from 30 countries 2015, Teva Germany supported provide medical and dental participated in ‘Climbing against the “Johanniter Christmas treatment at no cost to MS’ in France.

U.S. patients in need through the Teva Cares Foundation Patient Assistance Programs. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 13 Ensuring responsible practices in our supply chain In 2015, we began building our first Supplier Code of Conduct in alignment with Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) principles and Teva’s Business Code of Conduct, as a way to help ensure that our suppliers uphold ethical practices in their businesses and specifically, in the work they do with Teva. We hope to start introducing our Code to suppliers in 2016. Advancing collaboration and maximizing value with suppliers As part of our efforts to engage more holistically with suppliers, in 2015, we launched a Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) program to advance collaboration with key suppliers, generate mutual shared value and minimize risk. Initially, we are engaging with a small number of selected suppliers and will gradually expand our scope over time. Working with more diverse suppliers In 2015, we introduced our U.S. Supplier Diversity program to encourage engagement with more diverse suppliers, including small businesses, minority, women and LGBT-owned, or businesses run by veterans or people with disabilities. We started our outreach to identify potential new diverse suppliers for Teva, by becoming members of organizations such as WBENC (Women’s Business Enterprise National Council) and NMSDC (National Minority Supplier Development Council). We are planning to be more active with these and other organizations to ensure our pipeline of diverse suppliers will grow in the coming years. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 14 Safe medicines for patients Patients look to Teva to develop new medicines safely, work to the highest standards of clinical research and be transparent about our results. We comply with applicable laws relating to the safety of medicines and the complete and accurate labelling of products and provision of patient safety information. We maintain a worldwide network of highly trained local safety officers, most of whom are physicians or pharmacists. Patient safety is supported by our high standards of manufacturing and precision quality assurance, our pharmacovigilance (PhV) operations, our clinical trial standards and our fight against counterfeit drugs. Clinical trials: Clinical trials play a crucial role in helping ensure medicines are safe and effective before they are brought to market. We follow the most advanced global standards for clinical trials, with emphasis on protecting the safety of potential patients as well as trial participants. All trials are conducted in accordance with the international Declaration of Helsinki, which lays out ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects. We conduct clinical trials only when critical to product development and we minimize interventions as far as possible to avoid non-critical exposure of trial participants to experimental drugs. In 2015, we published 36 trial results, conducted 157 site visits to oversee our trial activity and audited 45 trial sites. In 2015, we also formed strategic partnerships with our Contract Research Organizations (CRO) vendors who conduct trials on our behalf. In collaboration with these CROs, we improved our trial processes to enable greater transparency and quality of information. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 15 Caring in the use phase Our global Pharmacovigilance (PhV) division monitors, analyzes and reports potential safety risks associated with the use of a Teva product or device. While drugs are approved based on representative safety trials, their effects may vary when used in practice in different circumstances by different patient types. Our finger-on-the-pulse alerts us to adverse reaction events associated with our medicines, and we investigate immediately and take appropriate action. In 2015, our Corporate Safety Board met 15 times to review all aspects of the safety of our products in the market. Based on our ongoing evaluation of products in the market, in 2015, we produced 1,548 Periodic Reports identifying the aggregate safety data of different medicines since their development. We also delivered 142 Risk Management Plans (RMPs) that describe the risks of adverse drug reactions and potential adverse reactions associated with the use of a drug to help assure a positive risk-benefit profile for our medicines. In addition, we sponsor post-marketing safety studies after a medicine has been authorized to obtain further details relating to a medicine's safety. In 2015, we held 35 post-marketing safety studies in 35 countries to monitor the safety of both our generic and branded products in various therapeutic areas after release to the market. Keeping patients safe by fighting counterfeit drugs Counterfeit drugs are a threat to the health and safety of patients as they may not contain stated doses of active ingredients, meaning that patients are not receiving the correct treatment even though they think they are. Not only that, counterfeits often contain dangerous impurities that can actively harm patients. The threat is serious with the annual value of the counterfeit drug market estimated at $200 billion. In 2015, we took new steps to advance our efforts to prevent counterfeit drugs from putting our patients at risk. We joined the Pharmaceutical Security Institute (PSI), a coalition of the 33 largest pharmaceutical companies. PSI and its members work to combat counterfeits by raising the public's‫ ׳‬awareness of the dangers of counterfeit drugs and by collaborating with government agencies, customs authorities, international police agencies and others to help eliminate the flow of counterfeit drugs. This step strengthened our existing anti-counterfeiting activities, including participation in international efforts, supporting related legislation and regulation, and, of course, compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 16 Upholding labor rights In this section, we describe how we uphold the first two principles of the UN Global Compact. Principle 3 Principle 4 Business should uphold the freedom of Business should support the elimination of association and the effective recognition all forms of forced and compulsory labor of the right to collective bargaining Principle 5 Principle 6 Business should support the effective Business should support the elimination of abolition of child labor discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Behind every new treatment, medicine, service or products our company develops are real people. These are 57,000 people in 80 countries who have dedicated their careers to working together to uncover new ways of advancing the health of patients. These dedicated people are the lifeblood of our company’s success. At the most foundational level, we observe globally recognized human rights standards in our workplace, we do not tolerate child labor or forced or compulsory labor, we support freedom of association and avoid discrimination in all its forms. We maintain a safe workplace and care for the wellbeing of our employees. We go beyond these basic rights through our support for employees in a variety of initiatives, from listening to their opinions and needs, to valuing diversity and differences, to developing leadership and supporting career aspirations. Our inclusive workplace We value diversity and believe that an inclusive workplace based on respect and equal opportunity is a more empowering workplace. We encourage diversity among our employees as well as in our interactions with patients, communities and business partners. In North America, we continue to enhance our Teva Inclusion Network which is comprised of eight Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) based on shared characteristics, interests, and life experiences to create channels for networking and development. All our ERGs were active throughout 2015, including hosting inspirational speakers, community meetings, participating in webinars and other activities. Our Employee Resource Groups Abilities Latino/Hispanic Heritage (People working with African Heritage Network Asian Heritage Network Network disabilities) Pride Network (Supporting Men at Teva Vets at Teva Women at Teva LGBT community) Advancing gender equality: We maintain a gender-equal workplace with 46% of our global workforce made up of women. In 2015, 50% of all our managers were women, from first line managers up to the most senior levels of management. In 2015, two female directors joined our Board of Directors, bringing the presence of women on our Board to 23% (3 of 13). Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 17 Caring for employee health and wellness We empower each our managers in each country of Employees operation to provide practical tools and locally tailored getting healthier programs that help employees lead healthier lifestyles and In our U.S. operations*: address their needs and preferences. In 2015, for example, our U.S. sites began a “Journey to Well+16% being” to create a work environment that encourages and employees became active members supports the physical and emotional health of employees. As of Teva’s onsite fitness centers part of the program, employees receive information about their health status and risk factors together with benefits, +32% services and resources to support healthier behaviors. In employees completed a Biometric 2015, we saw a significant increase in engagement for better Screening and Health Risk Questionnaire health among our U.S. employees. +59% In Israel, health insurance plans were enhanced to provide employees participated in our employees and their families with comprehensive quality Weight Watchers program access to care and our health plan service hours were adjusted to enable more employees to participate. In 2015, 23 more than 1,400 employees consulted with our Nutrition employees used our Smoking Advisors and hundreds engaged in different sporting Cessation program (25 in 2014) activities organized by Teva in Israel. *Data for 2015 is compared to 2014, Relates to employees and eligible dependents. A safe workplace for our employees At Teva, we believe that everyone has the right to a safe and healthy working environment. We are committed to meet applicable safety regulations in all our operations, but more than this, we aspire to establish a culture where safety is a core value and integrated into everything we do. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 18 We aspire to a future workplace with zero injuries and incidents. We support this aspiration by proactively identifying and eliminating hazards; improving safety management systems; continuous safety education and training; upgrading equipment and infrastructure; and ongoing auditing and monitoring. In 2015, we achieved a 10% reduction in our global recordable injury rate and a 10% reduction in our global lost time injury rate. This continues a trend of improved safety performance over the past four years. 69% of our injuries in 2015 were due to slips, trips, and falls; ergonomic overexertion; and injuries where individuals were struck by a moving item resulting in cuts, scratches and bruises. There were no work-related fatalities in Teva’s operations during 2015. In addition to the multi-year development and implementation of our global EHS management system that specifies minimum safety and health standards to be followed across Teva, we continued to focus on raising awareness of safety and health and enhancing our safety culture. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 19 Taking responsibility for our place on the planet In this section, we describe how we uphold the three principles of the UN Global Compact supporting environmental stewardship: Principle 7 Principle 8 Principle 9 Business should support a Business should undertake Business should encourage precautionary approach to initiatives to promote greater the development and diffusion environmental challenges environmental responsibility of environmentally friendly technologies Climate change is an increasing global challenge that impacts everything we care about: our patients, our employees, the members of our communities and our business. Understanding the important role business must play in mitigating climate change, in 2012 we established goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and improve our energy efficiency. In 2015, we created additional goals for increasing the beneficial reuse of waste and reducing our water use at three key sites in water scarce areas and we have almost achieved our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal, almost 5 years ahead of schedule. EHS “Journey to Excellence” We continue to roll-out our global EHS (Environment, Health and Safety) management system with the intention that all our operating facilities will become fully compliant in the coming years. The EHS management system includes continuing to develop a comprehensive set of internal EHS operational standards covering all aspects of our manufacturing and supply to create a unified set of Teva standards. In 2015, we introduced two new internal standards on energy conservation and water conservation and management, supported by relevant employee training. Our EHS management system is aligned with international quality standards such as ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 and we hold 15 certifications to one or more of these standards at different sites. For other sites, compliance with our EHS management system is a robust basis for future external certification to these standards. Our EHS aspiration called “TargetZERO” includes four key 2020 targets. Our performance through 2015 is as follows: Cumulative performance against TargetZERO Targets to 2020 2013 2014 2015 Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15% (baseline 2012) -4% -9% -14% Improve energy efficiency by 20% (baseline 2012) -6% -7% -10% Reduce water use at three water scarce sites by 5% in 2020 Achieved at two (baseline 2014) sites Increase waste beneficially reused (diverted from landfill) by 10% (baseline 2014) -6% Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 20 Our environmental performance Energy by Scope in MWh GHG emissions by Scope in tons CO2e 2,899,227 2,735,914 974,956 2,697,055 938,330 890,951 2,616,905 835,452 1,296,014 1,239,657 1,242,896 621,799 605,013 567,499 534,321 1,248,836 1,603,213 1,496,257 1,454,159 1,368,069 353,157 333,317 323,452 301,131 2012 2013 2014 2015 2012 2013 2014 2015 Scope 1 energy Scope 2 energy Total energy Scope 1 emissions Scope 2 emissions Total GHG emissions Emissions of ozone depleting substances (ODS) Water withdrawal and discharge in million M 3 8.49 8.34 8.11 7.46 6.55 6.04 6.11 5.52 5.60 5.72 5.79 2.02 2012 2013 2014 2015 2012 2013 2014 2015 Water withdrawal in M3 Water discharge in M3 Total waste by type in tons Waste by disposal type in 2015 288,688 Recycling including 224,189 Other conversion to energy 20% 35% 239,200 182,048 Landfill 4% 42,141 49,488 16% 25% Incineration Bio Non-hazardous waste Hazardous waste Total waste treatment Notes: Energy and emissions: Teva uses Operational Control to account for energy consumption and carbon footprint.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd – UNGC Communication on Progress for 2015 The 10 Principles 21 Europe leading the way with renewable electricity As part of our global effort to reduce GHG emissions across all our operations, in 2015, we made significant progress by increasing our use of renewable energy. Approximately 50% of our total electricity consumption in Europe comes from renewable sources, such as solar, wind and hydro-power. Currently, Teva Europe leads the way on renewable electricity sourcing, but we plan to roll this out to more global operations in the coming years. By the end of 2017, we expect to reach >95% green electricity in Europe and 15% green energy globally. Our first biomass burner in India Another initiative to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels and save GHG emissions was initiated at our Goa site in India in 2015. We made a significant investment to install our first ever biomass boiler in our manufacturing facility. This facility produces tablets and capsules for markets in Europe, Canada, and Japan. With the installation of this biomass boiler, we produce 1.24 GWh of green heat energy, Photo: Solid fuel (Biomass) Boiler, Teva, Goa. replacing a heavy fuel oil fired boiler and eliminating 1,700 tons of GHG emissions per year, while generating significant annual savings. Currently, 36% of the energy required at Goa site is provided by the biomass boiler which converts agricultural waste, such as rice, sugarcane husk, sawdust and ground nut shells, into high density energy briquettes. The waste generated by the biomass boiler is also eco-efficient: an ash by-product that is sent to an approved recycler for use as fertilizer, raw material for bricks and construction landfill.
