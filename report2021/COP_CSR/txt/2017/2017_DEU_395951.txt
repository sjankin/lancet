COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 United Nations Global Compact Growing value. 01 AMATHEON AGRI STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT Dear Readers, Amatheon Agri Holding N.V. is a proud member of the United Nations Global Compact. As a triple-bottom-line company, we believe that caring for the environment and the community where we operate goes hand-in-hand with running a sustainable business. Since our inception, responsible investment and corporate responsibility have been central to our business strategy and values. In practice, this means creating more value for investors, customers, communities, and the company with a reduced environmental footprint. By conducting business fairly and ethically, respecting human rights and complying with international standards and domestic laws, we have laid important foundations for our business to continue prospering in the years ahead. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our partners and staff for their contributions to this year’s achievements presented in our Communication on Progress (COP) 2017 Report. I hope that by sharing our experiences of implementing the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, other companies are inspired to join the Compact and contribute towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Carl Heinrich Bruhn Chief Executive Office Amatheon Agri Holding N.V. 02 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 01 03 AMATHEON AGRI 02 COUNTRIES OF OPERATIONS 04 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 03 AMATHEON AGRI AT A GLANCE Amatheon Agri is a European agribusiness and food company, headquartered in Berlin and operating in SubSaharan Africa. Focused on farming, trading and food processing, Amatheon integrates its activities along the agricultural value chain. As a triple-bottom-line company, Amatheon acts as an anchor investor in rural areas to uplift neighboring communities economically, socially and environmentally. It is a combination of international expertise with localized African know-how, and a long-term vision with a sustainable approach, makes it set to become a leading player in the African agricultural sector. Founded in 2011, Amatheon established its subsidiaries in Zambia in 2012, Uganda in 2013, and Zimbabwe in 2014. During this relatively short timeframe, Amatheon has proven its business model and demonstrated its ability to build large, replicable, scalable platforms – in both farming and food processing. With over US$100 million invested in its operations to date, Amatheon believes that the key to unlocking Sub-Saharan Africa’s vast agricultural potential is combining world-class farming techniques, partnerships with smallholder farmers, and vertical integration along the value chain. Sustainable Approach Amatheon’s core business relies on healthy ecosystems, strong rural communities and talented staff. Knowing that large-scale commercial activities impact the environments and communities where they take place, Amatheon’s investments are built on participatory and transparent land acquisition and development. Prior to any developments taking place, Amatheon hires external environmental experts to conduct in-depth Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) which include desk research, site visits, public consultations, scientific studies and are bound to the approval of the respective country’s national environmental management authority. Furthermore, Amatheon is actively engaged in operationalizing the leading frameworks for responsible agriinvestments, such as the Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems (CFS-RAI), Principles for Responsible Agricultural Investment (PRAI), FAO and OECD’s Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains and the Analytical Framework for Responsible Land Based Investments in African Agriculture. 05 AMATHEON AGRI 04 UNGC PRINCIPLES FOR A SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS The table below highlights the four main pillars of the UN Global Compact, with a list of the ten Principles.

As a result, environmental management plays an essential role in our sustainable development strategy with a commitment to reduce environmental footprints. Our aim is to minimize impacts through responsible, sustainable use of natural resources, to continuously improve environmental protection and to develop a greater sense of responsibility among employees and suppliers. Guiding Principles 1. Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) Prior to developing land, there are in-depth studies conducted by external consultants to identify the scope of environmental and social impacts – both positive and negative ones. The ESIA process is extensive, including a variety of stakeholder consultations, creation of a baseline study about the vegetation, soil, biodiversity and water quality, and field work to capture social data about communities in the catchment area. Based on the findings, Environmental Management Plans are developed to mitigate potentially adverse impacts from the start. ESIAs are conducted in line with respective policies, legislations and other institutional frameworks applicable. 2. Internal Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) Environmental Management Plans stem from the ESIA and specifically address each item that is exposed to the project development. The EMP guides Amatheon on the implementation of a holistic management system, and looks at land and soil, air quality, noise, water management, biodiversity, traffic, health and safety as well as cultural heritage sites. Based on this plan, Amatheon carries out frequent monitoring to continuously improve its environmental performance and reduced footprint. 17 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2017 018 3.
