Making the most of digital technology to accelerate progress for all “At Orange we go forward in the belief that digital technology is a powerful tool for economic, social and environmental development. With that in mind, our goal is to harness its tremendous potential for progress and innovation to benefit mankind. Our Corporate Social Responsibility approach is a key part of Essentials2020 momentum, which is centred on a digital, efficient and responsible company dynamic. CSR ensures that our policies, investments and innovations create sustainable value for everyone and for society as a whole. Listening and respond to the expectations of all stakeholders is what our new brand ambition is all about, and it is also the essence of our approach to Corporate Social Responsibility. The entire group, including all of its subsidiaries, is fully committed to this rigorous standard, which is based on shared principles for action and driven by three sustainable performance levers:  offer trusted support on digital technology for all users  contribute to economic and social development  promote energy and ecological transition Working on this basis, and through an internal culture that promotes innovation, our corporate citizenship commitment ensures that all of our activities have the same focus: making the most of digital technology to accelerate progress for society and individuals alike. To do so, the Orange Group has set objectives for the short medium and longterm.

4 Our principles of action BEHAVING ETHICALLY AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION Orange is committed to doing business in an ethical environment. The ambitions laid out in the Essentials2020 plan, particularly in terms of international growth, mobile financial service launches, and the development of the internet of things, mean that Orange’s commitment to ethics, fighting corruption, compliance, and responsible and transparent governance is more important than ever before. With these principles as its lodestar, Orange strives to win the trust of all of its stakeholders, particularly its employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and investors. The Group’s objectives aim to consolidate its ethical approach and enhance its corruption prevention programmes. Our 2016 achievements Several actions to consolidate our ethical approach:  Updating a number of procedures (declaring conflicts of interest new version of letters of delegations of powers and signatures, with a commitment to declare any conflicts of interest new practical guide to identifying, avoiding and managing conflicts of interest, distributed at the 4th Ethics & Compliance day on 6 October 2016;  Integrating the service relationship ethics reference base into the Group's TTM process (Time To Market: process used to select, design and launch products and infrastructures, which sets the rules for managing these projects: milestones, deliverables, organisation and governance). This reference base could then be deployed in France and Europe. Actions to combat corruption  Reinforcing our procedures (updating corruption risk analysis procedure, testing the fraud and compliance due diligence procedure in three Group subsidiaries (Orange Moldavia, Orange Egypt and Orange Belgium) to verify its effectiveness and begin deployment throughout the Group continuing deployment of the tool for declaring and obtaining managerial approval for any occasions when thresholds for invitations, meals, gifts, etc. are exceeded);  Reinforcing the audit programme for the prevention of corruption; updating and deploying the self-assessment questionnaire for the entities.  In these 2 areas, ongoing communication and awareness initiatives for the whole Group, with a particular effort at the 4th Ethics & Compliance day held throughout the Group on 6 October 2016. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 5 RESPECTING AND ENFORCING RESPECT OF HUMAN RIGHTS In line with the principles of Business and Human Rights defined by the United Nations, Orange is committed to respecting and enforcing respect of human rights. For an international operator like Orange, this covers four areas: employee relations, customer relations, supplier and sub-contractor relations, and protection of privacy and freedom of expression. Orange has identified the following areas for improvement over the coming years: improving awareness of its impact in these areas in all of the countries where it operates, and helping employees better understand human rights issues, particularly by rolling out ad hoc training resources Our 2016 achievements Promoting human rights in the ICT sector Orange's ongoing strong involvement in promoting human rights in the ICT sector, particularly within the Telecommunication Industry Dialogue (TID) organisation, grouping eight international telecoms operators. 2016 saw the development of closer ties between TID and the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a recognized player in this domain, that includes internet operators, NGOs, academics and socially responsible investors. This merger between these two organizations should take place in 2017. Orange active involvement in the working groups across ICT sector on extremist contents on internet, and, more recently, on requests by governments to shut the network (internet, fixed line, mobile, , SMS). A common declaration by TID and GNI has been drafted to define the operator positioning towards these requests on network or services shutdowns (http://www.telecomindustrydialogue.org/global-network-initiative-telecommunicationsindustry-dialogue-joint-statement-network-service-shutdowns/). Orange more particularly faced an upsurge in shutdowns request in 2016, which not only result in breaches of freedom of expression and privacy, but also bring severe economic losses for the country, the people, and the enterprise. In all cases, Orange made sure that processes were respected, in particular that an official written request from the authorities was received. In France, Orange's active participation, as co-rapporteur for the CSR Platform (overseen by the Prime Minister) to develop a national French action plan to apply the United Nations’ guiding principles on human rights. See the report on the 2016 implementation of the Telecommunication Industry Dialogue principles. (https://www.orange.com/en/Commitments/Responsibility/Our-responsiblecommitment/Folder/Human-rights/Folder/Report-on-the-implementation-of-Industry-Dialogueprinciples). Transparency report For the 3rd time, Orange published a report summarising requests made by governments for wire-tapping and requisitions (https://www.orange.com/en/Commitments/Responsibility/Reporting). Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 6 Continuing assessment of the Group's human rights impacts Updating previous studies to measure human rights impacts in the countries where we work, by an external firm, VeriskMaplecroft, which developed a methodology based on United Nations and OECD standards: updating 2015 parameters relating to the number of Orange customers, staff employed and Orange's geographic scope; inclusion of new elements such as the presence of the Orange Foundation in the relevant countries. With the help of VeriskMaplecroft, implementation of a gap analysis process between national and international standards and their comparison with a few regulatory frameworks in the countries: 3 countries were chosen to test and refine the process: a more complete use in underway. Participating for the second time in the specific assessment carried out by the Ranking Digital Rights organisation, on protection of privacy and freedom of expression by the 20 biggest worldwide players in ICT. The results will enable us to improve our procedures and reinforce internal dialogue on the topic. Employee awareness Ongoing participation, within EDH (Companies for Human Rights, an organisation grouping 14 major French companies) in various initiatives, including preparing a specialised e-learning module. The module was tested in 2015 and finalised in 2016; a version accessible to persons with disabilities is being trialled and will be deployed in over 90% of the Group's countries, in French and English versions. RAISING INTERNAL AWARENESS ON RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES The concept of responsibility is an integral part of the corporate momentum on which the Essentials2020 strategic plan is based. As such, it must be assimilated throughout all of the Group’s activities and businesses. To that end, additional general awareness-raising sessions and business-specific training will be rolled out. Our 2016 achievements Continuing integration of CSR into professional training Responsible purchasing and logistics 30 buyers trained in 2016, including 16 for Orange Senegal, and Orange Mali. Since 2013, 429 buyers or sales employees were trained. For logistics chain personnel (target: 620 colleagues from the Europe and OMEA zones): development of a 30 minute e-learning module in French and English, launched early 2017; the module helps each logistics colleague to understand CSR, providing key information for including it in their work. On completing the module, colleagues are invited to share their experiences and practices within the Logistics community, on Plazza, the company social network. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 7 Orange Business Services In France, professionalisation of CSR contacts at each Business Branch, responsible for helping sales reps to better integrate customers' expectations around CSR Networks Several sessions raising environmental awareness integrated into existing training modules, especially in terms of network architecture Responsible marketing Two hour module including case-studies and a Q&A session, intended for new product managers and systematically included in training sessions in France. In 2016 there were 4 sessions and 43 participants. Responsible marketing committee set up, bringing together representatives from Group entities involved in marketing (marketing, innovation, customer experience, countries), which launched a major listening exercise within the marketing community, comprising an online questionnaire sent to the Group's 4,000 marketing professionals. Following this exercise, which saw an excellent response rate, 200 marketing professionals signed up voluntarily to be ambassadors for the initiative at their entity; the project is up and running as meaningful marketing . Responsible communication An online training module, created with help from 2 external experts in the field, was made available to accompany distribution of the new Code for Responsible Communication to all communication professionals in the Group (1,200 people). This self-training module is accessed through the Communication School , a campus dedicated to the Group's communication division, and was promoted through Plazza. The new Code for Responsible Communication, which came out in November 2016, is structured around the challenges of communication that shows solidarity and is respectful, transparent, and committed. It reasserts Orange's cast-iron rules for advertising and communication, in particular with regard to child protection, data protection, message clarity and the need to combat stereotypes. With this code, Orange aims to share the same rules, for visuals and messages, in all countries where it is present. REFINING OUR CSR POLICIES TO MEET STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS As part of its quest to share value with society, the Orange Group’s CSR approach draws on an iterative, structured dialogue with all of its stakeholders. This listening process, based on the principles of the AA1000 standard (inclusivity – materiality – responsiveness) makes it possible to:  ensure that the Group’s CSR projects are consistent with stakeholders’ priorities;  identify and prioritize the risks related to social and environmental issues in the countries where Orange operates, with a focus on detecting “weak signals”;  identify opportunities for innovation opening up new prospects of growth for Orange while supporting the social and economic development of the countries concerned. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 8 While this approach is fully mature, its success also depends on its capacity to be reinvented:  by country: while virtually all Orange countries have already successfully undertaken this type of dialogue, certain countries, particularly those where Orange’s investments are very recent, have yet to hold their first sessions. In other countries, relaunching sessions on a regular basis means that policies can be adjusted to take into account newly-identified risks and opportunities;  by theme: themed dialogues have already been held (women and ICTs, children and technology), but must be further developed; other key issues for Orange will be regularly identified and scanned in the same way;  at the Group level: certain cross-cutting issues which are particularly important for the Group will require a holistic and multi-local approach. Diversity and workplace equality will become the first topic addressed via this approach. Our 2016 achievements Dialogues by country Dialogues 2016: Romania and France IN 2016, 50 dialogues took place in 20 countries, in some cases for the second time (France, Romania, Niger, Jordan, and Senegal). Only Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius, Slovakia and the newly acquired subsidiaries have not yet carried out these dialogues; they will do so by 2018 Dialogues by topic  Women and ICT: after Niger and Senegal, a 3rd m-women dialogue was launched in Guinea Conakry.  Health: the dialogue carried out in urban and rural areas of Senegal (December 2016), with health professionals from the public and private sectors, authorities and patients, revealed strong expectations in terms of diagnostic services, remote medical follow-up, and training for medical staff. Group Dialogue  Group dialogue on diversity and professional equality, carried out in 6 countries (France, Senegal, Jordan, Romania, OBS Russia, OBS India), connecting internal (over 700 employees) and external stakeholders; extensive use of digital, notably for the international interactive video chat with members of the Executive Committee and employees on 8 March; overall conclusions delivered on 4 July, with contributions from all stakeholders. On 6 December 2016, Orange was awarded the 2016 Grand Prize for Diversity by Diversity Conseil , for its Global Diversity Policy and in particular for the Stakeholders Dialogue on the topics of diversity and professional equality.  Group dialogue on the circular economy: launched at COP22 with an interactive video chat with a member of the Executive Committee and a representative of the Ellen McArthur Foundation (over 600 participants connected, from 26 countries (70% external stakeholders, 30% employees)), including a Digital café launched for the general public, face-to-face interviews with strategic internal and external actors, and workshops bringing experts and employees together. Reporting will take place in the 1st half of 2017. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 9 ASSESSING DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY’S IMPACT ON OUR LIVES Digital technology is changing the way we live, communicate and think about the world. Orange wants to ensure that these changes are always synonymous with progress, giving everyone the means to better understand the changes that digital technology entails, and to make it a contributor to positive transformation. To that end, the Group spearheads an open collaborative platform, the Digital Society Forum (DSF), which involves a range of stakeholders from civil society. The Group actively monitors all of these changes in order to anticipate them and better introduce the issues and the DSF’s work to a broader public. Our 2016 achievements Continuing work by the DSF Launch of 2 new forums: Digital technology and employment and New forms of citizenship in the digital age . In all there have been 11 forums since 2013, which are regularly updated and tracked, in particular through workshops and meetings (over 50 workshops in France, participation in events like the Digital Forum Impact in Morocco, Changer d'ère , World Forum in Lille, Avignon Forum, Annual Forum of the Grenoble School of Management) or articles. The DSF community has doubled this year and now exceeds 8,000 members. Developing the Digital Society Forum and its international profile Senegal: first workshop in the first quarter of 2016; Digital Society Forum deployed at a major event on 1 December in Dakar, on the topic digital technology and employment . Further workshops will follow in all the countries. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 10 Orange, a trusted operator For its customers For its employees For its suppliers Digital technology is changing the world, and Orange believes that everyone should experience that change with confidence and trust. But trust cannot be asserted, it must be earned. Which is why we are working at every level of the company to be seen by all of our stakeholders, external and internal, as the partner for trust in a positive, simple and safe digital world. With peace of mind for all. SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS IN THEIR DIGITAL LIVES With Essentials2020, Orange has set itself the objective of giving all of its customers an unmatched daily experience. Through the quality of its products and services, of course, but also by offering support as they explore a digital world of proliferating innovation. Individuals, families, professionals or companies: Orange strives to connect them all to what they need, simply and with complete peace of mind. Providing an unmatched customer experience To ensure that all of its customers enjoy an unmatched experience, Orange is rolling out an internal transformation programme focused on three key areas of action and two levers:  three priority areas of action: upgrading our network and services so all our customers are even happier with a network that connects them at all times to what’s essential to them; digitalisation that helps make the customer relationship seamless and personalised; and simplification, which brings the customer peace of mind and improves internal efficiency;  a technological lever: individualised knowledge of the customer thanks to digital insight tools – such as the 360° vision or data – so we can personalise our relationship with each customer, personalise our product and service offering, as well as the quality of the network we deliver;  a human and cultural lever thanks to the Essential Voices programme, which aims to foster a culture of continuous improvement based on listening to the voices of employees and the voices of customers. This programme encompasses all lines of work, markets and countries, including our 155,000 employees and our 70,000 subcontractors and service providers. Group Indicator: Becoming and remaining number 1 by Net Promoter Score for 3 out of 4 customers by 2018 % of customers who rank Orange as their No 1 recommendation 2015: 47% 2016 55% Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 11 Our 2016 achievements A better understanding of customers:  Individual measurement of network quality for each customer in 5 countries; ongoing deployment to 7 additional countries  Transformation plan created for Orange Poland and Orange Romania, based on the customer journey in France. Digitalisation: Continuing to reduce the number of customer calls to call centers by improving the quality of the service and developing ever more effective digital interfaces:  39% of digital interactions (up 6 points in a year), with a target of 50% by 2018  13.5 million active users of the Orange and me application (up 23% in one year), available for the entire footprint  developing customer relations via chat, the support forum, social networks and messaging; 80% of journeys start via digital media Continuing deployment of Smart Stores: 157 smart stores deployed at end 2016 (65 in France, 79 in Europe, 13 in Middle Est and Africa). Listening to customers and employees: The first half year saw a series of workshops bring together 155 participants from various Group countries, to jointly define an action plan for continuous improvement and propose a method for its implementation. The work defined a Group action plan that was approved by the Executive Committee in November 2016. The three main elements of the plan are:  Put executive directors and managers into the field: undertaking to spend at least one day a year with front-line staff;  Launch the improvement programmes and their follow-up in all Group entities  Carry out specific and detailed analysis of detractors (customers who would not recommend Orange) identified by the Net Promoter Score: general adoption of call-back plans for detractor customers, quality cycles to resolve front-line problems Continuing the programme to simplify offers and the customer journey This programme reduces the number of calls by 10% in the year. Managing customers’ data in a trustworthy way and help them manage their own As everyday life is increasingly virtual and paperless, the volumes of data carried on operators’ networks are increasing exponentially. Much of that data is personal data generated by users themselves. However, users are increasingly questioning how the digital information they share is used and whether it is really confidential. Orange is striving to develop a secure digital environment that reassures both individuals and companies. The first major step in that direction has already been taken, with the publication of Orange’s commitments on data protection and respect of privacy. However, the Group must continue to extend its application by completing the existing procedures and rolling out easy-to-use tools for customers and users, so they can control and manage their personal data and the way it is used on Orange platforms. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 12 Our 2016 achievements Implementing governance focused on responsible and proper management of customer data Launch of the international Data Strategy & Governance programme. The Orange Executive Committee established this programme to define best practice for maximising use of our customers' data for innovation, improving the customer experience, fighting fraud and increasing our operational performance. At the core of this best practice are principles of the legitimate and responsible use of the data. By integrating protection by default into all our professions, into our culture, we are already anticipating our customers' growing need to trust in Orange. Orange is therefore developing an approach that goes beyond compliance, and which provides our customers with simple applications to control and manage the data they share with Orange. A final part of this approach is the appointment by the Executive Committee of a Data Protection Officer at the Group level, in order to oversee and support Orange in the implementation of data protection. Customers control and manage the personal data they provide on Orange platforms, for all services managed by Orange Launch of a badge of trust in France for 6 Orange mobile applications and 5 partner applications. The badge of trust is an application which enables a customer using mobile applications on a smartphone to understand which data is used by these applications, and to control how it is used when the application allows it. In France, in-store introduction of training modules for customers on protecting their personal data. Helping families use technologies safely, responsibly and creatively Orange has made the development of secure, responsible and creative digital practices for children a priority. Its commitment relies on the “Better Internet for kids” policy which aims to empower parents to help them take charge and allow their children to make the best of the digital world. Orange has set itself a roadmap to develop marketing offers in order to meet families’ concerns, to build campaigns for parents and children on safe and responsible digital uses and to promote creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and education, for instance by launching coding sessions for kids throughout the Group. More broadly, Orange works at defining and implementing a responsible marketing frame when addressing children on new technologies including the Internet of things. Our 2016 achievements Developing family offers in European countries, using the foundations of Better Internet for Kids Europe Numerous initiatives carried out. A few examples: In France:  Launch of the website for parents (espacedesparents.fr), with themed pages, practical guides and tips from experts, as well as a forum to encourage discussions between parents about good digital usage habits; Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 13 In Spain (see all CSR initiatives: somosresponsables.orange.es):  Educar para proteger (educate to protect) : in-store advice and training in safe internet use, in return for a €5 donation to an organisation providing digital skills training to young people at risk of social exclusion.  Collaborative e-learning platform for primary and secondary school teachers on how to teach the digital and using it safely and responsibly (www.educainternet.orange.es). In 2016, 1,500 teachers used the platform. In Poland:  Launch of the Chroń Dzieci w Sieci parental control application for smartphone and tablet (monitors time spent online, applications used and content of websites visited).  In-store support for parents wanting advice about good digital practices. 200 Orange advisers trained  Online lesson “Bezpiecznie Tu i Tam” (Staying safe here and there) for parents, in partnership with the Dajemy Dzieciom Siłę Foundation, the best-known Polish organisation working for the protection of children online.  Megamission (fundacja.orange.pl/megamission.html), a free educational programme on best practice for using digital technology, designed for primary school children. In Slovakia:  Continuing free workshops for parents, children and teachers, to build awareness of safe internet use, with support from psychologists trained in the topic. Launched in 2013, these workshops are attended by more than 5,000 children each year, and 500 parents and teachers. Orange Slovakia has been carrying out initiatives for child protection since 2006. OMEA Helping OMEA countries to develop family and young person offers along the lines of Better Internet for Kids (BIK), as adapted to the context and the zone. First initiatives in the OMEA area Senegal :  Launch of awareness campaigns via the Better Internet for Kids Facebook page.  Recruiting young BIK ambassadors to directly address young people and support them in making safe use of digital technology. Their mission is to create a network of influencers for good digital practice (in particular by encouraging viral distribution of BIK campaigns), to flag up unethical content and practice, and to run BIK events. Egypt:  Launch of an anti-bullying campaign via the Skit Game application with the Not-Guilty organisation [http://www.skitgame.com]. The idea is to help children deal with bullying though the medium of a game with 25 levels. Defining and implementing a marketing framework for connected objects (IoT) that might be used by children This framework must respect precautionary principles linked to electromagnetic radiation, and recommendations on usage depending on age as issued by the education community in each country. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 14 The offers for young people guidelines were approved in July 2016 and sent to the Orange marketing and CSR community, so that safe and responsible usage of our products and services is considered when designing and marketing offers. An update is planned to include changes in offers, especially offers including virtual reality functions. A questionnaire and recommendations for all product managers on 7 issues relating to safe and responsible usage was integrated into the Group innovation and offer definition process, so as to promote more responsible design of our offers. Deploying #SuperCoders and taking it to a broader scope, with sessions throughout the year Success of the initiative : 17 countries taking part in the #SuperCoders programme (http://supercoders.orange.com/fr/accueil) 4 countries on launch in 2014 and 9 in 2015. More than 7,500 children have now benefited from #SuperCoders workshops, with the support of 1,000 Orange volunteers trained in programming on the Scratch platform.  Launch of the #SuperCoders festival during Europe Code Week (October 2016) : videoconferences between the countries enabled children to discuss their Scratch software creations.  The Code for COP challenge, launched last year for COP21, was repeated this year for COP22 in Marrakesh. Seven projects from Cameroon, Romania, Tunisia and France won prizes.  France: In November, 29 introductory workshops on digital technology in 21 towns in mainland France, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Reunion. 13 secondary schools, including several belonging to the Priority Education Network (REP), helped to organise workshops in which nearly 1,500 students and 650 Orange employee volunteer coaches took part.  Poland: #SuperCoders arrived in 30 schools for children ages 9 to 12. Teachers use coding to teach maths, natural sciences, music and languages. If the results are positive, the programme will be extended to all schools in the country. In December, #SuperCoders won 1st Prize in the European Digital Skills Awards challenge set by the European Commission, in the Digital Skills for all Citizens category. This is recognition of the Group's actions in the field of digital education, for an international project delivered by Orange employee volunteers. Answering questions about radio waves Exposure to radiowaves, particularly antennas, raises concerns about possible health effects. To date, no health effects have been confirmed. However, while waiting for confirmation from ongoing additional studies, particularly regarding children and long-term usage, some health authorities have issued warnings about usage in order to reduce exposure to radiowaves from mobile telephones. Orange will continue to pro-actively provide information and support for all stakeholders. Internally, Orange provides training on the specific safety rules for staff working near or on radio antennas. Our 2016 achievements Continuing deployment of health and safety information and training on radio waves for employees working near antennas Internally:  90 technicians trained in Côte d’Ivoire. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 15  Creation of a tool developed by Orange Lab to help calculate security perimeters around antennae.  Updates to the staff guide and simplified booklet for technicians on best health and safety practices on Orange premises.  In France, information conveyed to H&S officers and company doctors. Externally:  Orange was one of the main contributors to a new ITU-T recommendation on exposure levels around radio antennas for worker safety.  In Poland: participating with other operators, the regulator and environmental organisations in developing a new law on construction and maintenance procedures for base stations. Continuing promotion of best practice Internally:  The radio waves policy for children has been updated  A policy on virtual reality headset use by children has been issued  In Egypt an event was organised in August 2016 for over one hundred journalists on responsible mobile phone use . Experts presented current knowledge and answered questions on exposure, emissions and health, providing recommendations for those wishing to limit exposure to mobile phones. The event was reported in over 60 newspapers and magazines. Externally:  Leaflets showing health and safety icons are now included in mobile packaging in five languages in all Orange countries.  The radio waves website has been translated into Arabic (the website’s 7th language)  In France: updates to the my mobile and my health leaflet with the French Telecoms Federation, following the publication of the latest ANSES (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) opinion and report in July 2016 on children's exposure to radio frequencies. Participation in the ANSES committee with the stakeholders: representatives, charities, public bodies (3 meetings in 2016). Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 16 BUILDING A DIGITAL AND HUMAN COMPANY MODEL Building a company model which is both digital and human is one of the five levers of the Essentials2020 strategy. This ambition is focused on three areas:  guaranteeing the skills needed for the future : identifying key skills for the future, recognising and developing in-house skills, recruiting profiles displaying these skills;  developing our collective agility : making our organisation and operating methods agile and cross-functional, focusing on digitalisation and simplification and promoting innovation, initiative, and experimentation;  getting everyone involved : enhancing our management culture and fostering employee commitment by empowering them and encouraging initiative. Group Indicators Achieve 90% of employees who would recommend Orange as an employer by 2018 2015 86,9% 2016 88,9% Have 50% of training courses include digital aspects by 2018 2016 not available Have 35% female representation in our management networks by 2020 2015 25% 2016 : 27.3% Our 2016 achievements Awards and Certifications Top Employer Global 2017: for the second consecutive year the Group was awarded this worldwide certification, which recognises the best human resources policies and programmes. 30 countries and territories on 5 continents where the Group operates, in particular through Orange Business Services, engaged in this process and succeeded. The Top Employer process is based on a very detailed questionnaire (policies, practices, tools, measures) backed up by a file of proofs.

At the centre of a vast industrial and economic ecosystem, with privileged access to 263 million customers, and working from a strong territorial position in Europe, Africa and the Middle-East, Orange aims to make the most of digital technology to accelerate progress for everyone. Providing access to the greater number of people, deploying essential digital services adapted to each person’s needs, supporting social innovation and entrepreneurship : these are Orange’s three drivers for action on local development. CONTRIBUTING TO REDUCE ALL FORMS OF DIGITAL DIVIDE Orange wants to contribute to fight against factors which cause digital exclusion through innovative solutions and investments. The group is thus working to ensure that the greater number of people enjoys full access to services which have become essential. Against the geographic digital divide, Orange is making massive investments in extending its fixed and mobile network coverage : accelerating the expansion of fibre and 4G networks in Europe and in the Middle East and Africa where customers’ needs are as well as reducing blank areas. Against the digital divide created by age and disabilities, Orange is rolling out a “design for all” strategy, which seeks to adapt its products and services to meet the needs of seniors and people with disabilities, and to design dedicated products which combine innovation, simplicity, and easeof-use. Against the economic divide: Orange seeks to address the economic problems faced by different groups by creating solidarity programmes or tailored offers, usually through partnerships, and to use digital technology to help boost regions and industries locally. Against social, educational, and cultural factors which cause exclusion, Orange offers awareness and equipment programmes, generally through the Orange Foundation.

In 2016, Orange contributed to funding the makeuses project by the Simplon.co Foundation, its aim to encourage women, from all backgrounds, to enter the digital sector (training, technical professions, etc.). In April 2016, Orange launched a first initiative to make young people aware of the professional opportunities of digital technology, and in particular network and IT professions. Following its success, a second season was launched in the second half of the year. The initiative comprises three sections  a Networks, IT and me MOOC (a free online training course, entertaining and interactive, with 4 weeks to learn about networks, IT and the people and professions that make them work aimed particularly at the 15-25 age group).

DEVELOPING ESSENTIAL AND INNOVATIVE SERVICES The Group is committed to ensuring that digital technology serves people. ICTs can provide solutions in many different areas, as long as users are provided with the right offer for their situation. As part of its global approach “Orange for development”, and most time with partners, the Group designs products and services which, in each field, are the best enabler of progress. Especially in the Middle East and Africa, several areas for transformation have been identified, including:  agriculture, to boost farmers’ incomes, increase agricultural productivity and enhance the global value chain;  financial service, to provide easier access to banking services via mobile and thus escape the constraints of traditional banking networks in areas where they are spread thin;  healthcare, to offer simple, reliable, effective solutions for medical services and personal care, and to help patients better manage their health and medical conditions;  the m-Women approach, which uses digital technology to help women gain independence, with essential services designed to meet their needs. Digital inclusion for women aims to generate a dramatic increase in their contributions to sustainable socio-economic development. Group Indicator: Diversify into new services generating over one billion Euros turnover by 2018. 2015 226 million euros 2016 323 million euros Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 27 Our 2016 achievements Orange Money Several avenues of development are ongoing:  Speeding up international transfers, now with money transfers between France and three African countries (Côte d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal)  Strengthening interoperability, enabling customers with bank accounts to transfer money from and to their bank accounts or electronic wallets provided by other telecoms operators  Developing B2B activity such as salary and supplier payments  Credit and savings services: partnerships with credit establishments, soon offering microcredit and savings services. In 2016, Madagascar was the first country to launch interoperability between three operators, and Cameroon launched a Visa card linked to its Orange Money account. Orange received accreditation as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI) in four countries: Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal and Guinea. Continuing to expand and intensify services for agriculture: mAgri Defining a new strategy Five years after the launch of the first Orange mAgri service, an external consultant was appointed to conduct an appraisal of mAgri in the 6 countries where the service has been launched (Niger, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal, Madagascar, Egypt). The results of the appraisal have enabled mAgri to be included as part of a global approach positioning Orange as the partner of digital transformation in Africa and the Middle East, with the service acting as a lever for growth. The strategy breaks down into 3 phases: adjustments to the existing service, integration with the global offer, and extensions to the range, in the long term targeting positive ROI. Continuing mAgri developments  Launch of mAgri in Botswana  Launch of Sandji in Mali: Sandji is a text-message-based, modern aid to decision-making, developed to help small-holders plan farming activity, on the basis of 48 hour rain forecasts for the farmer's specific area, as well as seasonal forecasts.  Launch of Bashaier in Egypt, the first online network for agricultural marketing, with subscribers receiving regular texts giving prices for fruit and vegetables and aromatic and medicinal herbs. Deploying eHealth services  Cameroon: Activa Makala: health insurance solutions via Orange Money, providing financial support to insured parties who are incapacitated for at least 5 days due to personal injury  Egypt: Be Healthy Be Mobile : in partnership with the WHO and IUT, the United Nations agency for ITC, to improve prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).

Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 28  Côte 'd'Ivoire: launch of the HIV response project with ONUSIDA: text messages, quizzes and surveys sent to raise awareness among patients on taking antiretroviral medication. A first pilot phase launched in the second quarter of 2016, for 1,000 patients managed by 3 NGOs, gave rise to very positive results.  Mali and Senegal: launch of a vaccination reminder service. In Senegal, during the pilot phase, more than 14,000 users benefited from the service free of charge. m-Women  Launch of a partnership between Orange Senegal and the Sooretul start-up, which uses an online platform to sell local agricultural products processed by women's groups. By end 2016: 3,540 women were directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural entities; more than 400 products listed; 18 SMEs involved across 8 regions;  Partnership in Côte d'Ivoire with BEL, for the Community offer as part of a Social Incentive project for around 200 women street-sellers of BEL dairy products. The aim is to increase their standard of living and improve their product hygiene and conservation skills. This type of project enables access to specialised training content without cost constraints, thereby contributing to women's independence. Inclusion of a savings solution to pay for their children's school fees  Launch of the Cycle M service, a family planning solution that forms part of government policy in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The service offers menstrual cycle tracking by mobile phone. The application makes it easy to track the important dates within a menstrual cycle, to help reduce social difficulty associated with failures in family planning: early pregnancies, deaths associated with back-street abortion, difficulties for mothers in meeting the needs of large families and for young parents. After three months of operation: 73,049 users, including 43,192 active users.  Egypt: launch of Private Recharge in May 2016. This is a free, private top-up service whereby Orange subscribers, in particular women who are worried about harassment by mobile, can buy a prepaid electronic top-up without having to give their phone number to the sales-person. In 2015 the similar service launched in Iraq was nominated by the GSMA in the best mobile services in emerging countries category. Today 5% of Orange Egypt's subscribers are regularly using the service, which has recorded 2,366,113 transactions per month since its launch. Access to energy Access to electricity is a major challenge for the African continent, where Orange can play a major role by capitalising on its brand, its market presence and its technical personnel, thereby establishing a channel for diversification in a field where the business stakes are high and which will also reinforce our positive and participatory role in the zone. Orange is developing 2 separate offers:  Smart metering services, a B2B offer for electricity transport and distribution network operators PowerCos, to enable better management of their operations, billing and oversight. The service is based on an electric meter with an in-built module that communicates with a service platform managed by Orange. This helps reduce technical failures, with improved production resource allocation and through the ability to detect power distribution problems in real time. The service also aims to reduce commercial losses by offering innovations around billing (in particular pre and post payment with Orange Money) as well as in the area of detecting and fighting fraud. Finally, Orange is seeking to help the Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 29 PowerCos in digitalising their management, enabling their end customers to manage their contractual relationship (subscriptions, price plans, etc.) using digital tools (mobile applications) and to access detailed usage data so they can control and optimise their energy consumption.  Increased electrification in rural areas in partnership with Engie, to offer electricity production and distribution solutions in rural and inaccessible zones that do not have access to the national grid, for example using simple, individual solar kits. The first pilot projects were launched in Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Senegal in late 2016. SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP In today’s hyper-connected world, it is easier than ever before to open up and collaborate with extremely diverse talents in order to become more creative, more effective and more innovative to benefit everyone. Because Orange believes that working in partnership with a broad range of innovators (start-ups, major groups, investors, universities, students, governments, NGOs, etc.) will lead to more creativity and more effectiveness and more economic impact, the Group fosters synergies among stakeholders by creating ecosystems for support and sharing knowledge through an open innovation process. Orange is investing in efforts to spot, support, and promote digital talents. Group Indicator: A 15 % yearly increase in the number of entrepreneurs supported by our initiatives for local economic and social development 2015: 150 entrepreneurs supported 2016: 239 entrepreneurs supported, a 58% increase compared to 2015. The entrepreneurs are supported through the following initiatives: the La Ruche network (5 incubators in France) ; the 4 African incubators (Senegal, Niger, Guinea and Mali) ; the Orange Social Entrepreneur Prize. The strong growth in the 2015-16 period is tied to new site openings. Between now and 2020 average annual growth should stabilise at 15% (logarithmic curve). Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 30 Our 2016 achievements Orange promotes support mechanisms for each stage of a start-up's life: the full entrepreneurial journey is catered for, from idea to incubation, including funding. Identifying Orange deploys detection mechanisms worldwide to anticipate new digital uses and support the most advanced start-ups in responding to them.  Upstream, Orange's research and innovation at the Orange Labs explores fields as varied as mobile financial services, content aggregation, mobile communication services, networks, IoT, Big Data, and so on.

The three prize-winners receive grants ranging from €25,000 for first prize to €5,000 for the special cultural prize. Finalists in both competitions will benefit from close support from the Grow Movement NGO as well as Orange experts, for a period of 6 months. Orange also funds a patent application for the First Prize. The Orange Prize for Social Entrepreneurship in Africa is a real success. Since 2011, over 3,500 projects have been presented. 95% of winning start-ups, since the very beginning of the prize, continue to grow today.  In 2016, Orange supported the launch of the Digital Impact challenge, with winners benefiting from the multi-partner programme of incubation and acceleration for positive economy startups provided by Orange and the Ruches network.  Creation of the Entrepreneur Club website: a new information space in French and English dedicated to business creators in Africa and the Middle East. The site provides information for entrepreneurs and puts them in contact with Orange's various entrepreneurship support schemes. Entrepreneur Club also offers practical information and the tools needed to start a business. Similarly, Orange is part of the Africa Innovation incubator network, which brings incubators together across the African continent. Supporting  Orange Fab, the Group's international network of start-up accelerators (12 facilities on 4 continents), exists to support already existing start-ups in transitioning to the next level. Selection begins with locally initiated calls for applications. For each session, 2 to 7 start-ups join the local Orange Fab programme. The Orange Fab facilities offer support to the selected start-ups for a minimum of three months, providing equipment and human Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 31 resources (training and mentoring by our experts, co-working spaces, access to Orange's international network in line with the start-up's development potential).  Incubation: the start-ups benefit, over a longer period, from a mixed environment that favours their development. Each incubator is run by different stakeholders, so as to optimise conditions for the success of the incubated company. In 2016 there were two new launches, in Mali (CREATEAM) and Guinea (SABOUTECH); they join existing incubators already launched in Senegal (CTIC) and Niger (CIPMEN). The latter two incubators saw their premises double in size in 2016, enabling more hosting capacity in 2017, an essential requirement for a stable economic model.  Orange Digital Investment meets the funding needs of start-ups, whatever their level of maturity, with various finance mechanisms. The facility was set up in 2016, to manage the Group's investments with the aim either of making a financial return, or creating synergies to improve products and services delivered by Orange to its customers. Orange Digital Investment is the umbrella for Orange's investment activities in start-ups.  Local seed capital, for instance Sonatel's acquisition of a share of Teranga Capital in Senegal in March 2016.  The Orange Partner and Orange Developer programmes provide technical support to startups: providing developers worldwide with free access to 20 programming interfaces (APIs), which companies can use to imagine and develop digital applications and services. Numerous other resources are also made available to help complete their projects, such IoT development kits (LoRa), a product test service with panels of Orange customer users, instruction tutorials and content for using APIs, etc. Promoting  Go Ignite To support start-ups with international ambitions, Orange has linked up with other major telecoms players to establish Go Ignite, which was created in 2015. This international alliance aims to connect start-ups to an ecosystem covering Africa, Asia-Pacific, Australia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle-East. Go Ignite offers innovative startups the opportunity to access a market in excess of one billion customers.  Hello Startup The Hello Startup programme with BFMTV is an Orange initiative. Each week a guest (a startup director or representative) answers a journalist's questions, presenting the business's challenges, projects and ambitions. Since its launch in 2014, the show has hosted over 100 start-ups.  Participating in French Tech The French Tech initiative aims to promote a public national and regional drive to support the technological start-up ecosystem in France, to make France one of the major start-up nations and to encourage the development of economic value and employment in France. Orange confirmed its support for the French Tech initiative, as an actor in the digital ecosystems of the 13 centres with the French Tech label (Rennes, Brest, Nantes, Lille, Normandie, Lorraine, Paris, Lyon, Nice, Aix-Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse and Bordeaux) Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 32 and the 4 French Tech thematic territories (Avignon, Saint Etienne, Alsace, Angers), as well as French Tech Loire Valley. Orange is supporting and promoting French IoT start-ups, grouped under the French Tech Connected Objects umbrella. In October 2015, Orange signed a charter to promote these connected objects at its points of sale. Orange again supported Connected Objects Week , which in 2016 took place in May.  Vivatech In June 2016, Orange contributed to creating Viva technology Paris, which for 3 days turned Paris into the start-up capital of the world, enabling 5,000 start-ups from all over the globe to present their projects at the Porte de Versailles Paris-Expo facility. It was an opportunity for the participants to experience the best of global tech, and discover the 250 innovations premièred. The programme included lectures (to help young entrepreneurs get started but also on social questions around digital technology), workshops (digital art, coding), start-up pitches, etc. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 33 Promoting energy and ecological transition Orange deploys ambitious solutions and action plans to support ecological and energy transition in the fields of climate change, resource and waste management and the protection of biodiversity. Numerous business lines are working to reduce its energy consumption and CO2 emissions, to improve the disposal of its equipment and promote recycling, and to research more eco-responsible solutions for its customers. During COP21 held in Paris, at the end of 2015, Orange renewed its commitment towards the environment protection and set 2 new priorities:  reducing our CO2 emissions by 50% per customer use between 2006 and 2020  integrating the principles of the circular economy into its organisation and processes by adapting its organization accordingly ADOPTING A SYSTEMIC APPROACH ISO14001 Orange has set the goal of extending its ISO 14001 certified scope to 60% of its activities Groupwide by the end of 2016. Our 2016 achievements At end 2016, the scope certified stood at 66.82%. Orange France joins the Group subsidiaries that are 100% certified (Orange Spain, Orange Slovakia, Orange Romania, Orange Egypt, Orange Mali, Orange Marine, and the Group head office) In 2016, all ISO 14001-certified Group organisations successfully underwent renewal or follow-up audits. The KPI measuring the extent of the certified scope with reference to all our activities increased by nearly one third compared to 2016. Circular economy In December 2015, during the COP21, the group committed to integrating the principles of the circular economy into its organisation and processes by adapting its organization accordingly, by 2020. This commitment involves a progressive change of our economic models and processes, in line with our ecosystem, and covers several projects: eco-design, reducing our critical resources consumption, optimizing waste management, giving a second life to electronic and electrical waste. This approach contributes to our our objective on reducing CO² emissions. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 34 Our 2016 achievements  Creation of a dedicated cross-business strategic committee, with a first meeting held in November 2016  A collaborative project, with members of the Ellen MacArthur foundation, to make our technical and networks equipment modular, for improved re-use and recycling potential, changing the business model from ownership to usage focused.  One phase in deploying the circular economy requires reference suppliers to be trained in the concept. Five people received the training proposed by the Foundation.  An international stakeholders dialogue is under way and will run until March 2017, with a focus on four countries: France, Poland, Egypt and Spain (see section Adjusting our CSR policies in line with stakeholder expectations , page 7). REDUCING OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT Technology now plays a role in all areas of human activity. In transforming the traditional approach to industry, digital technology represents part of the solution for reducing environmental impacts of all sectors. At the heart of this revolution, telecom operators, data producers, and indeed all of the world’s socio-economic actors are multiplying the uses of digital technology. Orange is at the forefront of those seeking to reduce their own environmental footprint. During the COP21, held in Paris in December 2015, Orange set itself an ambitious new target: a 50% reduction in its CO2 emissions per customer use in 2020 (compared to 2006). A new target to further optimise the effectiveness of its action plans and investments. Group indicator: Reducing our CO2 emissions by 50% per customer use between 2006 and 2020. 2006-2016: reduction of 48.23% Our 2016achievements 2016 saw our overall CO2 emissions per customer use reduced by 48.23% in the period 2006 to 2016. Networks and information systems In 2016 these represented nearly 68.2% of the Group’s CO 2 emissions, and 72% of its consumption. A major energy action plan was launched in 2008 to reduce energy consumption linked to their operation: Green ITN 2020. Continuing deployment of drivers of energy savings:  Intensification of cooperation with equipment suppliers in order to develop high energy efficiency telecommunications equipment between now and 2020 Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 35  Energy audits of 13 major technical sites in France, and definition of an action plan to classify the actions to take according to effectiveness, for general application across all major technical sites in France;  In Africa and the Middle-East, continuing deployment of solar energy on radio sites in the region, with over 2,800 sites operational in 2016.  Orange Jordan's decision to switch to 100% renewable energy with the completion of the solar farms project with a power rating of 34 MW which, in 2017, will cover all the operator's electricity requirements, i.e. 57 GWh, avoiding the emission of 40,000 tonnes of CO 2 every year.  Selection of energy conversion equipment and deployment of smart meters on technical sites to optimise energy consumption. Thanks to all the actions taken, we have saved 3.5 TWh of electricity in the period 2010 2016, which is around 77% of our annual consumption, and 217 million litres of fuel oil (around 3 times our annual consumption). Tertiary buildings Buildings represent nearly 22.6% of the Group’s CO 2 emissions, and 22.1% of its consumption. To reduce this energy consumption, it must be measured. Analysis and use of measurement data helps speed up transformation of uses and processes, as well as reducing consumption In France,  continuing equipment of tertiary buildings with instruments to measure the consumption of multiple fluids; 120 of the biggest mixed and tertiary sites equipped by end 2016, compared to 110 in 2015  continuing audits and controls of service providers to identify opportunities to improve energy management in buildings (830,000 m2 building area at end 2016, compared to 562,000 m2 in 2015) In the other European countries, the deployment of measuring devices for energy consumption by office and computer equipment has been completed by all countries. Optimisation programmes established in 2015 and continuing in 2016 enabled a number of countries to reduce consumption by this equipment by 30% to 50%, thanks to better management of the equipment outside working hours. Travel Travel accounts for nearly 10% of the Group’s CO 2 emissions, and 6% of its consumption. Electric vehicles, limiting business travel, promoting collaborative and solidarity transport methods: Orange is exploring innovative technological and human solutions to reduce its emissions Fleet optimisation Continuing deployment, with 650 shared vehicles by end 2016 and a deployment target of over 1000 additional vehicles in 2017. Orange has the biggest fleet of shared vehicles in France. Green fleet Nearly 250 electric vehicles by end 2016, and over 210 hybrids. Deployment of electric vehicle recharging equipment in Orange buildings, at a rate of one charging station per vehicle ordered. Over 500 charging stations deployed. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 36 Push initiated in 2016 to choose petrol engine vehicles, both for company cars (1/3 of the catalogue offer is petrol engines) and cars used as utility vehicles (25% of Clio ordered with petrol engines) Several entities have taken measures to limit the use of individual cars (Company Transport Plans, carpooling, car sharing, eco-driving training, alternative mobility (e.g. electric bicycles), etc.). Videoconferencing Several solutions are available to staff enabling reductions in business travel (video-conferencing, tele-presence, collaborative teleworking portals, etc.). Facility occupation rates are increasing worldwide, at 14.5% (16.8% in France). LIMITING OUR IMPACTS ON NATURAL RESSOURCES Collecting and sorting equipment and waste In order to improve collection and sorting, which are essential steps in re-use of equipment, recycling, tracability, and waste management, Orange has chosen to enhance and optimise its waste management system and to promote collection of its customers’ old mobiles. Increasing use of eco-design In addition to limiting its direct impact, Orange seeks to reduce throughout their lifecycle the environmental impact of the products and services sold to its customers. That means using ecodesign processes for products and services. Group Indicator: Collect 30% of our customers’ used mobile devices in Europe by 2020. Collection rate in 2016: 15.3% Our 2016 achievements Management of electric and electronic equipment Strengthening and optimising systems for managing used equipment, to encourage re-use, recycling and traceability. In 2016, 60,954 tons of waste were re-purposed (i.e. waste was re-used, the materials re-cycled, or power generated), an improvement of 5% on 2015.  In Europe, a centralised process was established to re-use network equipment and monitor results by country. A first initiative is under way in France.  OMEA: 1st pilot scheme in Senegal for 45.3 tons of WEEE from the network, enabling financial and environmental optimisation, as well as traceability of the various sub-components (electronics, ferrous and non-ferrous metal). A consultation is under way in Mali to select a WEEE collection and processing service provider. Orange / Corporate Social Responsability / 2016 review 37 Mobile collection Collection rate in 2016: 15.3%, up by 9% compared to the previous year. This increase is due in particular to excellent performance in Romania, where the collection rate is 34%, and good scores in France (19.3%) and Slovakia (15.9%). 1.8 million mobiles were collected in 2016, for a total of 9.7 million since 2010. In 2016, a new mobile collection workshop has been set up in Cameroon (the 6 th opened), in cooperation with Emmaüs International. Since 2010, over 1.5 million mobiles of mobile phone waste have been collected, i.e. 250 tonnes. 30 permanent jobs have been created. Eco-design  Eco-design of the new Livebox 4 (more compact design, reduced packaging using cardboard from sustainably managed forests and vegetable-based inks). This project earned recognition for Orange at the Mariannes d'Or for sustainable development.  Study carried out with Sagemcom on using recycled plastics from the Livebox 3 to build new shells.  Software eco-design energy audit of 4 applications: Orange Football Club, Mon Réseau, Orange Travel, Orange Money; introduction of recommendations on Orange Travel in 2016 Environmental rating of products Creation of the Open Eco Rating platform with Telefonica and Huawei, to perfect a uniform approach to calculating the environmental and social impact of mobiles, making it clearer and more transparent for consumers. The platform is accessible to operators and manufacturers. To provide better comparability, the Open Eco Rating method replaces the ecosystems used independently by operators like Telefonica and Orange. MAKING THE DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AN ENABLER OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION In a world where natural resources are limited and climate change is a reality, Orange believes that digital technology is part of the solution and can make positive contributions to the environmental and energy transition. That’s why Orange designs and develops services and solutions to encourage sustainable alternatives for smart cities, M2M, energy optimisation, carbon footprint reduction, ecofriendly travel, and more. Taking part in new schemes Digital technologies can contribute to reducing carbon footprints by popularizing thrifty habits. A broad range of solutions is already available for corporate customers, to improve both their operational and environmental performance. Since 2011, Orange has also been working to develop solutions tailored to the challenges of smart cities through its Smart Cities & Territories business. Orange’s offers include the use of Big Data to support governments and towns that need powerful tools to better manage rapid urbanization.
