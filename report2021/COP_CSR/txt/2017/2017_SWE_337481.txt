It is a basic human need and a human right to feel safe. Safety is subjected to many different types of threats, however. This includes military threats, terrorism, accidents or natural disasters. Saab develops innovative, cost-efficient high-tech systems to increase security for societies and individuals. At the same time, there is a realisation throughout the business that some of the systems and solutions that contribute to greater security are not only used in a state of peace, but can also be used in conflict. This entails a large responsibility. By acting responsibly in everything we do, we build the confidence of customers, employees and society and contribute to a safer world.

Saab’s sales growth was 5 per cent in 2016, in line with the long-term goal. This is a result of conscious choices over several years, with strategic investments in the development of new technologies and products and a new strategy to closely partner with customers through the marketing organisation we launched just over four years ago. Taken together, this has laid a stable foundation for profitable growth, which is also a prerequisite to creating long-term value for shareholders, customers, employees and the communities that we serve. On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Saab’s CEO, Group Management and all of our employees. For 80 years, thousands of fantastic employees have found new technological ways forward. Technological development is and has been the core of the company’s operations and success. Our mission has been to contribute to a safer society through modern defence and civil security. That was the case in 1937, and it remains so in 2017. This is what we contribute to Sweden and to many other countries around the world.

S AA B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 – 5 CEO COMMENT POSITIONED FOR CONTINUED GROWTH Saab continued to develop in the right direction in 2016. We have a strong order backlog, we have more tenders being evaluated by customers than ever before, and our product portfolio and the way we collaborate are seeing growing interest in global markets. Our position for continued profitable growth is strong and our way forward to create value for our owners and customers is clear.

With a backlog nearly four times higher than knowledge of how to collaborate on technological sales, we are positioned for further growth in 2017 development, Saab is a sought-after partner. Today and beyond. Sales increased to SEK 28.6 billion. customers often require collaborative models as part Operating income amounted to MSEK 1,797 with an operating margin of 6.3 per cent. Operational cash flow amounted to MSEK 2,603, which is a result of a conscious focus on cash flow in recent years. We saw important payments relating to our major projects and a high level of activity, including in Business Area Dynamics. A safer world enriched by differences Many places in the world are unsafe. War, conflicts, migration and unpredictable terrorism are disconcerting and horrifying. Terrorism in particular is intended to spread fear in people. This is why we remain steadfast in defending equal rights and the right of people to feel safe. With our products and services, we contribute to a more secure world. As CEO of Saab, I know how important and positive diversity is in a team, in a management group or in a workplace. We don not get stronger in spite of our differences, but because of them. Our work with gender equality was awarded the Swedish Industry Equality Prize in autumn 2016, and in the same spirit, we will continue to work with diversity in a broader sense in 2017. FROM IDEA TO CAPABILITY In recent years, we have focused on developing our product portfolio and investing to strengthen our position in the market. This has made Saab one of the most competitive companies in the industry. Investments in research and development will continue, since they are a key to remaining competitive. To stay a step ahead and meet our customers’ needs in the best way, we have a strategy built on three areas: marketing, performance and innovation. 6 – S AA B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 Our customers, whether military or civilian, are aware that they have to improve their capabilities in a fairly short time, and Saab is well equipped to help them. of any deal, so that they can develop their domestic Saab has identified four main focus areas for our defence capabilities and industrial competence. sustainability work, which are integrated into our Throughout our history, our strategy has been to business strategy.

This period of growth began in 2015. Prior to that, Saab chose for many years to invest in developing the product portfolio and a strengthened marketing organisation to create a platform for profitable growth. To ensure profitable, long-term growth, development of Saab’s portfolio and market position will continue in 2017.

At the Saab started investing heavily in development, while same time, we needed to reduce risks in the balance increasing amortisation of research and development costs. In 2014, total development costs represented 28 per cent of sales. At that point, we had secured and started development on the new generation of Gripen. In the same year, we expanded the product portfolio in surveillance radar and launched five totally new radar systems for land and sea. The new generation of Carl Gustaf, M4, was also launched in 2014. In 2015, Sweden ordered the new version of the A26 submarine and Brazil ordered the new gener­ation of Gripen. In 2016, Saab launched a new generation of the airborne surveillance system, GlobalEye.

The business model is adapted to the product area, system complexity, customer group and geographical market. COMPLEX DEFENCE ORDERS In complex defence orders, the solutions are comprehensive and often include training, maintenance, support and service over the product’s entire Complexity lifecycle. Deliveries can continue for several years after development. These COMPLEX DEFENCE ORDERS systems are configured and designed based on each customer’s specific Complex systems with long delivery needs and often have a large share of customer-financed development. times, e.g., Gripen and Erieye. In addition, complex defence orders usually entail some form of industrial co-operation, e.g., technology transfers. SUBCONTRACTOR SUBCONTRACTORS Saab can also serve as a subcontractor to a partner with primary contact Subcontractor of civilian and military with the end customer, e.g., when supplying subsystems. Several of Saab’s command and control systems, e.g., Remote Tower and 9LV, a naval command systems, such as command and control systems, are platform independent and control system. and can be integrated with other companies’ products and systems.

Through our strong base in Sweden and local presence in over 30 countries, we ensure close contact with our customers. In an increasingly complex market, a local presence and greater business orientation are critical to win strategically important deals, whether for military or civil security solutions. Since 2013, Saab's market organisation is divided into five market areas: Europe, North America, Latin America, Middle East & Africa and Asia Pacific. This organisation has strengthened Saab’s local presence in key markets. For customers, it means access to specialised expertise, while Saab gains better insight into the market. Efficiency in the marketing and sales process has improved through fewer redundancies and a clearer distribution of work. Now we work more closely with customers and have greater opportunity to offer the right combination of products and solutions. Today Saab has a more focused business culture. In less than two decades, Saab Australia has tripled sales, expanded to new fields and found new customers. A willingness to develop is the reason for the success,” says Dean Rosenfield, Managing Director, Saab Australia. Saab offers maintenance, repairs and testing of components in avionics, hydraulics, radar, optronics, mechanics and composite parts. We manufacture and deliver our own testing equipment and train our customers. SECURE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORDERS For Saab, it is important to have a steady inflow of small and medium-sized orders. They can be turned over and delivered to the customer faster than larger, more complex orders, and as a result can converted faster to sales. In many of these projects, payment is received upon delivery. Operating income in businesses with smaller orders is fairly evenly distributed over time, while profitability in large projects typically rises as a larger share of the order is delivered and the risks decline. Its strong local presence has helped Saab to grow its small and medium-sized orders. In 2016 orders below MSEK 100 amounted to MSEK 12,005, representing 55 per cent of the order intake.

GROWING TOGETHER 2 6 – S AA B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 PARTNERSHIPS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES Spreading knowledge through technology transfers offers many advantages. People from different countries and organisations meet and it results in new business ideas that create value for all the parties involved. This many times generates new business. Saab’s order backlog consists of large orders such as the Gripen combat aircraft system for Sweden and Brazil, the type A26 submarine for Sweden and an airborne radar system to the United Arab Emirates. Major deals are preceded by a procurement process that can take a number of years. When Saab signs large defence deals, the contracts usually contain more than just the sale of products. Many countries A LOCAL PRESENCE HAS HELPED SAAB IN THE US also want technology and skills transfers as well as In September, the first two aircraft co-developed by Saab and Boeing for the U.S. various forms of industrial cooperation.

Saab therefore has well-established processes to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing export controls. This is critical in order to maintain trust in the business. OUR COMPLIANCE PROGRAMME Saab maintains Group-level policies and tools to help its businesses follow the export control laws that apply to the company’s products and activities. The high standard we maintain in terms of export compliance was confirmed by the global trade publication WorldECR, which named Saab one of three European Export Controls Compliance teams of the year. The head of export control is responsible for the company’s overarching policy, directives and governing policy documents as well as for providing advice to the businesses on operational issues and monitoring compliance within the company. In addition, each business area has its own export control organisation to manage the work at an operational level. To encourage collaboration and prioritise needs, Saab also has an export control council with representatives from various parts of the business. Continuous internal training on export controls is provided for employees who come in contact with controlled products or technologies. Web-based introductory training is also available to Saab’s employees. For export control officers and other key The UN Charter establishes that every country has employees, a biannual conference is held to increase the right – and obligation – to protect its citizens understanding of various export controls and related against acts of aggression.

The largest part of Saab’s exports is trade in conventional arms. from Sweden, where the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls (ISP) determines on behalf of the government which defence products Saab may sell to which countries. WHAT SAAB SELLS TO WHOM The export of defence materiel requires a permit from the competent authority. Such permits could be issued if there are security and defence policy reasons for the export and if it is consistent with Swedish foreign policy interests. Decisions on export permits are made on a case-by-case basis where ISP weighs a number of criteria in a comprehensive assessment. ISP also takes into account the type of product the decision involves. 3 0 – S AA B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 A restructuring of the Indian defence Ten years ago, Saab made the decision market has been a topic of discusto view India as a strategic market, and sion for many years. “But it is only more than 300 people are now working after Narendra Modi’s reformist governwith Saab-related businesses across the ment was appointed in 2014 that the plans company’s operations in the country. have reached a more concrete phase,” “We have been very successful with says Jan Widerström, newly appointed the IDAS self-protection system for Indian head of Saab India Technology, who has Air Force and Army helicopters,” says a decade of work experience in India.

This is why we have efficiencies each year. been working the last two years to coordinate and improve functional processes in the company. The reason is that we have grown for many years, mainly BREAKING THE COST CURVE When Saab designed the new version of Gripen, we at the same time broke the cost curve for development and production of complex systems. The goal was to be even more competitive. The method we chose was model-based definition (MBD), which let us give up paper in favour of computerised 3D images. There was an initial cost to introduce Lean principles in development, methodologies, tools and routines. But since the product is right from the beginning, there is higher efficiency and profitability in production, aftersales and publications. For our customers, there is a big advantage to our working so efficiently. They feel reassured knowing that they can see their order in 3D before placing it. We also reduce our environmental impact by avoiding having to print tens of thousands of pages of documentation. For our Brazilian colleagues who are learning to build Gripen in Linköping, quality assurance is made much easier. 3D images are able to break through any language barrier. It requires courage to make a revolutionary change. We are certainly willing to take chances, and it is one reason why we are a leader in our industry in this area. 3 4 – S AA B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 MARKET-DRIVEN RENEWAL Product renewal is often a close collaboration with Value-adding customers to ensure that Saab offers the most advanced technology for the applications they want. One example is the Carl-Gustaf M4 weapon system, partnership which has been continuously modernised and adapted to its users’ changing needs. The latest version offers the same effectiveness and versatility as previous versions but with a lighter design, shot counter, intelligent sighting system and program­ mable ammo, giving the soldier more flexibility and Collaborative projects in various countries around the world give us an opportunity mobility. In December, Saab received an order from us to improve efficiencies in our development and production. One example is the fourth customer for the latest M4 version since Aerostructures Assemblies India (AAI), a collaboration with the Indian manufacturer its market launch in late 2014. Deliveries will take Aequs. In the last three years, the project has progressed from idea to production, place in 2017. with both companies providing valuable know-how and sharing the same values. Production was launched in India in August 2013, and the first components for the PARTICIPATION IMPROVES OUTCOME Airbus 380 programme were delivered in February 2014. Saab has contributed Saab invests a large share of its profit in research and its expertise in project management to the partnership, while Aequs has added development. This is necessary to compete on the its manufacturing expertise and knowledge of the Indian market and local supply forefront of technology. It is thanks to our worldchain. Now that production has effectively begun, the partners are working class employees and their innovative thinking that together to win more contracts. For example, Door Plug 3 and Cover Plate for the company is as strong as it is today. Saab has a A321 Airbus are being built together. Much of this development work is done by non-hierarchical corporate culture that makes it Saab India Tech Centre in Hyderabad, while assembly is handled by AAI. responsive and flexible. This also means generously sharing knowledge, and that employees are encouraged to think freely and present their ideas. An innovation pilot project was started by the Dynamics business area in 2016 to test a new way of working systematically with innovation. Among other things, a tool has been introduced that allows everyone to see and comment on proposals and offer more ideas and improvements. The idea behind the project is to pave the way for a new way to see innovation within Saab and thereby create a more efficient development process.

Everyone who works at and carefully weighing risks. Saab shares a responsibility for maintaining safety, SAFETY ONBOARD A SUBMARINE The crew on a submarine lives and works for long stretches in a pressurised vessel containing weapons, large amounts of fuel, diesel engines, liquid oxygen, and hydraulic and electrical equipment. The sub is surrounded by water under high pressure and must be navigated in the dark in three dimensions, encircled by obstacles. You could compare it to flying a high-speed aircraft at low altitude in the dark, but in considerably more complex conditions. Saab has a long tradition of developing, building and main­ taining submarines. For domestic submarines, this is done in close collaboration with FMV and the Swedish Navy. International and national laws and ordinances as well as established standards are implemented systematically in a safety programme for each project. Safety means conducting risk analyses not only to reduce the number of critical incidents, but also to increase the probability that everything will run smoothly. In concrete terms, this is achieved with the participation of experts who understand the technology, human factor, organisational aspects and communication for every system.

ON THE FOREFRONT OF TECHNOLOGY UNIQUE Changing threat scenarios, coupled with transformative technological developments, require us to continuously adapt and develop new innovations. We therefore invest about a quarter of our sales in CAPACITY research and development. 2016 was an eventful year in which we launched the E version of Gripen and two new airborne early warning and control systems, GlobalEye and Swordfish. On May 18, Gripen E was unveiled to the world at a ceremony in Linköping attended by over 500 invited guests from over 30 countries. Compared with previous versions, Gripen E has a significantly improved avionics system. The capability to carry more weapons and improved range performance are made possible by a more powerful engine and higher fuel capacity. Gripen E is equipped with a highly integrated and sophisticated sensor suite including Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, Infra Red Search and Track (IRST), an Electronic Warfare (EW) suite and advanced datalink technolSaab’s new GlobalEye is the most see low-flying aircraft.

Today it is mainly being used in areas where it is important to shed weight, such as aerospace and automotive technology, but also in medical technology. The biggest benefit of 3D printing is in innovative product solutions. TTC, a joint research centre started by Örebro University and the companies Saab, Lasertech LSH and Bofors Testcenter, conducts research and development in 3D printing and industrial 3D X-ray, which in just a few years have gone from being simply interesting to strategically important for Saab. TTC is steadily growing as more companies and universities join the centre, the only one of its kind in Sweden to combine two areas of innovative research and technological development and make its expertise and equipment available to both industry and universities. COMBIENT SUPPORTS DIGITISATION Combient is a joint venture formed in 2015 to support the companies in the Investor sphere in the areas of FUTURE digitisation and automation. Combient works with generic software platforms that can be utilised by its owner-companies. The business grew in 2016 as it actively supported these companies. Two interesting technologies it has invested in are blockchains (e.g. BUILT IN for contract management) and data analytics. Saab and FAM AB are the largest owners, with 25 per cent each.

For the selected contracts we have in detail obtained an understanding for the project though, among other procedures, review of contract clauses, project plans, analysis of stage of completion and contract forecasts. Each quarter we review the projects together with the project leader, the project controller or similar. In these reviews we perform the following procedures focusing on whether significant risks are reasonably accounted for: • We inspect management’s assessment of the project execution and how this affect the financial reporting. This includes total contract value, level of completion, method for recognising stage of completion, cost incurred and estimated reaming cost. • We reconcile management’s assessment to underlying documen­ tation and compare this with previous quarters. • We reconcile financial information between reports and systems and recalculate calculations. In these reviews we use our knowledge about Saab and how similar long term contracts have been treated to discuss and ask questions and challenge management’s estimates and judgements. We also assess consistent application of accounting principles between contracts with similar circumstances. In this we also test items reported as work in progress. We test them from both quantitative and qualitative aspects and assess whether they are accounted for under Saab’s accounting policies. This year Gripen E Sweden, Gripen NG Brazil and Air born surveillance United Arab Emirates have been of specific interest in our audit: For specific contracts we have from time to time observations related to both amounts and judgement that we report to management and the audit committee. The projects complexity and judgments involved mean that the amounts recognized by nature is affected by uncertainty where future outcome can deviate significantly from management’s judgments. 1 4 2 – S A A B A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 016 OTHER INFORMATION THAN THE ANNUAL AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS N Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance This document also contains other information than about whether the annual accounts and consolidated the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and accounts as a whole are free from material misstateis found on pages 1–55 and 146–149.
