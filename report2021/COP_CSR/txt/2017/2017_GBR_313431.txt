PEOPLE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. In our employee relations we aim to develop and retain the best people via our workplace relationships and the way we work, and to ensure as safe and stable a workplace environment as possible. How we spend the cash we earn We recognise that our business requires inputs from, and has an effect on, a number of stakeholders. We see it as crucial that each group feels that their relationship with Lonmin is positive, and that they achieve some net gain, whether financial or otherwise. The analysis below shows how the US$1.1 billion of cash earned in the financial year was distributed. Shareholders received no dividend during the year, and none is recommended for 2016. In 2016 we met costs of 89 cents for every Dollar we earned, predominantly in South Africa. Payments for community projects and donations amounted to 1 cent per Dollar earned and we spent 2 cents per Dollar earned on interest and fees to the banks who lent us money.

A challenging operating environment This year has been marked by complex and competing themes, and the environment in which Lonmin operates remains challenging. With the global mining industry under pressure from weak commodity prices, South African mining companies face a range of additional stressors, some of which are unique to the country. The combination of these factors has contributed to increased costs and disruptions that negatively impact production efficiencies. These factors cover the spectrum of societal concerns and clearly demonstrate the interconnectedness of social, environmental, governance and financial value. Lonmin’s operations delivered good progress against the business plan and we expect to continue momentum to withstand the low pricing environment and improve cash generation. Costs were well managed and a reduction of R1.3 billion was achieved against the target of R700 million. Underlying operating profit increased to R124 million1 from a previous year loss. The reorganisation of the business which started in 2015 was successfully completed in the first half of the year, with a reduction of 5,433 employees and contractors, and 1,426 people were successfully reskilled and redeployed into vacant, more productive roles. The successful completion of this headcount reduction as well as concluding the wage negotiations with no labour unrest were undoubted highlights. The rights issue concluded in December 2015 considerably strengthens the Company’s balance sheet and provides funding certainty. In order to further create, preserve and enhance long-term equity value, we signed a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Anglo American Platinum’s (AAP) 42.5% stake in the Pandora Joint Venture post year end. This acquisition aims to consolidate the Company’s position in Pandora’s relatively shallow and high‑grade mineral resource and provide an option for development by Eastern Platinum in both the short and longer term. The tough decisions made last year have been difficult, but the business is now cash positive after capital expenditure, even in the current challenging operating and macro-economic conditions. Despite an improvement in the Company’s lost-time injury frequency rate for the year, we deeply regret the loss of four of our colleagues. Mr Zilindile Ndumela, Mr Goodman Mangisa, Mr Fanelekile Giyama and Mr Siphilo Makhende succumbed to injuries suffered in separate incidents at Rowland and E3 shafts in October 2015, April, May and July 2016. Post year end we regret to have suffered the loss of Mr Joao Macamo who was fatally injured at E1 shaft. We extend our deepest condolences to their families and friends. Our strategy as discussed on page 28 remains in place and is delivering results. The primary strategic focus this year was to implement the business plan to strengthen cash flows, reduce costs and manage capital expenditure responsibly. Without a profitable business we have no future. Lonmin also faces a range of social and environmental challenges that equally cannot be neglected if we are to be able to generate value for all our stakeholders over the long term. 1 Conversion factor of R14.77/US$1. 01 / Approach Reporting to 02 / Corporate Profile 03 / AOperating Challenging 04 / Leadership Reports 05 / Our Strategy 06 / Reporting According to Our Material Environment Focus areas Lonmin Plc / 23 Sustainable Development Report 2016 “The primary strategic focus this year was to implement the business plan to strengthen cash flows, reduce costs and manage capital expenditure responsibly.

Pursuant to the successful rationalisation of the workforce by 19%, we experienced an increase in productivity at our Generation 2 shafts from 5.6 square metres per person in 2015 to 5.9 square metres per person in 2016. As the disruption created by the rationalisation process settles down, we expect the mining teams to return to the long-run target levels of production. Whilst we are pleased with the implementation of our Business Plan and with our strategy to reduce high cost production in a low price environment, we have yet to fully harness the productivity gains, and mining has not been able to deliver the planned tonnes for Generation 2 shafts during the 2016 financial year for a variety of reasons, including redeployment and reskilling of employees taking longer than anticipated, absenteeism of key personnel reducing the planned blasts per month and higher incidences of safety stoppages in the first nine months of the year. We remain focused on improving productivity and recognise that multiple challenges remain and a step change is needed to realise further improvement. In parallel with the ongoing implementation of the initiatives set out below, additional stoping crews will be deployed in order to further support the achievement of planned output, as our healthy ore reserve position allows for this. The current initiatives being implemented to improve productivity are: • establishing a labour skills buffer; • addressing employee absenteeism; • introducing a programme aimed at the empowerment of frontline supervisors; and • implementing the Theory of Constraints framework in order to improve the optimisation of half levels at Generation 2 shafts Valuing our employees We value the contribution made by all our employees and Passion, recognise that morale and retention remain under pressure pride and as a result of the restructuring, reorganisation and continuing purpose cost constraints, with limited salary increases and few development opportunities.

Ensuring that the necessary controls and procedures are in place to support the safety and health of our workforce is a critical element of our business strategy, and we do this through sustaining operational excellence, caring for our people and demonstrating good corporate citizenship. Lonmin views safety as a proxy for good performance and we believe that our goal of Zero Harm is achievable. Health and wellness are integrally linked to quality of life, morale, productivity and safety performance. On a monthly basis, approximately 20,000 employees, contractors and community members visit Lonmin’s primary health facilities. The overall health and wellness of an employee are the outcome of a host of factors, many of which arise outside the workplace. Lonmin’s safety awareness and healthcare initiatives include many programmes that extend into our host communities. Lonmin’s lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) showed an improvement in 2016. However, there were four fatalities during the year, which we deeply regret.

Lonmin believes that education can fundamentally change lives, therefore, we invest in the education value chain – from early childhood development, school infrastructure and sport development to supporting students at tertiary level. We also train local communities, which develops the pipeline of possible future skilled employees and increases opportunities for local procurement. These same skills are transferable and can later be used for other community development projects, such as road construction. These initiatives are dealt with in detail in the rest of this chapter. • Corporate and community partnerships: Addressing the challenges evident in local communities requires a broader partnership approach that includes the Company, the community, local and national government, and the various companies operating in the area. • Ethical business practices: Lonmin’s Code of Business Ethics commits the Company, its employees and suppliers to ethical standards of social and business practices. Ethics at Lonmin is discussed in more detail in the Governance section on page 115 and our commitment to uphold human rights and our performance in this regard is discussed on page 77.

The Exco has established a SHE sub-committee, which reviews SHE performance quarterly to identify critical concerns and opportunities, and to monitor operational safety, health and environmental performance. Our environmental department is responsible for strategic direction in terms of environmental management and compliance, and monitors environmental performance. Line management is accountable for operational environmental compliance, supported by the environmental department. We take a precautionary approach to environmental management, aiming for compliance and continual improvement. Risks relating to sustainability, including environmental impacts, are incorporated into the Company’s corporate risk registers. Reviews of these risks and their associated management plans are conducted by the relevant operational and management teams, and the results of these reviews are presented to the SHE and Risk Committees of the Board. Lonmin’s Safety and Sustainable Development Policy and the ISO 14001 system procedures define the Company’s approach to environmental stewardship. Our ISO 14001 environmental management system (EMS) is well managed and we maintained our certification through annual third-party verification. The ISO 14001 EMS is a self-regulatory tool that promotes the minimisation and management of potential environmental impacts. A range of internal and external audits are conducted to monitor and verify the integrity of the EMS and the Company’s overall environmental performance. These include, among others, quarterly internal key performance indicator (KPI) audits, external EMP performance assessments, water use licence audits, Mining Charter audits, internal and external ISO 14001 audits, and environmental legal compliance audits. As part of continuous improvement, an additional external audit was conducted to verify the internal rating system of environmental incidents against the Lonmin ISO 14001 system procedures, as well as benchmarking with other industries. All actual level 3 and above incident ratings were verified and samples were taken of the lower-level incidents that were audited against the Lonmin procedures. A range of internal environmental indicators and targets are reported against every month to track performance on environmental matters. Reports are provided monthly to the operations, Exco and the Board, and to the Board SHE Committees, which meets quarterly to review the Company’s performance on SHE matters. Our focus on proactive engagements with important stakeholder groups including communities, regulators and internal stakeholders has strengthened relationships, Regular water use licence audits emphasised the critical importance of environmental are performed. compliance and improved the Company’s ability to secure approvals timeously. 07 / Employee Relationships 08 / Safety Health and 09 / Social Licence to Operate 10 / Environment 11 / Relationships with Government 12 / Governance / Annexures / 86 Lonmin Plc Sustainable Development Report 2016 Environment (continued) External policies, frameworks and regulations Approach and performance The primary acts that regulate Lonmin’s environmental The following section discusses the specific approach and footprint/activities are the Mineral and Petroleum Resources the 2016 performance for each material environmental area at Development Act, No 28 of 2002 (MPRDA), the National Lonmin.

COP21 in Paris in December 2015 is seen to have been a success and a very significant step towards this lower-carbon world. In light of the strong agreement at COP21 on the need to reduce emissions, the inadequacy of current global plans to achieve an average 2°C maximum rise, and the realities of the South African economy’s high carbon intensity, it must be assumed that pressure to reduce emissions within South Africa can only increase. There have been two important developments on emissions reduction in South Africa carbon taxation and carbon budgeting. Firstly, National Treasury issued a discussion paper on carbon taxation in 2010. National Treasury originally proposed to implement a carbon tax on emissions from January 2015, but has since delayed this until 2017. Several issues are still being discussed with industry, such as the extent of tax-free allowances and the possibility of companies buying carbon offsets from other companies. Secondly, the Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA), in its capacity as generator and custodian of the National Climate Change Response, has been developing proposals for carbon budgeting since mid-2013. The DEA’s approach is to allocate carbon budgets to individual companies and to require them to submit mitigation plans for future reductions (pollution prevention plans). The DEA will also require companies to report their GHG emissions on an annual basis. Industry believes that many principles should be used to guide South Africa’s carbon policy. Some of the more important points are: the effectiveness of reduction initiatives – how much emissions will be reduced, with what certainty and at what cost; how costs are distributed across society and the economy as a whole; the impact on trade competitiveness of South African companies in relation to their competitors; and policy certainty.
