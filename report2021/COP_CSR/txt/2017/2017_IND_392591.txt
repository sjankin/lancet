SCI continues to follow the policy of implementation of environmental regulations on all new SCI vessels ordered/delivered in recent past. The last newbuilding vessel acquired by SCI i.e. VLCC from a Chinese shipyard in March 2015, is also complying with strict environmental regulations. Recently, SCI has implemented an Integrated Management System (IMS) comprising Quality Management System (QMS), Environmental Management System (EMS) and Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series of Standards (OHSAS).

Environmental Regulations All new shipbuilding projects of SCI are complying with strict environmental regulations, such as : (i) Fuel oil tanks are protected on the sides to avoid direct contact in case of accident. (ii) Engines fitted on new vessels are complying with EU directive 2005/33/EC and thus EU compliant. (iii) NOx Tier II compliant engines are being fitted on new vessels. (iv) Environment friendly refrigerant is being used for the AC plants on new vessels. Page 6 of 14 (v) The vessel shall have green passport upon delivery i.e. list of all hazardous materials will be kept onboard which will be of great help during recycling/handling of hazardous materials during in-service repairs. (vi) Paint applied on the underwater portion of the hull is tin-free. (vii) Energy Efficiency Design Index is being implemented at design stage to reduce the Green House Gas emissions. (viii) Ballast water Treatment Plant is being fitted on the new vessels. SCI is technical consultant to the various Government Organizations for their tonnage acquisition programme. SCI as a policy is ensuring that even the vessels owned by these Organizations comply with environmental regulations. Air and Sea Pollution The company is committed to safe guard against air and sea pollution by way of exhaust gases, pollution by oil or sewage and pollution by garbage toxic, plastics etc. into the sea water. The Company takes following precautionary measures in this direction. • Company’s vessels are fully compliant of MARPOL regulations and hold valid International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate (IOPP). Each vessel is provided with a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) or Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plan (SMPEP) • Ships maintain weekly inventory of oil residues. Disposal and transfer carried out as per regulations and record is maintained in “Oil Record Books”. • Each vessel is holding valid International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate (ISPP). • Each vessel is holding valid International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate (IAPP). • Vessels use low sulphur bunkers with less than 0.1% in Sulphur Emission Controlled areas (SECA) and less than 3.5% in other areas. • Vessels use bunker with sulphur content less than 0.1% in European ports. • Inventory of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) is maintained on all tanker vessels. • Company has Garbage Management Plan and each vessel complies with the same. • The Company tries to avoid supply of goods which are packed in plastic and promotes eco-friendly/ biodegradable items such as garbage bags, envelops etc. • The company is also in the process of modifying its existing tanker fleet to be ECA compliant. The tanker vessels trading in ECA areas are fitted/being fitted with necessary equipments certified by Classification to be fully compliant with the emission limits while trading in these areas. 8 (eight) Page 7 of 14 tankers are already modified to be ECA compliant and arrangements are in process for other vessels. Environmental Safety • A procedure for leak detection at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board are being complied. (Record of same is being maintained in vessels’ Planned Maintenance System). • In order to reduce the disposal of lead and other hazardous substances into the sea/land; lead – acid batteries and other batteries are returned to the manufactures. • As per International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001, the Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on existing tankers (less than 20 years) have been replaced by non-harmful anti-fouling systems since 31st December 2007 onwards. Liner Vessels The Liner ships of the Company are sometimes engaged in the carriage of Hazardous and dangerous goods, both in the break bulk as well as container vessels. The company has developed an in-house manual which caters to shipment of International Dangerous Maritime Goods Code (IMDG) cargoes in containers. This document also highlights the company’s policy and procedures in respect of carriage of hazardous and dangerous goods and also their procedures adopted in implementing such carriage. The officers connected with dealing of hazardous goods are trained by attending various workshops and seminars and their knowledge is updated on matters involving carriage of hazardous goods. Frequent interaction with our partners in the container line, owners of vessels, other bodies have benefited SCI in developing hazardous cell.

SCI is technical consultant to Andaman & Nicobar Administration for acquisition of 2x1200 Passenger vessels from M/s. Cochin Shipyard Ltd. SCI has requested shipyard to calculate the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) on voluntary basis, even though as per IMO, EEDI regulation is not applicable to these vessels. This shows that SCI is committed to the UN Global Compact Initiative. SCI vessels have been voluntarily assigned additional Class notations related to environmental protection and safety (over and above the mandatory requirements) like “CLEANSHIP” (BV Classprevention of sea and air pollution), “CLEAN” (DNV Classrequirements for controlling and limiting operational emissions and discharges), “ES ( ABSEnvironmental safety), “ECO” (LR Classenvironmental ship design, construction and operation beyond statutory requirements) etc. SCI’s recently acquired second hand Suezmax tanker, in April 2007, is also provided with ABSES notation in line with our commitment to greater environmental responsibility. Towards conserving energy and Fuel Efficiency, in addition to the earlier four SCI tankers, one more tanker and one bulk carrier has been audited by Classification, thereby taking due steps towards economising on Fuel and Energy Efficiency. All ship repair workshops are strictly instructed that they should not use ASBESTOS material in any form during repairs/renewals on board vessels, as use of ASBESTOS is prohibited on ships in any form as per MSC 1/Circ 1426 and SOLAS regulation. Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.

These vessels have been assigned the optional notations such as “CLEAN” or “ES”. • SCI’s recently acquired VLCC has been awarded a notation of “FP” by LRS. • Company has put in place leak detection system at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board. • Ballast Water Treatment Plant has been fitted on voluntary basis on the new Oceanographic Research vessel. • SCI also encouraged a Chinese Shipyard M/s. Jiangsu Eastern Heavy Industries to consider fuel saving devices viz; Mewis Duct on our two new Kamsarmax bulk carriers, m.v. Vishva Chetna and m.v. Vishva Uday to increase the fuel efficiency thereby reducing green house gas emissions. Page 10 of 14 • SCI has followed the concept of Green Room for vessel “Samudra Ratnakar”. The Green Room concept basically means that all heat dissipating servers or work stations are enclosed inside separate room and isolated from the laboratory where the Scientists/Crew are working for their comfort and safety. • SCI has taken few initiatives such as trim optimization, hull cleaning and use of fuel additives which are aimed at reducing fuel consumption of vessels and thereby reducing the environmental pollution.
