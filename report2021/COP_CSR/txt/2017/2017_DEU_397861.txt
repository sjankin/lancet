With help of annual visits of the top-volume suppliers and as a consequence updating the Internal Rating Statement regularly, ARI finds many positive developments with our business partners but also detects and traces potential misconducts early. In 2017 ARI performed its first International Procurement Meeting to prepare and align our international organization for challenges in the global procurement market. The participants’ awareness of our commitment to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact Initiative has been increased and the internationally spread teams will continue their efforts to create KPI’s and international standards in alignment with the principles in 2018. www.ari-armaturen.com United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2017 Labour Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation As mentioned in the statement about Human Rights Principles, ARI-Armaturen actively promotes the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of all our employees – irrespective of color, race, nationality, social origin, physical or mental handicap, sex and sexual orientation, political or religious convictions or age.

From the purchase of raw materials and semi-finished products through energy intensive production processes to logistics and disposal. Our environmental awareness is not restricted to what goes on inside our own factory, however; it continues in the world outside throughout the lifetime of every single one of our products. ARI valves and systems make a significant contribution towards more efficient and sparing use of resources. No matter if they are used in a completely new, for repair, or for the modernization of an existing plant. With the adoption of an environmental and energy management system (ISO 14001 and ISO 50001) and its successful recertification in 2015 and 2017, ARI committed to make the efficient use of energy a top priority and reduce CO2 emissions through sustainable and environmentally responsible behavior. This commitment can of course also be found in our Code of Conduct. From an environmental responsibility perspective, we extended the use of centralized extraction systems instead of decentralized systems to increase the air purity in our production departments. In the department with the highest density of machines, the change from decentralized to a fully centralized system could be completed within the cause of November 2017. Other activities were the investment into state of the art production machines to exchange older and less energy efficient systems continuously or the renewal of the heating system for both the administration and production facility. We are encouraging our apprentices to form interdisciplinary teams, develop concepts to save energy and resources and to participate in regional and national competitions such as the Energy Scouts. This year, our team from the regional contest of 2016 has been awarded a special price on resource efficiency for their concept to safe 3.800 liters of testing media per test stand annually. The formal ceremony was hosted by German Environment Minister Hendricks in Berlin at the End of June and the participants were honored with Certificates as well as a measuring device for future project. The team of 2017 is following the success of last year and won the second price in the regional contest with their concept to annually safe 11 tons of plastic by using an alternative flange cover. www.ari-armaturen.com United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2017 Anti-Corruption Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
