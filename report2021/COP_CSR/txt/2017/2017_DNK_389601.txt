We strive to continually improve our CSR performance, both in our supply chain and within the daily operations of our organization. We are confident, that responsible business management will deliver sustainable business results.

It is therefore my pleasure to inform you that Metz A/S once again reaffirms our support to the United Nations Global Compact and its 10 principles. Yours sincerely, Claus Hedegaard CEO UNGC COMMUNICATION 2 ON PROGESS INTRODUCTION Metz A/S signed up to the UN Global Compact in November 2013, as we wanted to adopt an internationally recognized framework for structuring and reporting on our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts. With our commitment to the UN Global Compact, we recognize that we as a company are committed to continually improve and document our work within CSR, and we wish to communicate this to our stakeholders, including our customers, suppliers and employees. As a supplier of promotional products, we work as an intermediary between the end customer and the supplier. On some occasions, our suppliers are agents, who work as intermediaries just like us. Metz has a network of many suppliers and sub-suppliers, and therefore we have a responsibility to seek to influence our suppliers in terms of establishing responsible supply chains for the products that we ultimately sell to the end customer. In the following pages, we presents the Metz approach to CSR, our ambitions for working with the CSR principles as well as the CSR activities and projects that we have conducted or initiated during 2016/2017. UNGC COMMUNICATION ON PROGESS ABOUT METZ A/S Metz A/S was established in 1993 and is an owner-driven company that supplies promotional products and corporate gifts to more than 200 companies and organizations. Metz is the leading and largest supplier in the industry in Denmark and employs 44 people at our headquarters North of Copenhagen in Denmark. Metz acts as a trend spotter and purchaser on behalf of their customers. As a supplier of promotional products and corporate gifts to Denmark’s largest companies, Metz has to be a responsible and trustworthy partner in all areas. Most of the products are produced, according to the customers’ wishes and needs. As the only Danish company, Metz has obtained membership and part ownership of the world’s largest procurement organisation, IGC Global Promotions. IGC was founded in 1956 and is a global network represented in 52 countries. Our mission is to provide high quality products while also influencing and improving conditions relating to labour rights, human rights and the environment in our supply chain. We do this by communicating and by providing guidance to our suppliers in order to help them improve their processes and to comply with the principles of the UN Global Compact. Since we are not a manufacturer, this is the area that we will be able to influence the most, and thus have the greatest impact on. UNGC COMMUNICATION 4 ON PROGESS OUR APPROACH TO CSR The backbone of the Metz CSR strategy is shaped by the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Together with our suppliers and building on the UN Global Compact principles, we wish to work towards a more responsible supply chain for our customers and our other stakeholders. We do this by collaborating proactively with our suppliers and assessing our partnerships in order to strengthen their compliance with internationally proclaimed principles for Human Rights and Labour Standards, Environment and Anti-corruption. This approach is also defined in our company’s CSR policy that structures and motivates our efforts within CSR, see appendix. Our CSR policy builds on our ambition to make a positive difference to our stakeholders. One of the ways to do this is to create a transparent and responsible valuechain. Our CSR efforts are driven by the following ambitions; • We believe that by working responsibly, over the long term, we can outperform competitors, who do not adhere to the same standards and practices. • We strive to monitor and manage the CSR risks associated with our business, as well as communicate our performance to our customers, so that we can support the success of their own businesses. • We know that responsible business conduct provides sustainable, long-term business results, and that responsibility is a prerequisite for retaining our customers’ trust and confidence. Metz is an organization with a global network of suppliers and customers. Our main area of impact from a CSR perspective is our supply chain, which due to our global valuechain is the UNGC area where we can make the biggest difference in terms of integrating CSR principles into business practices. For Metz, responsible supply chain management (RSCM) is therefore a strategic CSR focus area that supports our overall business strategy. RSCM has been our main priority in terms of CSR and the primary focus of our CSR activities in the past years, and will COMMUNICATION continue to be in the future. 5 ON PROGESS RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY RISK SEGMENTATION CHAIN MANAGEMENT OF SUPPLIERS At Metz we recognize the challenges and risks associated with managing global supply chains, Our risk assessment is based on four steps, whereas some of our suppliers need only go and that our supply chain is the area where we have our biggest impact and opportunity to through the first two. We make this distinction due to the fact that it is important for Metz to be influence social and environmental conditions. However, we also recognize that not having our able to implement a risk based but also resource efficient supplier management system. own production poses a risk and to some extent limits the control and leverage we have in terms of improving the sustainability of our supply chain. Our business model is based upon sourcing either directly from the supplier or indirectly through an intermediary. We distinguish between direct suppliers, companies selling branded On-boarding goods, recognized agents or other intermediaries. The latter group often manages an indenew suppliers pendent network of suppliers and will often represent higher supply chain related risks than 1.

Our RSCM system is based on the UN Global Compact framework. The ten principles of the UN Global Compact, the 2. Risk segmentation 4. Reporting of suppliers principles in the ILO conventions and the UN Declaration on Human Rights form the basis of the demands we present to our suppliers.

UNGC COMMUNICATION 6 ON PROGESS HIGH RISK SUPPLIER COMPLIANCE LEVEL 4 1% in level 4 (against last year´s 0%). Phasing out FROM RISK SEGMENTATION The phased out suppliers´ contact details will be blocked in our system once we find a replacement, this ensures that there could not be sent inquiries or new orders to the blocked supplier. Last year we optimized our internal supplier database, and added levels to the listed suppliers. This provides a quick overview of the supplier´s present compliance stage and the requirements needed for the suppliers to move to the next level. Result of our risksegmentation in 2016, Result of our 2017 risksegmentation, This year we have focused on our level 3 suppliers and their compliance and used extra time on based on high risk areas (4 steps). based on high risk area (4 steps). guidance and support. Due to this specific task we have been able to move 8 % of the suppliers from level 3 to level 1 and 2, however we also had to move a supplier to level 4, as it has not been possible to improve their overall performance. LEVEL 1 This year 56% were placed in level 1 (against last year´s 52%) 50% LEVEL 1 56% LEVEL 1 Compliant no supporting documents are needed; 19% LEVEL 2 21% LEVEL 2 however minor improvements may be necessary. 26% LEVEL 3 23% LEVEL 3 If documents have expired, the supplier will be moved down to level 2 or 3 until new 5% LEVEL 4 1% LEVEL 4 documents are received and evaluated.

We will meet this target by phasing out the factories where Partial compliance supporting documents and/or major improvement needed. it has not been possible to improve their CSR performance, by moving our primary factories up to our level, and by entering into new partnerships with factories that demonstrate high commitIf a supplier do not manage to close their major non-compliance findings, if documents have ment to the work with CSR. Ideally, we would like to inspire the factories to take responsibility expired or if there has been changes in their organization that affected their compliance, they and to understand the importance of social responsibility, so in time it is not a matter of whether will be moved a level down until they regain the needed documentation. Similarly, they will be they are compliant or non-compliant, but a question of what they are doing extra on CSR within moved to level 1 if they manage to close their caps, get new documentation etc. their industry. LEVEL 3 23% were in level 3 (against 31% last year) Not in compliance – Compliance documents are needed. When we evaluate if a supplier should be moved to the phasing out level or if they should be moved to level 1 or 2, we look at the overall picture; social compliance, quality of the productions and business cooperation. If all these areas are below what we could expect from our business partners we will move them to the phasing out level and focus our effort on finding a supplier who can fulfill our requirements. 7 HIGH RISK SUPPLIER COMPLIANCE FROM PROMOTING A GOOD AND HEALTHY METZ CODE OF CONDUCT WORKING ENVIRONMENT Our risk assessment system system provides us with a quick overview of our suppliers’ In our opinion healthy and satisfied workers will deliver better quality and better service and in performance and identifies which areas that need extra guidance and effort on our part. the end this will result in greater success for the company.

It is important that both the management team and the workers understand why they need to follow these rules (preventing injuries, sickness, fire etc.) and how they can all benefit from having a safe workplace. 8 METZ STAKEHOLDER A DIFFERENCE TO BE CSR ACTIVITY 2017 REMEMBERED BY Our payoff: “A difference to be remembered by” reflects on the promotional items that we sell to COSTUMERS our clients, which their recipients are happy about – and will remember. However, it also reflects Similar to last year we have seen a change in the smaller companies. A number of small and the culture within Metz and is the center of our daily work in the organization in relation to the medium sized companies are now also asking for confirmation of their code of conduct, service we provide to our customers, what we can do to help others, how we treat our colleagues, transparency in their supply chain (permission for same if required) in order to demonstrate their and what we can do for the environment etc. responsibly produced items. This is a positive development as we are confident that responsible business management will deliver sustainable business results. Through global cooperation it DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS will be possible to influence and educate the factories on the importance of social responsibility To avoid throwing out discontinued clothing that could make a difference for others, for the benefit of the world’s economies and societies. we have entered into an agreement whereby we deliver these items to a women’s crisis center (1). SUPPLY CHAIN CHRISTMAS GIFTS – VALGGAVEN.DK Our main area of impact from a CSR perspective is our supply chain, which is the area where We are committed every year to develop and produce 100,000 Christmas gifts that are worthrewe can make the biggest difference in terms of integrating CSR principles into business membering. Besides our customer decided Christmas webshops (with their own gift choice), we practices. It is important that our supply chain has a responsibility towards CSR and towards us, have a predefined Christmas webshop with 25 different gifts that our customer´s employees can and we believe that building bridges between our companies will result in better products and choose from. We call this “valggaven.dk”. better business relationships.

Many accidents end in death or in serious permanent injury because the victim does not receive the proper life-saving help in the first crucial minutes. That is why all employees at Metz have been offered a first aid training course provided by “Dansk Folkehjælp”. The first course was held in November 2016 and the second course was held in January 2017. A DIFFERENCE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT CUSTOMER WEBSHOPS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS One of our main business areas is worldwide distribution of promotional items through our webshops. For this reason, we have developed a system that focuses on minimizing waste by 1520%. This includes all aspects that are associated with the finished item like production, storage and delivery. Furthermore, this also prevents our customers from spending money on ordering quantities that are not used. BESIDES THE THINGS WE ALREADY DO; Each year we are focusing on finding new ways to optimize our processes and minimize our environmental impact. In 2014, we stopped ordering bottled spring water to REDUCE OUR WATER WASTE and each employee received a drinking bottle instead. In 2015, we introduced a system to REDUCE OUR FOOD WASTE, where each employee notifies the receptionist if they will be in the office for lunch the following day. In 2016, all employees got rechargeable computer keyboards and computer mice to UNGC REDUCE OUR BATTERY WASTE, this will each year save the disposal of around 450 batteries. In 2017, all our webshops were moved to our internal warehouse, this will minimize the transportation between the two locations and therewith lower the CO2 emission related to this area with COMMUNICATION around 72 tons per year. IT IS THE SMALL THINGS THAT CAN HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE. 10 ON PROGESS OUR EMPLOYEES A good working environment is not only about the way we talk to each other, it´s about giving the employees the right tasks, challenge their expertise, and about supporting a good team spirit. It´s important that the employees get proper answers and guidance to their questions and feel that they are listened to when they present their suggestions and ideas. In other words, each employee should feel important and valued. At Metz, we acknowledge that each employee plays a vital role in the success of the company. We continuously focus on the elements that advances their commitment, job satisfaction and their wellbeing at work. We do this by having annual one-on-one development interviews, by offeringa private health insurance for our employees and their children, by fostering a good team spirit (e.g. by frequently organizing social events) and by giving the employees free access to sports facilities, healthy lunch programs, free fruit etc. We believe that all these things result in a good working environment in the organization. In 2017, all Metz employees got the opportunity to get an hour with a personal fitness coach. The purpose was to make a personal training program and to get instructions on how to do the different exercises correctly so that you do not get injuries during training.
