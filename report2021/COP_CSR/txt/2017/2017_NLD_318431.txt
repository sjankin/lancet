Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. GEOLOG is devoted to the protection of Human Rights. For this reason, we strive to conduct our business based on ethical and responsible actions in the areas where we operate. We encourage our local representatives to sponsor, support and actively participate in projects that positively affect communities. In this way, we look forward to support and improve local conditions. Charity Contributions and Social Responsibilities Chile Social initiative for children in Punta Arenas GEOLOG organized a social initiative in Punta Arenas (Chile) with a local kindergarten that hosts 104 children aging from 8 months to 4 years old. This type of public kindergarten does not receive sufficient resources to auto-sustain, and most of the families do not have enough resources to buy basic materials for the kids. For this reason, during Christmas time GEOLOG decided to purchase presents for the kindergarten and arrange a magic show for the kids. The event was very successful: children were enthusiastic and teachers very thankful with the initiative! 10 Bolivia Initiative to improve personnel health GEOLOG collaborated with clients in Bolivia on initiatives to promote the practice of sport, in particular cycling, with the goal to improve personnel health. We are aware that regular physical activity can help to prevent serious diseases such as obesity, heart problems, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis. Cycling regularly is an effective way to reduce risks of health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle. GEOLOG contributed to this initiative with the donation of three mountain bikes and helmets, in order to give the opportunity to all rig workers to use them in their free time to make physical exercise. Venezuela Support to local non-profit organization GEOLOG sustains in Venezuela a non-profit organization that organize social activities for local communities with the goal to help the integration and growth of the children through recreational, cultural and sports activities. In particular, in 2016 GEOLOG made a donation to support the baseball team of this organization helping them to participate in the local championship. Funding UNICEF We believe that investing in initiatives that advocate for education, health conditions and respect of children rights is a key element to building a better society in the future. Therefore, GEOLOG also funds programs that contribute to giving better opportunities for children. In line with this, GEOLOG made a monetary contribution to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). 11 Safe work conditions and incidents prevention GEOLOG’s QHSE Management System is built on the belief that most workplace injuries, illnesses and incidents are preventable. Hazards leading to these events are often known prior to their occurrence, making prevention the most effective tool to safeguard our personnel and third party people. In order to properly manage the risks related to the activities performed, GEOLOG has in place a proper risk assessment procedure that helps to identify and assess the risks associated with our operations, considering the likelihood and the magnitude of potential hazards. . This helps us to identify the mitigation and control measures needed to ensure the activities are safely executed. GEOLOG focus its attention not only on occupational safety (conventional safety risks, e.g. slips or trips), but also on process safety (major hazards risks). The interaction between the two safety levels has led GEOLOG to achieve its great HSE performance. Below some GEOLOG’s key performance indicators for the year 2016, followed by the graphic overview of the trends man-hours worked versus Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). Total Lost Time LTI Frequency Man-Hours Recordable Environmental Year Fatalities Injuries Rate Gravity Rate Worked Incidents Rate Spills (LTI) (LTIFR) (TRIR) 2016 1,932,595 0 0 0.00 0.00 2.59 0 Hours Worked LTI Frequency Thousand Manhours Vs.

This is the best result in the last 10 years, and this shows our commitment in achieving excellence in risk management and prevention system. We strive everyday in making continuous improvement in our HSE Management System in order to guarantee to our personnel the safest working conditions. 12 Labour Principles Guarantee gender equality to all its employees GEOLOG, through its internal policies and procedures, is committed and strives to respect the labour rights and to guarantee gender equality to all its employees with the objective to ensure no discrimination. Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

Next to this, GEOLOG acknowledges women’s business community. 13 Environmental Principles We encourage our employees to develop the business in an environmentally responsible manner Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. One of the keystones of GEOLOG’s HSE Management System is our HSE Policy. Through the commitment of achieving remarkable performance regarding Health, Safety and Environment, we encourage our employees to develop the business in an environmentally responsible manner. GEOLOG, in line with ISO 14001:2015 standard, tries wherever possible to use environmentally friendly products and to avoid environmental incidents. To do so, we identified all our potential environmental impacts in order to define all measures and actions needed to prevent, minimize and control them. 14 Environment-friendly solutions for GEOLOG Milan Home Production peaks have occurred in June and July when we Office produced about 25,000 KWH. December is the bottom of production with about 3 KWH. Of course this depends on weather GEOLOG main office and production facility in Milan, Italy, has been and seasonal conditions, but in general overall production is slightly designed considering environmentally friendly solutions, such as the better than expectation. use of renewable energy sources. These initiatives reinforce the commitment of GEOLOG towards The thermal station of the new building is powered by two solutions that help to reduce our carbon footprint and the impact geothermal wells, one for water production at a depth of 50 meters, on the environment. and one for water reinjection at a depth of 40 meters. At the end of 2015, GEOLOG installed photovoltaic panels (680 modules) in order to produce electric energy needed for the daily activities by using solar energy. The photovoltaic plant is an important investment made by GEOLOG in renewable energy. The system is working since March 2016. In these last months the system produced about 158,000 KWH, corresponding to more than the 30% of the entire power request in the site. 15 Anticorruption principles Highest ethical and legal standards Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. GEOLOG is strongly committed to the highest ethical and legal standards. Each company within GEOLOG has been provided with the internal Code of Business Conduct and Anti-Bribery and AntiCorruption Policy both aimed at raising awareness of the relevant national and international laws, standards and principles in order to ensure compliance by GEOLOG as a whole, and all directors, officers and employees with the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption business principles accepted worldwide.
