The future is always challenging and there is only one way to keep up with the changing world: transformation. We are ready to face new challenges and to adapt to new contexts. For this reason, we decided to be an excellence behind excellence, a trustworthy and outstanding partner that works behind the scenes in order to turn ideas into success. Excellence is not unique, but there are different ways of being excellent today. Our strongest motivation is therefore to create different excellences in different sectors, but all decisive and fundamental. We want to make big things happen and this is why, after more than 150 years, we transformed our identity to be ready for the future. But we did not forget our past: we still believe in our experience, in our definitions and in the work of our team. Our new logo perfectly represents our identity as it combines past and future: RINA’s historical tradition of excellence leads the way to innovation and future excellence. The stylized arrow on the left represents our past, while the stylized arrow on the right represents our future, both combined to create excellence. ETHICAL CODE The Ethical Code expresses our highest committment to Human Rights, Labour organization and management, Environment and fight against any form of corruption. The main scope of the Ethical Code is to state the fundamental values and principles, which guide RINA in all its activities, known within the organization and to all external stakeholders. Its scope is also the implementation of RINA policies, strategies and procedures. The Code of Conduct is to orient the individual behaviour to meet the same goals, confirming the image of correctness, fair business conduct and good reputation that have always been considered fundamental assets of our Company. 6 RINA APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY RINA is growing rapidly, both organically and through external acquisitions. This increases the need to apply a sustainable strategic, structured approach in the conduct of our business, offering new services that positively contribute to the society, as well as to the environment. With its responsible business conduct, RINA is committed to contributing to the implementation of the ten principles stated by United Nations Global Compact, joined in May 2016, respectively on human rights, labour organisation, the environment and anti-corruption. The United Nations Global Compact comes from the determination to promote a sustainable global economy. RINA would like to promote and contribute to such efforts. RINA joined national and international networks dealing with CSR and sustainability, namely the Association SODALITAS, the Italian partner of CSR Europe, Transparency International and its Italian Business Integrity Forum, supporting voluntary anti-corruption initiatives. We have issued a CSR Policy which is integral part of our business development strategy. We have enhanced our approach to sustainability, formalized in four pillars: Governance, People, Planet and Innovation. We want our stakeholders to feel confident that we do our best to manage our social, environmental and economic impacts. RINA has adopted an integrated Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, which takes into account strategic, financial, operative and compliance risks as well as environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, aiming at our continuous improvement. The RINA Risk and Control Committee has the primary role to assist RINA in achieving sustainable development goals in close cooperation with the Board of Directors and other internal Committees. RINA is constantly developing tools and procedures to strengthen our business, with due considerations, for instance, for the safeguard of impartiality. RINA is engaged in rule development processes, within technical Associations, Committees and Working Groups, at national and international level, with the purpose of sharing research, results, technical knowledge and best practices.
