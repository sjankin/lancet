United Nations Communication on Progress Statement of support Another year has passed and we have launched our 5th COP. Our commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact is unbroken and fully integrated in all our activities. We do feel a continued increasing focus on corporate social responsibility in our surroundings customers, suppliers, community and products. Nevertheless, we still are the only printing house in Denmark who is CSR certified, and we will strive to keep developing our CSR commitment and inspire the graphic industry to follow a more social responsible path. As a company, we have shown that we have the character to back our commitments in all the areas of endeavour that we have been committed to: in the marketplace, environment, workplace and our communities. We have by extension displayed our commitment to the principles of the UN Global Compact, and we believe that even as we strive for progress, our drive will be in the direction of reaching out to the entities and people we do business with. We have become even more aware that the stated CSR objectives are measurable and in line with both our visions within this area and the principles of the UN Global Compact. Our belief that we cannot be an island all by ourselves and the special meaning we attach to the word “global”, as in UN Global Compact, is what strengthens our resolve. September 11th, 2017 Henrik Kailow CEO, Kailow Group 1 Commitment Since 2011 Kailow has had an integrated CSR management system according to the Danish standard DS 49001, which is the Danish CSR certification with references to all parts of the ISO 26000 social responsibility. In addition, DS 49001 refers to the climate parameter, which is also implemented in the company’s system. The company’s CSR system is certified by the third party DNV-GL, which ensures that the company meets its own standards as well as the standards DS 49001, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001. Kailow and our suppliers also meet the Graphic CSR Code of Conduct, which is based on the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and is specified below. Furthermore, the company’s management handbook works as a working tool for all employees, by which it ensures that all employees at all levels are committed and involved in the company’s CSR work. Vision It is Kailow’s vision to show social responsibility through all our activities and in cooperation with our customers, suppliers, and employees to obtain the highest possible standard for our services, products, environment, work environment, and social relations. This we will do by:  Putting development of new ideas, products, and processes in the centre  Giving our employees the opportunity for professional and personal development and encourage them to work in a cooperation, which is based on openness, honesty, and mutual respect  Valuing work environment and social conditions for the individual highly  Optimizing and improving our environmental performance continuously  Being in close dialogue with customers and suppliers  Working towards Kailow being a part of the tolerant labour market  Promoting health at our joint workplace by focusing on health and work environment  Informing employees and people, who work on our behalf, about our policy and its consequences for the individual’s workplace Management of suppliers The management system has a separate tool containing procedures and instruction to cooperation with sub suppliers. Fundamentally, all suppliers within the scope of the system must be preapproved with reference to UN Global’s 10 principles. The result of the introductory examination leads to either a deselection or a categorization of a possible sub supplier. Within each of these categories, guidelines are described for demand to the sub supplier’s objectives for improvements. The aim of the tool is to search for opportunities for improvement of business partners’ (sub suppliers) CSR level, and through this disseminate Kailow’s and UN Global Compacts 10 principles as much as possible. 2 International conventions and the Graphic CSR Code of Conduct Fundamentally, Kailow complies with all principles regarding international conventions, which Denmark has joined, including defined employer rights in accordance with ILO’s conventions and the Danish labour market’s collective agreements. Furthermore, Kailow has adapted “The Graphic CSR Code of Conduct”, which is a tailored substandard for graphic companies fully compliant with UN Global Compact. Adapting and implementing The Graphic CSR Code has made our CSR work more coherent and evidential according to continuous improvements on essential impacts within CSR. In the following the scope of “The Graphic CSR Code of Conduct” is listed: HUMAN RIGHTS (principles 1 and 2) Human rights in the production country The company and its suppliers (hereafter named “the company”) are with regard to national and societal customs not involved in any violation of human rights in the production country.

The minimum age for employment is not less than the age of compulsory schooling and under no circumstances less than 15 years. This applies regardless of whether the laws of the production country allow lower employment age. However, in countries with insufficiently developed economy and educational facilities persons with a minimum age of 14 years can be employed in a transitional period after consultation with interested employers and employees' organizations. The company is engaged to register and document that there are no employees, who violate the rules on child labour. The registration contains at least the name, age or date of birth plus a certificate for all persons under 18 years. DISCRIMINATION (principle 6) Discrimination is defined as:  Any separation, exclusion, or discrimination based on race, colour, age, sex, marital status, sexual orientation, language, religion, mental or physical disability, health status, political opinion, national or social origin  Any other separation, exclusion or discrimination as a result of nullifying or impairing equality based on union membership or after negotiation with representative employee associations/representatives It is not considered discrimination, if the separation, exclusion or discrimination is due to specific qualifications for employment.

The company is engaged in creating and pursuing a policy that aims at – in accordance with national practices – promoting equality and eliminate discrimination. It also includes the ability to recruit people from vulnerable groups. ENVIRONMENT (principles 7 to 9) The company is engaged in regular development and maintenance of the production processes and systems for managing and preventing the environmental conditions of graphic production. It can be in correlation with paper, printing plates, chemicals, waste and energy issues/consumption. 5 The company’s environmental work and communication with the public is based on dialogue. This means that it is expected that regular dialogue will take place with neighbours, civil society, organizations, and others with an interest in environmental activities. This is done through information, which clearly reflects the essential environmental aspects associated with graphic production. Data and information Some of the key environmental issues in graphic production are associated with paper, printing plates and ink plus the origin of paper fibres. Therefore, the company is engaged in registration of this information and is able to deliver it at any time to customers and other stakeholders. Climate Another important environmental parameter in the production of printed matter is the energy consumption and with that the climate impact. The company is engaged – as far as possible – in providing information on how production affects the environment, and takes this into account in its selection. It can be done for example by choosing a paper quality that is manufactured with a lower CO 2 emission than similar qualities on the market. Such a choice can reduce the total climate impact of the printed matter by up to 75 per cent. Recycling The company reduces, reuses, and recycles waste as widely as possible. Chemicals The company is continuously making a risk assessment of the materials, products, and processes and at all times is able to document and provide information about this. Banned chemicals are not to be used in the company’s production. There are proper storage, handling, and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous substances. In addition, the company ensures to take all the necessary measures to replace these with less harmful chemicals and substances where possible. Water and VOCs (volatile organic compounds) The company is engaged in reducing the discharge of waste water and VOC emissions as much as possible and to use the cleanest technology wherever possible. ANTI-CORRUPTION (principle 10) Bribery is not acceptable in any form, whether it is private or public, direct or indirect, active or passive corruption. Corruption distorts competition and prevents markets from functioning efficiently and can be considered as an additional tax on investment and trade. Bribery is defined as a payment that is intended to get someone to do something, which is dishonest, illegal, or against regulations of his duties with the purpose of obtaining an undue advantage. Facilitation payments are defined as encouraging public officials to perform their tasks such as issuing licenses and permits. The company actively opposes the use of facilitation payments. It may in some cases be accepted, if it is customary in the country to receive such payments, and all other options are exhausted. At the same time, the company informs the customer/the company management about the use of facilitation payments. In addition, the company is engaged in introducing systems that effectively control the economic activities. All persons concerned in the supplying company are informed of the company's code of conduct in connection with corruption and the consequences by violations. Gifts Gifts are never given or received in secrecy. It is not allowed to give or receive money gifts or securities. 6 Gifts are not given, which are so great that the receiver will not be able to provide a corresponding gift. Never give gifts in connection with offers, offer evaluation, or contract negotiations. It is not allowed to accept gifts that are clearly intended to influence a decision, including the purchase of goods below market price. 7 Strategy To support the work with the above vision, Kailow will:  Sustain a certification after DS 49001, social responsibility  Sustain a certification after ISO 14001, environmental management  Sustain a certification after DS/OHSAS 18001, work environmental management  Sustain a certification after ISO 9001, quality management  Sustain our connection to UN Global Compact  Sustain social responsibilities according to the graphic collective agreement for our activities in Denmark  Make demands to and in relevant extent control suppliers and other business partners, national and international, according to the settings of social responsibility  Prevent increased burdens in relation to own social responsibility in new investments  Communicate openly about the company’s quality, environment, health and safety, and social conditions and make its strategies visible  Sustain all relevant legal requirements in force both through national and international activities  Meet demands about social responsibility from our interest parties, both regional, national and international  Continuously work to improve social responsibility through the graphic product’s supply chain and periodically set objectives in relevant areas for the future performance plus register and document that these objectives are reached  Offer Nordic Eco-labelled and FSC-labelled printed matters  Complete climate accounts for own production conditions and offer calculation of the printed matter’s CO2 emission and following neutralize the printed matter, if the customer requires it. Main Objectives With a view to continuously develop the company’s level within CSR, a range of main objectives are stated and outlined in the following KPI areas:  Customers o Developing methods for analysing selected customer segments for in that way to cover our customers’ expectations to service and products regarding relevant CSR parameters for graphic production. o This KPI is seen as being widely covering and measurable for the company’s total performances concerning CSR, since knowledge about the customers’ requests and needs is expected to induce additional sales of graphic products produced under the company’s certificates (standards).  Errors and complaints – including errors from sub suppliers o Errors in connection with production of graphic printed products weaken the company’s competitiveness and are a latent threat to loss of customers. o Errors produce loss of resources such as paper, printing ink, and energy and are a well documented significant environmental factor. Thus, a number of completed life cycle analyses show that conditions such as waste of paper, printing ink, and printing plates represent more than 90 % of the environmental impact.  Health and safety impact, which are prioritized by the employees in connection with workplace assessment (APV)  Sub suppliers o A structure and tools are made for selection and strengthening of sub suppliers. In this connection, objectives will continuously be outlined for sub suppliers’ performance concerning CSR. 8 Achievements in 2016 The following have successfully been done and implemented: Labour  Focus on workflow, health and safety during building renovation of office workplaces  Maintenance of DS/OHSAS 18001  Focus on improving cleaning procedures Environment  Maintenance of certificate for use of ClimateCalc  Sustain license to The Nordic Eco-label  Sustain license to FSC  Energy efficiency and CO2 neutralization of the printed matters.
