Travel policy of IMC underlines that employees must respect environmental standards when booking flights and hiring cars. Thanks to a more diversified staff distribution in the branch offices (e.g. more New Media and Sales employees in the Munich Office), travel efforts can be significantly reduced for visiting local clients. The same principles are applied with regard to subcontractors wherever possible.

Principle 9: Businesses should The “Green IT” concept is widely advocated for IMC. Challenges, which result from encourage the development and complexity of environmental protection, have large influence on ITdevelopment and diffusion of environmentally friendly usage spectrum: technologies New media channels for educational programs are offering chances to promote environmental protection. Page 15 of 19 Global Compact Principle Action Taken & Impact Achieved and/or Plans for the upcoming Year • Learning Solutions become a core competence of Green IT because they can substitute business trips and face-to-face meetings, and hence they reduce CO2 emissions, the travel cost budget and the strain on employees, thus improving their work-life balance. • The term “Green IT” marks information technologies which make significant ecologic contribution. Reducing a travel route by 1 km reduces the CO2 emission by an average of approximate 204 gram – in comparison to this, the energy use produced by the IT is negligible. A virtually conducted meeting or an e-learning course with 12 students would reduce the CO2 emission by 244 kg, given an average travel route of 1,200 km. • IMC has increased the use of Web Meetings and Virtual Classroom Sessions for internal communication and cooperation as well as for project coordination meetings with customers. This action reduces the need for travelling and contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions. IMC intends to further expand its activities in this area in the coming years. • IMC supports the DHL GoGreen climate protection projects by combining its shipments with DHL GoGreen services whenever possible. DHL calculates C02 Page 16 of 19 Global Compact Principle Action Taken & Impact Achieved and/or Plans for the upcoming Year emissions generated by transport using a method based on the ISO 14064 standard. In accordance with the specifications of the Kyoto Protocol; these emissions are offset by climate protection projects. • IMC also has increased and intensified its business operations in the area of “cloud computing”, providing professional services to its customers via hosted IT environments. This allows for synergies in the use of IT systems via shared IT infrastructures; in 2013, IMC received the “Cloud for Society Award” for its business operations in this area. The award also covers “green IT” aspects of IT operations. • In 2015, IMC has launched cloud-based versions of its authoring tool IMC Content Studio named “IMC Teach” and its performance support tool IMC Process Guide. • IMC has reduced the number of company cars with high CO2 emissions. With regard to reducing CO2 emissions, SUVs have been banned completely from IMC’s car pool. In addition, IMC has cooperated, in 2016, with inter-governmental agencies on developing e-learning modules on various environmental issues. The modules are designed for a global audience; in particular, they address professionals in the Page 17 of 19 Global Compact Principle Action Taken & Impact Achieved and/or Plans for the upcoming Year humanitarian sector and provide guidance and support to their work. Principle 10: Businesses should work All directors, officers or employees shall comply fully with all laws affecting the business against all forms of corruption, of IMC, including, without limitation, all laws prohibiting insider trading, money including extortion and bribery. laundering, bribery, improper payments and anti-competitive activities. The consequences to the company and its directors, officers and employees of any departure from this policy can be very serious. If a criminal violation has occurred, the company will take appropriate steps to stop the criminal conduct and to prevent such conduct from reoccurring. In order to foster compliance with anti-corruptions rules in a broad range of business operations, IMC has developed an interactive training curriculum available for use in organizations of all kinds. In addition, IMC has broadened its product portfolio with an online compliance management system which is used by IMC customers in order to effectively provide compliance relevant training to their workforce. Since 2015, IMC has been certified according to ISO / IEC 27001: 2013, proving IMC’s Information Security Management System. State-of-the-art data protection in new digital processes, combined with staff trainings, contribute to a safer environment against Page 18 of 19 Global Compact Principle Action Taken & Impact Achieved and/or Plans for the upcoming Year corruption. IMC is cooperating with inter-governmental organizations on developing e-learning modules on corruption prevention, internal controls and raising fraud awareness. They are targeted to a global audience of professionals in the humanitarian sector. Specific plans for 2017: IMC will continue cooperating with inter-governmental organizations on developing elearning modules on corruption prevention in order to increase their impact.
