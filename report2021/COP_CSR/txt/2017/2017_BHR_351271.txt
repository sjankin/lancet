Principle 1: Aim for Food Security, Health & Nutrition Businesses should support food and agriculture systems that optimize production and minimize waste, to provide nutrition and promote health for all people. 40 | BMMI COP Report Health & Nutrition Food Waste In 2015, GSS launched a nutrition improvement Bahrain—where most of our Alosra supermarkets initiative and hired a certified nutritionist to are located—wastes an average of 400 tons of provide menu-planning advice and nutritional food per day.

BMMI COP Report | 41 Principle 2: Be Environmentally Responsible Businesses should support sustainable intensification of food systems to meet global needs by managing agriculture, livestock, fisheries and forestry responsibly. They should protect and enhance the environment. BMMI is an ISO 14001 certified company and has not violated any environmental laws and regulations in any of the countries in which it operates, nor has the company been subject to sanctions and/or compliance fines. 42 | BMMI COP Report Under the IMS department, an environmental aspects register assesses between 50-80 activities impacting the environment, their significance, any legal requirements, and preventative measures to control those aspects by location. This includes spills, hazardous and non-hazardous waste management, emissions management, natural resource depletion, noise pollutions, and even contractor activities. As well as mitigation measures including training, awareness, monitoring, maintenance and engineering. Please refer to the Environmental section of this COP for further information. BMMI COP Report | 43 Principle 3: Ensure Economic Viability & Share Value Businesses should create, deliver and share value across the entire food and agriculture chain from farmers to consumers. Think Local is an integral part of our CSR programme that we are replicating in all our areas of operation. To reduce our carbon footprint, we educate and assist local farmers in the latest agricultural techniques in Mali and Ghana. This ensures we have a supply of fruit and vegetables within close proximity to the campsites we service without having to transport them from the city, which is often 10 to 15 hours away. The programme is a great way to make meaningful change in the countries where we operate. 44 | BMMI COP Report Ghana Mali In support of our 'Think Local' approach, GSS GSS has provided local farmers with seeds for was awarded a €74,000 financial contribution fruits and vegetables to grow around mining from the 'Swedish International Development areas.

BMMI COP Report | 45 Principle 4: Respect Human Rights, Create Decent Work and Help Communities To Thrive Businesses should respect the rights of farmers, workers and consumers. They should improve livelihoods, promote and provide equal opportunities. Under BMMI’s ‘Think Local’ initiative, Alosra supermarket identified and mentored a small and growing number of local farmers in hydroponic and greenhouse growing techniques and fertiliser use. Almost 15% of Alosra’s produce supply is now grown locally, ensuring a mutually beneficial partnership between the store and local producers. In Gabon, GSS sources around a third of its products locally. In Sudan, at least 50 % of total procurement is local—namely 100% of fresh fruits and vegetables, and chicken. Similarly, in Ghana GSS sources all fresh produce from local suppliers. 46 | BMMI COP Report From initially related to Sustainable Food & Agriculture sourcing fresh and local In order to support the 50 Gabonese members of the Association of Vegetable growers of produce in Bahrain, ‘Think Mandji Island (AMIM), GSS signed a contract with L’AMIM, a local Gabonese association of Local’ has rapidly gained farmers to help them grow a variety of fruits and stature as an integral part vegetables.

BMMI COP Report | 47 Principle 5: Encourage Good Governance and Accountability Businesses should behave legally and responsibly by respecting land and natural resource rights, avoiding corruption, being transparent about activities and recognising their impacts. BMMI’s operations have never infringed on land and natural resource rights and our environmental aspects register takes every precaution to identify any risks such as spill run-off that could pollute bodies of water and other natural habitats. Our GSS Gabon location has also supported the country’s national development plan Green Gabon. 48 | BMMI COP Report As a company, we value Honesty—one of our core values—and Truth, one of the three main pillars on which our CSR and Sustainability Policy was formed. Through annual reporting we strive to be more transparent about our sustainability initiatives—including the challenges we face. BMMI COP Report | 49 Principle 6: Promote Access and Transfer of Knowledge, Skills and Technology Businesses should promote access to information, knowledge and skills for more sustainable food and agricultural systems. In addition to knowledge, skills and technology transfer to farmers, Alosra also promotes knowledge of sustainable food and agricultural system to school students through experiential trips stopping along Alosra supermarkets’ supply chain. 50 | BMMI COP Report Both St. Christopher’s School Year 4 and British School of Bahrain’s preschool students participated in the trips. Pre-schoolers learned about the different fruits and vegetables on offer in Bahrain and whether they are grown on trees or on the ground, whereas the older crowd learned about their temperature storage. The highlight of the school trips was the visit to the farm, run by our Think Local farmer, Sadiq. Students were able to see fruits and vegetables that are grown on the farm. Teachers emphasised the value of the trips as they teach students, especially pre-schoolers, where their foods come from and how they are maintained. When usually asked where fruits and vegetables come from, pre-schoolers always answer, “the supermarket, silly!” While that is partially true, they now understand the different processes involved in providing them with their produce.
