Ensuring that quality medicines reach our patients is core to our daily business. We embarked on our CSR journey in 2012 acknowledging that our corporate responsibilities go beyond the safe development, manufacture and sale of our products. These responsibilities embrace how we operate as a business, what impact we have on our environment, supporting Michel Pettigrew the communities around us, and, taking into President of the Executive Board account a broader humanitarian need in the world. and Chief Operating Officer from the President of the Executive Board In early 2015 we published our first CSR Review (reviewing the period up to end of 2014). This second review, covers the period 2015 and 2016. I believe that it illustrates our good progress in integrating responsible approaches into our daily business, although I recognise that we still have some way to go. We have taken several significant steps during the period – notably including CSR strategies and goals in our next five-year business plan. We are quite far forward too, in developing a global responsibility platform in the area of reproductive health where we feel we can work with partners in the public sector to make a real difference to women’s health.

Section Two – Our CSR report 2016 As we prepared for our new business planning cycle (2017 – 2019) we required our affiliates to submit proposals for integrating socially responsible activities into their plans for that forthcoming period. We have made progress in developing a global signature programme on maternal health for Ferring in which all our affiliates and employees will be able to participate. To drive a responsible approach to business into our supply chain, we have a draft Principles of Conduct for our suppliers, guided by the UN Global Compact principles on Human Rights, Labour, the Environment and Anti-Corruption. We hope to pilot the Principles of Conduct with our first tier suppliers in 2017. We have also taken on the opinions of stakeholders expressed in our outreach activities of 2015 and 2016. This informed our first materiality assessment for the business, which identified key impacts and issues for our company. Addressing our stated plans to grow our activities across our global business regions – we have recruited about 20 CSR champions and advocates across the business to help us do this, and have Our Progress developed a draft set of volunteer guidelines. UN Global Compact A very important step for the company is our membership of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). As a signatory, we have committed to support the UNGC’s 10 Principles in the areas Report of Human Rights, Labour, Anti-Corruption and the Environment. We look forward to sharing our journey and to learning from other companies – both in our own industry and in other sectors. Signatories to the UNGC are required to produce an annual report detailing their activities in support of their commitment and in order to instil accountability. This review serves as our Communications on Progress to the United Nations Global Compact. The message from Michel Pettigrew, President of the Executive Board and COO, at the beginning of this review serves as our statement of continued support for this initiative. 16 17 People For our patients, and the medical Section Two – Our Pillars communities that support them, we aim to provide professional, medical, training or financial support in People therapeutic areas where we can make a difference.
