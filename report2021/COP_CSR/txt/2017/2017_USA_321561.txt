BOLD MOVES FOR A WINNING FUTURE 2016 STATE OF THE BUSINESS REPORT We manage Mosaic for the long term and for all our constituents— and that is why we have combined our annual outlook and sustainability reports into this, our first State of the Business Report. We think about sustainability broadly, in the true meaning of the word—the ability to sustain our business: Our social license to operate; our costs; our financial, safety and environmental performance; and our commitment to our communities all contribute to our sustainability and our ability to generate returns for shareholders. Joc O’Rourke President and CEO Dear Mosaic Stakeholders The economic and market challenges that faced the agriculture industry in 2015 persisted in 2016. Grain and oilseed prices remained low as farmers around the world harvested a huge crop for the fourth consecutive year, while fertilizer prices were impacted by weaker farm economics and the widespread perception that supply would outpace demand over the coming years. Potash and phosphate prices fell 33 and 23 percent, respectively, from already-diminished levels. At Mosaic, we faced these challenges head-on and recognized the opportunities they created. We made moves both necessary and bold to position Mosaic to win across the business cycle, and today we are poised to do just that. We have built a responsible and resilient company with a solid financial foundation and tremendous potential to deliver value as markets continue to improve. Our results for 2016 demonstrate our resilience. Mosaic earned $298 million for the year on $7.2 billion of revenue, compared with $1.0 billion of earnings on $8.9 billion of revenue in 2015. These results were respectable considering the steep declines in market prices for our products. Bold Moves Mosaic made major progress in 2016. I would like to We also made good progress in our work to permit new provide some highlights. phosphate mining areas in Florida.

And they will need fertilizers to do it. When it comes to producing enough food for a growing global population, healthy soils are paramount. Every time a crop is grown and harvested, nutrients are removed from the soil—and those nutrients must be replaced in order to continue producing food, feed, fuel and fiber crops. Potash and phosphate fertilizers make a vital contribution to healthy, productive soils by providing the nutrients plants need for growth. At Mosaic, we have the opportunity to help the world’s farmers meet the growing demands and ensure their soils are healthy with our innovative products and services.

Thank You The past few years have challenged many of our stakeholders: Tough markets can test patience, while cost cutting requires employees across the organization to make difficult choices. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you, for your patience, vision, hard work and dedication. I would also like to thank our many external partners—in our communities, at non-government organizations and our vendors—for your commitment to Mosaic. Corporate success increasingly requires wide social collaboration, and I am pleased that Mosaic has forged so many productive relationships. Finally, to our customers around the world: We exist to meet your needs, and we work hard every day to build close and enduring partnerships with you. We will continue this approach, and we greatly appreciate your loyalty to Mosaic. I believe the business cycle has begun its inevitable turn upward. Mosaic is poised to win and grow, and to benefit all its stakeholders. I look forward to a successful journey ahead and to more bold moves that will allow us to accelerate Mosaic’s momentum. Sincerely, James “Joc” C. O’Rourke President and Chief Executive Officer Global fertilizer April 2017 demand remains extremely strong.
