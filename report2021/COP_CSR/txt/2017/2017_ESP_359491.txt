Code None Version 2017 Progress Report 2016 Page 12 of 36 Methodology This Progress Report is based on the methodology of reporting by Stakeholders. The concept of the Stakeholder is key to understanding CSR. The complexity and dynamism of the current business context has made it necessary to acquire a solid commitment to the different Stakeholders, affected directly or indirectly by the business mission. Identifying Stakeholders and what their expectations are, are aspects that facilitate the comprehensive introduction of CSR in the heart of any organization. This enables organizations to anticipate possible risks or opportunities and establish policies, actions, follow up tools and indicators as described in this report. The CTL-TH Packaging Group has drawn up the Progress Report by developing the following steps: 1. Select the most relevant Stakeholders in your organization. 2. Identify the most significant challenges for the Stakeholders selected. POLICIES Formal documents in writing that define values, accident prevention and control tools and mechanisms, risks detected in the diagnosis. In this way communications and relations between the company and its Stakeholders are regulated. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS The diagnosis, assessment and control indicators for the results obtained by the actions implemented enable us to carry out an analysis of Stakeholders around the company and an analysis of the risks involved in topics related to the 10 Principles. In this way it is possible to know which policies and actions must be carried out for each Principle and which objectives must be set. provide the tools to control the fulfilment of policies and help to detect failures in management systems that need to be improved. ACTIONS Once the necessary policies are formalized, actions will serve to carry them out. The actions will help the organization to shape the policies developed and minimize the risks detected. The actions must be scheduled and designed according to the Stakeholder to which they are aimed. Documento propiedad del Grupo CTL-TH Packaging. Document property of the Group CTL-TH Packaging.

Principle 2 Companies must ensure that their businesses are not accomplices in the violation of Human Rights POLICIES Our policy and objectives are aligned with support and respect for the protection of fundamental Human Rights that are internationally recognized. The organization has written and implemented an Ethical Code We have a comprehensive internal management system that incorporates internal policies, regulations and procedures related to the quality of the product, verification controls and manufacturing processes in accordance with international and internal standards. Our internal management system, besides including operating procedures and processes related to the organization, the people who belong to it and their interrelations, also determines standards in relation to our product and supply chain. There are comprehensive procedures in our internal integrated management system linked to internal policies, regulations and processes relating to quality, Human resources, the organization, Customer service and Suppliers: “P.00.00015 – Following up the Ethical Code and Functions of the Ethical Committee and Protocol to report to the Ethical Code” In addition, with regard to Employees, we include in the internal general management document all the processes and procedures to select personnel, hire, recruit, labour relations, conflict management, promotion, objective assessment of performance, etc. and we have also reflected the setup of our internal organization, distribution by areas and functions.

Code None Version 2017 Progress Report 2016 Page 19 of 36 We have proceeded to implement a policy of formal purchases in accordance with CSR principles and our current management systems, also bearing in mind the system designed to control the degree of compliance. DIAGNOSIS, FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We can state that the CTL-TH Packaging Group complies strictly with legal regulations in this area, as companies are permanently subjected to public control by the administration, and also by internal company means (HR department and workers’ representatives) which guarantee compliance with these regulations. The risk is indirect non-compliance with Human Rights and the United Nations Global Compact Principles, because some of our Stakeholders do not comply, as a consequence of our lack of verification, control and/or surveillance of some who are suppliers of raw materials that do not involve presence in our company. However, we must make it clear that the company checks the contract conditions of workers of subcontractors. In relation to suppliers of articles, these suppliers are annually assessed in the quality system, which includes controls linked to Human Rights detected during audits carried out. This is carried out through audits on suppliers, to whom the Ethical Code of the CTLTH Packaging Group is transmitted. Currently our supplier classification is based on a quarterly review of their contribution of complete material, with the quality agreed upon and on the agreed date. The CSR criteria is added to the assessment of suppliers, pending the data analysis. ACTIONS The main objective for the coming year is the materialization of our CSR policy in a public document, to integrate it in our global management system and share it among all the stakeholders.

Code None Version 2017 Progress Report 2016 Page 22 of 36 The CTL-TH Packaging S.L.U company pact is agreed between the company committee of the organization and is signed by both parties. The company Committee verifies together with HR that at each moment complies with CSR conditions related to the principles and in the event of incidence, an internal communication is carried out, which is registered as an Agenda (content of the incidence, resolution, persons in charge, etc.). Meeting agendas and all agreements adopted by mutual agreement with the Company Committee are included in an internal database and also communicated globally to all Employees, becoming part of the internal regulations of the Company. In this way several lines of direct communication are maintained with the employee, well known by all the staff, who is incorporated into the workforce on being recruited: direct meetings with the person in charge and with the company committee, internal email address, memos, collective meetings with Management and Worker Assemblies. We do not restrict the time for meetings according to the legal minimum for collective negotiation, but invest whatever time is necessary to suitably manage each circumstance. We must incorporate the criteria defined in the previously written CSR policy into future selection processes, in which we include criteria for gender equality and respect for diversity as well as verification procedures for compliance with these policies and incident management. Hiring in the company, both nationally and internationally, is regulated by current regulations in Spain with regard to the minimum age for access to the labour market, i.e. 18 years of age. We omit the possibility of carrying out labour contracts with persons aged over 16 with the authorization of their legal representative. We promote a policy which tends to keep a stable workforce and in which currently less than 2% of staff in the organization are in a temporary situation. We have a general and formal policy with regard to family conciliation for employees, pending identification and registration. Finally we disseminate this policy in writing among all the staff in the company, through the usual internal media, as well as among other Stakeholders Our safety and health management system is certified by OHSAS 18001 in some of the group companies. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We have not verified if our Stakeholders Suppliers and Clients comply properly with these principles and in particular if they support the elimination of all kinds of forced or coercive labour. We have pending the dissemination of information to our supply chain about good working conditions and the absence of forced labour. Documento propiedad del Grupo CTL-TH Packaging.

Code None Version 2017 Progress Report 2016 Page 23 of 36 We have a formal procedure for the management of actions and assessment of staff based on competencies, potential and/or professional projection and staff must respond to the expectations of professional growth for employees as well as coverage of future needs by the organization of the company. We have no risk of hiring underage persons. We verify all contracts with the identification of the employee and carry out an initial medical check-up, which all national and international employees of the company fulfil as adults when formalizing the labour contract. We consider that discrimination for gender reasons is our greatest risk, and despite the existence of an equality plan, we must update and be vigilant in order to ensure comprehensive compliance. A concrete action has not yet been established for the promotion of effective equality of opportunities between men and women in all aspects, including access to management posts. With regard to the companies that work in our installations, the system checks compliance with this principle. Audits are carried out which check compliance of this principle by different suppliers. Annually the data composition of management bodies and the rest of the employees are incorporated into annual accounts and report on the activity of the company, which are public and registered in the Commercial forum. Additionally and monthly a report is provided on the composition of the workforce and the development of employment by functional areas, for the corporate governance organs and worker representatives. In order to ensure compliance with the Ethical Code, resolve incidences or doubts about the interpretation and adopt suitable measures for better fulfilment, the Committee for the application and follow up of the Ethical Code was created. The mission of this committee is to promote the dissemination and application of the ethical principles, in all the activities that the company carries out. It will be consist of the General Management, HR and SIG managers of each company in the Group. During 2016 no cases were registered nor was any previously open case resolved due to accusations of harassment, abuse or intimidation in the workplace. We will proceed with a reminder of the internal procedure to report and resolve situations of harassment, abuse or intimidation in the workplace, through the usual internal means of communication and dissemination.

We keep a strict compliance with current legality with regard national and international regulations of countries where we operate, with regard to the control and abolition of any kind of corruption which might arise, including extortion and bribery. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS We have carried out a diagnosis to get to know internal and activity areas with a greater risk of corruption, with the result that we have located in the Supplier supply chain, due to the markets in which we operate and their own idiosyncrasies. There is no procedure to assess the degree of knowledge, with regard to our codes of conduct and policies against corruption and bribery in relation to our Stakeholders, with the exception of the employees group.

Code None Version 2017 Progress Report 2016 Page 32 of 36 Feedback from the Stakeholders Apart from the 10 principles, the CTL-TH Packaging Group, as a result of the management of Stakeholders (audits, visits, surveys, follow ups by interest groupO), has the extended policy, diagnosis and actions, which will be described below. DIAGNOSIS / FOLLOW UP AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACTS  Feedback for “Employees” Over the year 2016, the employees of the companies in the CTL-TH Packaging Group sent their opinions and concerns via different means, although basically we can focus this exchange of information on annual sessions of information and communication I+C calls, as well as multiple periodical meetings which we hold with Representatives of the workers in the companies in the Group. From all this activity, the most relevant information about what worries the employees of these companies, without doubt, are subjects linked to the future and strategy of the company, innovation which we are implementing, and potential success and trade development in our markets. Therefore, the most outstanding aspect is, without doubt, everything related to the stability and future of our company. Secondly, we are also aware of interest about all topics related to training and the development of company employees, recent years in this period have seen very little activity in terms of initiatives linked with training, the promotion of individuals and personal development in the companies.  Feedback for “Clients” The main clients are increasingly more involved in CSR in different ways. 1) Based on codes of conduct or the ethical code which are sent to us either as information or so that we will be committed to fulfilling their principles. The trend for 2016 is on the up. Documento propiedad del Grupo CTL-TH Packaging. Document property of the Group CTL-TH Packaging. Difusión bajo Autorización.

Generally, according to the commentaries of our clients and comparing with the competition, the CTL-TH Packaging group Has the right focus to develop CSR. Is well positioned with regard to other suppliers, even the largest who have teams 100% dedicated to CSR. The best that clients highlight are: CSR policy with written commitment and quantifiable with progress report and for each company. CSR roles and responsibilities: clearly define the CSR organization (diagram) with objectives (quantifiable) and progress plan Analysis of the carbon footprint or ACV for the product (to be integrated into tenders) All of these points have been integrated into corresponding action plan and the general actions planned for 2017-2019.  Feedback for “Suppliers” With regard to suppliers, we should point out that we include CSR aspects during audits (Prevention, environment, management of human resources, ethical code for suppliers,O).
