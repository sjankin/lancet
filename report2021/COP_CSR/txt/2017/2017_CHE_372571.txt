P recious to us 2016 Sustainability Report Letter to our stakeholders We work constantly and enthusiastically with our stakeholders to maximise the sustainability of our company and of our industry. For all of us, the respect of human rights, protection of the environment, ethical procedures and transparency, in addition to compliance with all rules and laws, are as precious as the metals we process. This is why we have decided to summarise our approach to corporate social responsibility with the concept “Precious to us”, symbolising our dedication to daily operations and the enthusiasm with which we have prepared this Report. This concept represents our Company’s five commitments to you. Five shared commitments through which we fulfil our pledge to be a responsible company. Five commitments that are the basis of this Report. Our Group’s new ownership structure will maintain this approach. We prepared this Report according to the latest sustainability guidelines issued by the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), the foremost international standard for sustainability reporting. In addition, this year’s Report describes the Group’s actions with regard to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact concerning human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption: an initiative that we continue to support. These additional steps confirm our continuous 2 commitment to sustainability as well as our intention to make this Report an even more effective platform for sharing the work and results achieved during the year.

In 2016, we had 46 car pooling groups and subsidised 50% of the company’s Arcobaleno public transportation pass for 22 employees (made possible in part by the parking tax paid by employees who 46 CAR drive alone to work).
