Statement from the CEO 2016 was an eventful year for Columbus. We launched our new 5-year strategy Columbus2020, with the goal of helping our customers in the digital transformation. The strategy contains five interconnected elements that support the goal; Customer Success, Digital Leadership, Our People, and Process Excellence. Employee-well-being & development Employee well-being and development is the key focus in Columbus’ CSR effort, and with the strategic initiative Our People, we emphasize the focus on satisfied and engaged employees. Columbus is a people business and our talented employees are crucial for our successes. In Columbus, our employees are experts within our core fields, and work closely together across country borders sharing knowledge and expertise in order to grow and keep abreast of trends in our industry. We strive to create an environment in which we enjoy working together, and where our employees thrive in their job and continue to develop themselves professionally. We want our employees to be engaged in building a great company for the benefit of employees, customers and shareholders. Being a global company, there are natural differences in business cultures, rules and laws in the countries, where Columbus operates. To ensure that all subsidiaries operate within the same business conduct, we have completed Columbus’ Code of Conduct, which prospectively is the ethical guideline for our business operations and at the same time the strategic guiding principle for our CSR. UN Global Compact Columbus joined the UN Global Compact in 2012. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact has helped us develop our business in a positive direction and has increased the awareness of corporate social responsibility. This Communication on Progress report (COP) states Columbus’ engagement and compliance with the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact within the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment/climate and Anti-Corruption. Columbus considers the overall achievements in relation to the company’s corporate social responsibility to be satisfactory. We commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication.

Code of Conduct Columbus complies with the requirements of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and The United Nations Convention against Corruption. Respecting human and labour rights is fundamental to our business. Columbus has established Code of Conduct, which is our general ethical guideline for business conduct to ensure that we in Columbus on a global level are dedicated to promote ethical business practices and protect Columbus against corruption and other unethical business behavior, which we believe is incompatible with the operation of a healthy business. Code of Conduct applies to Columbus’ parent company and all subsidiaries. We expect and demand that all parties acting on behalf of Columbus respect our Code of Conduct. Transparency and Credibility In Columbus, we are committed to show complete openness towards customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers and other stakeholders. It is essential that their understanding of our services and products is accurate, updated and truthful. Therefore, there is no incongruence between what we communicate within the company and what we do externally. Anti-corruption We will not tolerate corruption, money laundering, bribery or other illegal or unethical business activity. Our performance and competitiveness are strengthened solely through lawful conduct. The Group’s anti-corruption position has been clearly communicated to all subsidiaries. Furthermore, we have implemented Columbus Authorization and Risk Management Rules (CARMR), which encompass rules on the authorization hierarchy and ensure the senior management’s involvement in major contracts and investments. Human Rights All employees in Columbus have been carefully selected on the basis of professional competencies without regard to religion, race, skin color, gender, age, disability or sexual or political orientation. We regard multiplicity as a strength and we will not tolerate discrimination or harassment. Diversity It is essential that all employees experience that Columbus has an open and unprejudiced culture where each individual is able to make the best use of his/her competencies, and that all regardless of gender have the same possibilities for career development and management positions. The Board of Directors has set the following targets for gender distribution in Columbus: • The proportion of women in the Columbus Board of Directors to 20% by the end of 2018. • The proportion of female managers in Columbus A/S to obtain a minimum of 20% by the end of 2020 (Columbus only reports on the progress in the Danish Parent Company, Columbus A/S, according to the Danish Business Authority’s guidelines). Page 4 of 9 Columbus Communication on Progress 2016 UN Global Compact At the end of 2016, the percentage of women in Columbus A/S constituted 12.5%. On a global level, the gender distribution at management level constituted 27.5% women and 72.5% men. Although Columbus does not report on progress for the parent company, Columbus focuses on increasing the proportion of woman at management level in all subsidiaries. For detailed information, please find the report on Gender distribution at Columbus’ Investor site under Governance and CSR. 4. Our People In 2016, we launched Columbus2020 with the strategic element Our People as one of the four strategic elements. Besides being a strategic focus in our strategy, employee well-being and development are the core focus area of our CSR efforts. Our greatest asset is our people, and therefore it is crucial for our success that we attract and retain the best employees in the industry. We want Columbus to be a company smart people join, and where they stay longer. A key focus for Columbus is thus offering challenging career opportunities, attractive working conditions and professional and personal development. Columbus is a global company with subsidiaries in ten countries with very different cultures, religions and traditions. The employee handbooks in our subsidiaries treat local policies on working conditions. Despite that employees’ working conditions are already on a high level compared to local standards, we continuously work on improving employee well-being and employee development aiming at common level across the company. Columbus2020 initiatives With the Our People focus in Columbus2020, we have initiated two strategic programs that will further development Columbus; Performance Excellence and Columbus Academy. Performance Excellence Columbus’ goal is to support high performance across Columbus. In order to reach that goal, Columbus introduced the program Performance Excellence, which on a global scale helps individuals and organizations in Columbus accomplish their goals. To support that goal Columbus has rolled out Columbus’ Competence and Career Framework (CCF) across the company. CCF is a system designed to ensure a targeted and structured effort on our employees’ competence and career development. The framework includes specific and well-defined targets on how the employees can improve and develop their career to the next level. Page 5 of 9 Columbus Communication on Progress 2016 UN Global Compact CCF is running on a digital platform, named GROW, across the Columbus Group. This means that we have digitalized the processes, which enables transparency of the documentation and streamlines the rating across subsidiaries. In 2016, Columbus continued the investment in career and skills development across Columbus, including an upgraded CCF, which means Columbus today has a unified setup in all subsidiaries. Columbus Academy We want Columbus to be a learning organization where we strive to become better, more educated and understanding how we can excel in our industry and deliver excellent customer experience. In 2016, we introduced Columbus Academy with the goal of providing our employees with relevant and engaging learning experiences that keep them at the forefront of the functions and processes at the heart of their job. Columbus Academy will be developed and rolled out during the next five-year period with the goal of having a full training curriculum for all functions in Columbus. Employee Well-being Employee well-being is a key focus in Columbus, and each month employees rate their job satisfaction through Columbus Heartbeat, our global employee satisfaction survey. Heartbeat is a simple survey, where employees are asked to answer one question: On a scale from one to ten, the employee are asked to rate their job satisfaction. The purpose of Heartbeat is continuously to improve the employee satisfaction in Columbus. The survey is not anonymous, and this makes us able to follow the development in employee satisfaction on department, country and on a global level in Columbus. The high frequency of the survey provides an exact and up-to-date picture of the employee satisfaction. And the result of the survey creates the basis for specific initiatives and improvements. In 2016, we reached an average Heartbeat response rate of 85%, which is the highest response ever in Columbus Heartbeat. In 2016, the average satisfaction level was 7.38 on a scale from one to ten. This is the highest satisfaction since we started Heartbeat in 2013. Employee Recognition In Columbus, we are proud of our many talented employees, and therefore we launched the portal Faces of Columbus in 2012, where all employees are encouraged to share portraits. We utilize the pictures in both our internal and external communications. The purpose is to promote Columbus as a company which puts employees at the center of attention – and to show our employees that each of them are an important part of Columbus. Employee recognition is vital. This is why we have launched our annual awards “Columbus Awards” on a global level. The purpose is to recognize and celebrate teams, who made a special effort and delivered extraordinary performances, in particular towards our customers. The winners of Columbus Awards are teams and subsidiaries. Page 6 of 9 Columbus Communication on Progress 2016 UN Global Compact Employee Dialog We strive to grow the dialogue with our employees and dialogue between employees in Columbus across borders in order to strengthen our community. The aim is that everyone feels as part of a global team, and that everyone's voice counts and is listened to. Yammer is our social, digital forum where all employees have the opportunity to debate with each other, ask questions, post inspirational messages and follow each other's achievements. Once every month all employees in Columbus receive a global newsletter. The newsletters ensures that all employees obtain a thorough knowledge of the strategy and the development in Columbus’ business. Furthermore, the newsletters are aimed to be inspiration and motivation to work towards our common goals. We continually strive to create more employee involvement and dialog. Among other things, we will work determinedly to make the newsletters become our employees’ mouthpiece to an even larger degree. 5. Environment and climate impact Being mostly office based means that our business’ impact on environmental impact is relatively small. However, Columbus continuously optimizes our offices in order to be energy-efficient and healthy working environments for our employees. Being a global company, our business activities include travel, which do have an impact on environment. We aim to minimize unnecessary travel by plane and instead promote and develop virtual meeting, which also improve the efficiency in our business. Page 7 of 9 Columbus Communication on Progress 2016 UN Global Compact 6. Community and Charity initiatives In Columbus, we are proud that several of our subsidiaries are engaged in community and charity initiatives. We regard this as an expression of commitment and team spirit and the initiatives are important in two ways: They contribute to the employee well-being internally in Columbus, and they promote Columbus as a company, which engages in sustainable development in the communities, in which we operate. It is essential, that we are involved in community and charitable initiatives. We have decided to emphasize these initiatives in our CSR report. By emphasizing local community and charity initiatives in Columbus, we hope to generate similar initiatives. However, these must always be based solely on our employees’ voluntary commitment. Below is a brief description of our local CSR initiatives. Columbus Russia Columbus Russia participates in ecological initiative called ”Utilize low-voltage batteries”. The employees in Columbus Russia collect used low-voltage batteries to transfer them for ecological utilization. Garbage utilization is practically absent in Russia, and separation of dangerous waste is not part of the Russian culture. However, in Columbus we consider environmental protection an important component of everyday life. InterDyn BMI InterDyn BMI has donated $1,000 to three different charity purposes: • Zonta International Foundation, which work for empowering woman and expand their access to education, health care, economic opportunities and safe living conditions. • The Arc, which promotes and protects the humans rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, actively supporting them and their families in a lifetime of full inclusion and participation in the communities. • Goodwill Industries International, which works to enhance the dignity and quality of life of individuals and families by strengthening communities, eliminating barriers to opportunity, and helping people in need reach their full potential through learning and the power of work. The decision on which charity project to support was taken by InterDyn BMI customers, who voted for the charity they wanted InterDyn BMI to support.
