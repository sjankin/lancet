This major initiative from the United Nations is to call to companies to align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals. Social and environmental responsibility is a voluntary process and has been a priority in the development of GESTION CREDIT EXPERT’s activities since 1970. Our mission is to provide our clients with sustainable and effective solutions based on respect for and protection of human rights, employment law and the environment; we are also deeply committed to facilitating the fight against corruption. This mission would be impossible without our employees, our clients and our partners, who support the firm and share our convictions. With the present document, I wish to advance the UN global compact 10 principles, so that they will continue to be integrated in our group daily life, its strategy and its process. And maybe, it is my hope that we inspire our readers to support the Global Compact too. This is why, i am delighted to renew GESTION CREDIT EXPERT Group’s commitment to the United Nations Global Compact.

In 2016 we took the leap and faced the challenge. Since the EcoVadis CSR audit is purely based on documents, the amount of official documents required was huge. But the effort paid off, since on its first evaluation, GESTION CREDIT EXPERT was awarded the Silver rating, taking it into the TOP 15% of suppliers evaluated by EcoVadis in the category ‘Activities of collection agencies and credit bureaus’ and in the TOP 15% of suppliers evaluated by EcoVadis across all categories. In 2017, for its second audit, GESTION CREDIT EXPERT is aiming for the best possible rating, the EcoVadis Gold status. 21 Communication on Progress 2016 GESTION CREDIT EXPERT I July 2017 ENVIRONMENT The GESTION CREDIT EXPERT group has based its policy for the control and reduction of its environmental impact on three fundamental commitments: 1compliance with current regulations 2the prevention of various types of pollution 3continuous improvement of knowledge, challenges and action implemented for better environmental performance. OBJECTIVE: ENERGY SAVING, RECYcertificates, salary certificates, copies of salary slips … are done on line using the HR CLING AND WASTE REDUCTION intranet. All internal communications have also been digitalised, including the welcome Eco-action, near-generalised practice booklet, all documents for new recruits, internal notes and general information, which are which must become systematic. transmitted by e-mail. We have thus reduced our consumption of paper. Within the context of communications to employees, awareness of eco-responsible actions is regularly aroused using e-mail. For example we encourage the use of standby mode on computers, screens and printers, we encourage people to turn the lights off when they leave their offices … by frequent reminders of good practice either sent by email or displayed on posters in high people traffic areas. Water fountains are available to employees, to limit the need to purchase of plastic bottles. To reduce our operating waste, we have parametered printers to ensure that recto/ verso printing in black and white is the default choice. We also recycle used cartridges, cardboard boxes and plastics. For this we have set up a partnership with a local recycling company. We make staff aware of the need to recycle and we have provided collection skips. The GESTION CREDIT EXPERT group has also undertaken a major project to digitalise some of its procedures: requests for leave and requests made to HR for employment 22 Communication on Progress 2016 GESTION CREDIT EXPERT I July 2017 ENVIRONMENT For the dispatch of mail and parcels, we Restricting pollutant business travel mainly use the French postal service, “La and carbon emissions.

For better quality of life at work, GESTION CREDIT EXPERT plans to equip its offices with acoustic totems and panels. A meeting room will also be made available to staff for work meetings, private telephone calls or for use during the lunch break. GESTION CREDIT EXPERT also plans to make its responsible purchasing action official for all general purchasing (PEFC paper produced from sustainably managed forest, use of ISO 14000 certified and imprim’vert printers, ecological cleaning products …). Although in reality the purchasing department already ensures that it gives preference to ecological products, a written charter will mean that all these actions are properly managed and made general practice for the purchase of all general products. 23 Communication on Progress 2016 GESTION CREDIT EXPERT I July 2017 COMBAT AGAINST CORRUPTION As a founder member of the ANCR, the National Union of Debt Collection and Commercial Information Firms, and then of FENCA, the Federation of European National Collection Associations, which define the profession’s ethical rules, GESTION CREDIT EXPERT is committed to complying with these rules and to promoting them.
