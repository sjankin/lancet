During 2016 we have focused on running our business in Manufacturing, Industrial Solutions and Site Solutions. This for sure has contributed to the improvements in the business continuing into 2016. 2016 was the year where we, after having finalized major structural projects to create a cost leadership combined with a focused market approach through specialized business units that have individual customer focus, also carried through changes in the management team with the aspiration go create a high performance team that can take AH Industries the next mile into the future. In respect of our values Proactive, Responsible, and Teamwork we have integrated these as well as our CSR policies in the Employee Development Dialogue (EDD). Combined with changes in the Management Team, AH Industries stands stronger and more focused than before. Management expects to see improvements in the results in the years to come. August 2013, we signed the UN Global Compact and thereby officially support the 10 principles within Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption. UN Global Compact serves as our mainframe for our work with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), anchored with our CSR policy. Working dedicatedly with CSR is important for our core business at AH Industries as well as for our stakeholders. During 2016, we have worked to further develop our CSR work by strengthening the implementation of CSR with core business processes, activities and culture. By this report I reaffirm AH Industries continued support of the ten business principles of the UN Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour Standards, Environment, and Anti-corruption. We describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. We intend to provide an open insight to the progress we have made as well as the challenges we face related to our work with corporate social responsibility. Each day we do our best to earn our position as a sustainable business partner. Knud Andersen CEO, AH Industries A/S 2 About the Report This report is part of Management’s Review in our annual report, and refers to the year of 01.01.2016 – 31.12.2016. The report encompasses data from the companies of AH Industries Holding A/S. This is the fifth report of its kind at AH Industries. The report is based on data, which has been collected through our group CSR&HSE data platform. August 2013, AH Industries signed the UN Global Compact. Our signing to the UN Global Compact officially states our support to the ten principles within Human Rights, Labour Standards, Environment and Anticorruption. Thus, this report also serves as our Communication on Progress Report (COP Report). An overview of primary COP elements encompassed by this CSR report is to be found at page 23. Moreover, the report is inspired by the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines, (GRI4), for which reason this report contains Standard Disclosures from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. A systematic and foundational materiality assessment has been performed with the purpose to identify the most material and relevant CSR issues for AH Industries to focus on, work with, and report on. The process of this materiality assessment is framed by the GRI4 Reporting Guidelines and founded on an analysis encompassing stakeholder expectations, internal group policies as well as the ten business principles from the UN Global Compact. A list of Standard Disclosures and Indicators from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines is to be found at page 23 and 24. This list of Indicators encompassed by the report is furthermore cross-referenced with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Annually, we review our materiality assessment. This year’s review confirmed focus and thereby content and focus areas of our CSR policy, ensuring for the CSR policy to set continued guidance on our CSR effort. The CSR policy is founded on the five main topics: Business Ethics Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity Health and Safety Environment and Climate Responsible Supplier Management. AH Industries has a significant impact on business partners, employees, owners, the environment and society. This report is part of our related responsibility to communicate openly about our CSR effort to our stakeholders. At AH Industries, it is a matter of course to comply with legislation and regulation in general, at a local, national, and global level. We have received no significant sanctions for failure to comply with laws and regulations during the reporting period. 3 Organizational Facts AH Industries supply steel, metal and cast iron components, products and supply chain solutions to business areas such as the wind industry, the cement and mineral industries, the off-shore and marine industries, and the machine processing industry.

By 2013, we are a signatory of UN Global Compact, supporting, Human Rights, Labour Standards, Environment and Anticorruption. Since 2012, all AH Industries companies, globally, have been certified according to OHSAS 18001 (Occupational Health and Safety Standard) as well as to ISO 14001 (Environmental Standard). In other words, this means that we, as an integrated part of our foundation for CSR and in accordance with our existing global ISO 9001 certification of our Quality Management system, have established a well-functioning global HSE organisation. At AH Industries, evaluations regarding environment and occupational health and safety are, as far as possible, included equally to other evaluations and considerations in the foundation for major decisions, investments and expansions. All Business Units have successfully passed recertification and surveillance audits by 3rd party auditor. Our Understanding of Corporate Social Responsibility AH Industries regards CSR as an important part of our business, as do our stakeholders, who continuously increase requirements regarding our CSR engagement. At AH Industries, CSR means to do business in a responsible manner, balancing our financial, social and environmental responsibility – also known as the Triple Bottom Line. This balance of responsibility is an integrated part of strategy and every-day activities. We prioritize and perform responsible and ethical business conduct and have set a high standard for responsible business behaviour expected by employees, suppliers and business partners. Our business integrated approach to CSR is regarded as an opportunity to create shared value; meaning value for AH Industries, our stakeholders as well as for society. In our opinion, the advantages of a business integrated approach to CSR are many. Listed below are, what we consider to be, some of the most significant advantages. Meeting demands from stakeholders and gaining strengthened competitiveness Risk management Cost savings 6 Corporate Social Responsibility Policy The foundation for our business integrated approach to CSR takes root in our group CSR policy. The purpose of the policy is to communicate AH Industries’ understanding of and opinion on CSR and to ensure for this to be reflected at all levels of the organisation as well as with the organisation’s relation with society and stakeholders. The CSR policy encompasses the five main topics: Business Ethics – Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity – Health and Safety – Environment and Climate – Responsible Supplier Management. Business Ethics We demonstrate honesty and integrity in our relations with, owners, colleagues, authorities, customers, suppliers, partners, organisations and other business relations. Our Code of Conduct contains the standards that every AH Industries employee must comply with. Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity We respect Human Rights. We are a diverse workplace with room for all types of employees no matter sex, religion, ethnic/social background, political view, age or sexual orientation. Being a diverse workplace also means that we give room for employment of disabled people and people with reduced ability to work. Health and Safety We work to secure our employees a safe and healthy working environment, proactively preventing industrial injuries and work related injuries. No work related situations at AH Industries should expose our employees to danger or endanger their health. Environment and Climate We work to secure that all activities are performed with much environmental care and with a focus to continuously initiating energy and environmental improvements. Responsible Supplier Management We work to secure safety in our supply chain by demanding of our suppliers that they act in compliance with UN Global Compact through our Supplier Code of Conduct. If a supplier fails to comply with this we will enter into a constructive dialogue with the supplier about implementing corrective actions. 7 Code of Conduct Supporting our CSR Policy, our requirements and expectations regarding our own behaviour as well as the behaviour of suppliers are stated in our Internal Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. Both documents are composed in compliance with UN’s Universal Declaration on Human Rights5 and the conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO), as well as UN Global Compact. Human Rights and Labor Standards With root in our Internal Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of Conduct, it is a matter of course, at AH Industries, to support and comply with internationally proclaimed Human Rights and Labour Standards. We are geographically represented through own sites and suppliers in countries where compliance with Human Rights and Labour Standards is not a given. Thus, we work actively to support and comply with Human Rights and Labour Standards both internally at AH Industries as well as through dialogue with our suppliers. Environment Our Internal Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct require of AH Industries and suppliers to comply with all environmental legislation to protect the environment. Anti-Corruption Our Internal Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of conduct state our group policy of zero-tolerance for corruption. Thus, our Internal Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code of conduct are the basis for positive development and improvement with regard to anti-corruption. Group Risk Assessment Exposure to risk is part of doing business. The challenge, therefore, is to manage, control, reduce or eliminate identified risks. During 2016 we have been working systematically with our strategic Group Risk Management Programme. During 2015, the program was subject for revision and significant update and strengthening. The purpose and result of this review ensures: Stronger link to strategy and business focus Stronger implementation with core business Broader and deeper employee involvement and ownership At AH Industries, we find that an updated and active risk matrix is essential to perform risk management aimed towards our most material and factual risks. In order to maintain an updated risk matrix, we designed our risk management process as an on-going annual process, to be integrated within our management at Group level as well as Business Unit level. Our risk management process is structured around five main steps. Risk Risk Risk Risk Reporting Risk Reporting Identification Classification Management (Board) (Owner) Ongoing management and follow-up 5 With reference to Danish legislation and The Danish Financial Statements Act, our Code of Conduct encompasses and communicates our respect and support of the protection of internationally proclaimed Human Rights. We will remedy violations in case we become involved in violations of human rights. 8 Anti-corruption risk assessment Supporting our Group Risk Assessment we perform independent anti-corruption risk assessment. The first assessment was performed in 2013. The result was, and still is, a low risk profile. Based on the risk profile, an anti-corruption program has been implemented. The anti-corruption risk assessment is reviewed annually, and the related anti-corruption program updated accordingly. Anti-corruption activities are explained in the section on Business Ethics. Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting 2016 Our CSR policy is put into practice, mainly through our Code of Conduct, Occupational Health and Safety policy, Environmentand Climate policy, Human Resource policy, and our policy on Gender Equality. AH Industries’ CSR framework, aligned with UN Global Compact. CSR Policy Internal Supplier Code of Conduct Code of Conduct OHS Policy & Environmentand Climate Gender Equality Policy Human Resource Policy Policy In the following sections, each of the main topics from the CSR Policy, Business Ethics – Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity – Health and Safety – Environment and Climate – Responsible Supplier Management will be reported on by Practice, Progress, and Future Focus. 9 Business Ethics – Practice AH Industries operates its business in a responsible manner and we want to contribute to sustainable development, as well as maintain and strengthen our high degree of integrity and credibility. Good and ethical business behaviour is expected from all employees at AH Industries. Our Code of Conduct, which is an ethical set of rules, communicates what is expected of all employees in relation to ethical business behaviour and anti-corruption. Our Code of Conduct also serves as our policy on Human Rights and communicates our respect and support of the protection of internationally proclaimed Human Rights. At the launch of our Code of Conduct, all employees were thoroughly informed on content and purpose of this document. Furthermore, employees in risk positions, including Sales, Purchase and Management were informed in more detail on the content of the Code of Conduct specifically related to their position and area of responsibility. Our Code of Conduct informs of a reporting guidance for reporting incidents and/or suspicion of noncompliance with the Code of Conduct. Proactively our Business Unit in China has implemented preventive measures, to ensure continuous compliance with Human Rights and Labour standards. At our Chinese Business Unit we have no employees under the age of 18 and salary level is higher than the minimum wage stipulated by local authority. Employees can work overtime, only if they chose to do so voluntarily. Moreover, they have established an employee committee with representatives who, on behalf of all employees, discuss policies, rules or other issues with management. Lastly there is a suggestion box for employees to freely express their opinion. Business Ethics – Progress Our Code of Conduct is developed in respect of stakeholder requirements, including, customers, owner as well as UN Global Compact. The Code of Conduct is available in relevant languages for all employees at AH Industries, covering publication in English, Danish and Chinese. At all Sites, the Code of Conduct is published at platforms accessible to employees, e.g. website, Intranet, notice boards. As a central part of the implementation of the Code of Conduct, all members of the Management Group have signed the Code of Conduct – leading the way with a good example. Policies Our Code of Conduct has, in both Denmark and China, been implemented as part of a hand-out-kit of documents for new White Collar employees. These documents are further introduced at our Group Introduction Programme, also for new White Collar employees in Denmark. During 2016, 18 new white collar employees participated at Group Introduction in Denmark, receiving information on Human Rights Labours Standards and Business Ethics, as part of the CSR introduction. Moreover, our Code of Conduct has been implemented in our Employee Development Dialogue Tool (EDD), for employees in both Denmark and China. Completing the EDD the employee will sign to have read and understood the Code of Conduct. 10 Our Whistleblower Service enables all employees and/or stakeholders globally to report a concern regarding potential non-compliance with our Code of Conduct. The Whistleblower Service is administered by our appointed Whistleblower Team, ensuring for anonymous case handling. In order to ensure a strong anchoring of the Whistleblower service, the service is supported by a detailed information kit, including a Whistleblower Guideline published in English, Danish and Chinese. Below chart illustrates development in reports of concern, filed via the Whistleblower Service.

Business Ethics – Future Focus With reference to our Code of Conduct, the following is reported as objective for reporting period 01.01.2017 – 31.12.2017. Signing of Code of Conduct as part of completing the Employee Development Dialogue (EDD). 6 For explanation on the incident of non-compliance from 2014 – Please see CSR Report for 2014 11 Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity – Practice AH Industries is a diverse workplace with room for all types of employees no matter sex, religion, ethnic/social background, political view, age or sexual orientation. We strive to maintain and make room for employees, who due to illness, physical, psychological, or social reasons are not able to perform in their previous position and/or have reduced ability to work. During 2013, we launched a policy on Gender Equality7 with the purpose to further career development for men and women on an equal basis. The ambition of the owners and Board of Directors is to have a balanced gender composition. The policy on Gender Equality focuses on Mid-level Managers8, as the first management level at AH Industries. The group of Mid-level Managers represent the first step of potential management development within the management levels of Mid-level Managers, Senior Managers, Directors, and the Executive Board. It is expected that a focus on management development, beginning at Mid-level Management, will have a natural effect on the gender distribution at all management levels. AH Industries is part of an industry dominated primarily by male employees. Thus, in order to attract and develop female employees, equally qualified to male employees, and thereby obtain a more balanced gender composition, the policy is supported by the following activities9. Annual seminar for Mid-level Managers Annual evaluation of recruitment process, to ensure gender neutrality With reference to the policy on Gender Equality, our objective is as follows: By 2016, the Board of Directors aim for the female board members to represent a minimum of 20 %, and by 2019 it is the aim that female board members represent a minimum of 40 % In addition to our policy on Equal Opportunity, our Human Resource policy is our main foundation for our focus on employee well-being, satisfaction and employee development. Our Human Resource policy is supported by the following activities. Employee Development Dialogue (EDD) Employee Satisfaction Survey Workplace Assessment Every second year, odd years, employees have an Employee Development Dialogue with their manager. The purpose of this Dialogue is to follow and support the development of the individual employee. Moreover, every second year, even years, all employees are invited to take part in an Employee Satisfaction Survey. The results of this study is followed by a process, where all departments work attentively to improve identified focus areas, while also maintaining a continued effort within already successful areas. The purpose of this combination and synergy between the Employee Development Dialogue and the Employee Satisfaction Survey is to establish a foundation for continued development, ensuring for all departments to function effectively, leading to improved employee satisfaction and thereby a balanced and effective workplace. Last but not least, all sites undergo workplace assessment according to national legislation. 7 With reference to Danish legislation and The Danish Financial Statements Act, we have implemented a policy on Gender Equality. 8 Mid-level Managers are defined by title of either Manager or Supervisor. 9 The Policy on Gender Equality takes roots in Danish legislation and covers only employees employed in Denmark 12 Diversity, Development and Equal Opportunity – Progress With reference to the policy on Gender Equality, the following development is reported for the reporting period 01.01.2016 – 31.12.2016.

Employee Development Dialogue 14 Health and Safety – Practice At AH Industries we prioritize our employees as one of our most important resources, and we consider safety to be a core issue. We believe that attention towards employee health and safety improves the quality of life of individual employees and their families to the benefit of our local societies. Legal compliance is ensured through awareness, operational control and monitoring as well as internal audits as support of the external audits by a third party organisation. Our activities within Health and Safety is structured mainly by our OHSAS 18001 certified Health and Safety management system, and manifested through our Health and Safety policy. The policy describes how AH Industries work to prevent industrial injuries and work-related illnesses. AH Industries and our occupational health and safety organization work proactively to ensure that no work-related situations at AH Industries expose our employees to danger or endanger their health. The risk of personal injuries or work related illnesses must be minimized and possible causes identified and eliminated through preventive actions. We educate and motivate our employees to actively take part in the occupational health and safety work and responsibility. The Occupational Health and Safety policy is, for the reporting period 01.01.2016 – 31.12.2016, supported by the following objectives: 0 severe accidents A minimum of 342 registered near miss incidents, globally Beginning of January 2014, we launched and implemented a global Group level Key Performance Indicator (KPI) project, where two of the identified KPIs are related to and support our Health and Safety policy and objectives. The Health and Safety KPIs: Reduction of total number of accidents with 50% over a three year period, 2014-2016 Increase of near miss registrations 2014, 200 registrations. 2015, 308 registrations. 2016, 342 registrations The KPIs are based on data from 2013. Both of the KPIs are formulated as group objectives; however, they are also broken down at Business Unit level in order for all our Business Units to know what is expected by them individually in support of the Group objective. New employees take part in mandatory introduction, encompassing an introduction to Health, Safety and Environment (HSE). The HSE introduction covers our Occupational Health and Safety policy, our Environment policy and the related HSE organizational set-up, working to make sure that we, as a minimum, meet all legislative requirements and standards and ensure a safe workplace for our employees. 15 Health and Safety – Progress At group level, all Business Units work actively with registration of near misses as an important activity, from which we can learn much about safety and thereby prevent actual work accidents. More specifically, such a systematic follow-up structure for registration of near misses means that our employees identify potential risks and implement solutions before the risks lead to accidents.

Compliance and progress in respect of our OHSAS 18001 certified Occupational Health and Safety Management system is evaluated by an external audit company that performs audit every sixth months. Moreover, compliance and progress is monitored by top management at monthly Management Meetings as well as at quarterly Management Reviews. 17 Environment and Climate – Practice At AH Industries, we work systematically to prevent, minimize and remedy adverse environmental impacts of our activities. Our activities within this field is structured mainly by our ISO 14001 certified Environmental management system, and manifested through our Environment and Climate policy. The policy describes how AH Industries, as a manufacturer within heavy steel industries, strive to make continuous improvements to make our production facilities as environmentand climate-friendly as possible. We have implemented an active Environment and Climate policy and we work hard to prevent environmental hazards from our factories. We have established an Environmental committee with Managers appointed as representatives. The Committee performs environmental mapping, related to our production activities, to identify significant environmental impacts as well as most essential environmental focus areas. At our current state, it is found that local improvement projects at our Business Units are best suitable for our organisation. Thus, we continuously focus on implementing environmental improvement projects, including energy efficiency, chemical management, reduction of emissions, reduction of water consumption and waste management, at Business Unit level. Our Environmentand Climate policy is supported by the following objective. Implementation of a minimum of two improvement projects, annually Furthermore, we monitor and report CO2 emission, with the aim for our production and supporting activities to be as climate-friendly as possible. We will as a minimum comply with the local environmental legislation in the countries in which we operate and we require the same from our suppliers through our Code of Conduct. In the future we wish to expand our efforts and create close partnership with our customers on making environmental improvements in production and product development. Our goal is to contribute to making the end product as environmentally friendly as possible. Legal compliance is ensured through awareness, operational control and monitoring as well as internal audits as support of the external audits by a third party organisation. Lastly, product safety is encompassed by the Code of Conduct, requiring for products manufactured by AH Industries and suppliers to comply with all laws and regulations relating to product safety. 18 Environment and Climate – Progress With reference to the Group objective encompassed by our Environment and Climate policy, the following improvement projects are reported for the reporting period 01.01.2016 – 31.12.2016.

Objective Concerned Business Unit Shutdown of physical production facility to merge activities with Site Solutions other existing facilities Ventilation and heating system is optimized in production facility Manufacturing DK Horsens We aim to ensure value for the environment as well as for AH Industries. Our focus on e.g. energy efficiency leading to a lowering of CO2 emissions, will at the same time reduce costs for AH Industries. In sum, our environmental work aim to ensure for our activities to have the smallest possible negative impact on the climate and environment while at the same time generate cost savings for AH Industries. Compliance and progress in respect of our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management system is evaluated by an external audit company that performs audit every sixth months. Moreover, compliance and progress is monitored by top management at monthly Management Meetings as well as at quarterly Management Reviews. 20 Responsible Supplier Management – Practice AH Industries is a global organisation, with business partners located all over the world. A global organisational presence furthers the need for a set of guidelines as a shared framework for responsible business conduct and ethical behaviour. Responsible supplier management is a central part of our corporate responsibility. At AH Industries, we want to collaborate with our suppliers in an on-going effort to promote their social responsibility. To achieve this, we have established a Supplier Code of Conduct, which forms basis for dialogue and control with our suppliers with regard to responsibility. Our Supplier Code of Conduct communicates a requirement for our suppliers to comply with and support internationally proclaimed Human Rights and labour standards, endeavour to utilize environmental management systems, and lastly to support and comply with a zerotolerance policy on corruption. Our work with and foundation for responsible supplier management has been further strengthened by: CSR issues to be integrated within our supplier evaluation form, for supplier audits performed by AH Industries’ Compliance and/or SQE Officer Supplier Code of Conduct to be integrated with standard supplier contract documents, used for new supplier agreements Responsible Supplier Management – Progress The implementation of and compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct is supported by a screening of selected suppliers, encompassing a self-assessment questionnaire where suppliers report on compliance with Environmental requirements, support of Anti-corruption, Humans Rights and Labour Standards, including issues of health and safety, discrimination, salary, remuneration and leave, working hours, child labour, forced labour, freedom of association and collective bargaining. Below chart will illustrate progress within our work with responsible supplier management.
