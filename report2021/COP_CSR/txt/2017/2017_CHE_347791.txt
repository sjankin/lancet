Explanatory Note: Submission of 2016 Communication of Progress by COFCO International COFCO International was officially incorporated on April 24, 2017, as a result of the merger of COFCO Agri and NIDERA. On the day of incorporation, Mr. Johnny Chi, the CEO of COFCO International confirmed our commitment to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, thus COFCO International’s signatory status to UNGC. Prior to this merger, COFCO Agri and NIDERA were both UNGC signatories. COFCO International’s implementation of the UNGC ten principles is built on the solid foundation of these two previous companies. Therefore, we submit two separate COPs summarizing both companies’ efforts in 2016 to implement the UNGC principles as well as the outcomes, as attached. COFCO International greatly benefits from all the good work as introduced in these two documents, and strives to fulfill its commitment to UNGC principles throughout its global operations.
