The Group makes active efforts an energy strategy to replace the use of heavy fuel oil with in this area by adopting measures that can contribute to sound more climate and eco-friendly energy sources. In this period, environmental and resource management. Borregaard’s Borregaard has reduced its direct CO2 emissions by 50%. At aspirations and recommendations concerning climate and present, Borregaard meets its base load needs for energy for EHS are set out in a separate policy document (see list on heating purposes through recovery of heat from production, page 3). bioenergy and incineration of waste. In 2013, use of heavy fuel oil in peak load steam production stopped, as Borregaard Borregaard has established a risk assessment and management commissioned a new multi-fuel boiler which primarily uses system which is part of the Group’s management activities. liquefied natural gas (LNG). The peak load steam production This system is regularly reviewed (at least every year) by is now based on a combination of LNG, light fuel oil and management groups and the Board of Directors.

The CO2 emissions associated with production of management covers every aspect of Borregaard’s activities, energy for heating purposes will vary from year to year including self-assessments on environment, health and safety. depending on the energy sources used for steam generation. Climate and EHS factors are a management responsibility. Total direct CO2 emissions generated by all of the Group’s Borregaard also has its own dedicated support functions for plants were 132,289 mt in 2016 (129,319 mt). In spite of environment, health and safety and risk management. reduced energy consumption, CO2 emissions at Borregaard Sarpsborg increased by 5,343 mt compared with the previous CLIMATE CHANGE – GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS year, and totalled 121,639 mt (92% of the total emissions). Borregaard’s business model involves using renewable raw The increase was mainly due to a higher portion of LNG in the materials to produce climate-friendly products that can peak load steam production and an increase in lignin powder replace products from fossil raw materials. With regard to production compared with 2015. greenhouse gas emissions from a life cycle perspective, Borregaard’s products more than compensate for the emissions Borregaard reports CO2 emissions to CDP (formerly known as from production (see page 4). the Carbon Disclosure Project). This calculation of CO2 emissions is according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol A particular focus in 2016 was to continue an ongoing energy (GHGP). Scope 1 emissions are almost the same as the efficiency programme which resulted in further reduced energy direct emissions calculated, except that they include internal consumption at the site in Sarpsborg. Borregaard’s direct transportation. Scope 1 emissions for Borregaard in 2016 emissions of the greenhouse gas CO2 primarily come from were 134,176 mt (130,939 mt), while scope 2 emissions were fossil fuels used in production of energy for heating purposes. 60,785 mt (66,223 mt). Scope 2 emissions are mainly CO2 6 from the production of electricity and the steam bought from Environment Agency. This assessment will serve as input to the external waste incineration plant at the site in Sarpsborg. the process of revising the emission permit effective from 1 January 2019. Borregaard aims to reduce CO2 emissions by planned investments in the energy efficiency programme. The most important Borregaard Deutschland has a renewed operating permit for project is an instalment of a heat pump during the 1st quarter the spray-drying process effective from 2016 with stricter of 2017, which will increase the temperature of feed water to limits. To meet the requirements of the new permit, Borregaard the boiler house at the Sarpsborg site in Norway, and hence has implemented several actions including a rebuild of the save energy. spray driers, which has reduced dust emissions by 20%. Borregaard is investing NOK 63 million in a project which A. Energy production and consumption includes an upgrade of the bioethanol plant and a facility to The total amount of energy consumed by all Borregaard plants capture and store biogas, and thus increase the internal use of amounted to 1,617 GWh in 2016 (1,687 GWh): 1,093 GWh green energy from 2018. The project has been awarded a grant of energy for heating purposes (1,165 GWh) and 524 GWh of of NOK 18.9 million from Enova3. The upgrade includes installing electricity-specific consumption (522 GWh). modern production technology which will reduce the specific use of energy in the bioethanol production process. The majority of the energy was consumed at Borregaard’s site in Sarpsborg, where total consumption amounted to 1,538 Targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are GWh in 2016 (1,584 GWh): 1,038 GWh of energy for heating considered “science-based” if they are in line with the level purposes (1,088 GWh) (66% are from energy recovery from of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature sorted waste and renewable energy sources) and 499 GWh of increase below two degrees Celsius compared with preelectricity-specific consumption (495 GWh) (98% renewable industrial temperatures, as described in the Fifth Assessment electricity). Borregaard has an energy efficiency programme Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change aimed at reducing the annual energy consumption at the (IPCC AR5). Borregaard has evaluated its future emission Sarpsborg site by minimum 60 GWh within three years plans. The evaluation shows that it is possible to achieve a (starting from 2014). This programme delivered savings of science-based target by continuing to reduce energy 51 GWh in 2015 and an additional 10 GWh in 2016. The consumption and increase the use of renewable sources for programme includes making better use of the surplus energy energy. The plan was presented at the Capital Markets Day from heating and waste to be able to reduce the amount of in 2016. In 2017, Borregaard will apply for approval of the natural gas and electricity used. The programme receives Group’s target to the Science Based Targets Initiative4. financial support from Enova3, representing 42% of the total investment of NOK 107 million.

The most significant Total SO2 emissions for the Borregaard Group amounted to 87 environmental challenges are associated with the main mt in 2016 (126 mt). The Sarpsborg site had SO2 emissions of production site in Sarpsborg. 79 mt in 2016, a reduction of 39 mt or 33% compared with 2015. This was mainly due to the installation of a new SO2 After a fire in the wood seasoning silos for reduction of scrubber in the cellulose bleaching plant. extractives in wood chips in October 2015, the Sarpsborg site has experienced some operational problems due to more Borregaard is continually working on measures to reduce the extractives in process flows. This has led to the need for more frequency of extraordinary emissions of SO2. These include frequent washing of process equipment as well as compenadditional facilities for monitoring and controlling SO2 sating measures in some production steps. As a result, the emissions from its plants. In 2016, Borregaard installed six emissions of copper increased in 2016, and the reduction in additional SO2 detectors to more easily detect elevated emission of organic compounds to water (COD) was lower emissions. An ongoing programme aimed at replacing the than expected. However, the emissions will be normalised pipework system by the end of 2017, as well as installing when the new silos are in operation during the first half of more scrubber capacity, will also reduce emissions, putting 2017. the aim of zero exceedances within reach.
