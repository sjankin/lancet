Retail space represents just under half of our total rental value, which means development of the retail sector is important to us. Despite several challenges, the retail sector continued to develop robustly in 2016.

ENCOUNTERS AND INTERACTION Atrium Ljungberg’s manner of developing city districts includes investments in what is needed for interaction, networks and learning. It is for this reason that we link shopping streets, and reinforce nodes and ­social structures. We develop different types of meeting places. It might be a matter of meetings and encounters between and within the business community, associations, culture and education. The issue also pertains to integrating cafés and restaurants. ECOSYSTEMS AND BIO DIVERSITY We develop green spaces to promote bio diversity. By working with ­ecosystem services, we utilise land, walls and roofs in an efficient and sustainable manner. Trees, green roofs and smart surface water management help us ensure that our properties take the climate change into ­account, at the same time that we create attractive environments. CLOSE PROXIMITY AND COMFORT Our locations offer shopping and a number of other comforts. We also make the locations accessible in a manner that benefits health and the environment. It is to be easy to walk and bicycle, as well as to travel by public transport and electric car. We collaborate with municipalities on the design of bicycle paths and regional and local public transport. We resolve parking in a space-efficient manner in order to optimise land ­usage and maximise proximity. SECURITY AND WELL-BEING We focus on people and build in human scale with a carefully designed ground floor. Meticulous planning and a mixture of businesses ensure that the locations are populated during different times of the day and year, which increases the level of security and well-being. Squares, shopping streets and parks are to be perceived as open and inclusive, as well as promote meetings and encounters, relaxation and play.

ATRIUM LJUNGBERG ANNUAL REPORT 2016 25 FROM CHOCOLATE F ­ ACTORY TO OFFICES Topsy and Siljan were the names of the first chocolate bars produced at the chocolate factory in Sundbyberg at the end of the 1910s. The chocolate factory ceased operations 60 years later because the business had grown to the point that the factory had become too small. The old industrial character including the generous ceiling height and large windows was preserved for the building’s current office operations. Sundbyberg as a whole is growing by leaps and bounds. More residentials is being planned for the area, as is a deck over the train tracks that currently divide central Sundbyberg into two sections.

Our existing project portfolio will enable us to invest the equivalent of approximately SEK 11 billion in the future. The goal is to invest SEK 1 billion per year in our own development ­projects, where new build and extension projects yield a return of 20 per cent, thus generating good value growth within the company and growth in the company’s cash flows. The projects help us achieve our growth objective of a 10 per cent increase in the operating net per annum. IN TERMS OF AREA, HALF OF OUR PROJECT PORTFOLIO consists of residentials and half of offices, retail, education and hotels. The project portfolio is divided among all of our areas where Sickla and Uppsala account for approximately 70 per cent. THE RATE AT WHICH we can complete the projects depends on the market situation and the progress made in the detailed development plan process. These issues are handled by our business development staff on a daily basis in close collaboration with internal resources such as project managers and market area managers, but principally with our customers and partners. A project market area is not usually started until we have secured a minimum return in the form of signed lease contracts. WE ACQUIRE properties to create value growth or to obtain strategic benefits.

Manufakturaktiebolaget opened its textile factory in 1899 on the outskirts of Malmö. A successful era ended when manufacturing was discontinued at the factory in 1965, at about the same time that many other Swedish textile players discontinued their operations. Malmö’s first retail centre opened three years later on the same premises, and now an additional 50 years later, a new era is beginning for Mobilia. Mobilia currently offers retail, service, residentials and culture. From once having been part of Malmö’s outskirts, Mobilia is now a city district and a natural part of the city centre.
