However, on a like-for-like basis, our energy usage at “same locations” was lower year-over-year due to a $2.5 million investment in LED lighting retrofits, and these improvements were only offset by growth in our data center business and acquisitions in our art storage business. With this report we’re also announcing our next step on our CR journey. Early in 2017, we engaged with key stakeholders including customers, investors and the NGO community to identify and better understand the key Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues where we face the biggest opportunities and the biggest risks. /5 2 0 1 6 C O R P O R AT E R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y R E P O R T GRI GENERAL 2016 RE SU LTS STANDARD DISCLOSURES G4-23 The acquisition of Recall in 2016 presented a significant challenge for merging data systems and representing a consistent year-over-year comparison. Because Recall was such a large organization (about 25% of Iron Mountain’s size worldwide) and they had their own public reporting, we decided to combine the reported 2015 results of the two companies and create a new 2015 baseline. These figures and this report represent the results of the combined global operation in 2016 compared to the combined 2015 performance. 2016 GOAL 2016 RESULTS Notes Not Achieved: While our direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) were reduced by 1 Reduce GHG emissions by 1% about 2%, we added a large amount of scope 3 emissions by Climate Impacts Global GHG emissions increased postfrom 2015. including the impacts of third-party transportation providers in Recall integration by 0.7%. former Recall territories, mostly in Latin America.

DE TROIT ’ S CON SI STENT HELPING HANDS In 2016 the North Central region of the United States tracked more volunteer hours on average per employee than any other area. In particular, the employees in Detroit consistently volunteered more than any other team. They supported veteran groups, walked on behalf of the Arthritis Foundation and breast cancer research, collected for Toys for Tots, assisted a women’s domestic violence shelter and rolled up their sleeves at a food bank. For example, two times a month, 10 employees each day would visit the local Detroit Gleaners Community Food Bank. There they would sort and package fresh produce on a conveyor line into boxes and packaging. At each visit, the Detroit employees would assemble 350-500 boxes of food that would be sent from the warehouse to other food banks, schools, churches and pantries for distribution. In total, they volunteered 720 hours and packaged more than 10,000 boxes of fresh food for local residents. / 27 GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE INDEX STANDARD DISCLOSURES 2 0 1 6 C O R P O R AT E R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y R E P O R T GRI GENERAL GRI CONTENT INDE X STANDARD DISCLOSURES G4-3, G4-4, G4-5, G4-6, G4-7, G4-8, G4-9, G4-10, G4-11, G4-12 GLOBAL REPORTING G4-6 G4-9 Countries with business operations Scale of the reporting organization 1.
