Data restated from 2015 www.sc.com/sustainability 13 SUSTAINABILITY DATA Additional notes on environment data The emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. This is to allow sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financial reporting. This is consistent with international carbon reporting practice. ‘Measured’ data is collected from Global Environment Management System (GEMS) properties, defined as all properties that are over 10,000 square feet for energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee. ‘Scaled-up’ data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the Group’s occupied property footprint for energy and water. For paper and business travel, it is defined per full-time employee (as at the end of the reporting period). Carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account. Total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period. Net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas. Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes, residential properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation. Scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 20 countries, based on seating class and distance flown. As we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or international with flight distance of less than 463km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) as ‘domestic flights’, have been classified as ‘short haul’. All flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1,108km, labelled by DBEIS as ‘short haul’ have been classified as ‘medium haul’. The Carbon Trust is our independent third-party assurance provider for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. In 2016, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were assured by The Carbon Trust, ensuring the accuracy and credibility of our reporting.
