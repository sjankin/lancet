Meikosha’s success came from the company’s “enterprising spirit” to attempt to become the ﬁrst domestic manufacturer of telephones only ﬁve years after Alexander Graham Bell’s invention of the telephone in 1876. Underpinned by this “enterprising spirit,” which has been nurtured and passed down throughout the Company’s long history, OKI has developed and provided a succession of products that have contributed to the development of today’s information society. Always in the vanguard of technology innovation, OKI began selling computers containing Japan’s ﬁrst domestically developed core memories, developed the world’s ﬁrst cash recycling automated teller machine (ATM) that recycles deposited bills as funds for withdrawals, developed LED printers, and introduced the ﬁrst Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) system to the Japanese market. As a company that supports social infrastructural development, OKI will quickly grasp and incorporate the needs of the market into the development of products that satisfy customers, while contributing to the development of an information society. Guided by its brand statement, “Open up your dreams,” OKI will diligently strive to achieve the dreams and hopes of stakeholders, to become the preferred global partner of choice and achieve continuous growth.

Annual Report 2017 16 STRATEGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Promoting Co-Creation and Open Innovation Aimed at Creating New Businesses Supporting digital transformation for customers, the OKI Group promotes the development of new integrated technologies in its stronghold of contact regions between physical reality and digital spaces from the viewpoint of “connected society,” “connected lifestyles,” and “connected manufacturing” to advance further down the path of digital transformation. From a “connected society” standpoint, we aim to establish “smart sensing” technologies that integrate our strengths in sensing technologies and networks in conjunction with our know-how in data analysis. From a “connected lifestyles” standpoint, we aim to develop “humane mechatronics” technologies that integrate our strengths in mechatronics, human-machine interface (HMI) and dialogueoriented artificial intelligence (AI) systems. From a “connected manufacturing” standpoint, we aim to establish “various kinds, various volume production” technologies that integrate our production technologies and augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications with our strength in data use. 1. “Smart Sensing” Technologies for a “Connected Society” OKI has strengths in three necessary elements for the Internet 2. “Humane Mechatronics” Technologies for “Connected Lifestyles” OKI is working to develop new humane mechatronics technologies of Things (IoT): sensing technologies, networks, and data analythat integrate HMI and dialogue-oriented AI technologies with OKIsis.

I feel the outside directors help energize Board discussions. We each draw on a different knowledge base to offer objective opinions from the perspectives we each bring to the table. The explanatory materials outside directors receive on agenda items before Board meetings have been improved and deepened, so we can now prepare for Board discussions after carefully thinking through what we receive beforehand. Some of these topics are no longer fresh for directors in charge of business execution because they have debated them many times in the past but such topics seem fresh and novel to outside directors who I feel want to spend a little more time on them. I want to continue to carefully check from an objective standpoint whether management decision-making is carried out in appropriate ways that complies with relevant laws, including the steps in the process of determining whether to elevate agenda items to the Board for discussion. 2 Management Committee and other committees.

Mr. Ishiyama, a legal expert, focusing on the Companies Act, is another academic serving as an outside director, like me, so I would like to work together with him to ﬁnd ways we can both make the most of our respective expertise. Where I think I can contribute more is on “proactive governance,” especially in offering advice on decision-making processes to realize Mid-term Business Plan 2019. When I accepted this post, I looked closely at the makeup of OKI’s current businesses and was impressed with how much effort it puts into manufacturing such as the EMS business, which is based on its strong technological capabilities.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (a) Summary of financial instruments The Group mainly uses short-term deposits and highly safe marketable securities for fund management, and raises its funds primarily through borrowings from ﬁnancial institutions and issuance of corporate bonds. The Group strives to mitigate credit risks associated with notes and accounts receivable from customers, which are operating receivables, by carrying out customer credit investigations in accordance with regulations for the management of accounts receivable of individual companies. For borrowings, the Group raises short-term funds mainly for working capital and long-term funds for working capital and capital investment. For borrowings exposed to the interest rate risk, the Group applies derivative instruments (interest rate swap transactions) to hedge its risk. The Group executes and manages derivative transactions in accordance with Oki Group’s policy.

Notes: 1. Fair value measurements of ﬁnancial instruments and investment in securities and derivative transaction Assets (1) Cash on hand and in banks, and (2) Notes and accounts receivable These fair values are presented at amount recorded in balance sheets, since they are settled in a short period of time and their fair value reasonably approximates the amount recorded in the balance sheets. (3) Investments in securities The fair value of securities is based on the market price on the stock exchange. The fair value of bond is based on the quotes presented by the ﬁnancial institutions. (4) Long-term trade receivables Fair value of the Long-term trade receivables is based on the amount after deducting the present estimated doubtful receivables from the balance sheet values, as estimated doubtful receivables are calculated based on the present value of loans/receivables. Liabilities (1) Notes and accounts payable, (2) Short-term borrowings, and (3) Other accrued expenses These fair values are presented at amount recorded in balance sheets, since they are settled in a short period of time and their fair value reasonably approximates the amount recorded in the balance sheets. (4) Long-term debt The fair value is based primarily on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest amounts is discounted by an assumed interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed long-term loans. Some long-term borrowings with ﬂoating interest rates and related interest rate swaps are accounted for using special accounting treatment applicable to interest rate swaps. Hence, the fair value of a long-term borrowing is based on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest, treated in combination with the said interest rate swap, is discounted by a reasonably estimable interest rate to be applied for newly borrowed long-term loans under similar borrowing terms. Derivative transactions Described in Note 16. 2. Financial instruments whose fair value is considered extremely difﬁcult to assess Unlisted equity securities (¥7,274 million ($64,946 thousand) and ¥9,612 million) at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are not included in (3) Investments in securities because they have no market price and it is deemed extremely difﬁcult to assess their fair values. 8. RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company and domestic consolidated subsidiaries have either funded or unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt plans and deﬁned contribution plans. The noncontributory deﬁned beneﬁt plan that is a funded plan adopts a cash balance plan. In this plan, amount of beneﬁt in which the “Point” based on the pay level is multiplied by rate based on the Japanese Government Bonds is provided to employee as pension or lump-sum payment. The lump-sum retirement beneﬁt is provided employee in accordance with the “Point” based on the business results, and the length of service. The lump-sum retirement payment plans are unfunded plans excluding the Company. The Company’s plan is a funded plan due to contribution to the pension and retirement beneﬁt trust. Several overseas consolidated subsidiaries have deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned contribution pension plans. The Company has pension and retirement beneﬁt trust. Certain consolidated subsidiaries appraise projected beneﬁt obligation and retirement beneﬁt expenses of lump-sum retirement payment plans by the simpliﬁed method.
