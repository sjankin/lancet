Conrico International Communication on progress Period covered :January 25th 2017 to January 24th 2018 António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm that Conrico International supports the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engage in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goal of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Conrico international will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global compact is the annual submission of a communication in progress (COP) that describes our company‘s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the Global compact policy. Gareth Beacham General Manager
