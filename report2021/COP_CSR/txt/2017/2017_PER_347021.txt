The Bank plays an important role in the economic fabric of each of our markets, and we constantly strive to facilitate economic growth and opportunity. Let me give you three examples: • Scotiabank is supporting key efforts to improve financial literacy across our footprint. One example is our partnership with Connected North, which uses high-definition, two-way video communication and collaboration technology to provide Aboriginal youth in Northern Canada with education on credit loans and interest, as well as budgeting. • In 2016 we were recognized as the top bank for small business by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, and had close to 600 small businesses as suppliers in Canada alone. Across our footprint, we are providing access to capital for small businesses through micro-finance loans and new technologies that more quickly and easily meet the liquidity needs of entrepreneurs — this type of liquidity is a key ingredient to job creation, economic growth and prosperity. • Finally, Scotiabank has embarked upon an ambitious digital transformation which will remove pain points for our customers and position us for a bright digital future. This fundamental shift in the way we do business requires new types of skills — from data scientists and computer engineers to cyber security experts.

Porter Scotiabank Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 4 CSR at Upholding Strong Serving Our Advancing Fostering Strong Reducing Our Impact Introduction Scotiabank Governance Customers Our Employees Communities on the Environment Chairman Letter Dear Stakeholders, The Bank’s core purpose, that we believe every customer has the right to become better off, is integrated into the fabric of our operations and our culture. Scotiabank is committed to the interests of our stakeholders, and to ensure we maintain your trust, we strive to enhance customer protection, lend fairly, balance stakeholder interests, and operate our Bank with integrity. One of the many strengths of Scotiabank is our ability to strike a balance between creating value for the Bank and for society. The challenges, opportunities and interests facing our Bank are diverse and complex. Acting with integrity to maintain and uphold a strong reputation requires solid, strategic governance practices and will help to ensure we are building (what the Bank refers to as) the economy of everyone. The Annual Report and the annual CSR report include many examples of our governance practices. We have made great progress in 2016 and will continue to evolve to build an even better bank. Since 2013, CSR oversight has resided with the Board’s Corporate Governance Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the CSR strategy and reporting, including reports on the Bank’s environmental and social performance and benchmarking of our social responsibility performance and practices. As a leading financial services provider, and Canada’s most international bank, we take our role to help customers become better off seriously. As we strive to build the economy of everyone, we will continue to make a positive difference around the world and at the same time, drive value for the Bank. We look forward to continuing to share our progress.
