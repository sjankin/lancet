Premier Oil plc // 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report 22 SECTION 1: OUR APPROACH continued Enforcement Any breach of the Code by our employees will result in disciplinary action and, in extreme cases, instant dismissal and referral to the relevant law enforcement authorities. In 2016, there were no disciplinary sanctions or dismissals for breaches of the Code. However, during the year, a formal investigation was opened by the Company into allegations of individual corruption against one of our employees. The employee resigned before disciplinary procedures were completed. The incident in question was small in scale and isolated, and did not highlight any material weaknesses in our control systems. Any breach of the Code by our business partners will result in either: • An agreed corrective action plan and measures to avoid a recurrence, or • Potential termination where this is legally permissible In 2016, we did not terminate or fail to renew any external business relationships due to breaches of the Code.

Premier Oil plc // 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report 38 Section 3: Environment Premier is commied to operating in a manner that reduces our environmental impacts to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. We will never knowingly compromise our environmental standards to meet our operational objectives. 39 Materiality 40 Climate change and greenhouse gas emissions 42 Efﬂuents and waste Premier Oil plc // 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report 39 OVERVIEW OUR APPROACH Materiality HS&S All Premier’s operated activities occur offshore, where we drill for and extract both oil and gas from sub-surface reservoirs for transport to international markets. These activities can have ENVIRONMENT negative impacts on water quality, air quality and local ecosystems. Any failure to take reasonable steps to avoid and/or mitigate these impacts poses a material risk to Premier’s reputation and to our ability to meet our legal and regulatory obligations. Our most signiﬁcant environmental issues EMPLOYEES relate to: • Efﬂuents and waste, including the prevention of spills and the responsible management of hazardous materials COMMUNITY RELATIONS • Greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption and ﬂaring at our facilities Managing our environmental performance The controls in our HSES Management System (p29–31) manage our environmental performance across the lifecycles of our operations and projects. The majority of our operated production and drilling activities are certiﬁed to the ISO 14001 environmental management standard. The recent exceptions SOCIETY are our new Solan asset, which began producing in 2016, as well as the producing assets Premier acquired from E.ON in April 20161. We plan SDGs related to material issues to include these assets within the scope of covered in this section our ISO 14001 certiﬁcation in 2017. APPENDIX In 2016, we spent US$8.4 million on identiﬁable environmental protection measures. This includes: • US$2.35 million on waste disposal, emissions treatment and remediation • US$6.08 million on prevention and environmental management costs 1 For the ﬁrst time, the environmental data reported in this section includes our Huntington, Babbage and Solan operated production assets (unless otherwise stated).

The chosen base year is 2011 (when Gajah Baru (Indonesia) and Chim Sáo (Vietnam) came on-stream). Prior to this, our operated production portfolio was materially different, making comparison prior to 2011 much less relevant. Calculations of Scope 1 emissions (i.e. direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) are based on equations and emission factors provided in the 2009 API GHG Compendium. Global warming potential rates are taken from the IPCC (2013) Assessment Report as well as IOGP guidance. Premier does not produce any biogenic emissions. 8 Our planned activities do not typically produce signiﬁcant amounts of hydroﬂuorocarbons, perﬂuorocarbons or sulphur hexaﬂuoride. However, in 2016, 2,368 tonnes of these gases were emitted into the atmosphere as a result of three unplanned releases at our Solan production asset and one at our Balmoral production asset. 9 i.e. combustion emissions; ﬂaring and venting; signiﬁcant stationary sources; and signiﬁcant mobile sources. 10 Revised ﬁgure following diesel under-reporting at our Balmoral asset in 2015 (p40). 11 Including Scope 1 emissions for production only. As explained above, the chosen base year is 2011. Our Solan asset, which achieved ﬁrst oil in April 2016, is not included in our 2016 intensity target as it was not in steady state production at the beginning of the year. As such, greenhouse gas emissions from the asset are also not included in our reported emissions intensity ﬁgure for 2016. Emissions from Solan are, however, included in our total emissions reporting. 12 Revised ﬁgure following diesel under-reporting at our Balmoral asset in 2015 (p40). 13 In 2017 we will be changing the basis for our greenhouse gas intensity measurements by removing mobile sources (e.g. helicopters and support vessels) from our calculations to align our reporting with IOGP requirements. 14 In the UK, for Balmoral and Solan, venting quantity is not calculated because it is already included in the ﬂaring calculation as an estimated ﬁgure. Including this data would result in double-accounting. Huntington and Babbage both have vent consents that form the basis of the estimate for venting emissions.

It also helped our human resources team to listen to the concerns and feedback of affected employees and adjust policy where necessary. Local employment We give priority to the employment of suitably qualiﬁed nationals whenever possible. To support this aim, we invest in the development of nationals’ skills, knowledge and experience. This helps ensure they can access opportunities throughout our organisation, whilst also supporting our business. Examples of the senior roles occupied by nationals include the Vice President of Operations and Development at our Indonesia business unit and the Finance Manager at our Brazil ofﬁce. In some instances we employ expatriate managers (i.e. those employed on foreign contracts) at a senior level due to: • The need for highly qualiﬁed expatriate managers with appropriate oil industry Workforce reduction The majority of redundancies came experience for speciﬁc roles to ﬁll local Like many other operators in the oil as a result of our acquisition of the skill shortfalls and gas sector, market conditions E.ON portfolio in the second quarter required us to carry out a number of 2016.

Premier Oil plc // 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report 66 SECTION 6: SOCIETY continued Supply chain management Our business units typically undertake their own contracting and procurement, with the corporate ofﬁce providing strategic and commitment endorsement and oversight where necessary. We subject all new contractors to an initial risk-based HSES assessment via either pre-qualiﬁcation, bidding and/or negotiation, and during contract commencement. Following these onboarding assessments, any contractors that we deem to be of high risk are subjected to a more detailed HSES screening. Furthermore, all our major contracts include relevant HSES requirements. Where possible, we monitor the HSES performance of suppliers and service contractors. In 2016, this included the integration of HSES performance indicators into contracts with major service providers at our Catcher project and Balmoral asset in the UK North Sea. We are examining the possible implementation of a broader contract management framework at our UK and Indonesia business units.

In connection with Premier’s April APPENDIX 2016 purchase of the E.ON assets, we conducted a wide-ranging due diligence process, which encompassed HSE and human rights performance.

Furthermore, a provision was included in the purchase agreement requiring E.ON to guarantee that they had not received any notices for material HSE non-compliances in relation to these assets for at least two years. 1 We categorise our supply chain into the following tiers: Tier One (high-value contractors who utilise sub-contractors), Tier Two (direct contractors) and Tier Three (smaller suppliers).
