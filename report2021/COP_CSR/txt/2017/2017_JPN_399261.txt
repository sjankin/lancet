NGK Report 2017 8 Our strengths lie in the growth of our business with the skills we have developed since our founding and the people that support that growth. Since our founding, we have leveraged our diverse set of skills to develop and oﬀer products that support the infrastructure of society and assist in the solving of environmental problems. It’s our people that are the bedrock of our strength, and their mentality to relentlessly pursue quality, to continue to push the envelope, and to give back to society has continued unabated from our founding up to today. Materials Process techniques techniques Pushing the envelope globally Our core and in new ﬁelds techniques Evaluative/ NGK goes right back to 1876, when Ichitaro Morimura Production analytical (Ichizaemon VI) and his younger brother, Toyo, founded Morimura echniques techniques Gumi (currently Morimura Bros., Inc.). In an age when Japan was beginning to modernize, the Morimura brothers were pioneers in globalizing Japan and blazing a trail for Japan-US trade. NGK, having started as an insulator manufacturer, began to develop Our people acid-resistant machinery for use in the chemical industry soon after our founding; we then actively engaged in diversifying and globalizing our business by making our ﬁrst export of power transmission insulators to India in 1935 and establishing our ﬁrst overseas production facility in 1973. Even now, we continue to constantly push the envelope in new ﬁelds and strive for sustained growth. A map showing our 30-year history with overseas trading partners.The orders we receive from overseas continue, and we are increasing our factories. Contributing to society During the Meiji Period when electricity ﬁrst began spreading throughout Japan, insulators that could withstand high voltage had to be imported. The ﬁrst president Kazuchika Okura stated,“It is our duty to our country to produce insulators in Japan.”Research and development into special high-voltage insulators and the ﬁrst Japanese insulators began from this keen sense of duty and clues from shards of US-made insulators. Our founding spirit̶the urge to contribute to the development of industry and the lives of the people by meeting the growing demand Kazuchika Okura, our ﬁrst president Okura was the ﬁrst-born son of for electricity with a stable supply of high-quality insulators insulators̶ Magobei Okura, the brother-in-law of Ichizaemon Morimura, founder continues today still in NGK’s corporate philosophy. of the Morimura Group. At the age of 28, Okura was appointed as the ﬁrst president of Nippon Toki Shards of US-made insulators that would serve as the (currently the Noritake CO., LTD.). starting point of the founding of NGK. Development He would later serve as president began under the belief that with the ﬁne techniques of of Toyo Toki (currently TOTO) and Japanese craftsmen, they were certain to be able to NGK Insulators, as well as manufacture special high-voltage insulators. chairman of INAX (currently LIXIL). NGK Report 2017 9 Ceramics, which are largely determined by natural phenomena like soil, water, and ﬁre, were originally extremely diﬃcult to make with any uniformity. However, with insulators, which have served as the supporting framework for society’s lifeline for decades, even a single defective product could have an enormous impact on all of society. For NGK, which broke away from the ceramic ware-making industry and began down the path of industrial manufacturing with insulators, product uniformity was the sought after quality. By reﬁning our core techniques with materials and processes to achieve this, we have continued to provide high quality and reliable The written pledges (the Founding Pledge) of our ﬁrst president, Kazuchika Okura, and his ﬁve other products.

In what areas have this background, emission regulations are becoming more you been achieving notable growth recently? stringent around the world, pushing up the demand for exhaust gas puriﬁcation parts and NOx sensors. Oshima: Our business is particularly growing in two key areas. One is associated with automotive exhaust system. Takaoka: That indicates the grave responsibility your We produce exhaust gas puriﬁcation parts which are our company bears as a supplier. In order to achieve main products with a global market share of around 50% and mass-production on a large scale, what is your situation of NGK Report 2017 20 Oshima: That is our unique value originated with an insulator manufacturer. Insulators are a very long-lived product. To ensure the eﬀective use of our products over decades, we have been persistently striving to achieve ever-higher quality, and developed unrivalled technologies. Also, we began in our early days to pursue business diversiﬁcation. We have invested our earnings in R&D, seeking to build future growth pillars. We have continued this approach to expand the company. Capture future needs and develop technologies Takaoka: To plan successful R&D projects, it is vitally important to carefully read the future to correctly forecast social needs. NGK’s successful diversiﬁcation has proven its insight into future needs. Oshima: The success we have had in the NOx sensors, one of Seeking to meet our recently established mainstays, is the result of research eﬀorts continued over two decades. Many years of assiduous this future demand, works enabled us to supply them timely when the society needs. we are promoting Takaoka: Within your marketed lineup, I view NAS batteries R&D further. as having huge growth potential, given the fact that currently very few enterprises commercialize large storage battery systems.

I wish to create a workplace where each Having such multiple specialty technologies and products that employee is inspired to take up a challenge at their own enable you to maintain advantages against others gives you a initiative. I’m wondering all the time what I should do to great strength. encourage their initiative or to boost their motivation. Toward NGK Report 2017 21 this goal, I took the ﬁrst step by touring the Group companies and manufacturing sites in Japan and overseas and every division within the company to take a ﬁrsthand look at each site in operation. Takaoka: What did you ﬁnd from this ﬁeld research? Oshima: Every factory I visited was running at its fullest-ever capacity to continue increasing production, keeping workers extremely busy. I saw this situation as needing immediate improvement so that they can eﬀectively demonstrate their potential to perform truly important tasks. To this end, it is necessary to review each work process and practice to thoroughly eliminate waste. To carry out this task across the company, I have launched the E3 (E-Cubed) activity*. Since work style reforms require a top-down management approach in part, it has been introduced at each division under the leadership of the division head, who has established organizational policies and announced them to division members. Takaoka: The top commitment can facilitate improvement of frontline operations. Then, the more operational eﬃciency will increase, the more employee motivation will rise. This is becoming increasingly important as businesses in many industries need to take steps to increase employee NGK’ s successful satisfaction to address the emerging challenge of a labor shortage. diversiﬁcation has proven Oshima: To be able to attract and retain quality talent that its insight into will continue to contribute to the company over the long term, we have reformed a range of personnel systems, future needs. eﬀective from this year. Major reforms include the revision of systems for general employees to encourage mid-career or younger personnel to undertake challenging tasks, and lifting the mandatory retirement age up to 65 to oﬀer senior Oshima: Our Group currently employs a total of more than personnel opportunities to work for longer and with a sense 20,000 people, and more than half of them are working of security. The revised systems also include measures outside Japan. It is very important that we uphold a shared directed at women’s career enhancement. vision to unite as one for advancing our business. In two years, NGK will celebrate the centennial of its founding and Takaoka: The gender equality issue is particularly speciﬁc to prior to this major milestone, we have begun to consider the manufacturing sector, where rates of female workers and revising the corporate philosophy. managers are relatively low. Takaoka: I am interested in the new philosophy to be Oshima: Contrary to the industry trend, at NGK, the average announced in the near future while also looking forward to duration of service of female employees is longer than that of the rollout of new products that can bring about an males. This is partly attributable to our systems that have innovative change in our future society and environment. been enhanced to support work-life balance. However, we are behind in terms of employing female managers. To Oshima: NGK’s products are indispensable parts of many overcome this shortcoming, we have begun to implement products related to electricity, vehicles, communications and initiatives to spur the development of future female other forms of social infrastructure that supports modern managers. lifestyles.

Quality Activity System The NGK quality activity system consists of a company-wide system, led by the Quality Committee chairman, and business division internal activity system, led by the heads of each business division. In terms of company-wide activities, the Quality Committee was established to function as a deliberative body assisting the Quality Committee chairman, while business division internal activities systems were put in place for each business line, creating appropriate quality systems for each. Quality assurance, quality control, quality improvements and quality education activities are promoted by the acquisition of ISO9001 or TS16949 certification. In the event of a major customer complaint, the CSR Committee Chairman and the Quality Committee Chairman will discuss and cooperate to take responses. Technical issues are discussed at Quality Review meetings, as necessary, to plan countermeasures, and the Quality Committee Chair supervises execution of the measures at the responsible division. In case of a customer complaint requiring disclosure, the CSR Committee Chairman will direct necessary arrangements to take an appropriate response without delay.

NGK Report 2017 51 Activities to Enhance DR Functions The increasing and diversifying quality demands from customers call for the integration of knowledge among various members, not only from the Design division but also from the Manufacturing and Production Engineering divisions, throughout the development process. For this reason, the Group considers the Design Review (DR) to be the most critical activity. DRs are conducted when development milestones are reached or when production processes change. Critical DRs are conducted by reviewers from throughout the company to support the elimination of risks. The DR Guidelines were created to promote DR discussions and to eliminate quality risks thoroughly. We are constantly enhancing the effectiveness of DRs through efforts to spread this guidelines, including education and reviews of each DR. In addition, we have prepared and are utilizing the DR evaluation indicators to encourage improvements by visualize the progress of each division's level. Furthermore, NGK organize a company-wide DR (Quality review meeting) for the quality trouble which is difficult to solve by one division, and discuss broad aspects of issues related to the reliability and safety of products by relevant engineers and experts across the company. In fiscal 2016, the third year since the introduction of DR evaluation indicators, a special meeting was held for heads of NGK's eight DR-hosting business divisions to exchange opinions on DR activities. Participants discussed the divisional situation regarding utilization of the indicators and related issues, and agreed on the view that measures should be taken to raise awareness of the role of DR in identifying risks. Going forward, we will place greater focus on developing solutions to identified risks, with the intention of strengthening DR functions.

Monthly reports from each base regarding customer complaints and the status of manufacturing quality are discussed at quality activity meetings, enabling the entire NGK Group to evaluate the quality status in a timely manner. Moreover, quality activity rules and annual quality objectives are developed in an attempt to develop and enhance quality activities. The NGK Group's Quality Activities Meeting Held at Overseas Plants In fiscal 2016, the meeting was held at five plants overseas.

We enacted the internal anti-bribery rules for dealing with foreign public officials in fiscal 2015 by stipulating the observance of anti-bribery laws and regulations as well as ethical standards to be observed for business transaction, which became effective in fiscal 2016. Moreover, 19 Group companies in the U.S., Asia and Australia as well established the internal anti-bribery rules in fiscal 2016, and we are planning to push forward for establishing the rules in other regions further. Conducting Anti-Bribery Training In fiscal 2016, we continued to offer anti-bribery seminars featuring lectures by lawyers. In Asia, we expanded the scope to include India, Thailand and Indonesia in addition to China and South Korea, offering seminars at all Group companies in Asia. In the U.S., continuing on from fiscal 2015, we offered the seminars at all Group companies. In Europe, we conducted the seminars in Poland in addition to those conducted in Germany in the previous fiscal year.

NGK Report 2017 63 Strict Adherence to Laws and Regulations Relating to Export Management の順守 As part of its thorough compliance efforts, NGK is engaged in the strict adherence to laws and regulations relating to export management. Behavioral Guidelines within the NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior establish the observance of security export control-related regulations, while management and training is conducted based on internal rules and the Export/Import Handbook. Using Databases to Conduct Comprehensive Inspections and Customs Management In response to the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act and other export control-related laws and regulations, NGK screens exports scrutinizes whether export licenses are required, and records screening results in a security export control database. Furthermore, export management with respect to the export of certain products is conducted using Authorized Exporter's Program. NGK commenced use of an export cargo management ledger in May 2015 in addition to the import cargo management ledger. Each department conducts voluntary inspections based on the export-import cargo management ledgers by verifying the consistency and status of retention of import-related documents. In fiscal 2016, 58 departments carried out voluntary inspections on inports. Voluntary inspections of anthorized exports take place at the beginning of each year. In addition, we use NACCS data (Automated Cargo And Port Comsolidated System) to verify the completeness of export-import cargo management ledgers. We have achieved nearly 100% completeness for imports and 90 to 95% for exports. We will strive to enhance the completeness by continuing to provide education and awareness-raising activities in each department. We also conduct surveys of domestic Group companies to verify the status of customs clearance management. Familiarization with the Export/Import Handbook NGK also made efforts toward thorough compliance with the Export/Import Handbook, which was published in fiscal 2012 and summarizes items for the observance of export/import customs clearance regulations. In addition to publishing this handbook on the company intranet where it can be viewed throughout the entire company, we provide training to spread awareness of the spirit of handbook through study meetings related to export/import management conducted internally in each business division. Export/import management study meetings are held one or more times per year targeting relevant staff in divisions responsible for export and import activities. In fiscal 2016, these meetings were held 9 times, with about 199 employees in attendance.

In fiscal 2016, seven overseas Group companies received such inspections. Formulation of Basic NGK Group IT Security Standards The rapid advance in information communication technologies and devices has made the quest for consistent IT security on a Group-wide level an urgent concern, thus in 2010 we formulated the NGK Group IT Security Standards with the goal of developing an IT security structure based on commonly shared Group standards and enhancing IT security. Every year, each Group company drafts action plans for the enactment of countermeasures in an attempt to systematically strengthen security. Through these countermeasure action plans, NGK confirms initiatives at each Group company and provides guidance as necessary.

NGK Report 2017 65 Risk Management In line with business expansion, the NGK group is also engaged in minimizing risks related to globalization and diversification while augmenting our risk management structure. The CSR Committee periodically confirms and follows up on the status of Company-wide risk countermeasures to ensure every effort is being made to manage business risks. Basic Approach The NGK Group Guidelines for Corporate Behavior were announced within and outside the Reference URL company as our basic stance toward the realization of the NGK Group corporate philosophy of creating new value by providing products and technologies that contribute to a better social Corporate Philosophy and Guidelines for Corporate environment. This includes initiatives that strictly observe the protection of third party rights Behavior and corporate assets and trust through the practice of risk management. http://www.ngk.co.jp/info/ governance/index.html Risk Analysis and Response The NGK Group assumes six categories of company-wide risks pertaining to compliance, information, employment and labor, making an effort to avoid and prevent these risks through deliberation of budgets and plans and overall examination and analysis in the course of execution and settlement processes at Strategy Committee and Executive Committee meetings. Business continuity planning (BCP) was formulated to ensure the continuation of critical business functions in the event of large-scale natural disasters including wind and flood damage and earthquake, massive transportation accidents or other emergency situations, which will be addressed by the Central Disaster Prevention and Control Headquarters and BCP Countermeasures Headquarters. Company-wide Shared Risks Category Risk Category Risk Legal / Regulatory infractions / Labor troubles improper accounting Labor accidents Misappropriation by individuals Traffic accidents Bribery 3.Employment/Labor Long-working hours/health management 1.Compliance Violation of intellectual property rights Support for unskilled labor Human rights violations/harassment Labor issues at suppliers and subcontractors Trouble with local communities Incidents and accidents 4.Incidents / Accidents Support for antisocial forces / Disasters Natural disasters Information systems breakdown Environmental management trouble 2.Information Leak of proprietary or personal information 5.Environment EMS insufficiency Inappropriate use of SNS 6.Product safety Defective products NGK Report 2017 66 Business Risks Production Bases The NGK Group’s main production bases are located in Aichi Prefecture and Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan, and overseas in the Americas, Europe, Asia, and other regions. The Group operates a global production system for its core products,such as ceramic honeycomb substrates for automotive catalytic converters, from the perspective of manufacturing close to demand centers and achieving optimal production. This ensures that risk is dispersed among manufacturing sites. However, irrespective of whether a production base is in Japan or overseas, if facilities at a major production base are seriously damaged by a natural disaster such as an earthquake or fire, production may stop for a considerable period of time, thereby adversely affecting the NGK Group’s business performance and financial condition. Overseas operations, in particular, carry such potential risks as i) compliance with the host country’s laws, regulations or taxes, ii) adverse changes in the economic environment such as fluctuations in exchange rates, iii) difficulty in securing, educating and training personnel, iv) inadequate infrastructure, and v) societal problems such as terrorism and war. The unforeseen occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact the NGK Group’s business performance andfinancial condition. Exchange Rates, Interest Rates, and Material Prices The NGK Group produces and sells products worldwide. Consequently, the Group hedges the risk of short-term changes in the exchange rates of major currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, euro and yen, with forward foreign exchange contracts and other financial instruments. However, appreciation of the yen could cause a decline in net sales and earnings, which could adversly impact the NGK Group’s business performance. The NGK Group plans to continue making the necessary capital investments to expand its businesses and improve productivity. The Group’s funding needs include these capital expenditures and the redemption of corporate bonds. In the event of interest rate rises, future fund procurement costs may increase, which could adversely impact the NGK Group’s business performance and financial condition. Rises in raw materials prices have led to higher manufacturing costs at NGK Group businesses. To minimize this factor, the Group raises sales prices, cuts costs, improves productivity, and reduces business expenses. The NGK Group endeavors to absorb rises in purchasing prices, but excessive rises in the prices for raw materials may adversely impact the Group’s business performance and financial condition. New Products The NGK Group works to create new products to secure its growth prospects. The Group makes focused investments in new products that should become pillars of growth in the future. At the same time, NGK is making capital expenditures in stages for products for which demand is expected to expand. However, in the event that these capital expenditures are not made on schedule, this may adversely impact the NGK Group’s medium-term growth prospects. Changes in the Business Environment Demand for the products that the NGK Group manufactures and sells is strongly influenced by changes in the economic climate in and outside of Japan. Such changes may adversely impact the Group’s business performance and financial condition. Product Quality Guided by its Corporate Quality Policy, the NGK Group conducts quality-related activities in a committed drive to ensure consistent high quality. These efforts notwithstanding, the Group cannot completely eliminate the possibility of quality-related issues from every product that it sells or manufactures. The occurrence of such problems could therefore have a substantial and adverse impact on the Group’s business performance. International Investigation related to Competitive Conditions The NGK Group is currently the subject of an international investigation related to Reference URL competitive conditions and is giving its full cooperation. The investigation is being conducted by authorities concerned with competition, and depending on the outcome, there may be an FY2017 results presentation materials adverse impact on the Group’s business performance and financial position. http://www.ngk.co.jp/IR/library/pres entation/pdf/201704.pdf#page=3 NGK Report 2017 67 Risk Management System NGK operates a risk management promotion structure led mainly by the CSR Committee.

Based on the results of the questionnaire, risk management measures are planned by the relevant divisions, departments. This tool is also beneficial for employees as it provides them with a follow-up opportunity to understand the appropriate risk response procedures. We will continue this project going forward.

We ask all overseas group companies to report information pertaining to the status of lawsuits, legal affairs and consultation with lawyers twice a year, and helpline usage, export controls and access to legal-related information once a year. Major issues found in such reports are reported to the Compliance Subcommittee and CSR Committee to share information. Consultations from overseas locations were handled by lawyers and legal departments to avoid risks. NGK Report 2017 69 Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Initiatives BCP Initiatives The NGK Group is developing Company-Group-wide Business Continuity Planning (BCP) through the establishment of the BCP Headquarters, an organization for leading business continuity and quick recovery in the event of a large-scale natural disaster, led by the President. Countermeasure initiatives include the establishment of multiple manufacturing bases and procurement sources, the damage mitigation measures related to building and equipment and employee safety assurance. We conduct emergency drills assuming a natural disaster as a field exercise of the BCP. In the drill, participants are instructed to take real actions faithfully according to the plan, through which we identify in detail issues related to each process and procedure and use the findings to improve the BCP. Fiscal 2016 Initiatives Reviewed major BCP initiatives according to the launch of new business/products Expanded the scope of the disaster scenario to cover more broad area from the previous one centering on Nagoya, Chita and Komaki Future Plans Review the assumed damage and counterplans based on the expanded disaster scenario,and study the reaction plans against the subsequent earthquake after the first huge earth quake’s strike Enhance the effectiveness of the BCP through the more practical drills using a sophisticated scenario and expanding the target scope and object persons NGK Report 2017 70 Intellectual property management The NGK Group encourages the creation of intellectual property (IP) rights through Number of patents held providing relevant education and works to ensure proper acquisition, protection and use of as of March 31,2017 IP rights based on the policy of respect for the rights of others and ourselves alike. Accordingly, the Intellectual Property Department is building a strategic patent database in 3,038 National close cooperation with business, research and development, and technology divisions. patents of Japan Specifically, it features a patent mapping function to present the internal and external patent landscape of specific technology areas using charts and graphs, which can be easily shared within the Group. To prevent patent infringement risks, we regularly conduct external patent Foreign patents 4,134 monitoring by product line and development theme to update our database. As of March 31, 2017, NGK holds 3,038 Japanese patents and 4,134 patents from other countries. Responsibilities of the Intellectual Property Department ・ Application for/acquisition of IP rights (patent, utility model, design) To establish IP rights for NGKʼs development achievements to safeguard the corporate assets on a legal basis ・ Patent search To conﬁrm the latest external patent landscape, mainly to prevent patent infringement risks ・ Administration and operation of patent management systems ・ Administrative work relating to acquired patent rights, including: maintenance of rights; payment of patent incentives; and cooperation with patent oﬃces ・Application for/acquisition and maintenance of trademark rights for corporate logos and product trade names and marks ・Internal IP training Awareness Programs for Managers NGK conducted manager-class awareness programs to enhance intellectual property strategy in the research and development and business divisions, making use of issues identified in these programs in NGK's intellectual property strategy. In fiscal 2016, we held the 8th session of the lecture series “Considering Intellectual Property” in March. As guest speaker, we invited Mikiya Ishihara, a former intellectual property department head of Sekisui Chemical Co., Ltd. He talked about “intellectual property activities at Sekisui Chemical,” focusing on enhanced strategic initiatives for examining and analyzing competitive technology trends using collected patent information, and reflecting the results in business and development strategy planning. The session was attended by a total of 116 employees.

Performance incentives are paid to the relevant inventors from profits derived from products associated with patents acquired by NGK. Group companies in Japan have established a similar employee invention reward system, thereby seeking to spur the invention promotion initiative across the Group. To further expand this effort globally, we are working to introduce a reward system to overseas Group companies in consideration of local legal systems and labor practices, in order to facilitate employee inventions and protect individual inventors’ rights. Provision against Intellectual Property Risks Overseas To support NGK’ s automotive exhaust purification ceramic products business, which is engaged in global production activities, we have built a mechanism for appropriately managing inventions overseas. NGK promotes the practice of intellectual property management overseas at the same level as in Japan. At NGK Ceramics Suzhou (China), we continually carry out activities for “prior use defense” as part of efforts to protect our intellectual property. Prior use defense refers to a legal system in which a company can claim the right of prior use in case its competitors file a patent application for technologies that the company has kept confidential as secret know-how, by proving its precedence to the day of application filing in terms of technological implementation, thereby seeking to ensure continued business. TOPIC Overseas IP training NGK offers overseas training programs to develop international IP experts, sending young employees to the U.S. and Europe. From 2016, Masashi Yasui from the Intellectual Property Department attended appropriate courses at the Munich Intellectual Property Law Center (MIPLC) in Munich, Germany. Following this, he will receive practical training at local patent firms from since October. Yasui (sixth from left in the back row) and other students at MIPLC NGK Report 2017 72 Respect of Humanity and Assurance of Comfortable Working Environment The NGK Group makes an effort to respect the humanity of its employees and provide a safe and comfortable working environment.

Until fiscal 2015, Group companies worked on this issue on their own or promoted safety and health activities through their responsible groups. Since fiscal 2016, the entire Group, including both domestic and overseas companies, has been working together on the enhancement of safety and health activities. As part of the efforts to enhance our global compliance and governance, we disseminate information to each site and keep track of individual situations. Through auditing and provision of support, we strive to solidly improve the level of our safety and health activities. In September 2016, we developed a medium-term action plan with compliance, risk reduction and enhancement of governance as the generic concepts. In order to further strengthen these efforts, we are also promoting the acquisition of international management system certification at domestic and overseas Group companies. Promotion of Experience-based Safety Education We are seeing a growing number of accidents among inexperienced workers. In response, we have established training centers at three sites in Nagoya, Chita and Komaki, as well as at Ishikawa Plant, where trainees can actually experience risks. Establishing these centers in-house means that more workers can now take enhanced training. At each training center, we teach them the importance of compliance with safety rules while using simple devices that let trainees safely experience three kinds of risks: electric shock, being pulled into machinery and getting caught. We are also planning to set up a “Safety Dojo” (meaning Safety School), aiming to further enhance the Experience-based Safety Education and develop trainees' ability to foresee risks. Training for Safety Assessors at the Manufacturing Division Since fiscal 2016, we have been encouraging employees at the Manufacturing Division to acquire Safety Assessor certification. This qualification is granted by Japan Certification Corporation to recognize people who have a wide range of knowledge and skills necessary for the safe operation of machinery based on international safety standards. There are four levels of certification in the system, awarded according to applicants' knowledge and skills. In fiscal 2016, we started by encouraging worksite leaders and above at the Manufacturing Division as well as those in charge of safety and health to acquire the entry-level Safety Basic Assessor certification. As a result, 317 employees have passed the examination as of the end of fiscal 2016.

I'm glad I used the system because I was able to stay close to watch my child grow day by day. In order to use this system, it was essential to have the understanding and support of the people around me. For this reason, I consulted my supervisor in advance to arrange the work. Since I believe men should also play an active role in childrearing, I hope to see further understanding and cooperation both within the company and across the entire society so that more men can use this system.

NGK Report 2017 90 Labor-Management Initiatives Labor Union NGK respects workers' rights, including the right to collective bargaining, and strives to build healthy labor-management relations. As of the end of March 2017, 3,295 employees belonged to the Labor Union. Protecting the Right to Collective Bargaining Labor-Management Consultations in Fiscal 2016 NGK and the Labor Union have signed a labor agreement as equal partners. The agreement specifies that both parties Regular Labor-Management Council: held twice shall respect each other's rights and take responsibility for the exercising of their own rights.

Collective bargaining sessions are held in an orderly manner, with both parties striving in good faith to resolve issues peacefully and promptly. Guaranteeing the Minimum Wage NGK and the Labor Union have signed an agreement that sets out the original “in-house minimum wages,” which are fixed at a rate above the minimum wages by region and industry stipulated by the Minimum Wage Act. Through this agreement, we strive to improve employees' working conditions and avoid violation of relevant laws. Communication between Labor and Management NGK makes an effort to build labor-management relations founded on mutual trust through communication with various consultative bodies, such as the Labor-Management Advisory Board, the Worksite Advisory Board and the Regular Labor-Management Council. NGK and Labor Union hold Labor-Management Advisory Board meetings to talk about business conditions and performance, and Worksite Advisory Board meetings to share issues pertaining to manufacturing, work systems and workplace environments from each worksite. In addition, at Regular Labor-Management Council meetings, labor and management also proactively exchange opinions. In fiscal 2016, labor and management worked together on a drastic revision of the human resources system. They engaged in broad discussion, with the aims of developing quality young and mid-level employees and enabling mature employees to keep working with security and fulfillment. Implementation of the revised human resources management system started in fiscal 2017. Under the new system, employees are provided with opportunities to broaden their job scope, the evaluation and wage systems have become more transparent, and the retirement age has been raised from 60 to 65. Survey on Workplace Vitality NGK conducts a survey to measure workplace vitality every two years, collecting responses from the entire workforce. The survey aims to identify organizational issues associated with the workplace by analyzing responses to questions to evaluate employee satisfaction, and carry out measures to increase their satisfaction with jobs and work systems. Overall survey results are reported in the internal newsletter, while the results of individual organizations are provided to each related manager for use in day-to-day activities to improve workplace environment. NGK Report 2017 91 Implementation of Fair, Free and Transparent Transactions With a basic policy centered on the three principles of openness and fairness, partnership and relationship with society, the NGK Group is engaged in fair and equitable business transactions with the procurement partners in our supply chain. Basic Approach The NGK Group has established the Basic Purchasing Policy in an attempt to conduct fair and honest business transactions and to prosper together with all our procurement partners. Supply Chain Management System At NGK, the Purchasing Department is responsible for managing suppliers based on the Reference Page Supplier Management Regulations. Management targets cover all the tier 1 suppliers and selected suppliers among tier 2 and beyond, including raw materials manufacturers. Communication Activities with Procurement Partners P127 Basic Purchasing Policy Open and Fair Open, fair, and equitable procurement Pursuit of the competition principles and profitability Partnership Mutual prosperity based on mutual trust with suppliers Relationship with Society Compliance with laws Preservation of the global environment Familiarization of the Purchasing Handbook Purchasing operations are directly related to various important aspects of corporate management, such as assets, production, development and business performance, and also involve external and financial activities, major areas prone to compliance issues. In light of this, we created the Purchasing Handbook to summarize internal rules for purchasing engagement and issued the first edition of it in fiscal 2007. The Handbook has since been reviewed every year. Efforts have also been made to better familiarize personnel with the tool: it has been made available on the intranet throughout the company and its significant objectives are discussed in company training programs, particularly for new managers. We will continue with these efforts, confirming partners' activities and keeping up with social trends, in order to maintain and enhance our CSR procurement. NGK Report 2017 92 Promotion of CSR Procurement In response to the rising social expectation for CSR-oriented supply chain management, the NGK Group promotes CSR procurement. We preferentially select CSR-aware companies and purchase CSR-based raw-materials and services. CSR Procurement Guidelines The NGK Group created the CSR Procurement Guidelines in fiscal 2010 as a guide to For more details: promote CSR procurement across the Group including overseas Group companies. The CSR Procurement Guidelines specifically describe our obligations as a socially responsible buyer as well as our Guidelines and requirements for socially responsible suppliers. In fiscal 2013, the Guidelines were expanded Supplemental Materials by being integlated with the previous Green Procurement Guidelines, which set forth rules for http://www.ngk.co.jp/english/ about/procure/ preferential purchase of environmentally friendly products and services, and adding provisions of conflict minerals, anti-corruption and human rights and labor issues. The expanded CSR Procurement Guidelines are publicly available on our website in multiple languages (Japanese, English, and Chinese). Procuring Resources and Raw Materials Responsibly The NGK Group conducts procurement activities that consider impacts on regional communities stemming from the use of raw materials (e.g. conflict minerals including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, as well as minerals that are the source of funds for armed insurgencies in that region) with the potential to cause social issues such as human rights violations and poverty, and takes steps to avoid using such materials when there is risk of adverse impact. Improving CSR Procurement At the NGK Group, we develop activities to promote CSR procurement, such as visiting individual suppliers and conducting on-site inspections. We also request our suppliers, particularly new companies, to sign an agreement to comply with the Guidelines. From fiscal 2016, we ask for annual renewal of the agreement in an effort to facilitate suppliers' awareness and understanding of CSR procurement while striving to increase the number of signers. We will continue with these efforts, confirming partners' activities and keeping up with social trends, in order to maintain and enhance our CSR procurement.

In fiscal 2016, the Purchasing Department sent members to NGK Ceramics Indonesia as an instructor at a seminar, offering advice for efficient procurement activities and know-how on purchasing operations and supplier management. Organizing Purchasing Liaison Meetings for Overseas Group Companies In 2016, NGK held a purchasing liaison meeting at between NGK Ceramics USA and NGK Ceramics Mexico in May and October, respectively. In the meetings, buyers from each company reported on their issues associated with purchasing and logistics and conducted cost cutting measures. The meetings helped enhance the relevant expertise of participants and further develop purchasing functions of the two companies. Fair and Honest Procurement Partner Evaluations and Extensive Resource Diversification In accordance with the Basic Purchasing Policy, the NGK Group selects procurement partners based on fair and honest evaluations. We also attempt to ensure procurement when disasters occur through the extensive diversification of procurement resources. Selection of Suppliers Based on Fair and Honest Evaluations NGK opens its doors to a wide range of procurement sources, including companies with which it has had no previous transactions. In terms of selecting new suppliers, we choose from multiple companies through fair and honest evaluation of their CSR initiatives, environmental conservation efforts and financial condition as well as quality, cost and delivery (QCD). In addition to the procurement department being involved in the selection of suppliers, multiple departments are also involved in this process, which requires multi-stage approval before selection occurs in an effort to ensure fair and honest evaluation and decision-making. Promoting Business Continuity Planning (BCP) through the Diversification of Procurement Resources In the event of unforeseen circumstances such as a major natural disaster, NGK promotes the sourcing of raw materials, equipment, secondary materials and other critical purchased parts from multiple suppliers as part of its BCP efforts to ensure procurement is uninterrupted. For items which are available from only one supplier, we are in the process of ensuring sufficient inventory and that the storage facilities for these items are located in a safe place that cannot be damaged by tsunami. In addition, when selecting a new procurement partner, we take into consideration the existence or absence of multiple locations and efforts to ensure inventory. NGK Report 2017 94 Preservation of Global Environment The NGK Group is engaged in ongoing environmental conservation efforts by means of improving manufacturing processes through the development and introduction of innovative manufacturing technologies and the development of products and services that contribute to reducing environmental impacts. Activities covered NGK Headquarters/Nagoya Site/Chita Site/Komaki Site/Ishikawa Plant (does not include Tokyo Main Office, Osaka Branch and six othersales offices) Group companies: 42 manufacturing-related consolidated subsidiaries (19 in Japan; 23 overseas) NGK's Core Policy on the Environment Recognizing that protecting the environment is a vital issue that all of humanity must face, the NGK Group formulated its Core Policy on the Environment in April 1996 based on Environmental Philosophy and Environmental Action Guidelines in order to bring its corporate activities into harmony with the environment. On the basis of this policy, the NGK Group works to reduce the environmental impact of business activities, and actively strive to help protect the environment by developing products and technologies to that end. NGK's Core Policy on the Environment Environmental Philosophy Given its corporate philosophy– NGK products and technologies must create new value and contribute to the quality of life –NGK will contribute to tackling environmental issues through its Triple-E business segments of ecology, electronics, and energy to create a comfortable environment for future generations. Guidelines for Environmental Action 1. Strive to develop, design, and manufacture products that contribute to the environment and products with low environmental impact. 2 . Work to reduce the environmental impact arising from business activities. Conduct design reviews to scientifically study and evaluate the environmental impact of business activities. Promote energy conservation measures for all processes and facilities, and make efforts to control CO₂ emissions Promote resource saving and recycling, and make efforts to control the generation of by-products. Through the appropriate use and control of chemical agents, work to reduce the risks inherent in toxic substances. Give precedence to environmentally friendly materials, parts, products, and facilities in procurement and purchasing, strengthening cooperative alliances with our business partners. 3. Enhance environmental management systems from a global perspective while continuously reducing our environmental impact. 4. Not only abide by environmental laws, regulations, and other requirements, but also institute voluntary standards and work to improve our own environmental conservation. 5. Provide environmental information to the public at the appropriate time and pursue dialogue with all stakeholders. Proactively develop social action programs. Also, engage in education and publicity in order to improve employees' environmental consciousness.

Power Business 5 4 Overseas Group Ceramic Products Business 9 8 Electronics Business 8 8 The counting method of manufacturing bases was changed in fiscal 2016. Environmental Audits NGK conducts internal environmental management system audits and is inspected by third parties at the Nagoya, Chita, and Komaki sites, as well as the Ishikawa plant. Group companies also conduct these same internal audits and external reviews of the environmental management systems are conducted by external auditors at all Group companies. In fiscal 2016, no significant findings were made. In the event of a significant finding, the relevant division and Environmental Management Department work together to review and implement countermeasures as well as inform environmental committees in each area in an attempt to horizontally deploy these measures. Environmental Risk Management At the NGK Group, each manufacturing site has individually established environmental management systems to prevent environmental pollution. Each site periodically performs selfevaluation of its environmental risk management activities and reports evaluation results to NGK headquarters. Headquarters confirms the results and gives advice and support for improvement, as necessary. Thus, we are working to improve the management level for the entire Group. Regulatory Compliance NGK conducts monitoring and assessments as well as vigorous control of exhaust and wastewater produced from its sites, observing relevant regulations and environmental preservation-related and other agreements with control authorities. Additionally, we organize environmental management specialist seminars on a regular basis for all Group companies in and outside of Japan to keep responsible persons updated on related topics, thereby enhancing our capabilities to prevent environmental pollution.

Mitigating Environmental Risks throughout the Group All NGK Group companies in Japan and overseas have completed acquisition of ISO14001 or third-party certifications meeting this standard and implement environmental management in line with environmental management systems. NGK shares information regarding changes in domestic environmental laws and regulations with Group companies and has created a structure to ascertain the status of responses to these changes. Overseas, NGK Headquarters is enhancing its ability to regularly ascertain the status of responses and management in terms of important legal and regulatory system revision information in the countries and regions where Group companies are located. Additionally, in fiscal 2016, we developed trend-based risk prevention systems using historical monitoring data for atmospheric, water and other types of environmental pollution, and introduced the systems to all Group companies in and outside of Japan. Also, NGK headquarters sent environmental management personnel to Group companies overseas to perform on-site environmental risk assessments and, for identified risks, countermeasures have been completed at relevant sites. We will continue with these efforts to mitigate environmental risks throughout the Group. Strengthening Environmental Management Linked to Business Planning The NGK Group promotes environmental management responsive to continuously evolving business plans. Initiatives aimed at reducing impacts on the environment in accordance with business plans include conducting forecast estimates and achievement evaluations in each business group, product line and global manufacturing base every six months to determine which initiatives to pursue next. These efforts include the establishment of the Environmental Expert Committee under NGK Environmental Protection Committee, as a company-wide decision-making body. The Environmental Expert Committee facilitates discussions among managers from planning and production divisions who formulate and promote actual business planning in each business division, strengthening the company-wide environmental management system. Going forward, we will continue to strengthen management integration with the aim of promoting environmental management that combines global environmental protection and corporate growth.

To achieve the goals of the Plan, we are promoting environmental activities, setting annual targets. Results of the Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan (2016 -2020) The NGK Group organizes environmental initiatives by creating five-year action plans. The Fourth Five-Year Environmental Action Plan, initiated in fiscal 2016, has been formulated to broadly encompass major global environmental challenges that businesses are expected to take responsible actions to address, and to select two key issues each for two groups of themes, namely, priority themes and focus themes. The two priority themes are: environmental/social contribution through products; and reducing CO₂ emissions and discarded materials. The first priority theme directly reflects the core concept of the corporate philosophy, while the other theme closely relates to NGK's mediumto long-term initiative of new/reformed manufacturing structures for increasing competitiveness. For focus themes, we have also set two issues: biodiversity conservation and water resources risk management/response, both being major challenges for which socially responsible corporate action is required with greater urgency. [Base year, target year, control scope] Base year: fiscal 2013; target year: fiscal 2020 The new Five-Year Environmental Action Plan has been designed to correspond with the business initiative of New/Reformed Manufacturing Structures. Accordingly, the base year and target year of the Plan have been set to coincide with the initiative. In principle, activities will be managed on a consolidated basis, embracing those based in and outside of Japan, in place of the previous method of managing domestic and overseas activities separately. The consolidation method has been adopted to improve management efficiency and effectiveness in response to the recent changes in our global production output structure, particularly increased amounts from overseas manufacturing sites as well as from production chains through multiple global locations. Mediumto long-term Socially important Corporate Philosophy management strategies environmental issues Commitment to biodiversity NGK products and technologies New/reformed manufacturing conservation must create new value and structures (Involvement in the Aichi Target) contribute to the quality of life.

For the fiscal 2016 initiatives, almost all yearly numerical targets have been achieved, and for non-numerical targets steady progress was made as initially planned, indicating that we have made a successful start to the Five-Year Plan. In particular, a distinctive achievement was recorded in the area of reduction in discarded materials, where we considerably exceeded the initial target, as a result of persistent efforts of business divisions. We will continue promoting environmental activities across the Group to achieve the targets for fiscal 2017 and onward.

In fiscal 2017, we will continue with these new development and distribution efforts to achieve the targets. Development and distribution of products contributing to environmental protection HONEYCERAM ® HONEYCERAM is a ceramic substrate for catalytic converters to purify harmful contents in the exhaust gases of automobiles. The products' honeycomb structure is effective for carrying the catalyst to detoxify harmful substances by chemical reaction. Since the launch of its commercial production in 1976, the product has been supplied all over the world for many years as an essential component for meeting automobile exhaust gas regulations, which have become increasingly more stringent and wider in scope. Production has grown to record cumulative shipment exceeding 1.4 billion units, while manufacturing bases have expanded to a current total of eight countries in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. HONEYCERAM is an indispensable component of clean vehicles. NGK's HONEYCERAM production eliminates a total of four million tons of NOx per annum*1, equivalent to double the annual NOx emissions in Japan*2. 4 *1 Assumption based on installation of exhaust gas system in new cars that are not equipped with such systems NOx elimination: million tons annually *2 Source: OECD Environmental Statistics (2012) Diesel particulate filter (DPF) The DPF is a porous ceramics filter used worldwide in the exhaust systems of diesel vehicles. With a pore structure, the filter ensures particulate matter (PM) is captured to purify the exhaust gas emitted from diesel vehicles. NGK is the only company to produce two types of DPFs based on both cordierite and silicon carbide. NGK's ceramics technologies support further developments for diesel vehicles. The honeycomb structure, where the inlet and outlet of the through-holes are alternately sealed, enables the thin ceramic walls to efficiently capture PM while exhaust gas passes through. Eliminates up to 99 % of PM NGK Report 2017 104 NOx sensors NGK has developed the world's first in-vehicle sensor to measure concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gas in real time with high precision. Specifically, the sensor is capable of measuring NOx concentration at the parts per mission (ppm) level and can thus detect even very small amounts of the gases. The sensor supports precise control of the exhaust purification device used in diesel vehicles, which leads to a reduction in NOx emissions and helps to promote the use of clean diesel vehicles. NAS ® Battery One of the most frequent uses of the NAS battery is for stabilizing the supply of renewable energy. While electricity from renewable sources, such as wind and solar power, is clean and, in principle, unlimited, its major limitation is that its output is affected by weather conditions, resulting in supply instability. The NAS battery resolves this limitation by storing excess renewable energy when generation exceeds demand, and supplying the stored energy to the grid when renewable output is low or demand is high. NAS systems enable the global growth of stable renewable energy. NGK was the world's first manufacturer to commercialize the NAS battery megawatt-class NAS systems are the world's most popular storage system. Featuring a large capacity, high grid-scale battery storage energy density, and long life, the battery can 200 530,000 support the reliable, long-term stable supply of Installed locations at over worldwide with a kW capacity electricity. Also, the NAS system allows for a more compact housing compared with conventional ( as of June 2017 ) lead-acid batteries. Low-level radwaste treatment system NGK has developed a wide range of systems to safely treat low-level radioactive waste generated from nuclear facilities and has supplied these systems to nuclear power stations and related facilities across Japan. The systems are developed utilizing NGK's proprietary treatment technology and high-performance filter-based dust collection technology. We undertake a variety of engineering projects including design, manufacturing and site construction, and also provide a long-term maintenance service to deliver stable and high-level radioactive decontamination. NGK thereby provides essential support for the safe and stable operation of nuclear facilities. In addition, we focus on the development of new systems for treating various types of radwaste expected to be generated from the decommissioning and dismantling of aging nuclear reactors. Importance of treating radioactive waste When treating and disposing of waste generated in radiation controlled areas, including nuclear power stations, it is critically important to prevent the spread of radioactivity via the release of radioactive matter. This requires special treatment and disposal methods that differ from those for general waste. NGK Report 2017 105 Preventing Global Warming The NGK Group strives to reduce CO₂ emissions, a major cause of global warming, setting reduction targets for the entire Group, including its manufacturing sites in and outside of Japan. Reducing CO ₂ Emissions from Manufacturing Activities Toward the achievement of CO₂ emissions reduction targets set under the Five-Year Action Plan, we have achieved steady results by creating and implementing annual improvement plans in line with the business plan at each manufacturing site in and outside of Japan. We achieved the fiscal 2016 targets to make steady progress under the Five-Year Action Plan. This accomplishment resulted from our successful efforts to carry out reduction measures as initially planned, despite the basic unit per net sales decreasing from the previous year due to a number of negative factors, such as the stronger yen, change in the product mix, and a new production line launched overseas. The reduction rate against BAU, an indicator newly introduced under the Fourth Action Plan to present more directly the effect of measures to reduce emissions from the manufacturing division, reached the 2020 target of 15%, backed by a significant improvement in the basic unit per production volume. For fiscal 2017, we will exert additional efforts to achieve annual targets in order to overcome the temporary rise in CO₂ emissions expected owing to two extraordinary events, namely, the completion of a new large factory overseas and starting the mass production of new products. To address this challenge, we will strive to carry out reduction measures even more effectively across the entire manufacturing division while focusing on cost cutting efforts.

Measures to Reduce CO₂ Emissions and Effects As it continues to expand overseas manufacturing, the NGK Group is particularly striving to raise manufacturing efficiency at its overseas sites in order to reduce the amount of CO₂ and discarded materials released from the Group. We have made steady progress through applying innovative processes and improvements to facilities and operations practiced in Japan to our overseas sites as well as promoting energy-saving activities for general-purpose equipment. In fiscal 2016, these overseas initiatives achieved significant results, including an annual CO₂ reduction effect of 9,500 metric tons (a reduction rate of 1.2%).

This is expected to help enhance activities to reduce CO₂ emissions. 環境経営統括部 Promoting energy-saving activities globally using 100 best practices Environmental Management Department Toru Oka We have issued the Energy-Saving Best Practices catalog. This catalog is a compilation of around 100 successful measures taken to address various issues, categorized under compressors, boilers, lighting, air-conditioning and other functions, specifically describing improvement methods and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the Energy-Saving Guidelines for General-Purpose Equipment have been created to provide instructions and advice for effective activities. Containing plenty of photos and illustrations, these easy-to-understand manuals have been well received by Group companies overseas as well as in Japan. They are also utilized by the Energy Center to give instructions and advice to Group companies. The two tools will be expanded by adding new practices, thereby facilitating energy-saving activities across the Group. NGK Report 2017 107 Energy-Saving Activities at Group Companies NGK Insulators Tangshan Co., Ltd. NGK Insulators Tangshan has introduced measures conducted at Japanese sites to reduce CO₂ emissions. Our efforts started with encouraging the daily practice of switching off lighting and other equipment when not in use, with the primary intention of raising employee awareness. We are continually working to improve activities with the help of the Komaki Site, which sends personnel to Tangshan every six months to perform an on-site inspection and suggest improvement plans. NGK Ceramics Polska Sp. z o.o. Since 2011, NGK Ceramics Polska has been focusing on improving processes for manufacturing SiC-based DPFs, its main product. Target areas include particularly energy-intensive calcination and drying processes, for which we have carried out various measures to reduce our CO₂ emissions. To further improve our performance, we will introduce new measures, including technologies provided by the Nagoya Site. NGK Metals Corporation NGK Metals is reducing CO₂ emissions by updating control systems and improving the operation of production equipment. Among various efforts, a particularly distinctive effect resulted from automating the control units of the oil circulation system for rolling mills. The automation eliminated unnecessary around-the-clock operation, a measure taken to address inefficient activation/deactivation processes, as well as simplifying complex manual processing. This change helped reduce electric power consumption as well as CO₂ emissions. Transport Volume / Basic Unit Per Transport Volume（NGK） Reduction of CO₂ from Logistics Basic Unit Per Transport Volume （KL/100,000 ton-kilometer） 5 （10,000 4.61 ton-kilometers） NGK works to reduce CO₂ emissions from logistics, setting 4.23 4.14 4.17 a target of reducing the basic unit per transport volume by 3.96 4 8000 1% year on year on a five-year average, as required by the Energy Saving Act. To achieve this target, we have 6000 3 implemented a number of measures, including raising loading efficiency and promoting a modal shift. For fiscal 3,670 2 4000 2016, we recorded a 2.1% increase on a five-year average, 3,409 3,121 3,221 2,715 reflecting the considerable lowering of the rate of marine 2000 transport, a mode emitting less CO₂, to address a change in 1 the product mix. 0 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Transport volume： Transport volume（Other） Ocean transportation Land transportation Basic Unit Per transport Volume NGK Report 2017 108 Starting to Report SCOPE 3 CO2 Emissions The NGK Group reports Scope 1 and 2 CO₂ emissions data for the Group overall and for NGK independently in relation to logistics (for shipment). In addition to this, NGK has begun to prepare Scope 3 data on a non-consolidated basis in response to emerging expectations for businesses to expand the relevant data reporting scope to include the supply chain. Introduction of Green Power As part of our corporate activities aimed at harmony with the environment, NGK began introducing Green Power (energy sources such as wind and solar power and biomass fuels) in 2002, earlier than any other company. The Green Power Certification System contract we signed with Japan Natural Energy Company Limited calls for them to generate two million kilowatt hours of wind power for us each year. This accounts for about 60% of the power consumed annually at the NGK headquarters building, attaining a reduction effect of approximately 1,000 metric tons of CO₂ emissions per year (based on the fiscal 2016 results; CO₂ conversion factor: 0.532), or the annual amount of CO₂ absorbed by approximately 71,000 cedar trees. NGK Report 2017 109 Promoting Effective Use of Resources To boost yield from manufacturing process improvements, NGK Group reuses in-process materials in an effort to curb discarded materials while also focusing efforts on recycling to reduce final disposal volumes to promote resource recycling. Reducing Discarded Materials from Manufacturing Activities Similar to its efforts to reduce CO₂ emissions, the NGK Group works to suppress its generation of discarded materials by formulating and managing annual improvement plans to achieve the Five-Year Plan targets for the reduction of discarded materials. In fiscal 2016, we exceeded the annual targets, securing the basic unit per net sales at the level of the previous year despite negative factors such as the unfavorable exchange rate affecting net sales and the launch of a new manufacturing line. This achievement resulted from the manufacturing division's outperforming efforts directed at an increased material utilization rate and production yield for each process and a higher recycling rate within processes, attaining a significant improvement from the previous year in the basic unit per production volume for many mainstay products. The reduction rate against BAU, which indicates improvement from the fiscal 2013 level, grew substantially from the previous year to 18%. In fiscal 2017, we will continue with these ongoing efforts, aiming to accomplish the Five-Year Plan targets.

In fiscal 2016, we focused particular efforts on NGK Electronics Devices, a consolidated subsidiary from fiscal 2014 that was included in the reporting scope from fiscal 2016, and Akechi Insulators, which was looking for new service providers. With assistance from NGK headquarters, both companies successfully carried out recycling programs while keeping treatment costs at a reasonable level, significantly decreasing the amount of landfill disposal. As a result, we have maintained a domestic recycling rate of 99% or higher since fiscal 2013, a target set under the Five-Year Plan. NGK, by itself, achieved zero landfill disposal, or a recycling rate of 100%. At overseas Group companies, where situations vary by country and region, suitable targets are set taking into account circumstances specific to each location. The overseas recycling rate has remained at around 90% based on calculations that exclude three companies that generate non-recyclable discarded materials, out of a total of 16 overseas manufacturing Group companies. Overseas Group Company Implementation Examples At overseas Group companies, waste material separation management is strictly enforced. Waste separation rules are posted where waste materials are stocked and color-coordinated containers are provided for each category of waste to avoid confusion. NGK Ceramics Europe NGK Ceramics USA NGK Report 2017 110 Risk management of water resources and Response The NGK Group recognizes the management of water resources as an important issue for the company in achieving a sustainable society, and promotes relevant initiatives as described below. Water Risk Evaluation At the NGK Group, to ascertain water supply risks for each manufacturing site in and outside of Japan, we perform a simplified internal survey to assess water shortage risks based on the water supply capacity of rivers in the respective regions. In fiscal 2016, we newly introduced a third-party survey to provide advanced analyses for sites where concerns are identified from the internal screening. For water supply/demand risks, the external assessment employs a range of indicators, from the river's water supply capacity and seasonal fluctuations in groundwater flow to the reservoir capacity of dams and other systems, and produces a supply/demand forecast. The assessment also analyzes risks of flooding and water quality deterioration. The external survey reported that no serious water risks have been identified at any surveyed site. We plan to expand the advanced assessment to all overseas bases. We will also work to keep up with related regulatory trends to ensure stable operations in the future. Water Usage Guidelines NGK created guidelines (an implementation status checklist) aimed at appropriate water usage and, in fiscal 2015, launched inspections to ascertain the efficiency of water usage at all manufacturing sites in and outside of Japan. Going forward, we will enhance these guidelines through internal and external case studies while encouraging efforts at each location to strengthen the operational structure against a future tight water supply. Promoting efficient water use at Group companies NGK Ceramics Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. We strive to use precious water resources as appropriately and efficiently as possible, including the recycling of water used inside plants, at Group companies located in highly water-stressed regions. For example, at NGK Ceramics Mexico, manufacturing process waste water is filtered using reverse osmosis membranes and the recycled Filtration device using reverse osmosis membranes water is reused as coolant and boiler water or sprinkled on vegetation. Cooperation with Suppliers Believing that it is important to address issues related to water resources throughout the supply chain, the NGK Group asks its suppliers to practice water resources-related risk management and efficient water usage via the CSR Procurement Guidelines, which includes relevant items. In fiscal 2016, a total of 723 companies, accounting for 99.4% of NGK's domestic supply chain, agreed to our request NGK Report 2017 111 Biodiversity Initiatives The NGK Group recognizes the conservation of biodiversity as an important issue for the company in achieving a sustainable society, and promotes relevant initiatives as described below. Activities Aimed at Achieving the Aichi Target The NGK Group has been pushing forward with activities pursuant to “Aichi Target” international goals for biodiversity agreed upon at the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 10). In fiscal 2016, we prioritized relevant activity areas and set two new ones: biodiversity survey of company-owned sites and cooperation with suppliers.

Cooperation with Suppliers We have added to the CSR Procurement Guidelines items pertaining to water resources-related initiatives and biodiversity conservation initiatives. We have won the almost full agreement of our suppliers in Japan to comply with the expanded Guidelines. Biodiversity Survey of Company-owned Sites NGK performed a biodiversity survey of a site owned for welfare purposes in Midori-ku, Nagoya City. Major findings include the identification of 23 avian species and 80 botanical species, with no rare or non-native species requiring urgent protective or removal actions detected. This indicates that the site is appropriately managed. NGK Report 2017 112 Environmental Education and Communication In accordance with NGK's Core Policy on the Environment, we conduct ongoing environmental education and awareness activities through the establishment of action guidelines for educational and publicity activities aimed at increasing employee environmental awareness. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of environmental problems among each employee to inculcate an awareness of environmental conservation activities. We also provide on-site classes at elementary schools and conduct environmental events and provide information to a wide range of stakeholders including the next generation to increase environmental awareness. Participating in Local Environmental Education Offering Guest Lectures at Elementary Schools and Children's Centers NGK sends instructors to participate in the guest lecture program for youth hosted by the Environmental Partnership Organizing Club (EPOC) every year. In fiscal 2016, the program was held at Yatomi City Tobu Children's Center (Aichi Prefecture), where our instructors offered a laboratory to teach how soil can purify water under the theme of water resources and usage. NGK provides ongoing environmental education programs, including its participation in the guest lecture program, which have been attended by a cumulative total of 2,100 participants. Employee Volunteers Teaching Parent-Child Insect Classes At Tsuruma Park in Nagoya's Showa Ward, NGK employees teach Summer Break Insect Observation classes for children and their parents (sponsored by the Nagoya City Greenery Association), introducing the various names and the ecosystem of insects living in the park. In August 2016, volunteer employee instructors were commended by the Nagoya Green Society for contribution to the local environmental education project, receiving a certificate of appreciation. Raising Environmental Awareness Environmental Education inside the Company To familiarize employees with the aims and content of NGK's environmental policies, we conduct position-based training related to environmental management systems. We also provide two different levels of environmental training: specialized programs targeting personnel in charge of environmental management and general programs for the entire workforce. Promoting the Acquisition of Qualifications To continue conducting environmental conservation activities in compliance with laws and regulations, we make an effort to develop and increase the skills of legally qualified personnel through support in each department for the acquisition of environment-related legal qualifications targeting managers engaged in pollution prevention required for the management of each area. We systematically educate Qualified Energy Managers in the Engineering Department, Special Controlled Industrial Waste Managers and others involved in waste-related activities in the Environmental Management Department and other business divisions.

Support provided by NGK includes lending reference materials to those who require them and providing test-related expenses. To date, a total of 590 people, more than 10% of NGK (alone) employees, have passed the test. In fiscal 2016, 116 passed the test. * The Eco test is an environmental and social certiﬁcation test administered by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry focused on a wide-range of environmental issues. NGK Eco Point System NGK promotes its Eco Point System in an effort to contribute to regional environmental improvement. Employees earn points for environmental behavior conducted at work and in the home, a portion of which is converted into cash and donated to local government-managed funds (environmental funds). In addition to the company's three sites in Nagoya, Komaki and Chita and the Ishikawa Plant, the System was newly introduced to the Tokyo Main Office and Osaka Branch and sales offices in fiscal 2016. The First Recognition of Top-Ranked NGK Eco Point Collectors The NGK Eco Points earned by individual Voice of one of the top NGK employees through their engagement in point earners environmental activities are aggregated on an Electrical Insulator Division, annual basis for each site (Nagoya, Chita, Power Business Group Komaki, Ishikawa), and top scorers are Koichi Kato commended every year.

NGK Report 2017 133 Remuneration of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Policies for Determining Remuneration, etc. of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Reference Page With the aim of incentivizing the realization of NGK's corporate philosophy and management policies, as well as to heighten the transparency, fairness and clarity of their responsibilities, Policies and Procedures the remuneration of NGK directors is comprised of three components: (1) a level-based, for Determining Remuneration of Senior fixed annual salary as basic remuneration, (2) an annual performance-based bonus to Management and heighten the link with the company's performance and further clarify the fulfillment of Directors by the Board of Directors responsibilities of each director, and (3) stock-related remuneration designed to boost motivation and morale toward enhancing corporate value over the mediumto long-term P139 through sound company management by having them share with shareholders the risk of stock price decline as well as the rewards of stock price increases and increasing their sensitivity to NGK's share prices. In terms of the ratio of fixed annual remuneration to variable remuneration, from the perspective of emphasis on maintaining and improving performance over the mediumto long-term, NGK sets the performance-based variable remuneration at an appropriate level. For the purpose of ensuring fairness and increasing transparency during the process of determining remuneration, the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee comprising a majority of outside directors deliberates matters related to the policies for determining remuneration, proposals on the total amount of remuneration for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, and proposals on the amount of remuneration for individual directors and executive officers, the results of which are reported to the Board of Directors. Outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members receive only basic remuneration based on their supervision of management from an independent perspective and role as monitors.

In recent years the remuneration of executives has become a hot topic within corporate governance in Japan, and NGK aims to build a governance scheme to address this, including establishment of the Nomination and Compensation Advisory Committee. I also feel that NGK has overcome various problems with respect to compliance, and we are moving in a very positive direction. Originally, compliance was focused on operations in the head office however, we are now advancing to the point where NGK's wide-ranging corporate activities can be viewed from a global perspective. I believe that it is important to enliven discussion on long-term strategy to improve corporate value while citing future problems and to make efforts to optimize our corporate portfolio for the next generation. Business strategy and governance are one in the same thus, as we globalize, we will be called upon to even further strengthen our efforts in this area. Outside Director Toshio Nakamura Remaining Incisive towards Issues Is Crucial It has been six terms now since I became involved in the management of NGK as an outside director, and I feel that the corporate governance of NGK has progressed very well over these past few years. In the area of risk management, it is crucial to create a system that can discern risks, clarify the decision-making process, and verify and accurately respond when problems do arise. Additionally, it is also important for everyone in the company, from the management to the employees, to share an incisiveness about whether or not there is an internal problem. On this point, I feel that after repeated communication and training, the mentality of the employees has changed. Another important role for corporate governance is to endeavor for the continued success of the company. For NGK, It is important to properly refine basic technology, discern the potential of its technology and seek to apply these in new friends. Specific efforts, such as “2017 Challenge 30” , are already underway, so I expect to see momentum develop there for major leaps forward in the future. Outside Director Emiko Hamada Using a Technological Perspective to Become Involved in Both the Workplace and in the Business I have had a strong impression of NGK as a highly technical and research-oriented company from the outside. I was appointed as an outside director beginning in 2017. I hope to bring new potential to NGK when developing new technology by providing my outsider's perspective as the first technological development-related outside director. To that end, I hope to engage in discussions with the people in development and to actively visit the workplace. I also believe that I can play a role in sharing my knowledge on the culture and rules of the electronics industry from my own abundant experience in the field of electronics, when NGK further penetrates the electronics industry. I would like to contribute to the future growth of NGK from perspectives that have been absent within the company and in new ways that no one has been aware of up to now.

In terms of specific procedures, the basic remuneration is determined by considering corporate performance and the level of remuneration within the similar industry, with the amount set according to position or rank. Performance-based bonuses, which are annual bonuses, are determined based on management indicators and increases/decreases in performance, including annual consolidated operating margins, consolidated sales and consolidated ROE. In terms of stock-related remuneration, as a long-term incentive, the allotment of stock remuneration-type stock options with a strike price of 1 yen per share are determined in accordance with position or rank.

pressing task for, at the very least, globally-active companies, so the search for the proper way to accomplish this continues across the world. With their second integrated report this year, NGK has masterfully shown through their NGK Report 2017 how to best accomplish this task. Indeed this report gets to the point and in a succinct way. The NGK Report 2017 (pamphlet) not only carefully selects the high priority issues from among the voluminous and diverse events happening currently, to happen in the future and having happened along their journey from the founding of the NGK Group, but they presented this information in a clear and easy-to-understand format using wording and illustrations that are succinct and dead on their mark. It hardly needs to be said that readers can search for more Mr. Koichi Ikeda information on the NGK website. Visiting Professor Their top commitment is a declaration to aspire for sustained growth going into the Management School future through the cultivation of three factors: their unique strengths, such as Ritsumeikan University advanced technical capacity in ceramics since their founding, their people, who are the foundation for their growth, and a sustainable future, which holds the NGK Group’s business activities and the solutions for the social problems of our day to be one and the same. This declaration from the management succinctly gets to the point even more. Moreover, the company-wide eﬀorts towards sustained growth, such as the New/reformed manufacturing structured initiatives to improve competitive edge in the medium to long terms, and the “2017 Challenge 30” that sets new product ratios of sales to above 30%, as well as the business overviews of the three business groups (Power, Ceramic Products, Electronics) are succinctly and clearly presented. This is especially the case with the business overviews of the three business groups, where the performance trends, outlooks, main products, FY2016 business conditions, FY2017 issues and initiatives, as well as the future prospects and eﬀorts, which are plagued by uncertainty, are laid out in a simple, yet richly appealing form. Additionally, the fact that they present themselves to be moving full-steam ahead with the pertinent eﬀorts (such as their human rights initiatives with the start of their human rights due diligence, their general employee HR system reform carried out in April 2017 to allow all employees̶from young hires to veterans̶to work with more purpose, and their continued promotion of CSR procurement in their supply chain) they have selected amidst the on-going internal and external changes in the business environment speaks to the trustworthiness of the NGK Group. In conjunction with this, they make special mention of the increased intensity of their eﬀorts towards the environment that they have been so committed to advance up to now̶speciﬁcally that they are moving on track to reach the goal of the ﬁnal year of their Five-Year Environmental Action Plan with the growth rate of sales of Products contributing to environmental protection. In the future, I have expectations that they will level and even out the report content that varies in density here and there, and attempt to compile an even more succinct and to-the-point integrated report, so that they may incisively discern and swiftly adapt to the dynamics of the global business environment and continue to keep ahead of the competition.
