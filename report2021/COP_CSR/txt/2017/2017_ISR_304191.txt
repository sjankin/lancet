The publication of the Corporate Responsibility Report reflects Discount Bank's deep commitment to the subject of social and environmental responsibility, including in matters of corporate governance. In 2015 the Bank celebrated eighty years since its establishment. Over the years of its existence, Discount Bank has been a leader in social action. This is the fifth Corporate Responsibility Report published by Discount Bank. The report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI G4 (Global Reporting Initiative) Standard. In this report we have significantly enlarged the scope of disclosure in order to reflect the good work done in the field of social responsibility by the principle subsidiaries in Israel: MDB and ICC. In 2010, the Bank joined the United Nations Global Compact initiative. This report constitutes also an annual update of this initiative in respect of 2015. In this respect we reiterate the Bank's commitment to the Global Compact initiative and to its ten principles. Publication of the Social Responsibility Report was made alongside additional reporting frameworks: to the Maala Organization, to the EIRIS research body and to the reporting and recording center of the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection. This reporting structure reflects the Bank's commitment for transparency and for extending its activity in social responsibility areas. The Corporate Responsibility Report presented below is not only a report or summary of activities, but is also, and mainly, a promise to continue the activities of the Bank and its employees in servicing its customers, continuing to work opposite those involved with the Bank and for the community alongside we work. Within the scope of its social involvement and commitment, the Bank will continue to take action to advance weak populations and encourage its employees to participate in activities for the community, thereby strengthening its social contribution as an organization and as individuals. Furthermore, the Bank has and will take action to integrate environmental considerations as part of its business strategy and credit policy. On behalf of ourselves and the members of the Board of Directors and Management, we support all the volunteers being employees of the Discount Bank Group, and all stakeholders in the social activities and projects led by the Bank. December 25, 2016 Dr. Yossi Bachar Lilach Asher-Topilsky Chairman of the Board of Directors President & CEO A Corporate Responsibility Report what is it? Corporate responsibility reporting rests on the approach that a corporation must be accountable to the society and the environment in which it operates, and not only to its shareholders. The adoption of this approach leads to a broadening of the scope of reporting, while addressing a wide variety of subjects, aspiring to deal with the full range of social, environmental and economic issues that occupy all the stakeholders of the reporting corporation. A stakeholder is anyone that Discount Bank influences or is influenced by: customers, employers, suppliers, shareholders, the community and the environment (it should be noted that as a financial corporation, in its main field of activity financial brokerage the Bank's vendors are essentially its customers, which their activity as depositors serves the Bank in providing financial resources. Another significant party is contracted workers, who are discussed in the chapter dealing with employees)1. The dialogue with the stakeholders is being conducted in various channels and is detailed in the different chapters below. The Corporate Responsibility Report complements the corporation's financial statements. Whereas one presents the corporation's financial performance, the second presents the manner in which things are done, the degree of importance that the corporation attributes to the aspirations of its stakeholders, and its efforts to promote areas requiring improvement. The Corporate Responsibility Report is not just a reporting framework, but a platform for ongoing dialogue between the corporation and its stakeholders. The Bank was the first banking corporation to issue a Corporate Responsibility Report in Israel in 2005 (for the years 2003-2004). The second Social Responsibility Report was published in 2009 (for the years 2007-2008). The Bank's Third Social Responsibility Report (for the years 2012-2013) was published in 2014. The Bank's fourth social responsibility report (for the year 2014) was published at the beginning of 2016. The publication of the Fifth Social Responsibility Report forms an expression of the Bank's commitment for social responsibility issues and for their importance as part of the Bank's organizational culture. 1 G4-24; G4-25 Corporate responsibility report Directives of the Supervisor of Banks in Israel On the background of developments regarding the issue of corporate responsibility reporting, and in view of the importance that the Supervisor of Banks attributes to the activity of banking corporations in this respect, the banking groups, in accordance with the Reporting to the Public Directive, are required to publish reports for a period of up to two years concerning corporate responsibility. In accordance with the instructions, the corporate responsibility report may refer to matters such as commitment for involvement in the community, environmental topics, cultivating the staff and work environment, fairness to customers and business ethics. The instructions does not determine the reporting contents, though it is recommended to include therein disclosure regarding relevant quantitative indices as well as relevant standards according to which the banking corporation operates in this field. It is the Bank's intention to publish a social responsibility report every year. Challenges and opportunities in the field of social responsibility Social responsibility and sustainability is an approach that provides the Bank with a methodological opportunity to make an operative connection between various topics and challenges. Discount Bank has been connected with the community since its establishment. Throughout the years, the Bank has seen itself as a bank that operates within the community, as a bank that operates in the best interests of the customer and his family and as a bank that acts responsibly toward all the stakeholders who influence, or are influenced by, its activities. The Bank is focusing on the challenges facing it in the social responsibility field, on a number of main levels: Creating a common value in products for customers: At the level of banking products the Bank focuses on several populations. The flagship program is the “Family Program”, which focuses on the needs of the customer and his family, and makes them into a financial group that benefits from a variety of unique services and benefits, in accordance with the aggregate data of the program’s partners. Concurrently, the Bank focuses on additional populations, such as small and medium-size businesses, students and so forth. The Bank is also taking steps in the fields of providing accessibility and financial education. At the level of environmental products promoting products such as those that enable the financing of alternative energy; Employees development and enrichment of employees by means of training, mobility and personal development; Community increasing the scope of volunteer work by the Bank's employees; The environment reducing the ecological footprint by means of a reduction in energy consumption; Responsible activity of the organization Responsible corporate conduct, while implementing high standards in the field of corporate governance and ethics, in all units of the organization and with stakeholders; In addition to the above mentioned areas, MDB focuses on the creation of value to the non-Jewish customers population and to the Haredi customer population, in respect of which the bank operates by means of a layout of branches as well as by specialized professional units. Moreover, during the last decade MDB jointly with relevant governmental agencies developed considerable expertise in the granting of credit to small and medium businesses through governmental funds for the support of businesses; In addition to the areas mentioned above, ICC focuses on the creation of value to customers belonging to the small business segment. The work process for managing this field will be expanded in the coming years, and will include broadening the measurement and reporting, strengthening the manner in which certain topics are handled and the gradual expansion of managing this field to the Group level. The expansion of the disclosure in this social responsibility report, so as to include wide and varied information regarding the work performed in the area of social responsibility by the principal subsidiaries in Israel MDB and ICC comprises a significant progress in this field. Social Responsibility Director The Bank has an officer in charge of social responsibility appointed by the Bank`s Management. The appointment is intended to strengthen the management of the social responsibility field at the Bank and reflects the importance attributed by the Bank to this subject. The director’s task is to intensify the awareness of Bank employees as well as of stakeholders, and to formulate plans of action to achieve the goals designated for this area. The officer in charge of social responsibility reports to the head of the Human Resources and Properties Division, who is in charge of managing social responsibility at the Bank's Management level. MDB has appointed an officer in charge of social responsibility, whose duty is to increase awareness to social responsibility among the bank's employees. The social responsibility officer reports to the Head of the Human Resources and Administration Division. ICC has appointed an officer in charge of social responsibility management, who is responsible for managing all social responsibility issues at ICC. The officer in charge of social responsibility management reports directly to the General Manager of ICC. Discount's fifth Corporate Responsibility Report The Report was prepared in accordance with the reporting principles of the GRI (a nongovernmental organization working in collaboration with the UN and organizations from all over the world, in order to develop and integrate global corporate reporting parameters among organizations worldwide). Within the scope of the commitment to the said reporting principles, this Report was structured according to the GRI G4 Guidelines Comprehensive , and includes reference to all Aspects identified as material (see extensive discussion further on2). The list of topics reviewed in the Report may be viewed in the table of contents on pages 2-3. An index is attached in an Appendix to this report which constitutes a cross-reference table between the different indicators and their reference in the report. The Report reviews the Bank's processes in Israel and at the principal subsidiaries in Israel MDB and ICC, and does not include the overseas activity3. The Report addresses, in the relevant contexts, the activities of the different divisions of the Bank and the principal subsidiaries in Israel MDB and ICC, including the senior levels over management. The data presented in the Report were processed according to the reporting of the Bank's various units, striving to build a data base that will enable a comparison with data from past years. This effort resulted indeed in improvement; however, further efforts are required for the systematical gathering of data regarding the various reporting issues. The calculation methods that are used have been noted in the places where the related data are presented, respectively. The report does not contain any 2 G4-18; G4-23 3 G4-17 data that are in contradiction with the data presented in previous social responsibility reports published by the Bank4. In cases where previously published data had been changed or corrected, this fact was distinctly noted. In the process of writing this report, the Bank strives to describe with maximum transparency its activities in relation to topics that it believes to be of interest to its stakeholders. We at Discount believe that this Report will serve the five categories of our stakeholders (shareholders/investors, customers and suppliers, employees, the community and environment), and will facilitate the promotion of dialogue, intensifying the relationship and heightening cooperation. Various excerpts of the Report, as well as the data presented therein, were referred to the information providers at the Bank and at the main subsidiary companies, for review and to various functions at the Bank and at the main subsidiary companies for comments. The final draft of the Report was also referred to all members of the Bank's Management for comments. Work performed in the field of social responsibility by the principal subsidiaries in Israel As stated, in this report we have significantly enlarged the scope of disclosure in order to reflect the good work done in the field of social responsibility by the principle subsidiaries in Israel: MDB and ICC. Previous reports did not include reference to these social activities, with the exception of a small number of issues5. By the nature of things, as this is the first report in which the activities of the said subsidiaries is reflected, the challenge facing the subsidiaries in the coming years is the expansion and intensification of reporting, while establishing an appropriate data base as well as data gathering and reporting procedures. In order to reflect to stakeholders the reporting position in these companies in a transparent and orderly manner, the Index contained in the Appendix to the report assigned separate columns to MDB and to ICC. Reporting in accordance with the G-4 reporting Guidelines may be made at two options: Comprehensive – where the report responds fully to all indicators regarding all reporting aspects – mandatory aspects and aspects defined as material; Core – where with regards to the material reporting aspects, the report responds to policy aspects and to one indicator respecting each aspect. 4 G4-22 5 G4-23 The reports of MDB and of ICC are at the Core reporting level, and as regards many aspects, they are very near to the Comprehensive reporting level. It is noted that the sections describing policy or work procedures at Discount Bank apply also to MDB and to ICC, unless otherwise stated. The process of identification of material Aspects In accordance with the G-4 reporting standard, it is required to perform a process for the identification of material aspects6 that have a material impact on the activities of the reporting company and on its stakeholders. Selection of the material Aspects is made from a list of Aspects offered by the GRI. Towards the preparation of the social responsibility report for the year 2014, the Bank has performed an orderly process of defining the material reporting aspects. A materiality matrix was defined as part of this process, which is used by the Bank as a reporting basis also for the present report. Within the framework of the preparations for the next social responsibility report, the report for the year 2016, the Bank plans to validate the list of material aspects and make the necessary changes therein, where required. For details regarding the process of defining material aspects, see the Social Responsibility Report for 2014 (pp. 10-13). 6 G4-18 Alternatives for the manner of defining the approach to each Aspect. In accordance with G4, three alternatives exist for the definition of each Aspect: Alternative A : defining the Aspect as material identification of an Aspect as material requires conducting an orderly reporting based on a clear administrative infrastructure that includes a formal policy, work plans and performance goals, with respect to such Aspect (this alternative is defined in the following Table as material Aspects full reporting ). Alternative B : immaterial Aspect, information only the definition of an Aspect as immaterial, in respect of which information only will be provided. Reference to this Aspect in the report, though not defined as material, stems from the need to report on processes and data that are required by various initiatives and frameworks, in which the Bank is a member. Namely, initiatives such as the UN Global Compact, the Maala rating, the EIRIS rating and so forth (this alternative is defined in the following Table as immaterial Aspects partial reporting ). Alternative C : immaterial Aspectan immaterial Aspect, in respect of which no reference will be made in the report (this alternative is defined in the following Table as immaterial Aspects no reporting ). Within the framework of the identification process, all Aspects have been classified into one of the mentioned above alternatives7. 7 G4-18 Aspects defined as material8 Material Aspects Immaterial Aspects Immaterial Aspects full report partial report no report Prevention of corruption Economic performance Fairness of products and High advancement of financial education Work environment and conditions Greenhouse gases emissions and air Importance of the Aspect for Stakeholders of employment Sewage and waste pollutants Training and development of employees Involvement in the local community Indirect economic implications Social/environmental products Regulatory compliance Medium Prevention of discrimination Environmental and social risk management Gender equality Evaluation of suppliers' Employee health and safety work environment Diversity and equal opportunities Energy consumption and increased Employee union efficiency Material consumption Customer privacy Inclusion of human rights clauses in investment agreements Employee relations Management Asset management and Business continuity Work environment sifting Local procurement practices complaints mechanism Evaluation of the Low Environmental Investment suppliers' impact on human rights Environmental evaluation at suppliers High Medium Low Importance of the Aspect to the Bank 8 G4-18; G4-19; G4-20; G4-21 Material Aspects reporting Boundaries9 Material aspect Reporting Boundaries 1 Prevention of corruption within the organization 2 Economic performance within the organization Fairness of products and advancement of within and outside the organization 3 financial education Work environment and conditions of within the organization 4 employment 5 Training and development of employees within the organization 6 Involvement in the local community within and outside the organization 7 Indirect economic implications within and outside the organization 8 Regulatory compliance within the organization 9 Prevention of discrimination within the organization 10 Gender equality within the organization 11 Diversity and equal opportunities within the organization Energy consumption and increased within the organization 12 efficiency 13 Business continuity within the organization 14 Local procurement practices within the organization Dialogue with stakeholders in the banking sector In the first quarter of 2016, a validation process of the material reporting aspects framework for banks in Israel was conducted, under the guidance of the corporate responsibility and sustainability group of the Accounting Firm of BDO Ziv-Haft. Fourteen representatives of the academy, the professional community, the business community, associations, the community and the environment participated in this process. The products of the dialogue may be divided into two groups: the compiling of a list of reporting aspects in accordance with the level of importance as seen by the stakeholders participating in the process and the recommendations/comments made by the said stakeholders regarding the focus and enlargement required with respect to each aspect. 9 G4-18; G4-19; G4-20; G4-21 The following aspects have been defined within the framework of compiling the list of reporting aspects: Aspects of high importance fairness in products and services; accessibility; environmental and social considerations in the granting of credit, finance and investments; disadvantaged population; privacy of the customer; diversification of customers and sectors; ethics and prevention of corruption. Aspects of medium importance promotion of proficiency and financial education; promotion of the local economy and the creation of economic value for stakeholders; quality of service; corporate governance; compliance; sustainability management; integrating corporate responsibility aspects with purchasing; proper work environment; employment diversity, equality of opportunities and gender equality. Aspects of low importance marketing communication; innovation regarding services and products; business continuity; operational and logistic efficiency environmental aspects; training and the development of employees; investing in the community (contributions and sponsorships); voluntary activity of employees. As may be seen, high correlation exists between the aspects defined by the Bank as material and the aspects defined as such by the stakeholders taking part in the process. The Bank has studied the recommendations/comments made by the said stakeholders regarding the focus and enlargement required in each aspect and made an effort to enlarge and focus the report, in accordance with the said recommendations/comments. As stated, the Bank plans to validate the list of material aspects as part of the preparations for the next social responsibility report, the report for 2016, and in this respect the Bank would re-examine the products of the said validation process. Reporting to the Global Compact The Bank joined the United Nation Global Compact initiative in September 2010 and since then submitted in March 2012 and in March 2013 an annual progress report regarding the Bank`s social and environmental activities. This report, as well as the two previous social responsibility reports, constitutes an annual progress report in respect of the years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. An Appendix to this report includes an index comprising a cross-reference table between reportable items in accordance with the Global Compact initiative and their reference in this report.

Control over the appropriateness of reporting Discount Bank G4 in Accordance Comprehensive General The Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Group of the BDO Ziv Haft Consulting Company have been engaged by Discount Bank to perform an assurance process for the 2015 Discount Corporate Responsibility Report (reviewing the Bank's performance in the 2015).

This Group operates in accordance with local and international accounting standards for the examination and promotion of responsible conduct of corporations. Independence The accounting firm of BDO Ziv Haft acts as joint auditors of Discount Bank. Furthermore, the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Group provide support to the Bank in a number of control processes over sustainability reporting. Discount Bank has engaged the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Group to perform an assurance process over the reporting, and the Group declares that it is independent of the Bank in its business operations. The appropriateness control presented herewith has been performed as detailed further on, and in accordance with the guidelines of the GRI and the accepted principles for reporting control. The control is designed to examine compliance with reporting according to the principles of the international reporting standard GRI:G4 and the performance of the process for the definition of material Aspects lying at the basis of the report, in accordance with the GRI methodology. Certification In view of that stated above, and in accordance with the examination performed by us, we certify herewith that the report of Discount Bank complies with the requirements of GRI:G4 at the In accordance-Comprehensive transparency level, and accordingly we testify that based on the information, and accordingly we hereby testify on the basis of the information at hand, as follows: The Aspects included in the report cover the areas material to the Bank's activities and its stakeholders.

Following are the channels in which control was performed, commensurate with the principles of control over the appropriateness of reporting: Principles for the definition of the report content Stakeholder inclusiveness providing a response to stakeholder expectations from the Bank. The Bank maintains an orderly dialogue with several stakeholders, which allows it to understand their preferences in real time. The process of identification of material aspects has not changed in this report, and it relies on the materiality process performed towards the writing of the social responsibility report for 2014. This is based on the assumption that there were no material changes in the operations of the Bank so that it is not anticipated to see changes in the positions of its stakeholders and therefore also in the list of material aspects. Consequently, the list of material aspects, on which this report is based, is identical to those identified in the previous report. Product: Discount Bank presents the framework of material Aspects in its operations, and in view of the inclusion of stakeholders' positions, the Bank presents a framework of Aspects material to corporate governance activity. Sustainability context presentation of the different sustainability issues relevant to the Bank.

The information presented in the report includes a description of the administrative approach with respect to each of the material Aspects. Product: The report reviews the operation of Discount Bank and its impact upon stakeholders in aspects of sustainability, while presenting an extensive and orderly state of affairs image. Materiality clear reference to the various areas of influence of the Bank. The Bank had already made in the previous report a comprehensive process for the identification of material Aspects in its operations, both internal and external. This act has integrated the positions of stakeholders alongside the positions of senior officers of the Bank, and a materiality matrix of Discount Bank has been created. The materiality matrix used by the Bank in the writing of this and the previous report, and serve as a basis for reporting in accordance with the G4 principles. Product: The report relates to all the material Aspects relevant to the Bank. Furthermore, the materiality matrix enables to understand the gaps existing between the preferences of the Bank and those of the stakeholders. In addition, the Bank has elected to include in the present report also reference to Aspects of a lesser importance level, on which the Bank expands the scope of disclosure, despite the fact that they are not material. Completeness examination of the scope of disclosure in respect of material Aspects. The report complies with the requirements of GRI:G4, at a In Accordance Comprehensive transparency level, meaning that the report responds in full to all the indices comprising the Aspects, which the Bank had defined as material Aspects. Product: Full disclosure in respect of each of the indices under the aspects material to the operation. Principles for assessment of the report quality Balance and clarity balancing the report between positive and negative aspects of the company's operations, and the clarity of the data and information to the reasonable reader. The report presents the Bank's performance in a transparent manner, with reference to both positive and negative performance. The manner of presentation of the information in the report allows the reader to understand the implications of the Bank's operations, with a more extensive discussion of Aspects defined as material.

Timeliness the up-to-dateness and relevancy of the information to the public. The present report of Discount Bank relates to the Bank's performance in 2015. Discount Bank publishes every year a social responsibility report. Nevertheless, the report is being published almost a year from the end of the reported period, and this time lag has to be reduced in future years.

The data had been assembled from all responsible functionaries at the Bank and by means of documents evidencing the reliability of reporting. Product: All Aspects had been examined and we found complete correlation between the contents of the report and the operations of the Bank. Recommendations We found it proper to commend Discount Bank on the following matters: A. Extending and intensifying the scope of the report The present report contains a significant enlargement of the information provided with respect to the principal subsidiaries of the Bank in Israel (ICC and MDB). Moreover, regarding certain issues the Bank expanded the reporting and now publishes information and data not presented in prior reports. B. Strictly keeping of a balanced reporting The Bank strictly maintains a transparent, full and balanced reporting, and reports positive achievements and performance alongside the confrontation with complex issues that are not flattering, while presenting the relevant comprehensive information in the matter as part of appropriate management. C. Continuous commitment to transparencyover a long period of time the Bank diligently submits annual reports to additional reporting frameworks in the field of corporate responsibility besides the GRI, including: Global Compact, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Registration and Reporting Group of the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection, and also participates in the rating of Maala. This may be considered as a continuous commitment to transparency with respect to its performance in this field. As part of the Bank's efforts to continue and improve, we recommend intensifying the activity and reporting in the following areas: A. Definition of goals and indices regarding corporate responsibility A part of the aspects relating to corporate responsibility at the Bank are conducted in an orderly and measurable manner, though some are not as yet. In order to continue and improve, the Bank has to present in a clear manner in its next report its goals with respect to corporate responsibility aspects, so that the attainment thereof could be examined, showing whether the expected improvement has been reached. B. Validation of material aspects with the stakeholders This is the second report of the Bank written in accordance with the reporting guidelines of GRI: G4. In accordance with these guidelines, it is expected that towards each reporting cycle, the Bank should perform a review for the validation of material aspects. In view of the time that had passed since the Bank performed a review of material aspects, and particularly in view of the inclusion of the subsidiary companies in this report, it is recommended that towards the next report, the Bank should perform a new review of the positions of its stakeholders as well as of the aspects material to its operation, and should form an updated materiality matrix. C. Extending the contents of the report and reference to all the material subsidiaries As stated, Discount Bank has significantly expanded in the present report the information on its operations, including therein considerable information regarding the operations of the material subsidiaries operating in Israel. It is recommended that in the next report, the Bank shall review the whole Group, reporting also on the operations abroad. This, alongside the maintenance by the material subsidiaries of the high reporting standard and transparency of the Bank.

Profile, Corporate Governance, Vision and Values Goals and business strategy On August 20, 2014, the Board of Directors approved the Discount Group’s strategic plan for the years 2015-2019. The plan that was drawn up is based on in-depth analysis and detailed planning work carried out at the Bank, with the assistance of an international consultancy firm. The plan encompasses all the Discount Group’s spheres of activity, taking a view of the Group’s strengths and challenges, as a diverse and stable financial group having core material holdings in Israel and overseas, with a longstanding and loyal customer base, an extensive network of branches, service that is based on personal relationships, and devoted and professional staff. The plan has been constructed on three central pillars far-reaching efficiency measures, growing the retail segment and inculcating an organizational culture supporting change. The first pillar focuses on efficiency measures and stringent management of expenses, including: Reducing the size of the Discount Group’s workforce by more than 1,000 employees, of which some 700 by the end of 2017. During the years 2014-2015, a decrease of 628 employees of the Bank was recorded, comprising a reduction of 9.7%; Adjustments to the organizational structure, with the aim of simplifying various processes and making them more efficient, as well as shortening the customer response time; Reducing the Group’s real estate areas (in light of, inter alia, the downsizing of the workforce). Within this framework, real estate areas were reduced by 3,768 square meters in 2015 (following a reduction of 6,186 square meters in 2014). Savings in procurement costs and other expenses. The second pillar in the plan focuses on long-term growth and profitability: Growing the retail segment, placing emphasis on private customers and small businesses, at the Bank and at its subsidiaries Mercantile and ICC. In 2015, the Bank focused on growing its consumer credit operation and on further developing the households and small businesses segment. This measure was also supported by improved infrastructure and the development of models that enabled the portfolio to be enlarged and provided better credit accessibility to the public. Thus for example, in 2015 private credit at the Discount Group, excluding housing loans, grew by NIS 2,254 million, an increase of 10.4% compared with the end of the previous year. Profile, Corporate Governance, Vision and Values Strengthening the connection with the Bank’s customers, by means of upgrading appropriate and useful value offers in a variety of distribution channels, and through implementing technological improvements and enhancing the customer experience. Within this framework, innovative digital services were introduced, as well as a new Internet site for private customers; Accelerating the process of transferring operational functions from the branches to the back-office, so as to allow bank tellers to focus on providing personal service to the customers In 2015, a new back-office “Banking Service Center” was established in order to support the branches by the removal of operational activities and the concentration of expertise, with the aim of streamlining processes, shortening response times, making cost savings and freeing up time at the branches for activity that has value for the Bank’s customers. In addition, speedier and simpler work processes, based on new technologies, are deployed at the branches, with the aim of streamlining the bankers’ work and enabling them to focus on providing personal service to customers. The third pillar which is the integration of a change supporting and customer focused organizational culture, which is based on performance and excellence and on the development and nurturing of the human capital, is the inculcation of an organizational culture. Within this framework, the Bank integrated in 2015 management tools based on performance: Balanced scorecards for the Level of the Group and of the Bank, as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) for the senior management echelon, which are being monitored on a current basis. Points of emphasis for 2016 Integration of the strategic plan. Integration of the plan includes the launching and execution of some thirty strategic projects.

The strategic plan of Mercantile Discount Bank. The Board of Directors of MDB approved in August 2015 the strategic plan for the operation of this bank. The strategic plan comprises two principal lines of action: Expansion of the retail activity of the bank (households and small businesses), within the framework of which, the bank is expected to focus on specific segments of the population, in respect of which the Bank has accumulated over the years experience and specialization in the granting of banking services that respond to the special needs of these segments. Operational efficiency through strict management of operating expenses and improvement in the structure of revenues. For additional details, see the 2015 annual report of MDB, which is available on the website of this bank (pp. 6-7). The strategic plan of ICC. The Board of Directors of ICC approved on December 10, 2014, the strategic plan of the company for the years 2015-2017. The plan is based upon two central layers growth in the credit field and the reduction in costs, alongside the maintenance of the competitive capabilities in the payment market. Implementation of the plan is intended to lead to an operational model that would support the achievement of the company's goals, including: reliance on advanced digital and technological platforms in order to support the realization of business initiatives, educated risk management within the framework of the risk appetite, as well as development of human capital and organizational culture in order to support the strategy. Implementation of the plan is intended to lead to a growth in profits of the ICC Group and to enable it to face in an optimal manner, the challenges set by the financial market in Israel in the coming years. Profile, Corporate Governance, Vision and Values Forward-looking information. The main points of the strategic plans presented above include assessments that fall into the category of forward-looking information, such as the estimate of profitability, the efficiency and growth targets that have been set, and so forth. These assessments are based on the latest information and estimates available to the Bank and its subsidiaries. The strategic plans are based on assumptions regarding developments in the Israeli economy in the coming years, and also legislative and regulatory initiatives that are currently known, whose enactment is expected with a high degree of probability. Material changes in the state of the economy and the situation of the customer public, legislative and regulatory changes having a material effect, material changes in the competitive landscape and material changes in the security situation could have an impact on the degree to which the targets of the strategic plans are achieved. A further cause of uncertainty arises from the limited ability to accurately forecast the implications of some of the future processes and their impact on profitability.

Among other things, the agreement provides for a selective annual increase in salary at an average rate of 3.5% for each of the years 2012, 2013 and 2014. The agreement remained valid until December 31, 2014. On March 23, 2015, ICC signed a collective labor agreement with the new Federation of Labor and the national representative committee of ICC employees ( the agreement ). The agreement extends by one additional year the validity of the previous agreement signed by the parties. According to the agreement, the parties shall continue negotiations, starting August 2015, in respect of a collective agreement for the years 2015-2017. The agreement establishes the rate for the wage addition in respect of the year 2015, determines the rate of seniority increment payable to permanent status employees of ICC, and establishes amounts and rates of additional benefits to which ICC employees are entitled. In terms of the agreement, the parties are bound to maintain The Employees industrial peace at ICC until February 29, 2016, with respect to the understandings to which the agreement relates, except for certain matters as defined in the agreement. The wage level at ICC is decided based on accepted criteria in the employment market and in accordance with employee performance. In 2016 a new collective labor agreement was signed for the years 2016-2018. The agreement established the rate of the selective wage increase at an average level of 3.1% for each of the years, as well as established the seniority increment for these years. In addition, additional employee rights and benefits were established. Mercantile Discount Bank Labor relations with employees of this bank, except for those having a personal employment agreement, are principally based on a basic labor agreement labor statute and complementary collective agreements. These agreements determine, among other things, that wage terms, work and related terms shall be linked to those of Bank Leumi Le'Israel B.M.. Besides these agreements, specific agreements are being made from time to time, between Management and the employee representative committee, with respect to specific issues. The terms of employment of members of Management of MDB are regularized by personal engagement agreements. On May 22, 2005, an agreement was signed between the New Federation of Labor, the employee representative committee and the Accountant general at the Ministry of Finance, which states, inter alia, that the validity of the collective labor agreements existing at the bank shall be extended to December 31, 2009.

In addition, from time to time the Bank encourages early retirement of tenured employees, as detailed below. With respect to the remaining Bank employees who are not union members and are employed for determined time periods (temporary employees) and/or in accordance with personal employment agreements managerial flexibility regarding the termination of their employment is higher, and indeed termination of employment of these employees occurs generally at the end of the contractual engagement period, or on grounds of dissatisfaction from the employees performance or disobedience, as well as in view of adopted efficiency measures and cuts in expenditure required by the Bank. Such termination of employment is effected only after the employee has been made aware of the circumstances and reasons for the termination of his employment, has been given the opportunity to voice their claims against the dismissal, and after the Bank has seriously considered each such case on its own merits. Employee Retirement The Bank encourages early retirement of permanent employees, directed at an employee population having defined characteristics, for which a focused effort is made to encourage their early retirement at beneficial terms. The encouragement of retirement of permanent employees is a strategic human resources goal. The retirement has the retiring employee's consent and is not imposed (dismissals), and it advances goals like reducing the average cost per employee position and rejuvenation of the workforce. The Employees 2014 retirement plan.

In view of the extensive demand on the part of employees to join the plan, the Bank's Board of Directors, in its meeting of December 17, 2014, decided to extend the plan, allowing 130 additional employees to join it. As part of integrating the retirement plan, the Bank provided retirees with pension consultation by external consultants, financed by the Bank, which assisted employees in their decision as to the acceptance of the retirement offer and as regards the desirable compensation channel.

The Act specified an administrative enforcement mechanism, which includes warnings and the imposition of monetary sanctions on employers who violate labor laws, which will serve as an alternative for criminal indictments by power of labor laws. The law imposes extensive liability on employers with respect to their direct employees, as well as purchasers of services with respect to enforcement and securing the rights of personnel engaged on their premises in guard, security, cleaning and catering duties. The Act prohibits the engagement by entities ordering services and contractors supplying such services, in agreements which do not provide for basic wage terms for the personnel involved.

Ruling in the matter of forced retirement on grounds of age. In December 2012, the National Labor Court issued an innovative ruling with respect to the duty of employers to consider approaches made by employees facing retirement on grounds of age (67 years), who are interested in continuing their employment. In accordance with the said ruling, employers must consider approaches made by employees based on the personal circumstances of each employee and not only on the requirements of the employer. In actual fact, a part of the employees apply for the continuation of their employment, and the Bank acts in accordance with the procedures required by the said ruling of the Court. Collective agreement in the matter of proper representation in the workplace of handicapped persons. A collective agreement was signed on June 25, 2014, by the Business Associations Board, the Manufacturers Association in Israel, Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce (FICC) and other organizations with the Federation of Labor, which states that an employer, who employs over 100 employees, must provide for the proper representation of handicapped persons. The parties have defined that proper representation at the end of the first year since the agreement became effective, would be 2% of the total number of employees employed by an employer, and 3% at the end of the following year. It has also been agreed that an employer has to appoint a person on his behalf as responsible for the employment of handicapped persons .

Green Discount for the Environment Policy General The Bank is a financial corporation providing various financial services to its customers, and as such, the direct environmental influences on its existing production processes are very limited. This differs, for example, from industrial plants that could deal with the problems of gas emissions, sewage, toxic waste removal, etc. Most of the Bank's environmental influences are office effects deriving from the consumption of resources: energy, water, paper, etc. One of the Bank's environmental goals is to limit these indirect effects. Environmental policy Discount Bank attributes importance and relevance to the subject of the environment, from the social and economic aspects, and as a valuable basis for its business activity. Therefore, the Bank adopted a policy of maintaining the proper balance between business activity and environmental protection. Principles Discount Bank views the subject of the environment with importance and relevance, in the social areas toward the community, and in economic areas its business success and positioning as a leader and its commitment to prevent environmental damage and to ongoing improvement in environmental performance; The Bank directs its business activity while aspiring to service its customers' transactions and their economic development, while considering subjects related to environmental protection, and while assessing that the legal and regulatory obligations are fulfilled where applicable to a financial body; In the construction and property sector, the Bank is obligated to identify environmental influences, measure and understand them, as a basis for reaching decisions, prevention of environmental damage, and an obligation to a proactive approach; The Bank will include its employees and the community in its environmental activities; The Bank's Corporate Division undergone a process, with the objective of evaluating credit policy with an eye to environmental matters; Green Discount for the Environment The Bank's Management allocates manpower and financial resources to evaluate and monitor to the extent possible, the environmental influences of the Bank direct and indirect in order to reduce them. The Bank's Management has chosen a high-ranking official the construction and Properties Department manager. The manager reports directly to the Head of the Human Resources and Properties Division, who reports to the Bank's Management. Ultimate Objectives Commitment to preventing environmental damage and ongoing improvement in contribution to the environment; Recognition of natural resources as a limited public resource; Commitment to the principle of sustainable development; Commitment to the entrepreneurial approach in the real estate sector, primarily the reduction of damaging effects to the environment; Examining the possibility of installing of energy-saving equipment in the operation of electrical equipment and air conditioning. Goals Related to Impact on Environment Energy reducing electricity consumption 5% annually; Reducing gasoline consumption 1% annually; Reducing the carbon footprint in Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 1% per year. The Bank intends to implement in 2017, a wide action for the exposure of this issue to Bank employees (whether by the distribution of learning material or by alternative means, such as updates on FaceBank). The consumption of resources Energy usage In continuation thereof and according to the policy as described above, and considering the nature of its environmental implications, the Bank has determined the reduction in energy consumption as a central goal in its operation in this field. Almost all of the Bank’s energy consumption results from its buildings bulbs used for lighting and air conditioning systems. The Bank monitors its energy consumption with the aid of an outside company. The Bank has set goals for savings in energy consumption. Green Discount for the Environment Among the measures taken in order to encourage awareness, and in consequence actions taken for savings in electricity, may be mentioned the reporting to managers. A reporting procedure has been instituted whereby an electricity consumption report that includes a comparative analysis, is produced for attention of branch and unit managers. The object of this process is to reflect electricity consumption to managers in order to encourage energy saving. The report is produced on a monthly basis and in addition, a condensed semi-annual and annual report is produced for each unit manager at the Bank. At the same time, several projects are in effect for the replacement of the air conditioning systems with VRF units, for the replacement of lighting with the more economical LED lighting, for the installation of security systems (the switching off of lighting at the branches and head office upon turning on the alarm systems), for the selective supply of power for lighting and air conditioning on days on which a branch does not operate (rotation days), for the installation of timer clocks, etc. MDB has taken several steps to improve energetic efficiency, including use of energy saving light bulbs and installment of efficient air conditioning units (VRF) at new branches. MDB also examines the possibility of installment of VRF units at existing branches. Furthermore, occupancy sensors have been installed in meeting rooms and the automatic turning-off of lighting and air conditioning is in operation during afternoon and evening hours at the management office premises. At MDB branches a central switch exists for the turning-off of electric power at end of the work day. MDB monitors electricity consumption and regularly examines electricity consumption per square meter of office space, in order to identify opportunities for improvement of energetic efficiency. At ICC light bulbs have been replaced by energy saving LED T5 bulbs. Moreover, the automatic switching-off of computers operates at weekends as well as automatic switch to standby position after two idle hours. Furthermore, by means of building control systems, the automatic switching-off of electric power is made four times during evening and night hours. Roofs of buildings owned by ICC are covered once a year by white insulation material, which contributes to a reduction in the heat absorption of the buildings during summer months, thus saving in air conditioning energy consumption. Furthermore, to the extent possible, ICC uses natural lighting for its office premises, and the planning of new buildings and operation areas makes use of material that is not harmful to the environment, while complying, to the extent possible, with green construction principles. The steps described above in ICC led to a 17% saving in electricity consumption, compared to 2014.

Green Discount for the Environment Emission of greenhouse gas The Bank is voluntarily committed to targets for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. In each year, the Human Resources and Properties Division monitors the progress in this area by collecting performance data in the various areas and formation of a report reflecting such data. The Bank voluntarily reports emissions created by it to the reporting and recording center of the Israel Ministry of Environmental Protection. This, in view of the expectation that with time such voluntary reporting would become compulsory. In operational terms, the Bank strives to gradually reduce its carbon footprint through energetic efficiency at the branches and at head Office (see hereunder). In addition, to the extent possible the Bank combines green criteria in the building projects of its Head Office and branch buildings (see hereunder). The carbon footprint, the data of which is presented hereunder, is composed of three scopes: Scope 1 direct emission originating in the consumption of fuel and refrigerant gases; Scope 2 indirect emission deriving from the electricity consumption; Scope 3 indirect emissions deriving from business flights.

Calculation of direct emission (Scope 1) of MDB and of ICC does not include refrigerant gases emission. 3) Emission originating in the use of refrigeration gasses has been recalculated, following the improvement in the data. As a result, the total emission included in Scope 1 has been recalculated as well as the total carbon footprint of the Bank. 4) The calculation of emission resulting from the consumption of electricity is based on the emission coefficient of the power company for 2015. 5) Scope 3 includes emission from business travel. The computation is based on coefficients of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Green Discount for the Environment The data in the Table indicate a reduction of 19.2% in the carbon footprint of Discount Bank, which is the result of three factors: A 5.5% reduction in the consumption of electricity (Scope 2); A significant reduction (approx. 56%) in the consumption of refrigeration gases following the installation of VRF systems replacing part of the old air conditioning systems at the branches, repair of leakage and a more accurate measurement; Reduction in air travel. These three factors add to the reduction of 4.2% in office space. Annual absolute reduction targets of 1% both in Scope 1 and Scope 2. The Bank makes use of refrigerant gases for the air conditioning of its branch and head office buildings. In 2015, the Bank consumed approximately 3 tons of R-22 type refrigerant gas and approximately 0.75 tons of R-410 type refrigerant gas. The Bank is acting for the replacement of a major part of its old air conditioning systems with the more economical VRF systems. Energetic efficiency Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions Presented below are details regarding the investment of Discount Bank in measures1 to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2015, and the annual savings which have resulted therefrom: 2015 Expected annual Annual GHG financial emissions savings(2) Investment in Annual energy reduction (CO2e (estimate in Type of activity Description NIS thousand savings (in kwh) tons) NIS(3)) Energy efficiencies Energy efficiencies in buildings in A/C systems 3,300 1,248,986 869 2,338,652 Energy efficiencies Upgrading electricity in buildings control systems 273 936,739 652 1,753,989 Energy efficiencies Installing building in buildings control systems 100 936,739 652 1,753,989 Total 3,673 3,122,464 2,173 5,846,630 Notes: 1) Savings in the consumption of electricity in relation to 2014. Estimated as a percentage of total savings in consumption. 2) In accordance with actual savings data, estimated as a percentage of the total financial savings. In 2015, due to cost-saving considerations, cut backs were made in the scope of construction and infrastructure projects, including renovations at branches and head offices units, and also infrastructure upgrades. As a result, there has also been a decrease in the scope of investments in this area. Green Discount for the Environment Mercantile Discount Bank acts toward the reduction in fuel consumption and emission of greenhouse gases in several ways: Transportation to and from the Management Building in Holon and the Yovel Tower in Tel Aviv; Providing transportation for the joint travel on business of employees; Preference for low pollution vehicles on lease arrangements; Use of video conference means for meetings and appointments. ICC the company's vehicle fleet which numbers some 230 vehicles, was replaced in the course of the recent few years and it includes today vehicles with small engines of economical fuel consumption and reduced pollution. Replacement of the vehicle fleet of the company has led to a 5% saving in the consumption of fuel by the company. Furthermore, the company maintains a transportation system for employees of the service centers, with the view of reducing the use of private vehicles by employees. As part of improving the efficiency of the employee transportation layout, efficiency of the transportation layout has been improved by 50% in 2015. In addition, the air conditioning systems in the Management office building in Givatayim and in the service center building in Ashdod are operated by means of water chiller units, which do not require use of refrigeration gasses having a high global warming potential. Employee transport system at Discount Bank In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from employees’ transportation on the one hand and in order to make things easier for employees on the other hand, the Bank operates three transportation facilities at the disposal of employees. One operates at 07:30 AM from the Arlosorov Train Station in Tel Aviv to the Bank offices at 160 Herzl Street, and at 15:30 PM from the offices at 160 Herzl street to the Haganah Train Station in Tel Aviv. In addition, during the day there is transportation service (at fixed hours) from the 160 Herzl street offices in south Tel Aviv to the Discount Tower in the center of Tel Aviv. In addition, a transportation array is provided from Jerusalem to the Discount College in Rishon Le'Zion. In addition, the Bank has installed shower cabins in one of the buildings on Yehuda Halevi Street, for the benefit of those employees who cycle to their office at the Discount Tower. Bicycle parking facilities have been placed at one of the Management buildings in order to encourage employees to use this means of transportation to arrive at work.

The Bank, together with its employees, has mobilized in a major process with the objective of reducing paper consumption. This process is reflected in several projects being integrated simultaneously. Branch without archives The process includes extracting the daily material from the central archives (performed at all branches), extracting basic documents from the branches, the scanning thereof and presentation in the customer digital file (performed at 70% of the branches), converting paper documents to original digital documents (the first stage has been implemented covering 15% of the documents at branches on transactions without the customer’s presence); Paperless archives The process includes the conversion of paper documents to original digital documents. The number of bins in the central archives will be reduced by 70% over a period of seven years, within the framework of an effort that will result in saving 3,000 tons of paper; Reduction in the number of reports printed on paper: The production of printed reports to the branches has been terminated, these being made now via computer only; System for management and distribution of procedures and circulars Enables access and retention of the Bank's procedures over time. Is carried out by a transition to an Intranet system (an internal communication network in the Bank) which enables the distribution of circulars and procedures in an employee portal, thereby saving the need to print the procedures and distribute them to all the employees; Green Discount for the Environment Discount mail service in the Internet The Bank contacts its customers and enables them to receive updates about their account activity by means of a secured mailbox on the Bank's website. This process makes it possible to reduce the distribution of notices and letters to the customer's home by mail. The service allows secured access to the mailbox from any computer by use of a personal password. Furthermore, the service allows the safekeeping of mail messages and management of a personal archive, where mail may be retrieved during a period of seven years; Computerized forms system Banking work uses a large number of forms. Until now, the forms were printed in advance, requiring extensive storage space, and the destruction of the inventory of forms whenever they were updated. The Bank switched to a computerized forms system, which enables each employee to print the updated form when needed, while it contains the particulars of the specific customer, thereby avoiding recording errors. This process also saves space for storage of the blank forms, and enables customers to receive faster and more efficient service; Envelope savings Replacement of inter-office envelopes with multi-use envelopes. Mercantile Discount Bank Acts in a wide array of ways in order to reduce the consumption of paper at the branches and at Head Office: Reducing the quantity of printed material at the branches within the framework of the project paperless archives , which commenced in 2014, the Bank acts to reduce the printing of documents at the branches. The printing of a form would be made only where the Bank has the regulatory duty to keep a printed form in its archives. This project led to a reduction of 15% in the scope of forms printed not in the presence of customers, such forms being now kept in a digital archive; Reduction in the number of contract forms the Bank has found that in many cases, contracts signed with different suppliers of the Bank may be reduced to a small number of pages only, and already in 2014, the Bank began the process of reducing the contents length of contracts; Proper disclosure presentation on a touch screen the bank is obligated to publish daily proper disclosure in each of its branches. In order to improve efficiency of the process and save paper, touch screens are to be installed (in 2017) on all the bank's branches, on which the proper disclosure would be presented as well as other relevant information. The information would be updated on a concerted basis by the relevant factor in the bank's management; Green Discount for the Environment Computerized committee management system in 2015 the bank has purchased portable computers and tablets for the purpose of improving the efficiency of committee work, avoiding the need to print the documents required for the work of the different committees. Furthermore, additional actions are planned for the coming years, which are expected to lead to a significant reduction in the consumption of paper, part of which being introduced already in 2016: Reducing the use of postal services in 2016 the Bank began to extend the use of electronic mail instead of the printing of documents and mailing them in envelops by means of the Israeli postal services; Reducing the number of loan documents in the course of 2016 the Bank began reducing the number of documents required for the granting of a loan to costumers; Computerized interfaces with credit card and insurance companies the bank is establishing digital interfaces with credit card companies to allow the electronic delivery of payment orders and other forms. In addition the bank contacted various insurance companies in order to allow the digital recipient of documents; The Bank is preparing for work by means of digital scanning that would result in savings in the usage of paper; The Bank is preparing for the process on several plains: finishing form barcodes, reducing the period of time for the keeping of documents in archives, transfer of part of the documents to the computer system, the digital signing of documents and improving the scanning quality. This move would lead to the optimization of the scanning process and the archiving of documents, including improved scanning efficiency, application of digital signature and a review of the length of period for the keeping of documents in archives. ICC ICC Mail ICC started in 2015 a move for the reduction in the quantity of paper used in its operations, and has offered customers the option of receiving their monthly statements of account by electronic mail instead of by regular mail. In this framework, the number of customers joining this service has significantly grown since 2015, and the matter is placed in an organizational focus; Online forms customers asking for the issue of credit cards or for loans may now do so via the Internet and fill the online forms; Paperless archive the archiving of documents is made digitally; Green Discount for the Environment Reduction in the quantity of paper used for internal purposes the two-sided printing of documents has been defined as the default option and company employees are required to use their personal employee cards for printing purposes. Moreover, documents that have not been printed by employees are being deleted from the memory of printers after sixteen hours. Change in 2015 2014 %1 Consumption 2015 of paper (in compared Tons) Absolute Relative to employees Absolute Relative to employees to 2014 Discount Bank 201 0.036 380.8 0.068 (47.2) MDB 196.8 0.123 229.6 0.141 (14.3) Notes: 1) The percentage change is computed on the absolute amount. 2) The quantity of paper waste sent for recycling was reported in prior years. 3) Paper consumption data of MDB has been computed on the basis of the number of paper packages purchased and the average weight of a package. The annual average paper consumption of ICC amounts to 16.45 tons. This following several focused actions taken in 2011 to reduce the consumption of paper by the company. Since that year and over the following years, the consumption of paper by the company remained stable. ICC does not make use of recycled paper. In the light of the efficiency measures taken by the Bank in recent years, it may be seen that the consumption of paper has been significantly reduced. At the same time, the quantity of paper waste sent for recycling has increased (744 tons in 2015, 610 tons in 2014 and 485 tons in 2013), which stems from the shutting down of branches, the scanning of documents and the reduction in archives. Use of recycled materials The Bank makes extensive use of toner cartridges. Most of this consumption is based on refurbished toner cartridges, as detailed below. The purchase of new toner cartridges is marginal, being approx. 100 units per year. Change in %1 Consumption of refurbished toner cartridges 2015 compared 2014 compared (in Units) 2015 2014 2013 to 2014 to 2013 Discount Bank 18,000 18,209 16,500 (1.1) 10.4 MDB 1,334 4,630 4,230 (71.2) (9.5) Green Discount for the Environment The reduction in consumption of renewed ink cartridges stems from the increased purchases of new (original) ink cartridges, which have a longer life expectancy, and therefore the overall consumption of ink cartridges by the Bank is smaller over a period of time. About 25% of the ink cartridges purchased in 2015 by Discount Bank were new cartridges. Use of recycled paper is in immaterial quantities. Additional activities Promoting green building Examining environmental effects also at the Bank's buildings environmental effects are being examined also as a basis for making decisions in matters of construction and assets. This in the framework of moves described hereunder. Integration of green criteria in construction in branches and Head Office buildings as part of the process of choosing and planning of buildings, in engineering and the choice of materials (see above Energetic Efficiency ). Environmental control measurement and monitoring of radiation at Discount Bank and at ICC. Furthermore, current monitoring of the work environment is conducted at ICC, including presence surveys and radiation surveys performed by external independent companies. Promoting green building at the present time, the Bank has one building complying with Standard 5281 for green construction of the Israel Standards Institute. The building is located at 17, Yehuda Halevi Street in Tel Aviv, and has been awarded the Green Label certificate of the Israel Standards Institute. The Bank has acted towards obtaining a Green Label certificate also for the Bank's building at 41 Yehuda Halevi Street. The building has been constructed according to the green building principles, which include the use of natural lighting, energy saving air-conditioning system, use of building materials having a green standard stamp, providing a bicycle parking facility as well as shower stalls for the riders. Green Discount for the Environment Plans for the future. Establishment of the Discount Campus in June 2016, the Group purchased a plot of land of twenty-one dunnums in Rishon Le`Tzion. The Group plans to construct on the site a campus to which will be moved different units of Discount Bank, MDB and ICC, including the computer installations. Construction of the project and the transfer of the various units shall be made in stages. Green building considerations would be taken into consideration in the construction of the Discount Campus, such as: ventilation, optimal use of natural lighting and more. Additional activities In addition to that stated above, several additional activities were held, such as: Upgrade of air-conditioning systems and transition to VRF systems All renovation and construction of branch premises performed in 2015, included the replacement of the air-conditioning systems with advanced energy saving systems. Recycling in addition to the paper sent for recycling, the Bank recycles additional waste, such as electric bulbs, bottles, batteries and electronic waste. The waste sent for recycling in 2015 included 9,600 electric bulbs, about 74,800 beverage bottles, 5,700 batteries and 9,927 tons of electronic waste. Additional actions reduction in the floor space of archives following scanning operations and the use of such space for work station purposes, and the repeated use of furniture following the renovation of branch premises. ICC Extending the validity of part of the credit cards issued for five years this move will contribute in the long run to the reduction in the company's consumption of plastics; Recycling of plastics once a year, the company shreds old plastic cards. These are sent for recycling and used as raw material; Responsible removal of batteries serving uninterruptible power supply such empty batteries are being removed once a quarter and sent to the Ramat Hovav hazardous waste disposal facility; The green scrapping of computers, servers and storage equipment Electronic waste, such as computers is sent for recycling to Ecommunity company Ecology for protected community. Green Discount for the Environment Communication of the subject and employee instruction The Bank promotes the environmental issue through two principal moves: An environmental organizational portal use of the internal Intranet site for employees in the matter, where information/ activity in this respect is being published. The site serves also as an address for employee questions and approaches in the matter. Additionally, in all the offices and conference rooms, stickers were affixed to the switches, reminding to shut off the lights at the end of the workday. Likewise, all of the cafeterias have hung banners calling for saving resources and encouraging employees to make use of the recycling bins placed at the cafeterias. Management of environmental risks In the Supervisor of Banks' guidelines regarding the exposure to environmental risks and their management, various possible aspects regarding the exposure of banking corporations to environmental risks are detailed and the need to relate to these risks individually is emphasized. Environmental risk may derive from an impairment of collaterals when realized. Furthermore, the risk might be realized in an indirect manner as a result of deterioration in the financial condition of another party due to environmental costs resulting from regulations regarding environmental protection. Damage to reputation may also be recognized as part of environmental risk, as a result of the possibility that relation to an environmental hazard might be attributed to the banking corporation. Training sessions have been performed by outside experts, as part of the process of absorption of environmental risk management for the business factors. Risk deriving from climate changes The main climate change risks to which the Bank is exposed, may result from factors affecting the Bank's operations (for example: changes in physical conditions or changes in regulation) or from Bank customer activities (mostly in the financing area). Physical changes are being managed at two levels firstly, as part of the Bank's business continuity plan, which examines and estimates the probability and severity of potential risks which might affect the essential operations of the Bank, including extreme events, such as extensive flooding caused by heavy rain. The evaluation of Green Discount for the Environment risks is continuing by updating Bank's response plans to their possible materialization. Furthermore, the Bank is prepared for operation under difficult weather conditions, such as heavy snow in Jerusalem or a storm that might affect the Discount Tower. Such risks and the updating of assessments, respectively, are performed on a current basis. Risks deriving from the Bank's customer operations are managed within the framework of credit risk management. At the same time, the Bank has identified the opportunity inherent in the financing of the solar energy field and has put an emphasis on enlarging the credit to this area (see below). Credit Policy regarding Environmental Risks In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the global awareness of ecological and social damage caused as a bi-product of the development of projects, mainly in the industrial, real estate and infrastructure sectors. As a result of the increased awareness of various environmental matters, some of the companies engaged in these sectors have begun to consider environmental criteria in their feasibility studies. As a result of increased awareness, widening legislation on the subject and claims by those who had suffered damage which were admitted by courts around the world, a part of the companies engaged in these areas began taking into account environmental criteria in considering the profitability of projects. Legislation in this field has widened also in Israel, though it is not yet wide-ranging compared to Europe and the U.S.. Banking corporations may be exposed to environmental risks in the various aspects of their operation, and such risks may be included with other risks, such as: credit risk, market risk, operational risk, legal risk and liquidity risk. The Bank's policy as regards environmental risks relating to credit is focused on the identification of the risks, evaluation thereof and reporting it to the decision makers, as well as conducting a continuous monitoring of borrowers having a high environmental risk potential. The aim of this policy is to identify borrowers having a high risk potential, and making specific decisions with respect to cases where the risk is viewed as material (having a high probability of materialization and when in potential materialization the credit loss may be material). In this framework, the Bank has defined an evaluation process with respect to the Green Discount for the Environment level of environmental risk and of the quality of risk management regarding business customers upon the granting of credit and upon performing the periodic evaluation of customer quality, with special reference to customers having a high environmental risk potential. The monitoring of the credit risk exposed to significant environmental risks is performed on an ongoing basis during the year. For further details regarding the risk management at the Discount Group, see the 2015 Annual Report (pp. 84-127) and in the document Disclosure according to the third pillar of Basel and additional information regarding risks for 2015. Granting green credit (green businesses) As part of the overall process of environmental quality risk management, the bank offers credit to green businesses, everything subject to adherence to the credit granting rules in effect at the Bank, including the examination of the repayment ability of the borrower. Green credit credit granted for: Financing the operations of a company producing green products contributing to the protection of the quality of the environment; Credit to a company that has a green production process protecting the quality of the environment; Credit granted for the establishment of a green operation, including the purchase of green equipment (machinery); upgrading of production systems of those protecting the quality of the environment. Following is a list of green areas determined preferential as regards financing: Banking services on the Internet the granting of benefits to customers using the Internet banking services also as part of the environmental risk management concept. These customers do not visit the Bank branches using air-polluting vehicles, thus reducing air pollution; Companies developing green products companies manufacturing products having environmental added value, such as cleantech companies; Installation of solar energy systems installation of solar energy systems both for commercial and private purposes; Purchase of green vehicles credit for the purchase of hybrid/electric vehicles; Companies rated highly by the Ministry of Environmental Protection. The area of activity, which became relatively significant from among the above mentioned areas, is credit financing the installation of solar energy systems, as detailed below. Green Discount for the Environment Financing in the solar energy field The sub-sector of photovoltaic installations (PV) is a part of the renewable solar energy field. This field began to develop in Israel in recent years, and is based on Regulations under the Electricity Market Act, designed to regularize the establishment of electricity production installations using solar and wind energies. The method chosen by the Regulators to provide incentives for renewable energies in Israel is the feeding pricelist , according to which, the owner of the installation sells the electricity produced by him to the Israel Electric Corporation at a predetermined price. The feeding pricelist is based on an analysis of the costs involved in the construction and operation of an installation operating by use of photovoltaic technology and which is intended to allow the entrepreneur an appropriate return on his investment over the life of the installation. In many cases, the regulation includes an outline of amortization following identification of technological developments and a decrease in the cost of the installations. The feeding pricelist is secured for entrepreneurs who will construct installations supplying electricity up to the total agreed quota. The Government of Israel publishes in recent years supply quotas for the construction of small installations (up to 50 kilowatts), medium installations (over 50 kilowatts) and large installations (over 12 MW). The said method has created a basic infrastructure for the granting of bank credit to this industry. The Bank has a specific policy for the granting of credit to the solar energy systems field, both to business and private consumers. Among other matters the processes for granting credit, controls and specific collateral for this field are arranged within the framework of the policy. The Bank's total credit exposure in respect of financing solar energy projects (photovoltaic and thermo-solar) amounted as of December 31, 2015, to NIS 1,067 million, compared with NIS 1,168 million on December 31, 2014. The reduction stems from the gradual repayment of loans granted in prior years. Mercantile Discount Bank. The credit balance in this field is negligible.
