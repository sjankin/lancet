We faced unprecedented challenges, precipitated by regulatory, macro-economic, political and competitive forces in our two largest markets, and to varying degrees across our portfolio. With deeper senior management capacity and skills in place, including the appointment of a Group CEO, the board conducted a deep and fundamental strategic review of the business and its processes. The review illuminated a number of issues in need of attention and affirmed the Group’s unique strategic advantages on which we can continue to build a sustainable business for the future. This precipitated our business transformation initiative, IGNITE, which sets out a clear roadmap for the next 18 months. There is still much to be done to transform the Group and position it for the future, but also much to look forward to for the people and stakeholders of MTN. I confirm that MTN Group Limited continues to support of the Ten Principles of the UNGC in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In our 2016 annual Communication of Progress we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Phuthuma Nhleko Chairman of the Board/ Acting Group President and CEO MTN Group Limited MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress 5 Scope of the COP Materiality and stakeholder inclusiveness As Global Compact signatory, MTN recognizes that the ten principles within the four issues areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption are material to the organisation and that these reflect significant economic, social and environmental impacts. We also recognize that the decisions and assessments of our stakeholders are being influenced by the process and results of MTN’s integration of the ten principles into our operations and strategies. This report marks the fourth year of our UNGC Communication of Progress reporting, and provides more detailed information to our stakeholders regarding our actions to support the Ten Principles of the UNGC in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In our 2016 annual Communication of Progress we describe our actions to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy and operations. The MTN Group communication of progress covers operations in Afghanistan, Benin, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Cyprus, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea-Conakry, Ghana, Iran, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Sudan, South Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zambia, as well as MTN Enterprise operations in Kenya and Namibia. Determining material issues Material issues refer to matters that have an impact on our ability to remain commercially viable and socially relevant to our stakeholders. The material issues important to MTN’s sustainability are determined by reviewing the issues most important to our stakeholders, and the impact of these issues on the achievement of our business objectives. Material issues are prioritised according to the scale and nature of impact on business operations, economic performance and interests of our stakeholder groups. To determine the issues most material to MTN’s sustainability, the following sources are considered: • Feedback from all stakeholders that review the annual reports. S R Sustainability Report • Engagement with all stakeholders through the email addresses sustainability@mtn.co.za and investor.relations@mtn.co.za. • Information gained through engagements with regulatory authorities, media organisations, civil society and community-based organisations, our customers, and general members of the public. • Feedback from engagements with the JSE SRI, the CDP, MTN’s investors and financial analysts, and research organisations that consult us or assess our responsible business performance. • Information from third-party questionnaires and assessments of our publicly reported performance by university organisations and other third parties not commissioned by MTN. • Feedback from internal review and research processes including industry, peer and global developments, and risk and audit management processes. 6 UNGC Communication of Progress for the year ended 31 December 2016 Issues identified through this process are assessed during internal materiality reviews. These issues are reviewed by the executive, the Group Social and Ethics Committee and the Group Board. This review is undertaken periodically to ensure that we are responsive and can adapt to changing operating conditions. Our material issues of focus for 2016 are set out below: MTN Group Limited UNGC Communication of Progress 7 Sustainability context Despite global uncertainty and the challenges faced by MTN, we are optimistic about enabling sustainable growth. By focusing on the organisational, system and process requirements needed to meet our strategic objectives, we have enhanced our ability to bring the benefits of the digital economy to our markets. Both MTN and our stakeholders have realised some of these benefits through ICT-enabled solutions that generate commissions, connect people, improve economic participation and enable social development. Cross-sectoral partnerships, catalysing local innovation and offering mobile technology solutions that address some of the service access and affordability constraints in our markets help us create shared societal value. MTN improving sustainability in its markets in 2016 MTN’s role in improving sustainability in its markets in 2016 saw us continuing to implement changes to our operating model in order to align ourselves with the growing demand for digital services and solutions in our markets. Our e-commerce partnerships are enabling our customers to enjoy access to products previously only available in more developed countries. Partnering with tower management companies, we are better able to focus on core business delivery. This also helps us and other mobile operators to reduce some of our environmental impact. By investing in the development of local content in our markets, we actively encourage mobile application developers of all ages to develop solutions that can potentially help people participate in economic opportunities and overcome constraints such as lack of access to information, health and education services, among others. Challenges MTN faced in 2016 The challenges MTN faced in 2016 were narrowed down to those which impacted our top nine operations, ultimately affecting the Group: • Challenging economic conditions • Increased competition and disruption of traditional telecoms business • Tough political environments and greater regulatory and compliance requirements • Easing of sanctions in Iran • Inconsistent execution of Group strategy and implementation of regulatory compliance and governance policies by operations Actions taken to integrate sustainability into its core business activities in 2016 We continued to integrate sustainable business practices into our day-to-day activities. Institutionalisation of the Group’s ethics management framework remained a priority. We are actively working to strengthen the culture of ethical and responsible practices across our business. We continued to add sustainable economic value in the following ways: • We offer mobile financial services, health, education and other digital products that help narrow the digital divide between our markets and other, more developed markets. • MTN’s mobile money services have evolved from basic transfers and micro-payment services to savings and loan products. • We actively encourage the development of digital solutions that meet the specific needs of our markets, ensuring we create shared value with the communities in which we operate. 8 UNGC Communication of Progress for the year ended 31 December 2016 We further met our eco-responsibility imperatives by: • Developing IoT-based solutions to reduce negative environmental impacts. • As we outsource our network sites, we encourage our tower management partner companies to improve energy efficiency and help MTN manage Scope 3 GHG emissions. • Continuing to make good progress in reducing our use of paper, water and other resources and are improving our waste management practices. We contributed to sustainable societies by: • Enhancing our ethics management programme across the Company through training, communications and ensuring the availability of additional certified ethics officers. • Making some progress towards achieving our digital human rights management objectives. • Introducing progressive employee wellness solutions including flexible work policies, greater access to health services and workplace-based day-care services for employees’ children were implemented in some operations. MTN’s sustainability focus for 2016 In 2016 we hope to continue to enable digital dividends for our stakeholders by harnessing the spirit of innovation and collaboratively developing solutions to opportunities and real-life challenges in our markets. We will continue to value good governance within MTN, and are committed to continue to implement the Fourth King Code of Corporate Governance, the United Nations Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 4) and Global Compact, carbon and climate impact reporting and the principles set out in the United Nations Protect, Respect and Remedy Framework. Like all businesses, we face challenges from time to time, yet we are not deterred in our sustainability journey. As a major ICT player in emerging markets, we are acutely aware that our resources can make a meaningful difference to the lives of our customers and communities.
