Report on activities supporting the UN “Global Compact” initiative and Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) carried out within the framework of the “Approved Partner” Programme in 2016 Introduction The Mission of the Approved Partner Program is to promote reliability and responsibility as significant values in the creation and functioning of civil society, as well as strengthening trust and positive relations between business, science and administration, e.g. by implementing projects which promote good examples of reliable and effective cooperation. The “Approved Partner in the Local Community” project, conducted as part of the program, with the cooperation of local and government administration, as well as local trade unions, is just one example of that kind of actions. Actions pursued by local governments and local organizations, which are worth following, are awarded and promoted. Their main goal is to achieve sustainable communities, friendly for their residents, and to encourage initiatives in the local community and build positive relations between local governments and businesses. Various organizations and institutions which pursue and support initiatives promoting such actions are also awarded. As shown in many studies, lack of trust forms a significant barrier for business growth and for developing more effective ways of cooperation between business, science and administration. Such cooperation is particularly important in the EU’s new financial perspective and for the growth of innovation, which is one of the priorities of Poland’s long-term development strategy aimed at increasing competitiveness of the Polish economy. The main objectives of the Programme also include dissemination of economic, legal and other knowledge about the economic market and modern methods of corporate management, paying special attention to the standards observed and followed in the European Union. The “Approved Partner” Programme is the initiative of the Reliable Business Association and the European Education and Consulting Centre (until end of 2004 Business Promotion Centre) introduced in 1995 in Wielkopolska. At the time it was the only programme of this type in Poland. It is important to add that The Delegation of the European Commission in Poland and The President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) extended honorary patronage to the Programme. A multi-step company verification system combined with ongoing monitoring of company reliability are among the main values of the new version of the Programme implemented in 1999, which makes it distinct among other similar 2 initiatives. The verification procedures are systematic based on verification requests submitted by companies and the documents, which are assessed in line with the principles stipulated in the Programme regulations. The assessment checks how reliably a company conducts its business, whether it pays its liabilities on time, whether it is solvent, whether it observes legal and administrative regulations and the principles of fair competition, whether the methods used internally and externally are friendly, what the quality of its goods and services is, how involved it is in the issues of the social environment and how it cares for the natural environment. In the period under discussion systematic marketing activities connected with the Programme were carried out, including ongoing monitoring and verification of the companies participating in the Programme. The documentation defined in the Programme regulations submitted by the company was collated and prepared for analysis by the Licence Bureau of the “Approved Partner” Programme (maintained by the Centre for European Education and Consultancy) and the Verification Committee (composed of representatives of the Association) assessed the companies seeking the award or extension of the right to use the “Approved Partner” logo and honorary title in their marketing activities. Activities supporting the Global Compact initiative and Corporate Social Responsibility (CRS) Systematic support (media coverage, Internet, e-marketing campaigns and dissemination of information at conferences and meetings) was continued in 2016. It aimed to popularize knowledge and help in the implementation of the UN Global Compact initiative and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): January – December 2016 promotional campaign in cooperation with specialized agencies, including mail shots with information about the “Approved Partner” Programme, Global Compact, CSR and solidnypartner.pl website and sent to Polish companies, accompanied by a telemarketing campaigns. – modernization of “Approved Partner” programme website (solidnypartner.pl) and solidnypartner.eu business portal. Both pages promote laureates of the „Approved Partner” programme and other companies offering top quality goods and services. There was also website (czytelniabiznesowa.solidnypartner.eu) expanded that connects with abovementioned initiatives. One of the main aims of the programme and described webpages is creation of the “zone of greater safety in business”, which is a value particularly important for prospective customers during the “crisis of confidence”. In 2016 Michał Wieczorek, the “Approved Partner” Program Coordinator (which is currently celebrating its 21th anniversary), took part in many conferences and meetings related to sustainability and the increased role of innovation. 12 October 2016, during the “POL-ECO-SYSTEM” International Trade Fair of Technologies and Products for Sustainable Development and Municipal Services, organized by the Poznań 2 International Fair (a longstanding strategic partner of the “Approved Partner” Program) under the auspices of the Ministry of the Environment, representative of the board of the Poznań International Fair and the Coordinator of the “Approved Partner” Program presented special diplomas “Approved Partner of Local Communities”. Initiatives and good practices of local governments and local government organizations aimed at sustainable development of communities (friendly for their residents) were also awarded, among them initiatives, which encourage civic activity in local communities and which build positive relations between local governments and business. The awards were presented to: Investors’ Assistance Center of the Marshal Office of the Westpomeranian Region (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Westpomeranian Region) The City of Grodzisk Mazowiecki (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship) The City of Wałbrzych (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Lower Silesia Region) The County District Office in Krapkowice (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Opole Voivodeship) The County District Office in Przasnysz (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship) The County District Office in Szczecinek (recommendation of the Marshal Office of the Westpomeranian Region) The ceremony was broadcast online via the Web City platform, which also hosted the “Good Practice Fair” held concurrently with the ”POL-ECO-SYSTEM“ trade fair (11-14.10.2016). The event presented activities undertaken by companies and local governments in local communities. A conference promoting knowledge about the availability of funds (particularly EU funds), how to apply for them and presenting practical examples of project implementation was also held on that platform. As all these events were available online, prospective participants, including trade fair visitors, had an opportunity to join them.
