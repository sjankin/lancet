Aggressive measures to offset revenue losses saw a strong emphasis on quality across all levels of the value chain. Commencing in April 2016, the quality drive was first rolled out among the estate workforce with the aim of improving leaf quality. Meanwhile, efforts to counteract initial resistance by the workforce prompted the management conducting regular pocket meetings to tackle change management issues and also stress the importance of proper plucking techniques. To complement these efforts, harvesting shears were also introduced to enable pluckers to maintain leaf quality throughout the harvesting process. However, given the added focus on quality, the yield per hectare declined by 20%, while the cost of production increased in the second quarter of the financial year, following a mandatory 11% wage hike for the estate workforce with effect from September 2016. The wage hike along with a proportionate increase in incentives led to an increase in the cost of production for the financial year, compared to the previous financial year. Phase two of the quality drive, launched at the end of the second quarter saw the roll out of new manufacturing techniques and implementation of multiple process improvements on the factory floor. A culmination of these factors helped enhance the quality of the output enabling KVPL’s Tea sector to capitalize on the market uptick in the latter part of 2016 and secure premium prices at the Colombo Tea Auctions. The strategy delivered good results, with KVPL’s sale averages being amongst the best with in upcountry plantation companies. Export volumes in the second half were lower than in the preceding six months. This had a cascading effect on the bottom line in the second half of the year, in the January to March 2017 quarter, where KVPL’s Tea sector began recording profits for the first time in 07 months. The fact the company was able to make profits despite the steep increase in the cost of production, points to a greater efficiency achieved through the quality drive, which could possibly signal an end to the woes experienced for the past two years. | KVPL’s 25 years of Excellence | 56 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Sector Reviews Contd.

Future Strategy Given the unprecedented results stemming from the quality drive, moving forward, the core strategy would be; the focus on quality. The goal is to expand the scope of the initiative to achieve the right balance between quality and quantity. At the same time the Company is also considering the possibility of developing an out grower model to meet the growing volume demands of the future. These initiatives are expected to pave the way for a sustainable model for KVPL’s Tea Sector operations in the coming years. | KVPL’s 25 years of Excellence | 57 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Financial Capital G4-9,13,22 Financial Reporting and Achievements To provide stakeholders with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the financial statements, the KVPL Group continues to adopt best practices for financial reporting and as such the timely filing of quarterly and annual financial statements remains a high priority on the reporting agenda.

Further, investments in Immature Plantations taken over by way of leases are shown in this note. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from immature to mature. The Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets at cost using LKAS 16 – Property, Plant & Equipment. Specific borrowings have not been obtained to finance the planting expenditure. Hence, borrowing costs were not capitalised during the year under Immature Plantations (2016/17 Nil).

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. The fair value of managed trees was ascertained in accordance with LKAS 41.The valuation was carried by Messer's Sunil Fernando Associates, chartered valuers, using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical verification was carried out covering all the estates. 14.2.1 Change in Fair Value of Biological Assets Consolidated Company 2016/17 2015/16 2016/17 2015/16 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Change in fair value of consumable biological assets (Note 14.2) 15,515 20,259 15,515 20,259 Change in fair value of produce on bearer biological assets (Note 17.1) 11,002 979 11,002 979 26,517 21,238 26,517 21,238 14.2.2 Information About Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Non financial asset Valuation Unobservable Range of unobservable Relationship of technique inputs inputs (probability unobservable weighted average) inputs to fair value Consumable managed DCF Discounting rate 17.5% The higher the biological assets discount rate, the lesser the fair value Optimum rotation 25-35 Years Lower the rotation (Maturity) period, the higher the fair value Volume at rotation 25-85 cu.ft The higher the volume, the higher the fair value Price per cu.ft. Rs.450/to Rs.7,000/The higher the price per cu. ft., the higher the fair value | KVPL’s 25 years of Excellence | 181 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Other key assumptions used in valuation 1. The harvesting is approved by the PMMD and Forest Department based on the forestry development plan. 2. The price adopted are net of expenditure. 3. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the cost are not taken in to consideration. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long-term exploitation of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable. Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows every investor to reasonably challenge the financial impact of the assumptions used in the LKAS 41 against his own assumptions. 14.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity variation sales price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied. Simulations made for timber show that a rise or decrease by 10% of the estimated future selling price has the following effect on the net present value of biological assets: Company Rs. '000 Rs.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. Accordingly the Group has exposure to mainly Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Market Risks from its use of financial instruments. This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. 37.1 Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk management policies. The Group financial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The KVPL Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the financial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 37.2 Credit Risk Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institution's foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 37.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings, when available and in some cases, bank references, purchases limit etc. which also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the management is considered when revisions are made to terms and conditions. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 912 m (2015/16 – Rs.541 m). KVPL has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea and Rubber auction systems. MTPL has the largest exposure to credit risk as a major portion of the trade receivables are from foreign currencies. All open account debtors are covered with export credit Insurance. Settlement of other debtors are carried through banks. | KVPL’s 25 years of Excellence | 207 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2016/17 37.2.2 Investments Credit risks from invested balance with the financial institutions are managed by the Hayles Group Treasury Department in accordance with the Group’s Policy . Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to them. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty’s failure.

Liquidy Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimising the exposure to liquidity risk through diversification of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term investment with long term financial sources and short term investment with short term financing. Where necessary, the Group consults the Treasury Department and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinising the funding decisions. | KVPL’s 25 years of Excellence | 208 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC Annual Report 2016/17 Notes to the Financial Statements Contd.
