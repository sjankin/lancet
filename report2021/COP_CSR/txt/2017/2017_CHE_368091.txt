Global Compact Communication on Progress and GRI Content Index referencing the Datwyler Sustainability Report 2016 Message from the CEO Long-term values 100 years of innovation for the benefit of our customers, employees, shareholders and the community – that is the hallmark of the Datwyler Group. Over this period, Datwyler has evolved from a family-owned Swiss company into an international group. Building on our strong roots, we have developed our own style with high standards and unique values:  We are entrepreneurs.  We bring value to our customers.  We excel in what we do.  We have respect for others. We strive to deliver sustainable profitable growth for the benefit of our stakeholders as the foundation for adding longterm value and preserving the corporate independence of the Datwyler Group. In our efforts, we are addressing the challenges of our times. As early as 2008, we voluntarily adopted the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for the sustainability section of our Annual Report, and in 2009 we joined the UN Global Compact. This is an initiative launched by the United Nations stating ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and in combating corruption. As a UN Global Compact participant, Datwyler commits to follow the ten principles and to accept its responsibility within society. This endeavour is based on the Datwyler values and the Code of Conduct that lay down globally binding rules for all Datwyler Group employees. As far as our suppliers are concerned, we have set out our requirements in a dedicated code of conduct based on the UN Global Compact since the beginning of 2014. The systematic customer and employee satisfaction surveys were continued in 2016. Since 2013, the Datwyler Group has also reported its greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In this way, we live up to our social responsibility every day as a reliable partner to our stakeholders and contribute to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
