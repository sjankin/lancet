ORIX’s overseas business has expanded in recent years due in part to acquisitions. The head office aspires to international governance standards, and major overseas subsidiaries are also strengthening their governance in each country and region. ORIX management has the will to lead toward even more stringent oversight of overseas governance and compliance. Indefinable Business to Succeed in an Uncertain Era One of ORIX’s advantages is that its business is not Ryuji Yasuda definable by orthodox industry classifications. It is a major company in insurance, banking and real estate as well as leasing and corporate finance. At the same time, it is also developing into a major player in the environment and energy business and concession business, and is also Functioning corporate involved in multiple industries through its private equity governance serves to increase investment business. corporate value.

ORIX is a sation Committee, which empowers rigorous discussion dynamic company. and a framework for adding external perspectives to the ORIX INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 31 I therefore believe that a mindset based on a specific business category will be increasingly less meaningful. CEO Makoto Inoue has astutely pointed out that “I have no idea what we will be doing in five years. And this is ORIX’s business model.” While many Japanese companies are frantically trying to avoid risk, ORIX has embraced a mindset of taking healthy risks as part of its growth process. Returns require risk, so ORIX is strong because it has embedded the will to take on challenges in its corporate DNA. ORIX may have some catching up to do in areas such as artificial intelligence and fintech, but is well positioned to demonstrate its strengths during the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I am excited to see how ORIX uses its originality in the future.

We have therefore established a sound and transparent corporate governance system. ● Corporate governance is a system for management oversight. It involves setting management objectives for managers, performance analysis and evaluation, and supervision in order to ensure that management strives to attain outstanding results. The tension inherent in corporate governance encourages management to perform to the best of its ability and facilitates innovation in pursuit of corporate objectives. Such an approach is conducive to the achievement of consistently high ROE. ● Outside Directors have a crucial role to play in corporate governance. From various perspectives reflecting their diverse professional backgrounds, Outside Directors are able to objectively evaluate management’s performance in ways that transcend the industry’s conventional wisdom and the company’s ingrained practices. Moreover, by virtue of their external perspectives, Outside Directors are in the position to objectively evaluate the risk of management not taking adequate levels of risk. Evolution of Corporate Governance In order to present itself in an accurate and transparent fashion to investors, ORIX 1964 Adopted U.S. GAAP has been applying U.S. GAAP in its financial reporting since its founding in 1964. Six years after its founding, ORIX listed its shares on the second section of the Listed on the second section of the Osaka Osaka Securities Exchange. Going public reflected the Company’s aspiration to 1970 Securities Exchange be a responsible member of society with transparency and accountability in its governance. In 1997, ORIX spearheaded the strengthening of corporate governance by estab1997 Established Advisory Board lishing an Advisory Board, a committee composed entirely of outside advisors who provide advice to management. In 1998, ORIX adopted the Corporate Executive Officer System, which separates Introduced Corporate Executive the supervisory function (Board of Directors) and business execution (Executive Officers). In the same year, ORIX listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange 1998 Officer System and listed on after considering the growing number of foreign shareholders and the benefit of the New York Stock Exchange strengthening corporate governance through the more stringent disclosure requirements of the SEC. ORIX welcomed its first outside director in 1999 and adopted the “Company with Adopted the “Company with Committees” board model* in 2003. All of the current Outside Directors meet the 2003 Committees” board model* independence criteria prescribed by the Tokyo Stock Exchange. * Adopted the new “Company with Nominating Committees, etc.” board model in line with the amendment of the Companies Act of Japan in 2015. This is how ORIX has been strengthening its management oversight since its founding. The current corporate governance framework requires a high level of discipline from the managers but we believe this is how corporate governance is supposed to be.

Financial Auditing Differences with Respect to the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards ORIX’s American Depositary Shares have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) since 1998. As an NYSE-listed company, ORIX is required to comply with certain corporate governance standards under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. However, as a foreign private issuer, ORIX is permitted to follow home country practice. Our corporate governance practices differ in certain respects from those that U.S. listed companies must adopt. A summary of these differences is as follows: ● ORIX is not required to meet the NYSE’s independence require● ORIX is not required to have the majority of its Board of ments for individuals on its Board of Directors or its Nominating, Directors comprised of Outside Directors nor is ORIX Audit and Compensation committees.

In addition, the Audit Committee consists solely of Outside Directors and five of the six members of the Nominating Committee and four of the five members of the Compensation Committee, respectively, are Outside Directors. 34 ORIX INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Board of Directors The Board of Directors carries out decisions related to items that, either as a matter of law or pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, cannot be delegated to executive officers, and important items as determined by the regulations of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors is responsible for deciding and monitoring ORIX’s policies on a regular basis, which include corporate planning such as capital management, fund procurement, hiring and recruitment strategies and internal controls. Aside from such items, the Board of Directors delegates decision-making regarding operations to representative executive officers to facilitate better efficiency and swiftness of such process. The Board of Directors also receives reports from executive officers and committees regarding the status of business operations and finances. The Board of Directors is composed of directors, including Outside Directors, that possess broad knowledge and experience. The number of directors on the board is also maintained at the level we consider to be appropriate for effective and efficient board discussion. Board of Directors Evaluation The Board of Directors conducts a survey questionnaire to all directors. The effectiveness of the Board of Directors is evaluated and analyzed and actions to improve the administration of the Board of Directors are implemented. Overview of Board of Directors Evaluation Results for FY2017.3 ● The responsibilities of supervision of company operations are sufficiently fulfilled by the directors using their various know-how and experience, and by effective directives at the meetings of the Board of Directors and respective committees, as well as through discussions of a sufficiently advanced quality. ● Since FY2010.3, ORIX has ensured effective and appropriate management oversight functions while maintaining diversity on the Board of Directors by continuously having six Outside Directors. ● Proceedings to contribute to authentic discussions are presented at meetings of the Board of Directors, so that each director can supervise and monitor operations from midto long-term perspectives. ● Discussions are sufficiently conducted using materials coordinated to facilitate further discussion at all subsequent meetings of the Board of Directors with regards to the content of comments, questions and proposals. Training of Directors Appropriate briefings by lawyers and others, including those on legal duties and responsibilities which must be observed by directors, are implemented at the time of appointment of new directors. External training bodies are also employed as the need arises. Orientations are also conducted when Outside Directors are invited. These include provision of opportunities for individual briefings from the CFO with regards to management strategy, business activities, and company financial conditions. In addition, compliance training for executives is also implemented on a regular basis during the period of an executive’s appointment. Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee Nominating Committee ● The Nominating Committee decides and produces proposals to appoint or dismiss directors, which are then submitted at the general meeting of shareholders (appointment and dismissal of directors are subject to resolution at the general meeting of shareholders). ● The Nominating Committee also deliberates on the appointment or dismissal of executive officers, although this is not required under the Companies Act of Japan. ● The Nominating Committee has determined the “Conditions for Director Independence.” ● The Nominating Committee ensures that the Board of Directors possesses the appropriate levels of and diversity in knowledge, experience, and expertise, through “Nomination Criteria for Director Candidates” for directors' appointments. “Conditions for Director Independence” and “Nomination Criteria for Director Candidates” determined by the Nominating Committee ▶▶▶ Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission http://www.orix.co.jp/grp/en/ir/library/20f/ Audit Committee ● The Audit Committee monitors the execution of the duties of the directors and executive officers and creates audit reports. The Audit Committee decides the content of proposals to appoint, dismiss or refuse the reappointment of the Company’s independent Certified Public Accountants, which are submitted to the general meeting of shareholders. Compensation Committee ● The Compensation Committee formulates the policy for determining compensation of each director and executive officer (“Policy for Determining Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers”) and also decides the specific compensation for each individual director and executive officer. ORIX INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 35 Corporate Governance at ORIX Members of Each Committee Name Position Nominating Committee Audit Committee Compensation Committee Makoto Inoue Director Kazuo Kojima Director Yuichi Nishigori Director Kiyoshi Fushitani Director Stan Koyanagi Director Hideaki Takahashi Non-Executive Director ◯ ◯ Eiko Tsujiyama Outside Director ◯ (Chairperson) ◯ Robert Feldman Outside Director ◯ ◯ (Chairperson) Takeshi Niinami Outside Director ◯ ◯ Nobuaki Usui Outside Director ◯ (Chairperson) ◯ Ryuji Yasuda Outside Director ◯ ◯ ◯ Heizo Takenaka Outside Director ◯ ◯ Board of Directors and Committee Meetings in FY2017.3 Number of Meetings Attendance Rate Board of Directors 8 98% Nominating Committee 3 94% Audit Committee 8 100% Compensation Committee 3 93% Compensation for Directors and Executive Officers The Compensation Committee believes that in order to accomplish ORIX’s business objectives, directors and executive officers should place importance on not only performance during the current fiscal year, but also on mediumand long-term results. The fundamental policy is to ensure that compensation is designed in a way that provides effective incentives to directors and executive officers. Based on this principle, the Committee then establishes specific policies for each director and executive officer in accordance with his/her respective role. Compensation Policy for Directors ● The compensation consists of fixed compensation and share-based compensation.* ● Fixed compensation is, in principle, a certain amount that is added to the compensation of the chairperson and member of each committee. ● Share-based compensation is calculated based on the number of points earned and accumulated by the individual while in office until retirement. It is eventually granted to the individual in the form of ORIX shares upon retirement. This compensation is intended to align mediumto long-term results of the Company with the individual’s performance. Compensation Policy for Executive Officers (including those who concurrently serve as Directors) ● The compensation consists of fixed compensation, performance-linked compensation and share-based compensation.* ● Fixed compensation is decided based on the standardized base amount for each position followed by an adjustment in accordance with each position’s respective role and responsibility. ● Performance-linked compensation consists of two components of equal weighting. The first component is derived from the standardized base amount for each position that starts from 50% followed by adjustment within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of the consolidated net income target for the current fiscal year as a performance indicator. The second component is derived the same way as the first component, except with the subsequent adjustment within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of his/her division(s)’ performance target for the current fiscal year. Furthermore, in the case of representative executive officers, his/her performance-linked compensation is entirely based on a standardized base amount that is adjusted within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of the consolidated net income target for the current fiscal year as a performance indicator. ● Share-based compensation is calculated based on the number of points earned and accumulated by the individual while in office until retirement. It is eventually granted to the individual in the form of ORIX shares upon retirement. The points granted each year are derived from the standardized number of points where 50% of which is adjusted within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of the consolidated net income target for the current fiscal year as a performance indicator, and the other 50% of which is adjusted within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of his/her division(s)’ performance target for the current fiscal year. Furthermore, in the case of representative executive officers, his/her share-based compensation is entirely based on a standardized number of points that is adjusted within the range of 0% to 200% based on the attainment level of the consolidated net income target for the current fiscal year as a performance indicator. This compensation aims to align with mediumto long-term result of the company to the individual’s performance. * “Share-based compensation” is a program in which points are annually allocated to directors and executive officers based upon prescribed standards while in office, and the actual number of ORIX’ shares calculated based on the number of accumulated points is provided at the time of retirement. Points granted to the members of each position are determined based on the guidelines set by the Compensation Committee. 36 ORIX INTEGRATED REPORT 2017 Compensation of Directors, Executive Officers and Group Executives (FY2017.3) Fixed Compensation Performance-linked Compensation Share-based Compensation Total Number of Amount Paid Number of Amount Paid Number of Amount Paid Amount Paid Recipients (Millions of yen) Recipients (Millions of yen) Recipients (Millions of yen) (Millions of yen) Directors 8 106 — — 8 16 122 (Outside Directors) (6) (67) — — (6) (13) (81) Executive Officers 28 765 28 368 28 499 1,632 and Group Executives Total 36 871 28 368 36 515 1,755 Notes: 1.

Specifically, we create fulfilling workplaces by establishing a working environment that respects diverse work styles and embraces contemporary social conventions, and by reforming our human resource system. Moreover, we are enhancing training to offer opportunities for employees who embrace challenges and enable employees to excel internationally.

We also help women to excel and have been actively recruiting women since 1982, well before the Equal Employment Opportunity Act for Men and Women was passed in 1986. In line with the Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace enacted in 2016, ORIX has formulated its Action Plan for Promoting Female Employee Participation as described below. ORIX Corporation’s Action Plan for Promoting Female Employee Participation Target Increase the percentage of female employees in managerial positions by 5 points (compared with 2015) to 18% by 2020 ● Hire a certain number of female employees Main initiatives ● Establish career plans that nurture female manager candidates and provide seminars and workshops for young female employees ● Implement programs and training to nurture female executive candidates who will be responsible for the next generation Improving Work-Life Balance ORIX wants optimum workplaces in which all employees are empowered to fully demonstrate their individual capabilities. We therefore support flexible work styles so that men and women can excel long term. ● Promoting Work Style Reform We launched our Work Style Reform Project in October 2016 under the direct control of the CEO. The goals of the project were to create a workplace that empowers diverse people to excel by improving productivity, and to engender a culture that accepts various work styles. Under the project, we set up a committee of about 100 front-line employees from 10 major Group companies, which considered issues and measures over a six-month period, and proposed about 80 measures to the CEO. We have been promoting reforms to realize these proposals since April 2017.

A U.S. holder of the shares or ADSs of the Company is therefore subject to special rules generally intended to eliminate any benefits from the deferral of U.S. federal income tax that a holder could derive from investing in a foreign corporation that does not distribute all of its earnings on a current basis. Investors should consult their tax advisors with respect to such rules, which are summarized under “UNITED STATES TA X ATION” in the Company’s Form 20-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Presentation of Financial Information The Company’s fiscal year ends on March 31. The fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, is referred to throughout this Integrated Report as “FY2017.3” and other fiscal years are referred to in a corresponding manner.

Such statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
