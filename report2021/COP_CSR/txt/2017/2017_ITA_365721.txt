It is a year that saw two events of great importance for the Group: the approval of a Business Plan for the period 20162019/2020 and the start of the adoption of a single operating unit – the “Single Bank” – in accordance with the Business Plan, with the merger of two network banks (Banca Regionale Europea and Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria) into UBI Banca. The creation of a Single Bank responds to the needs to simplify operating processes in order to achieve greater operational efficiency and effectiveness through the rationalisation of corporate governance, of central units and of geographical market coverage. The relationship between the bank and its customers is also simplified and improved with greater use of digital processes, to provide a banking experience that is constantly accessible through all the available channels. By rationalising branches, we intend to free up human resources to work on more specialist activities, while maintaining our roots in communities that have always distinguished the success of our bank. Multichannel access allows us to add new value to our local presence by means of “digital” customer relationships with particularly effective procedures that simplify the lives of our customers and add value to their time. Physical proximity nevertheless remains strategic and it is guaranteed by the commercial distribution networks of the five Macro Areas and the 36 Local Departments, with a substantial presence even in small towns (almost one quarter of branches) and in depressed areas of the country (17.6% of branches). The Business Plan has important operating, financial and capital goals, especially in terms of capital strength. This is the first aspect of “Fare Banca Per Bene” (to bank fairly and well), which we have always done. To do this means first of all to bank with sound and prudent management. And then to bank fairly and well is to be a bank that follows rules of conduct based on respect for customers and for all our stakeholders. Then last, but not least, it is to be a bank that is attentive to the common good as the ultimate goal also of the economic activities by which communities live. This orientation can be clearly seen in the priorities described in this Sustainability Report. The first of these include the issues of integrity, risk management and the creation of value in the long-term for shareholders and for all our stakeholders. These are issues closely linked to the promotion of the principles of the United Nations’ Global Compact on human rights, labour, the environment and the fight against corruption which the Bank has signed up to and is committed to sharing, supporting and applying in its sphere of influence. This report is bursting with data. Some of this testifies to levels of excellence, such as in customer satisfaction scores (94% of customers are satisfied) or in personnel management for which our policies have received the award of “Top Employer” certification for the third consecutive year. Here we are thinking for example of gender diversity and equal opportunities indicators (the female component of employees now accounts for over 39% and more than half of new recruits), of training indicators for career growth and to keep staff continuously up-to-date (over 89,000 training days for more than 96% of employees) and of company welfare with a remarkable package of supplementary benefits and initiatives to reconcile private and working life, which also include smart working. Other data describes our role as a bank at the service of the real economy in communities (almost three quarters of balance sheet assets are used to finance consumption and family and business investments) with special initiatives also to facilitate the access to credit (€6.3 billion disbursed during the year on programmes for SMEs, for study and youth employment, for start-ups and female entrepreneurship) and to support families and businesses in difficulty due to the economic crisis or to the consequences of natural disasters (repayments deferred on almost €1.5 billion of the principal on loans and mortgages to households and SMEs). And then there is also almost €14 million of donations and sponsorships for social initiatives. Still other data illustrates virtuous progress, such as the development of UBI Comunità, which has achieved a market share of 8.3% in the third sector (double the Group’s market share as a whole), the innovation with the Social 4 Future Sicav and social project finance and the figures for energy consumption and the related emissions (-5.4% and -1.9% respectively). And yet further data points to room for improvement as with the total loans granted for renewable energy or with the percentage of consumable materials purchased (paper in particular) with environmental certifications. Our present and future efforts are designed to maintain and if possible further consolidate the positive results, but above all to grasp opportunities to improve, by bringing economic, social and environmental strategies increasingly into line one with the other. The aim is to create shared values with a view to sustainability not just for our own business but for the economic environment in which we live and for its model of development. Andrea Moltrasio Letizia Brichetto Arnaboldi Moratti Chairman of the Supervisory Board 1 2016 Sustainability Report Key impacts, risks and opportunities G4-2 UBI Banca operates in a market and in a national context that contains very pervasive regulation of the bank’s governance models and of the contractual relationships with the different categories of its stakeholders. It is not considered a systemic bank, which means that if it were to become unstable it could not trigger a global financial crisis and an economic crisis at international level as a consequence. However it is considered a significant bank for the European financial system and as such it is one of those banks subject to single European supervision. With market share of 5.2% in terms of branches, 4.3% in terms of funding and 5.4% in terms of lending, its activities have a significant impact in the domestic economic context. This is especially so when it is considered that in various provinces, which include the most developed in the country, it has a market share that is twice or three times greater than its national market share, holding almost one third of the loans at sector level in the provinces of Bergamo and Brescia. And in a still difficult and unstable macroeconomic context, the ability to manage risks adequately and to grasp business opportunities at the same time, means the bank can have a positive impact on the performance of individual local areas and prevent the negative impacts that situations where sound and prudent management is not followed can have on customers and on the community in general. This applies not just in strictly economic and financial terms but also with regard to the broader issues of social inclusion and cohesion and to the prospects for local development. UBI Banca has a risk governance and management system in place which continuously carries out accurate identification of risks to be measured. In consideration of the nature and location of the activities carried out by the UBI Banca Group – primarily credit intermediation and transaction banking services within Italy – environmental risks which may have an impact on the Group’s activities are not identified.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 183-186 On the other hand, certain trends which may constitute important opportunities even in terms of strategic positioning are clearly evident when formulating commercial strategies and objectives. These include the following: the huge progress with new technologies; the development of welfare needs as a consequence of demographic changes and the retrenchment of government services; the rise of nonprofits in the economy as a new market segment with interesting dynamics from a banking viewpoint; and the emergence of new styles of consumption and production models which reward quality, social responsibility and environmental sustainability. We can find direct responses here in the Business Plan in the following: digital innovation projects [ 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 59-61]; the objectives of the new Wealth & Welfare Division [ 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 63]; the development of UBI Comunità with an increase in particular in financial support for social enterprises [ 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 57-59]; attention to customer satisfaction [ 2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 64-66]; and a new approach to businesses following an “industrial policy” by sector/supply chain, rewarding Italian excellence such as in the food and farm and tourist sectors and in the “champion” businesses of today and tomorrow. This is all done with constant attention to the quality of assets and capital strength, which in the new bail-in regulatory context can be leveraged as a distinctive feature to increase customer loyalty and attract new customers. And the updated Business Plan for the “combined entity”, resulting from the acquisition, now completed, of the three “bridge banks” resulting from the rescue of Banca Marche, Carichieti and Banca Etruria, forecasts growth in the CET1 capital ratio from 11.2% at the end of 2016 for the UBI Banca stand alone plan to around 13.5% at the end of 2020 for the new entity, mainly as a result of profits generated. The acquisition by UBI Banca of these three “Bridge Banks”, constitutes the first transaction authorised by Brussels to manage crisis situations in Italy This is also an opportunity that UBI Banca was able to grasp thanks to its capital strength, in order to growth further to reach a size that is more adequate for successful competition on the market. Strategy and analysis 2 Group profile Name of the organisation G4-3 Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A. (UBI Banca in abbreviated form) is the parent bank of the UBI Banca Group and st was formed on 1 April 2007 following the merger of Banca Lombarda e Piemontese into Banche Popolari Unite, with the consequent integration of the two groups of the same name [ G4-7]. Primary brands, products and services G4-4 The Group operates mainly in the retail banking and financial services sector, with a distribution network composed of seven locally-based brands together with the brands of the online bank and the Group’s product companies. IT activities and other support functions are managed by UBI Sistemi e Servizi, while training and professional and managerial development is carried out by UBI Academy. The local brands are those of the network banks that originally joined the Group and which were then integrated into the Parent, UBI Banca, with the “Single Bank” project launched in November 2016 with the mergers of Banca Regionale Europea and Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 10-11 Headquarters G4-5 The Company's registered office is in Bergamo and it also has operating headquarters in Bergamo and Brescia. As laid down in the Articles of Association, shareholders’ meetings are held alternately in the city or province of Bergamo and in the city or province of Brescia, while the Supervisory Board and the Management Board meet alternately in the city of Bergamo and in the city of Brescia and generally once a year in the city of Milan. Countries where significant operations are carried out or that are specifically relevant to sustainability G4-6 The UBI Banca Group operates mainly in Italy and it has a very limited number of branches in other European countries. Its presence in non-European countries consists solely of representative offices in areas of major interest for the international business projects of Italian small and medium-sized enterprises and of an asset management company located in China.

(3) Joint-venture in which UBI Banca holds 35% of the total share. 3 2016 Sustainability Report The Group operates in a total of 14 countries, which include no “tax havens” or other financial centres that do not yet comply with international tax standards as recommended by the OECD, or countries classified as at risk of money-laundering or terrorism by the lists of the International Financial Action Group and/or the Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finance. As concerns Brazil, China, India and Russia, in which the Group has representative offices, and which, according to the assessment criteria contained in the Group’s armaments policy, are classified as countries at risk with regard to respect for human rights, we do not provide any banking and financial services connected with international arms trade transactions.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 71-73 Presence in low populated or economically disadvantaged areas G4-FS13 The Group is present in all the regions of Italy, with the sole exception of Sicily, with 1,524 branches and 123 private and corporate banking units.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 9 The majority of branches are located in the more developed and richer areas of central and northern Italy, but there is also a significant presence in regions with lower growth rates, which receive subsidies from the European Union as part of the “Competition and Employment” objective programmes (268 branches accounting for 17.6% of the total). Geographical coverage also includes small towns and villages in rural or mountain areas: 23.7% of branches are in municipalities with less than 5,000 inhabitants and the Group provides the only banking facility present in 146 municipalities.

There is only one single class of ordinary shares, each of which grants the right to vote in a shareholders’ meeting. The Articles of Association also place a transitional limit on voting rights equal to 5% of the share th capital until 26 March 2017 (24 months following the entry into force of the reform law for “popular” cooperative banks). 1 The figures for shareholders are taken from dividend payment requests (May 2016). 2 The reform requires “popular” co-operative banks that exceed the threshold of €8 billion of total assets to take one of the following measures within twelve months of exceeding that limit , (18 months from the date of entry into force of the decree for “popular” banks which on that date were already authorised to carry on banking business): the reduction of assets below that limit; transformation into an ordinary joint-stock company; voluntary liquidation (Art. 29, Para. 2-ter, Consolidated Banking Act).

The Code of Ethics states that where requirements are the same, preference is given to those suppliers who demonstrate the implementation of good practices of responsibility and/or possession of social or environmental certifications. To ensure the independence of suppliers, we seek to avoid the establishment of exclusive business relationships, or those characterised by excessive financial dependence on the Group (the total amount paid to each Group supplier must not exceed 25% of the supplier’s total turnover). Suppliers who provide goods and services to the Group on a regular basis or occasional suppliers who supply goods and services for amounts greater than €30,000 are registered on a list of approved suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi. The approved list contains preferred suppliers for each type of good and service, listed on the basis of quality (50% weighting), competitiveness (25% weighting) and financial and capital soundness (25%) and we periodically assess them with the involvement of the offices requesting the supplies (budget managers), the Purchasing Department and an outside database. Suppliers of utility services (local water companies, gas companies), landlords of rented properties and institutional suppliers (e.g. Italian Banking Association and CONSOB Italian securities market authority) are excluded from management on the list of approved suppliers. At the end of 2016 suppliers on the list numbered 876 (+2 compared with 2015, as a result of 43 new suppliers and 41 removed from the list). Management of the supplier list and the vendor rating system is supported by dedicated software that interfaces with the SAP accounting system. All buyers in the Purchasing Department can use the corporate intranet to consult a supplier’s vendor rating, the class of goods sold, figures on invoicing over the last three years, the amount of orders in progress and an indicator of dependence on the Group. The Group’s Code of Ethics has a specific section on relations with suppliers which must be oriented towards mutual satisfaction and be based on the observance of the principles of transparency, fairness, loyalty, integrity and competition.  CODE OF ETHICS P. 15-16 Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodic monitoring. Supplies which are not regular or for small amounts, and considered not strategic and which do not carry a high operational risk are regulated by the general conditions of a standard contract, while specific contracts are drawn up for recurring, strategic supplies, which carry high operational risk or which are for large amounts. All suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation and regulations to protect the rights of workers, which in particular means observation of national trade union agreements for the sector to which they belong and of pension, accident prevention and insurance legislation along with specific legislation on health and safety. Additionally, when an order is placed or a contract is signed, all suppliers are required to comply with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics. Standard contract clauses provide for the power of UBI Sistemi e Servizi to verify or have verified by its agents – at any time and using the inspection procedures considered most appropriate – that the supply of goods or the provision of services is carried out and that this complies with the applicable legislation and regulations. They also provide for a commitment by the supplier to facilitate the exercise of these verification powers, by providing UBI Sistemi e Servizi with all the information required, including the documentation, written communications and/or documents needed to carry out appropriate controls. 9 2016 Sustainability Report Significant changes during the year G4-13 No significant changes occurred in 2016 in the size of the Group, in its ownership and in its supply chain. Significant changes occurred from an organisational viewpoint with the start of the process to merge the network banks into the Parent, UBI Banca, (the “Single Bank” project) and the consequent revision of UBI Banca’s organisational structure.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 32-34 Risk management approach G4-14 UBI Banca operates in a heavily regulated sector at national and European level from the viewpoint of a prudential approach to risk management. In any event it has always maintained a prudential orientation designed to maintain a high level of capital strength and control over risks including reputational risk, with a view to social responsibility and sustainability.  GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT Adherence to charters, principles and other external initiatives G4-15 UBI Banca is maintaining its commitment, first made voluntarily in 2003 by the then BPU Banca, to apply the ten universal principles of the Global Compact in favour of human rights, the protection of labour, the environment and the fight against corruption, for the construction of a global economy that is more inclusive and sustainable. In 2014 it adhered voluntarily to the Italian Responsible Payments Code promoted by Assolombarda (Lombard employers association), making a commitment to comply with terms and conditions agreed for the payment of suppliers and more generally to spread a culture of efficient, punctual and rapid payment practices. At present Group suppliers have signed contracts which involve payment terms ranging from on-receipt-of-invoice up to a maximum of 120 days from the date of invoice (a very marginal proportion accounting for 0,012% of the total). The average supplier settlement time in 2016 was approximately 32.5 days. The Bank has adopted governance and commercial processes as soon as they were issued compliant with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies since that was issued in 1999 by the Corporate Governance Committee promoted by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., and also with the recommendations of the European Code of Conduct for Home Mortgages, signed by European banking and consumer associations. Although it has not adhered to the Istituto di Autodisciplina Pubblicitaria (Italy’s advertising standards authority), it complies with the principles of the Codice di autodisciplina della Comunicazione Commerciale (code of conduct for commercial communication) drawn up by that Institute, the first edition of which dates back to 1966.

The independent auditors Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., also engaged for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBI Banca, were appointed for the period 2012-2020. The auditor carries out its activities on the basis of the principles recommended by the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000) issued by the International Assurance Standards Board (IASB) and it issues a certification of compliance with the relative guidelines declared by the Bank. 17 2016 Sustainability Report Report parameters 18 Material topics Boundary of the report G4-17 Unless specified otherwise, the boundary of the report is that of the Consolidated Financial Statements and it is consistent with the GRI-G4 guidelines. In terms of scale, it comprises 17,518 employees and associate workers, accounting for 99.5% of the Group total, and 969,919 sq m of net indoor floor space. The boundary for the data and information on the direct environmental impacts of the Group comprises the following companies: UBI Banca, UBI Sistemi e Servizi, UBI Academy, the network banks now merged into UBI Banca (Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca Popolare di Ancona, Banca Carime, Banca di Valle Camonica), IWBank, UBI Pramerica, Prestitalia, UBI Factor, UBI Leasing, UBI Fiduciaria and BPB Immobiliare. Process for the identification of material topics G4-18 The contents of the document – primarily of a non-accounting nature – have been defined by means of an analytical and structured process (an analysis of the materiality) which led to the identification in 2015 of sustainability-related topics that are material for UBI Banca and its stakeholders. The analysis was conducted in compliance with the recommendations furnished in the GRI-G4 Guidelines and it consisted of the following steps: 1. identification of potentially relevant sustainability-related topics by considering a variety of sources e.g. the GRI-G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, Financial Services Sector Disclosures, other banking Group benchmarks, an analysis of topics assessed by SRI analysts and rating agencies; 2. assessment of the materiality of each topic for the Bank, on the basis of stakeholder priorities and business strategies, carried out (in a forward-looking manner) by the senior management of UBI Banca and by the CSR liaison officer network [ GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT]; 3. estimation of the materiality of each topic for stakeholders, weighted with the materiality attributed to them, on the basis of the results of customer satisfaction surveys and other stakeholder engagement activities carried out and SRI analyst and rating agency assessments (including the annual report of the Carbon Disclosure Project on environmental matters); 4. identification of the materiality threshold (the average of the materiality assessments described in the two previous items) and therefore of the genuinely material sustainability-related topics. The topics are grouped into strategic planning areas, represented graphically in the Materiality Matrix. A section of the Sustainability Report is devoted to each area identified in the Materiality Matrix [ G4-45]. Materiality Matrix G4-19 Integrity in corporate conduct High Governance and risk management Creation of value Involvement in local communities Quality and customer satisfaction Operations rooted in local Importance for Stakeholder communities Enhancement and wellReduction in direct environmental impacts being of personnel Business lines with environmental and social aims Legend Economic and governance area Business Relations with human resources Low Other material topic Low Importance for UBI High 19 2016 Sustainability Report The Materiality Matrix was not revised in 2016. Nevertheless, on the basis, amongst other things, of reporting experience acquired with the first application of the matrix, some changes were made in the hierarchical tree structure of the relevant topics and the related aspects. More specifically, the topic “Communication and dialogue” has been incorporated in the topic “Governance and risk management”.

Significant changes in the scope and topic boundaries G4-23 No changes occurred during the reporting year in the Group’s structure and activities which might affect the general comparability of the information content of the 2016 Sustainability Report with that of previous years. Any reasons which might make the historical data series for single indicators non-comparable are given in the respective tables and charts. Material topics 20 Governance and risk management UBI Banca’s governance is based on full compliance with the regulatory framework in force and the voluntary codes of conduct adopted and also its corporate values and the principles of its Code of Ethics. Its priority is to maintain its capital strength, as an indispensable condition for the creation of sustainable value, and to control risks of all types, pursued by seeking the best mix between the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. Structure and composition of the governing bodies UBI Banca has adopted organisational and corporate governance solutions which make a clear distinction between roles, with an appropriate balance of powers and separation of duties, and also a balanced composition of bodies, effective controls, management of all corporate risks and adequate reporting. The organisation of UBI Banca and the Group is subject to constant review, to take account of changes in the environment and requirements over time to achieve the best configuration in terms of streamlining and operational efficiency and adequate management of all components of risk and market opportunities. G4-34 UBI Banca has adopted a two tier governance system consisting of a Supervisory Board and a Management Board. A Shareholders’ Meeting appoints the Supervisory Board, which then appoints a Management Board. The Supervisory Board performs the duties of strategic policy-making and supervision (including control of performance) of the management of the Bank. The Management Board has exclusive responsibility for the management of the Bank and for performing all those operations necessary to implement the objects of the Bank in compliance with the general strategies and plans drawn up by the Supervisory Board. Committees have been created within the Supervisory Board which oversee specific issues. These include an Appointments Committee, which oversees the update of corporate governance rules and principles of conduct adopted by the Parent and its subsidiaries, also with regard to developments on the matter at national and transnational level, and it assesses the adequacy of the commitment made to corporate social responsibility issues.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 7-8, 15-29, 44-51 G4-35 The Register of Powers defines responsibilities delegated by the Supervisory Board at different organisational levels on the basis of the organisation chart. The General Corporate Regulations define missions and responsibilities in relation to each aspect of management for every organisational unit. G4-36 Ethical, social and environmental aspects of operations are co-ordinated by the CSR Manager, who is responsible for the Corporate Social Responsibility Function formed as part of the Financial Reporting, Accounting Principles and Controls Service. This service reports to the Chief Financial Officer, who is on the staff of the Chief Executive Officer. Specific responsibilities are delegated to the following: • the Welfare and Mobility Manager, in the Human Resources Area under the Chief Operating Officer, who is responsible for optimising systematic travel by employees and for the conception and co-ordination of action to improve the quality of life of persons inside and outside the Bank, from the viewpoint of both organisational well-being and personal well-being, offering concrete opportunities in terms of services and benefits; • the Health and Safety Manager, head of the Prevention and Protection at the Workplace Unit, who reports to the Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the management of all aspects relating to the health and safety of workers, by means of occupational risk assessment, prevention and monitoring action and the appropriate corrective and training action [ LA5]; • the Energy Manager, manager of the Energy Management Operational Unit in the Real Estate Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi, who is responsible for analysing the energy requirement and for taking action to optimise consumption and improve the energy efficiency of buildings and services. The only position that reports directly to the Supervisory Board is that of the Chief Audit Executive. G4-37 No formal process exists for the direct consultation of stakeholders by the Supervisory Board other than that which is governed by the Articles of Association. Nevertheless, when important events occur in the life of the Group, stakeholders (both shareholders and others) are involved in opportunities for discussion with the participation of the Chairs of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board as well as the Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board is informed by means of internal reporting processes of the results of consultation with stakeholders carried out by different company units in the exercise of their duties. With regard to employees, their interests are upheld by company and Group trade union representatives as part of periodic discussions required under the various trade union agreement procedures and in other opportunities for meetings, such as equal partnership commissions and bi-lateral observatories on corporate social responsibility, corporate climate, training and equal opportunities matters. 21 2016 Sustainability Report G4-38 The composition of the Supervisory Board, as well as that of the Management Board, complies with the provisions of Borsa Italiana’s Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies which lays down best practices followed at both national and international level.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 7-8, 15-29, 44-51 G4-39 The governance system adopted involves separation between the roles of the Chair of the highest governing body – the Supervisory Board – and all executive officer roles, including that of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is a member of the Management Board.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P.44-51 G4-40 Procedures for the election and nomination of members of the Supervisory Board and its committees are regulated by the Articles of Association and by the Regulations for the Supervisory Board, in compliance with the applicable legislation and regulations, which include the Borsa Italiana Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P.15 G4-41 Conflicts of interest are regulated by the provisions of the law and by the Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies just mentioned, with reference both to their management and their disclosure. UBI Banca pursues policies and procedures for conflicts of interest that are compliant with the applicable legislation and regulations.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 35-36, 42-43, 54, 64-65 The role of the highest governing body in the definition of mission, values and strategies G4-42 The Supervisory Board defines the Group’s principles, values and strategies, which are formalised in the Group’s Code of Ethics, its regulations and policies and in its business plan.  G4-34, G4-36  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P.7-8 Expertise and assessment of the highest governing body’s performance G4-43 A self-assessment process was commenced in December 2016 relating to the year 2016 on the size, G4-44 composition and functioning of the Supervisory Board and its internal committees with support from the firm Korn Ferry, whose independence had been verified beforehand. The procedures for the self-assessment process are laid down in the internal regulation entitled “Selfassessment Process for Governing Bodies of the UBI Banca Group”, drawn up to implement supervisory th regulations on the subject of Corporate Governance (Bank of Italy Circular No. 285 of the 17 December 2013 – Part One – Title IV – Chapter 1). The annual self-assessment process is carried out in relation to the threeyear term of office of the Governing Bodies and, in the context of the UBI Banca Group and on the basis of criteria of proportionality, it follows the rules laid down by the Supervisory Authority. The document also includes guidelines for the organisation of training activities for members of Governing Bodies. The self-assessment was conducted, amongst other things, on the following factors: the quality and completeness of expertise, experience and knowledge existing within the Board; the degree of effectiveness of the functioning of the Board and the contribution of each of the internal committees; the quality of meetings; the quality and promptness of reporting and presentations to the Board; the effectiveness and efficiency of decision-making processes within the Board; the clarity, agreement and satisfaction with regard to policies, performance and risk objectives and to the results achieved; relations with the Management Board and Senior Management.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 26, 47 The highest governing body’s role in risk management UBI Banca carries out risk management, monitoring and measurement by means of a governance system which covers the organisational, methodological and regulatory aspects, with the objective of integrating its policies and the applicable Governance and risk management 22 regulations in an adequate risk management framework. In this manner it pursues the sustainable creation of value in the long-term and maintains a positive reputation in the economic and financial community. To achieve this the Internal Control System adopted by UBI Banca is designed, in compliance with the principles of sound and prudent management: to constantly verify that corporate policies and strategies are implemented and that corporate processes are effective and efficient; to safeguard the value of assets and protect them from losses; to ensure that corporate information and IT procedures are reliable and secure; to maintain the current types of risk below set limits; and to prevent the risk that the Group may be involved, even involuntarily, in illicit activities (including money-laundering, usury and the financing of terrorism).  INTEGRITY OF CORPORATE CONDUCT  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 38 G4-45 The activities of the Supervisory Board focus primarily on economic impacts, risks and opportunities and therefore the expertise required and performance assessments are mainly of an economic nature. Nevertheless, with the introduction of a reputational risk management policy, the Highest Governing Bodies also oversee social and environmental responsibility, which is constantly monitored and subject to reporting. Reputational risk is defined as the present or future risk of incurring loss of profits or capital resulting from a negative perception of the image of the Bank by customers, counterparties or shareholders of the bank, or investors or supervisory authorities.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 183-186 G4-46 Environmental and social aspects of operations – and the related risks and opportunities – fall specifically G4-47 within the responsibilities overseen by the Appointments Committee [G4-35, G4-36] and by the entire Board as part of the Reputational Risk Policy and of the process for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, with regard in particular to agreement on the Stakeholder Map and the Materiality Matrix [G4-18].  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 28 The role of the highest governing body in the sustainability reporting process G4-48 The Supervisory Board as a whole analyses and approves the Sustainability Report, normally in a meeting following that in which the Consolidated Annual Financial Report is approved. The highest governing body’s role in the assessment of economic, environmental and social performances G4-49 The only official process for direct communication between stakeholders and the highest governing body G4-50 consists of ordinary and extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings. These may be convened by shareholders themselves in compliance with the provisions of the Articles of Association. Shareholders may also ask for matters to be added to the agendas of Shareholders’ Meetings as well as to submit motions for approval on matters already on the agenda. If they are shareholders of the Bank, employees may take part in Shareholders’ Meetings and speak following the same procedures that apply to all shareholders. Critical concerns, remarks and proposals may also be put forward by trade union representatives of companies and the Group in periodic meetings required under the various trade union agreement procedures and in other opportunities for meetings, such as equal partnership commissions and bi-lateral observatories on corporate social responsibility, corporate climate, training and equal opportunities matters.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 77  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 66-69 Remuneration and incentives The Group has adopted remuneration and incentive policies designed to support medium and long-term strategies with the objective of creating value over time and pursuing sustainable growth for shareholders, employees and customers. G4-51 Remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board does not include variable forms of pay. The only exceptions to this are the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Management Board classified as senior management, who may receive variable forms of pay in the same way as other Group employees. The principles and procedures for management remuneration are regulated as part of Group Remuneration and Incentive Policies and these provide for remuneration packages that are differentiated in terms of the fixed, 23 2016 Sustainability Report variable and benefit components for the category to which staff belong. The variable component of remuneration is mainly based on performance measurement, on both an annual and long-term basis, with the objective of involving and orienting staff towards the pursuit of long-term policies, by recognising the value of individual and team contributions. To ensure a more direct correlation between results and rewards a bonus pool has been set, to which access is gradual on the basis of the satisfaction of preliminary trigger conditions by the Group and the achievement of risk-adjusted profit targets set at the level of both the Group and the individual business entity. The measurement is related to risk-adjusted income statement and balance sheet indicators, to internal and external customer satisfaction levels, to strategic projects and to assessments of the effectiveness of behaviour. Performance-based variable remuneration consists of: • short-term incentive schemes (annual); • long-term incentive schemes (multi-year); • the company productivity bonus (or, a result bonus, as defined in the current national trade union agreement); • commercial “contests”. Again in relation to the variable performance-based component, provision has also been made for the repayment of bonuses that have already been paid, using clawback mechanisms that take individual behaviours into account, as set out in the regulatory framework, whether or not there are compensation or disciplinary issues. These mechanisms were not applied to any member of staff during the course of 2016. Total fees for the financial year 2016 paid to members of the governing bodies of the Group came to approximately €12.8 million, down compared with the previous year (-5%), accounting for approximately 1% of total staff costs.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT – 2017 SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING P.3, 10-11, 30-31, 37-57 G4-52 The main parties involved in the process to determine remuneration are as follows: • the UBI Shareholders’ Meeting • the Supervisory Board • the Remuneration Committee • the Risk Committee • the Management Board • the Shareholders’ Meetings of the Italian subsidiary banks • the Boards of Directors and Boards of Statutory Auditors of banks and companies • Corporate Strategy • Human Resources (for the sole purposes of remuneration regulations in accordance with the provisions of Bank of Italy Supervisory Regulations on remuneration policies and practices) • Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit, as corporate control functions. A UBI Shareholders’ Meeting not only determines the total remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board, it also approves the remuneration policies of the Supervisory Board and Management Board, the incentive component based on financial instruments, the criteria and limits for determining remuneration in the event of the early termination of employment relationships or of corporate offices held, as well as increasing the ratio of variable to fixed remuneration up to a maximum of 2:1. The Supervisory Board, on the basis of a proposal from the Management Board within the scope of its remit (remuneration policies for the governing bodies are excluded from the Management Board’s remit), and after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee (which involves the competent corporate functions in the matter) and with the Risk Committee for verification of compliance with the “Risk Appetite Framework”, sets and reviews the Group’s remuneration and incentive policies on at least an annual basis and approves the Report on Remuneration, Section I of which is subject to a non-binding vote by a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. The policies are then submitted for approval by the Shareholders’ Meetings of the Italian banks and by the Boards of Directors of subsidiary banks and companies, except for the incentive component based on financial instruments, which is subject to approval by a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. Information is provided to the above bodies by means of the Annual Report on Remuneration within the Group. The Management Board, having incorporated any general recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee, formulates – with support from the competent functions – a proposal, within the scope of its remit, for Remuneration and incentive policies and the relative tools to implement them which is submitted to the Supervisory Board for its approval after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee. That same Management Board and the Boards of Directors of the subsidiary banks and companies, in accordance with the policies set, approve the relative means to implement them and, with the support of Human Resources and the other competent functions, makes recommendations for choices concerning the management and remuneration of staff. Having taken account of any proposals from the Remuneration Committee in those cases where it is required by the regulations in force, the Management Board also determines the remuneration of Senior Management and of personnel belonging to the “Material Risk Taker” perimeter at UBI and recommends remuneration for Senior Management and personnel belonging to the Material Risk Taker Governance and risk management 24 perimeter of subsidiary banks and companies to be submitted to the Boards of Directors of those companies. The foregoing is submitted to the Supervisory Board for verification of compliance, after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee. The corporate control functions are involved ex ante, working together to ensure the adequacy and regulatory compliance of the policies and practices adopted, and they carry out ex post monitoring of their proper functioning and application.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 30 G4-53 As well as determining the total remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board, the UBI Shareholders’ Meeting also approves the following: • remuneration policies for the Supervisory Board and the Management Board; • the incentive component based on financial instruments; • the criteria and limits for determining remuneration in the event of the early termination of an employment relationship or of an office held; • an increase in the ratio of the variable to fixed components of remuneration up to a maximum of 2:1. Shareholders meetings of the Italian banks and Boards of Directors of the subsidiary banks and companies are responsible for approving remuneration policies except for the incentive component based on financial instruments, which is subject to approval by a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. Information is provided to the above bodies by means of the Annual Report on Group Remuneration. All the resolutions submitted to the UBI Shareholders’ Meeting regarding the previous year were passed with a very large majority in favour.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT – 2017 SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING P.3 G4-54 The member of staff with the highest remuneration in the Group earned €1.49 million in 2016, 31 times the median amount of remuneration for all employees, with the exclusion of the member of staff with the highest remuneration. These calculations included both full and part-time employees (using a “full time equivalent pay rate”) and fixed and variable remuneration as well as non-monetary benefits were considered inclusive of incentive schemes (figures estimated on the 2016 cash quota), one-off bonuses, company bonuses and commercial contests. G4-55 The highest remuneration paid in the Group did not increase compared with the previous year, while the median increase in remuneration for all employees, with the exclusion of the highest-paid member of staff and personnel with foreign contracts, was approximately 1% (0.5% in 2015). These calculations included both full and part-time employees (using a “full time equivalent pay rate”) and fixed and variable remuneration as well as non-monetary benefits were considered inclusive of incentive schemes (figures estimated on the 2016 cash quota), one-off bonuses, company bonuses and commercial contests. Consultation with stakeholders The UBI Banca Group believes in the value of communication and dialogue with stakeholders to seek, where possible, shared solutions for the economic, social and environmental problems that affect the communities in which it operates and society in general. UBI uses the tool of dialogue in its corporate governance as an integral part of its work to build strategies and manage and to contain risk. It is through listening to people that it strives to constantly improve its decisionmaking processes, its products and the efficiency of its service and to pursue relationships of trust with all its stakeholders. G4-24 The UBI Banca Code of Ethics defines Group stakeholders by dividing them into three classes: • organisations and parties which have essential or significant interests with respect to carrying on business, due to the direct and specific nature of the relationships established or of the investments made (e.g. customers, personnel, suppliers, investors); • entities and parties who have significant interests, not based on direct business relationships, that are affected by the external impacts of the Group’s activities or by which UBI’s activity is directly influenced or conditioned (the community, with particular reference to local communities); • organisations and institutions which represent widespread interests or interests specific to different categories of stakeholder which are able to exert influence over UBI (e.g. public authorities, operators on financial markets, the media and opinion leaders, stakeholder organisations).  CODE OF ETHICS P. 5-6 G4-25 The stakeholder map contained in the Code of Ethics was drawn up as part of the project for the transition to the new G4 guidelines on the basis of six characteristics (direct influence, responsibility, dependence, closeness, political and strategic intention, representativity) and with account taken of the Bank’s existing 25 2016 Sustainability Report activities and strategic objectives.  CODE OF ETHICS P. 5-6 G4-26 Stakeholder engagement activities are structured with consideration given to the intensity of the relationship G4-27 and the breadth and urgency of the interests held by different stakeholders, in addition to the procedures laid down by specific legislation and regulations (e.g. Shareholders' Meetings, negotiations with trade unions) and established practice (e.g. investor relations, customer satisfaction surveys). Investors and the financial market All disclosures, and financial reporting and other compulsory disclosures in particular, must always be made punctually and must always be full, truthful and accurate, for the benefit not only of shareholders and investors but also of all stakeholders. Particular attention is reserved both to the continuous management of relations with shareholders and with the national and international financial community and also to the systematic disclosure of reliable, exhaustive and timely information on the Group's activities, results and strategies. The following work to achieve this: • the Corporate Affairs Service, which is responsible for relations with retail shareholders; • the Investor and Media Relations Area – that reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer which is responsible for relations with institutional investors and with the media, as well as for events and sponsorships. Information of significant importance to shareholders is also provided in special sections of the Group’s corporate website. Meetings with the financial community took place on many occasions in 2016 following attention paid to the Group both on issues concerning the banking system and on events regarding the UBI Banca Group. After the transformation of the Parent from a co-operative into an ordinary joint-stock company, which took place in October 2015, members of a new Supervisory Board were elected and a new Management Board was nominated in April 2016. This was then followed in June 2016 by the drafting and presentation of a new 20192020 Business Plan which set out the operating and financial objectives of the Group to 2019 and to 2020 as part of broad structural, organisational and corporate ownership changes which included, amongst other things, the merger of the network banks into the Parent, UBI Banca. Investor relations activities were therefore involved in meetings with the financial community on many occasions. That community was involved and reached by using not only conventional communication tools such as press releases, conference calls and presentations to financial analysts and professional investors, but also by means of much more frequent meetings with investors themselves, and international investors in particular. A series of meetings were also organised in local communities for retail shareholders at which UBI Banca Management illustrated and discussed the results achieved as well as the guidelines of the 2019-2020 Business Plan. 2016 2015 2014 1 F IN AN CIAL CO MMUN ICATIO N No. of No. of No. of No. of No. of No. of E v e nts E v e nts E v e nts E v e nts E v e nts E v e nts Conference calls/presentations 5 812 4 492 4 463 International conferences 6 186 13 201 9 242 Road shows 10 99 26 190 13 160 Individual and group meetings 55 138 38 107 37 148 TO TAL 76 1 ,2 3 5 81 990 63 1 ,0 1 3 1 Events organised with investors and analysts of the share and with investors in debt instruments.

These are supplemented by special meetings to address specific questions such as when new products and services are designed and these include special focus groups.  QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION Opinion leaders Relations with opinion leaders are mainly developed through the conventional media, but new social media activities are becoming increasingly more important. Relations with the media are the responsibility of the competent organisational units and they are managed Governance and risk management 26 with the intention of providing relevant and reliable information on the structure, activity, and financial position of the Bank, its policies and strategies, including social and environmental policies, and the impacts of action taken. Relations are conducted according to the principles of integrity, transparency, independence and equal treatment for each newspaper and journalist. Mirroring the communication strategy of UBI Banca, the Network Banks themselves work to obtain adequate coverage in the press (the local press especially), for their activities and initiatives.

UBI Banca continues to hold first place in the banking sector for quality of contents and followers of @ubibanca, with over 300 product contents. On Facebook, which is undoubtedly the most important social network, fans of our page reached 200,000 at the beginning of January 2017, bringing UBI Banca up to third place in the classification of banks with a conventional distribution model. This channel recorded good performance in 2016 with over 100 million views and average daily interactions by over 2,000 fans, while 400 UBI Banca contents were published during the year. Again in 2016, subscribers to the YouTube channel increased substantially, thanks above all to activities targeted at young people with the collaboration of Youtubers (celebrities well-known on this social network) engaged for the Viaggio in testa (“holiday in mind”) campaign in particular to promote the QUBI account. In total this channel received over 4.1 million minutes of viewing thanks, amongst other things, to the publication of over 50 videos in 2016. As concerns Linkedin, after carefully planned positioning activities carried out in the second half of 2016, structured editorial activity was commenced with contents designed to engage both young people and senior professionals. This was added to by constant and proactive management of the channel by Human Resources – Selection and Employer Branding, with support from Commercial Communication. Personnel 27 2016 Sustainability Report Dialogue with personnel takes place through relations with institutional representatives [ REPORTS AND ACCOUNTS 2016 P. 82], through internal communication facilities [ REPORTS AND ACCOUNTS 2016 P. 83] and through special surveys to measure satisfaction and expectations. Internal Customer Satisfaction (ICS) surveys, specially for internal customers, who are mainly staff working in the distribution network, are used to acquire opinions on different products, software applications and processes provided by units at the Parent, by UBI Sistemi e Servizi and by the product companies.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 65 The subjective perception of employees on the issue of work-related stress is surveyed using special questionnaires in order to reveal possible difficulties and areas for improvement with the objective of coming closer to a widespread and shared corporate culture based, amongst other things, on organisational wellbeing.  REPORTS AND ACCOUNTS 2016 P. 189 Governance and risk management 28 Integrity of corporate conduct For UBI Banca “Fare Banca per Bene” (to bank fairly and well) means being a high-quality, solid and reliable bank, which bases its work on a constant sense of ethics, transparency, integrity and sustainable results in the longterm. It means believing in strong and shared values and putting them into practice in observance of principles and rules of conduct which are not seen as limitations, but as the way to establish our identity on the market. Values and principles G4-56 The Group’s mission, values and principles are formally set out in its Charter of Values and Code of Ethics [G4-56] and they are set out in greater detail in the general rules contained in the Code of Conduct for Group Personnel and in the specific regulations for different areas of activity, consisting of Policies, Circulars and Rulebooks. Furthermore, UBI Banca has signed and is committed to observance and promotion of the universal principles of the United Nations’ Global Compact on human rights, labour, the environment and the fight against corruption. The Code of Ethics, due to its key role in the application of Group values and principles, in addition to being officially adopted by all subsidiaries, is also brought to the attention of other investees so that they may commit to maintaining conduct consistent with the principles contained in it. It is communicated to staff through the app for the consultation of internal regulations on the corporate intranet and in hardcopy form for companies who have no access to that portal. It is delivered to members of governing bodies and to newly recruited personnel, when a relationship is established. It is published on the Group website and it is delivered to all those who work with the Bank under contract or who represent the Bank, even without being subordinate to it. Major suppliers are required to sign a declaration of acceptance as part of the respective contract documents. G4-57 The Group CSR Manager provides support and advice for training and communication activities and for the interpretation and implementation of the principles of the Code of Ethics. Compliance By emphasising the key importance of an adequate Internal Control System for the purposes of sound and prudent management and of containing risks and capital stability, the New Regulations for the Supervision of Banks issued by the Bank of Italy with Circular No. 285 of 17th December 2013 and the Bank of Italy and Consob (Italian securities market authority) Joint Regulation have established that Italian banks must have a “Compliance Function”. This function must be dedicated exclusively to the management of compliance risk and must regard all company activities. Compliance risk is defined as “the risk of incurring legal or administrative penalties, or substantial financial losses or reputational damages as a consequence of violations of compulsory rules or internal regulations”. Compliance risk management policies follow along the lines of the growing attention paid in Group regulations to organisational and internal control matters, on the assumption that effective organisational and governance structures constitute an essential condition for the prevention and mitigation of corporate risk factors. The Compliance Function is assigned a proactive and preventative role which is therefore, within the scope of its remit, one of analysis, stimulation and co-ordination of the units in different areas with management and operational functions. One of the most innovative features on which attention has been focused on the development of a compliance approach in banks consists of the diffusion of a risk culture at all levels, where the aim is to develop awareness among staff that this does not lie in controls alone, but must be part of business itself and must be a corporate identity that attributes value to rigorous observance of high standards of conduct. From an organisational viewpoint the Compliance Area reports directly to the Management Board and is composed of five services: ICT Operations Compliance, Banking Services Compliance, Investment and Financial Services Compliance, Governance and Other Processes, Methodologies, Monitoring and Reporting. Compliance activities involve not only external regulations, but also internal regulations, in which the Code of Ethics and the Code of Conduct for Group companies are important and they also assess instances of non-compliance for the purpose of improving internal procedures and processes. In the first few months of 2016, activities to update the “Group organisational regulations for the management of the compliance process” were concluded in order to complete the implementation of the Bank of Italy clarifications memorandum issued in August 2015 on the proper procedures for compliance with the provisions of Circular No. 285 on the subject. The new Group Regulations govern the operational stages and steps needed to conduct analyses and identify areas of non-compliance and therefore they regulate management of the remedial action to be taken.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 53-59 G4-58 Any reports of problems concerning unethical or unlawful behaviour and questions relating to corporate integrity are regulated by the Code of Ethics. The Chief Audit Executive (head of the Internal Audit Function) is responsible for receiving written reports, which may also be received at a dedicated email address codice.etico@ubibanca.it). The Internal Audit Function makes a record of reports received, carries out an initial assessment to determine 29 2016 Sustainability Report the importance and then forwards them to bodies with management and control functions and also: • to the Supervisory Body, if the alleged violation is significant for the purposes of regulations pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01; • to the organisational unit that manages relations with the stakeholder who has committed the alleged violation, or the relative body in question, in other cases. While reports cannot be kept anonymous under the Code, they are kept strictly confidential and those making reports are protected against any form of retaliation, discrimination or penalty. This reporting channel is co-ordinated with others provided for by the 231/2001 model (model for administrative liability procedures) for the prevention of crimes falling within the sphere of banking activities and by the Whistleblowing Policy for reporting unethical or illegal conduct. More specifically, the Whistleblowing Policy pursued in compliance with the amendments made to Legislative Decree No. 72/2015 of the Consolidated Banking Act (Art. 52 bis) and to the Consolidated Finance Act (Art. 8 bis) and with the update to Borsa Italiana Spa’s Corporate Governance Code (July 2015) to which the UBI Banca Group adheres, has established a reserved and protected channel for Group staff to report actions and facts which may constitute a violation of the regulations governing banking and financial activities during the course of carrying out their duties at work. In 2016 no reports were received of violations of the Code of Ethics and those reports received through the whistleblowing channel did not show any violations of the Code of Ethics.

Adherence to the UN Global Compact strengthens the Group’s commitment to fighting corruption, which in Italy is included among the “predicate offences” falling within the sphere of application of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of companies. As part of its implementation of the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, UBI Banca has adopted a model of organisation, management and control (the 231/2001 Model), which lays 1 down rules and procedures designed to prevent the commission of the crimes specified by that decree . The Internal Control Committee of the bank was identified to play the role of the Supervisory Body, formed as an internal committee of the Supervisory Board, in order to ensure the proper functioning and constant update of the model itself and of the relative reporting and penalty systems. Furthermore, in its capacity as the Parent of the Group, UBI Banca informs subsidiaries of the policies it has set on the matter and recommends general criteria which they may follow. Each subsidiary adopts and updates its own Model with support from the Parent’s Compliance Function for those companies that have granted a specific mandate for this [  G4-41]. Oversight of anti-money-laundering activities, inclusive of the compliance function, is performed centrally in the Group by the Anti-Money Laundering and Claims Area, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The management model, which is 1 In 2015, the 231/2001 Model was updated for compliance with the new provisions of Law No. 186 of 15/12/2014 on “self-laundering”, which has similarities in common with or is connected with the crime of corruption. Integrity of corporate conduct 30 organised centrally for the Network Banks (now merged into UBI Banca) and for its subsidiaries UBI Leasing, UBI Factor and Prestitalia, is based on the following: • effective IT system support to manage customer risk profiles and to monitor all transactions (according to the 2 amount limits set by the relative legislation) by using various software applications including Gianos ; • clear, exhaustive and easy-to-use internal regulations, systematically aligned with legislative regulations and procedural and self-regulatory innovations adopted; • procedural regulations which govern the acquisition and storage of documents to identify customers and record their financial profiles and to perform accounting and all other operations required – in full compliance with civil law regulations and anti-money laundering legislation – and also accurate oversight and monitoring of data acquisition and storage. In order to ensure effective controls, it maintains terrorist lists and lists of persons politically exposed, acquired from reliable and independent sources, constantly up-to-date and the relative company regulations are constantly updated too. All employees receive specific training on a three-yearly programmed basis, designed to increase staff culture and awareness on the matter and to provide critical knowledge of new developments introduced by Bank of Italy provisions. The Internal Audit Function carries out audits of UBI Banca and of subsidiaries who have delegated internal audit function activities to the Parent and more generally, as part of the management and control duties of the Parent, of all Group companies. With regard to that auditing perimeter, in compliance with international professional standards, the Internal Audit function also carries out on-site inspections of the operation and the appropriateness of the internal control and risk management system by means of an annual plan of activities submitted to the management and supervisory bodies of the above-mentioned subsidiaries and cumulatively to the management and supervisory bodies of the Parent. New control activities have been implemented concerning anti-money laundering with particular regard to the quality of the adequate verification of customers that are not natural persons. These take account of the guidelines contained in the “National analysis of money laundering and the finance of terrorism risks”, carried out in 2014 by the Financial Security Committee of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance. Improvements to controls continued with the study of irregularity indicators able to detect matters for submission to the attention of line and control units applied by means of the integrated Anti-money laundering Portal IT platform. Updates were carried out on both corporate regulations (with dedicated circulars, which were subsequently inserted in a new edition of the Anti-Money Laundering Rulebook) and on management processes, already updated in 2014 as a result rd of Bank of Italy provisions dated 3 April 2013 on the subject of “Adequate Verification” and “Keeping a Single IT Archive”. G4-SO3 All activities and organisational units are subject to verification connected with implementation of the 231/2001 Model, while the Supervisory Body reports to the governing bodies on its adoption and effective implementation, the supervision of its functioning and oversight of its update. All transactions are subject to monitoring according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation by means of dedicated software applications which support the identification of data potentially connected with money laundering or other illegal activities, including corruption. The situations detected are subsequently subject to assessment by the organisational units responsible for managing the customer relationship and then by the central control unit.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND FINAL PARTS OF THE 2016 REPORT REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE P. 61-62 G4-SO4 In 2016 17,500 hours of specific training were carried out both in the classroom and through the e-learning platform, for 8,671 employees. Training activities were directed above all to staff who constitute the first point of contact with customers. Training on the principles of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, which also addressed anti-corruption policies with procedures differentiated according to the level of responsibility, stood at levels resulting from the need for normal updates with over 2,500 training hours delivered during the year to 557 participants. G4-SO5 Again in 2016, as in previous years, the operational risk management system and more specifically the loss data collection procedures recorded no incidents of “corruption, bribes and anti-money-laundering violations”. This detection constitutes a specific sub-category of internal fraud detection.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 170-171, 323-324 G4-SO6 As provided for by the Code of Ethics, no payments – neither direct nor indirect and in any form – are permitted to: political parties, movements, political committees and other political organisations, their representatives and candidates, congresses or festivals with political propaganda purposes. 2 GIANOS (a generator of irregularity indicators for suspect transactions) is a software application to select potentially suspect transactions widely used by banks. It was developed by an Interbank working Group co-ordinated by the Italian Banking Association with the support of legal, IT, organisational and statistics experts. 31 2016 Sustainability Report Commercial practices In order to develop long-lasting business relationships with its customers, based on trust and mutual satisfaction, UBI Banca’s commercial activities are constantly based on rigorous professional and ethical standards aimed at substantial integrity in relationships (this includes identification and management of possible conflicts of interest, with the provision in this respect of adequate information) and abstention from any improper commercial practice, from any form of advertising that is deceptive or which does not reflect the quality of the products and services advertised and from any behaviour or agreement designed to impair market competition. UBI Banca is also committed to ensuring maximum transparency for customers with regard to its range of products and services, in compliance with the Bank’s ethical standards [ CODE OF ETHICS P. 22] and the provisions of the relative regulations, with particular attention paid to the sale of complex financial products. Rules for the transparency, integrity and quality of products and for customer protection in the range of financial instruments supplied to customers are defined in the document Risk Appetite Framework Policy for the trading, placement and subscription of financial products. In compliance with the recommendations of the supervisory authorities, UBI Banca does not place products on the Consob “black list” (communication number 0097996/14) on the primary market, because it considers that these are not appropriate to retail customers. According to Consob recommendations, these are products which could only be advised for and distributed to retail customers by adopting special precautions and following an assessment of whether they are in the interests of customers and on whether sufficient information is available to assess their characteristics and the principal risks. The necessary measures have also been adopted with regard to IW Bank’s online trading platform to prevent customers from trading in complex products on the blacklist. All advertising initiatives are screened by the competent units to ensure compliance with legislation and regulations concerning commercial practices, with particular attention paid to privacy, transparency and protection of the consumer. By working through the various units involved, the Bank verifies compliance with the provisions of the Voluntary Code on Advertising when advertising messages are formulated, even when outside advertising agencies are brought in. “Creative” demands are always subject to the regulations in force in terms of the clarity of the messages, visibility and the completeness of the legal notices. The same lines of conduct are also followed for advertising at points of sale and for “digital” initiatives which make use of the web to deliver messages rapidly and to a wide audience.  QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION As part of auditing activity conducted by the various functions which contribute to the implementation of the system of internal controls, the Auditing Function also considers the effective implementation of the principles and commitments set out in the social and environmental policies which regard the Group’s commercial activities. G4-PR5 UBI Banca now has a well-established customer satisfaction survey system in place using an outside independent firm.  QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION G4-PR6 No cases of banned or disputed products to report. G4-PR7 No cases of violation of the regulations in force occurred, nor were there any reports of non-compliance with regard to advertising processes, which were carried out in compliance with internal Group regulations. G4-PR9 No facts emerged in 2016 concerning the provision of products and services which gave rise to fines concerning transparency and proper conduct in relations with customers. Similarly, there are no cases or instances of violations of regulations and/or codes of conduct adopted concerning the transparency of products and services to report with regard to the provision of investment services and with regard to IT compliance. st With a provision of 21 January 2016, the Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato (AGCM – the G4-SO7 Italian Competition Authority) launched an investigation into the Italian Banking Association concerning the 3 possibility that the interbank agreement involving the SEDA service (and more specifically the remuneration mechanism inherent in it), as set forth by the Italian Banking Association itself in a circular it issued in 2013, might constitute a resolution for an association of companies that restricts competition. With a provision th dated 13 April 2016 the AGCM decided to broaden the investigation to include some banks (including UBI Banca), because the AGCM had found that the banks themselves were taking an active role “in the definition of the SEDA remuneration system, also with reference to the transition stage from the RID direct debit system to the new systems and to the treatment of mandates already deposited”. th On 19 April 2016, at the time when the decision to broaden the investigation was notified, inspections were carried out at certain banks including UBI Banca. The proceedings are still in progress and UBI Banca considers 3 This is an optional accessory IT service related to the SEPA direct debit system. Integrity of corporate conduct 32 that it has no involvement whatsoever in the allegations made.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 321 Transparency G4-PR3 The Bank of Italy has issued specific provisions on the transparency of banking and financial operations and services. These set minimum and general standards for the preparation of the documentation used to provide customers with information (structure of the documents, essential information, choice of terminology, standardisation of some common types of contract) and they also introduce obligations for banking and financial intermediaries as well as for the marketing of traditional banking services of an organisational or control nature for compliance with regulations governing transparency and integrity in relations with customers. The transparency provisions apply to the purchase of traditional banking and financial products (e.g. current accounts and other forms of deposit, financing, payment instruments) and to each stage of relationships between intermediaries and customers: the precontract stage, before the contract is signed (document on customer rights and information sheet, distribution of summary cost indicators, prevention of disputes through organisational controls), the stage at which the contract is signed (summary documents, form of the contracts) and the post-contract stage involving relations between intermediaries and customers (periodic documentation, dispute management). These rules sit alongside other sets of regulations governing transparency and integrity in relations with customers such as for example those that govern the provision of investment services, regulated by the Consolidated Finance Act, or of insurance products as well as the regulations contained in the “Consumer Code”. Compliance with these regulations is subject to particular attention within the Group, which has also introduced a commitment in its Code of Ethics to always provide customers with full, clear and easy to understand information at every stage of customer relationships. G4-PR4 No cases or instances of violations of regulations and/or codes of conduct adopted concerning the transparency of products and services occurred to report in 2016 with regard to the placement of products and services, to the provision of investment services and to compliance with provisions in the IT field.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 170-171 Respect for people (non-discrimination) All personnel management processes, starting with selection and appointment and throughout the course of an employment relationship, are based on observance of the principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities. Particular attention is paid to the management of diversity – especially from the viewpoint of disabilities and gender equality – and to the management of disciplinary proceedings, two areas in which the risk of running into cases of discrimination are greatest. The first aspect is managed as part of human resource management and development policies and remuneration policies [ENHANCEMENT AND WELL-BEING OF PERSONNEL]. As concerns the management of disciplinary proceedings, UBI Banca has adopted specific guidelines, valid throughout the Group, designed to ensure they are managed properly and transparently through the formalisation of investigation, decision-making and judgement processes and through periodic reporting on the measures taken. With regard to the recruitment of disabled persons, the Group complies with the regulations currently in force, while with regard to gender diversity, the female component of personnel has increased even in managerial positions. G4-HR3 No reports of violations of the Code of Ethics or in any case of allegations of violations of the principle of nonG4-LA16 discrimination were received, not even among the 75 disciplinary proceedings initiated during the year in observance of established procedures. These are disciplinary provisions for operational irregularities and negligence of various kinds (64), for irregularities in the disbursement and management of loans (6) and for undue appropriation/diversion of funds administrated (5).

With regard to Group personnel, freedom of association and collective bargaining is guaranteed in compliance with national regulations and legislation and there are no restrictions on the freedom of association and participation in trade unions. Seven trade union organisations are present in the Group which operate freely without restrictions and the Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct trade union activities. In 2016 trade union representatives took approximately 239,715 hours of trade union leave. Relations with trade union organisations are based on the search for agreement, as far as possible, on solutions to the issues which are discussed from time to time, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue even beyond the minimum required by institutional procedures. Work on trade union relations was intense in 2016 with 92 trade union meetings held for a total of approximately 690 hours.

As concerns the remuneration of senior management, no significant differences are to be found between female remuneration compared with that of males. For the remaining staff, however, as a consequence of the greater presence of part-time work for female workers, a difference remains due to the greater presence of part-time contracts: 29% of female personnel are employed on part-time contracts compared with 1% of male personnel. 35 2016 Sustainability Report AVER AGE GR O SS 2016 2015 2014 SAL AR Y 1 VAR IAB L E VAR IAB L E VAR IAB L E F IXED VAR IAB L E 2 TO TAL F IXED VAR IAB L E 2 TO TAL F IXED VAR IAB L E 2 TO TAL (thousands of euro) TO TO TAL TO TO TAL TO TO TAL Sen io r man ag ers Men 150.8 4.6 155.4 3.1% 150.4 10.3 160.7 6.8% 148.9 11.4 160.3 7.7% Women 159.0 3.1 162.1 1.9% 150.1 9.7 159.9 6.5% 144.5 12.8 157.3 8.9% Mid d le man ag ers Men 62.9 1.7 64.6 2.7% 62.5 2.1 64.6 3.4% 62.4 2.1 64.5 3.4% Women 53.2 1.7 54.9 3.2% 53.2 2.0 55.3 3.8% 53.9 2.1 56.0 3.9% Pro fessio n al areas Men 39.7 1.2 40.9 3.0% 39.6 1.5 41.1 3.8% 39.6 1.7 41.2 4.3% Women 35.6 1.1 36.7 3.1% 35.7 1.4 37.1 3.9% 36.2 1.6 37.8 4.4% F o reig n emp lo yees Men 75.4 0.1 75.5 0.1% 77.6 0.0 77.6 0.0% Women 52.7 0.1 52.8 0.2% 50.4 0.0 50.4 0.0% 1 Data related to 99% of the employees, excluding extra Group. 2 The figures are inclusive of: Incentive Schemes, One-off Bonuses, Company Bonuses and Commercial Contests. 2016 2015 2014 AVER AGE GR O SS SAL AR IES O F W O MEN TO MEN TO TAL F IXED TO TAL F IXED TO TAL F IXED Senior managers 104.3% 105.4% 99.5% 99.9% 98.2% 97.0% Middle managers 84.9% 84.5% 85.6% 85.2% 86.7% 86.3% Professional areas 89.8% 89.8% 90.2% 90.1% 91.7% 91.6% Foreign employees 70.0% 69.9% 64.9% 64.9% Data related to 99% of the employees, excluding extra Group.

Integrity of corporate conduct 36 Creation of value UBI Banca pursues the creation of sustainable value over time for its shareholders and for all its stakeholders ranging from employees to the individual local communities in which it operates and to society in general, and it also pursues the maintenance of an adequate level of capital strength. The creation of value is intended in the broad sense and not only in the technical sense relating solely to quantitative metrics, except for the economic value generated and distributed to stakeholders, which is calculated on the basis of the framework set out by the Italian Banking Association (ABI), in compliance with the relative GRI-G4 guidelines. Solidity Again in 2016, the continuing fragility of the economic environment conditioned the Italian banking sector even though signs of improvement do exist not so much for volumes of funding and lending (only the latter is recovering slightly, but limited to individual retail customers), but for the quality of credit as new inflows to non-performing status reduce. In this scenario, UBI Banca has been rewarded for its consistently high level of capital strength with a constant increase in deposits (+9.9% for current accounts) and a strong trend for indirect funding (+14.1% for insurance products and +11.8% for assets under management). And then credit quality improved significantly (-6.8% for gross non-performing loans and 47.0% for new non-performing loans).  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 45-46 Profitability The result for 2016 was a loss (a consolidated net loss of €830.2 million and a normalised consolidated net loss of €474.4 1 million ) the consequence primarily of expenses incurred to implement the Business Plan consisting mainly of the recognition of loan provisions to improve the ratio of net non-performing loans to tangible equity (the “Texas ratio”), in addition to expenses related to the Single Bank Project (redundancy expenses, impairment losses on the network bank and improvements to the IT platform).  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 95 G4-EC1 The economic value generated was also reduced significantly as a result, not only because of the greater impairment losses recognised on loans, but also because of a reduction in net interest income and lower profits from finance activities, while the economic value distributed to stakeholders only diminished marginally, having drawn from the share premium reserve to replenish losses for the year and from the extraordinary rowers serve to distribute a dividend to shareholders  2016 SEPARATE FINANCIAL REPORT P. 54*.

Furthermore, exclusive 53.0% membership of UBI Club is dedicated to those Employees 67.1% shareholders who are customers of UBI Banca and possess at least 1,000 shares. It provides a package of banking and insurance products offered at special terms and conditions. The value of purchases, which drive a substantial local supply industry, remained largely unchanged. This is composed of small and large suppliers who are managed according to criteria of independence, transparency and fairness. In a difficult market context the Bank continues to provide sustainable payment conditions with average payment times recorded in 2016 of 32.5 days and a maximum contractually agreed payment time of 120 days from the date of invoice (applied for only 0.012% of the total). The value of ordinary and extraordinary contributions to the Resolution Fund for Banks and to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme (due starting from 2015 and amounting to €131.8 million in 2016) is considered paid to public administrations. The whole community benefits not only from the economic value of payments made or social intervention, but also from the value of important activities, not measured, such as those for the prevention of criminal activities (e.g. money laundering and the finance of terrorism) and in general for obligations to co-operate with investigating authorities. G4-EC2 In consideration of the activities it performs, the Group has no significant direct exposure to risks connected with climate change. Minor impacts may occur in relation to supply processes, especially with regard to fuel and electricity costs and commercial and lending processes relating to the occurrence of extreme climatic events which could affect the operating capacities and solvency prospects of corporate clients (a risk which is, however, mitigated by the high sector diversification of the Group’s lending). On the other hand, business opportunities may arise as a result of investments by individuals and businesses in energy savings and in the use of alternative energies and investments by businesses to comply with evolving regulations and efficiency standards for products and production processes. G4-EC4 UBI Banca has never received any form of government assistance. It has carried out operations with central banks for financial stability purposes and to facilitate the transmission of monetary policy. G4-EC8 Given its nature and its distribution network in the community, the UBI Banca Group generates significant indirect impacts on the economy, that are very difficult to quantify. They mainly regard the following: • the competitiveness of the economy, as a result of support to small and medium-sized enterprises to promote growth and technological innovation and to overcome the crisis; • the development of depressed economic areas, through geographical choices for the location of branches and the allocation of economic resources; • the development of the green economy and the reduction of environmentamyl costs through support for investments for energy savings and the development and use of renewable energies ; • the reduction of risks and the maximisation of the social benefits of development through attention to issues such as financial inclusion and education, growth of a financial civil economy (the third sector), protection of health and safety at the workplace lavoro, non-discrimination and equal opportunities. On a national scale, UBI Banca can help reduce the social costs of economic inequalities, increase the efficiency and stability of the financial system and act to fight against illegal conduct. 39 2016 Sustainability Report Quality and customer satisfaction UBI Banca invests constantly in quality and innovation in order to be able to offer products and services that are increasingly in line with the demands of a continuously evolving market. The digital revolution in particular has made tools and technologies available that have eliminated constraints on space and time, with high standards of quality and security for banking products and services. The digital experience does not exclude, but on the contrary enhances the maintenance of direct and personal business relationships, which are developed thanks also to a widespread local presence and personalised advisory services, which create trust and represent a distinctive tool in our way of banking. The quality and adequacy of products and services UBI-1 The Group defines rules for the development and distribution of new products and for the maintenance of existing products by means of a specific product development and management policy. These give rise to processes designed to help achieve objectives of quality, technological innovation, competitiveness and compliance with regulations, consistent with our mission, strategy, business goals and the overall corporate architecture of the Group. IW bank has adopted a specific process for the development of products and services for its particular products and services, due to the special nature of its business, which differs in some areas from that of the conventional Group banks (e.g. evolved trading, an open platform for assets under management, etc.). In this manner we seek to ensure that products and services are consistent with customers’ characteristics and needs and that response times to market demands (time to market) are reduced throughout the Group. The characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, investment plans) and needs of customers (e.g. financial, protection) are surveyed through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the Progetto Ascolto customer satisfaction survey or complaints management) and through the analysis of competitors’ products and services. Participation in observatories and working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives are also a source of valuable information, for example in relation to the possibilities offered by new technologies. Competitiveness is based on a pricing policy oriented towards transparency and fairness to customers and it involves analysis and monitoring of the relationships between the risk taken (if present), the return, the costs incurred and the market context, with account taken of the need to provide financial support to local communities and businesses. In 2016 the bank continued to invest in digital innovation, focusing on the simplicity and transparency of products and services and on the integration of communication channels to the benefit of an increasingly improved user experience.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 59-61 The quality and value of UBI Banca’s presence on the market is recognised each year with the award of various prizes.  2016 SUMMARY OF SUSTAINABILITY REPORT P. 11 The quality of customer relationships The quality of customer relationships and customer satisfaction are monitored by means of customer satisfaction surveys, the analysis of complaints and by monitoring the duration of customer relationships. G4-PR5 The Customer Satisfaction Area uses a set of surveys on the subject of service quality and of the precise and complete experience of the use of the bank. The surveys, which are always carried out by outside independent parties, examine three dimensions of quality: the perceived quality of customers in their relationship with the bank; the quality delivered, which is the service supplied by the bank through its different products, software applications and processes and the expected quality, which is the ability of the bank to achieve an ideal level of quality suggested by customers. The results of the surveys carried out are reported periodically to various units in the Group, together, where necessary, with recommended corrective action [G4-24]. In 2016 customer satisfaction surveys involved more than 120 thousand Group customers, both individuals and businesses. The comparison benchmark was constructed by interviewing approximately 11 thousand customers of competitor banks using the same methodology as that used for UBI Banca customers. The UBIndex is a summary indicator of perceived quality and therefore of the level of customer satisfaction. More specifically, the level of satisfaction is measured through the UBIndex (a summary index which measures the quality perceived, calculated monthly by bank, market, segment, District Management Area and branch and it is also used in incentive schemes for Group personnel. In line with trends in progress since 2011, a rise in the level of customer satisfaction was seen in 2016 in the retail market (+2 points) and the corporate market (+3 points), which confirmed UBI’s continued ability to outperform the benchmark. The score for the private banking market on the other hand, although high, moved in the opposite direction, falling by two points and it Quality and customer satisfaction 40 was beaten by the benchmark. Surveys of perceived quality examine a variety of themes which include the perception customers have of UBI Banca’s image and its social responsibility, reasons that customers that have closed their accounts have for leaving the bank and the customer experience.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 64-65 The annual survey of the perception customers have of UBI Banca’s image showed that the Group’s main strength is the sense of trust that it transmits (seriousness, solidity).

The survey on lost customers was carried out using a methodology designed to detect the causes of customers leaving by listening to the experiences which led customers to end their relationship with the Bank. The survey showed that customers are increasingly more demanding and that they pay much attention to the value added provided by the Bank. Aspects concerning organisation and products are determining factors in customer satisfaction, as are relationships of trust established with the bank, where relations with staff also play an important role. Customer experience is measured by asking customers to define in one word the sensation they experienced at the last time of contact with bank (through physical or remote channels). The large majority (91%) described a positive experience: the most frequent terms were kindness (20%) and helpfulness (15%). Mystery client surveys monitor the quality delivered by the Bank during the main stages of the process to purchase products or services by a potential customer. The mystery client programme of visits was carried out at all the Group’s network bank branches (a total of 1,500 visits). The main steps in the “customer journey” (welcome, advice/profiling, proposal, cross selling and follow-up) were analysed during the visits for the offer of the following products: current accounts and related services, financial advice on investments, home mortgages, personal loans and non-life insurance policies. The results were positive for all the surveys carried out, but the best results were for the welcome stage and for listening to the requirements expressed by customers. Exploration of expected quality is carried out using qualitative and quantitative surveys: the former make use of workshops and focus groups to identify the quality requirements attributed to an ideal bank; the latter assign a scale of priorities to individual requirements (a “quality pyramid”) and identify the Bank’s position with respect them. The values of simplicity and transparency, relationships and knowledge, and attention to customers stood at the top of the 2015 quality permit, while in 2016 – affected by a reversal in the socioeconomic context (reduction in the expectations of recovering from the crisis, failure of consumption to recover, risks attached to the introduction of bail-in regulations) – customers changed their priorities to the reliability of the bank, the competency of staff and organisational efficiency, emphasising at the same time the importance of the requirement for a simple and transparent bank.

Claims management is therefore based on guaranteeing precise, direct and prompt answers that satisfy customer requests and expectations. It is the responsibility of UBI Banca’s Claims Function, positioned within the Anti-Money Laundering and Claims Area in the organisation chart. In line with directives on transparency and the guiding principles adopted by the Group, various channels are available to the public to submit complaints and claims: in addition to local branches and conventional mail and fax channels, there are also ordinary and certified electronic mail, the websites of Group companies, apps and the Customer Telephone Service. All the channels are advertised on information pamphlets pinned up in branches and in special sections of the Group’s corporate and commercial websites. First-time complaints received in 2016 by the Group numbered 26,500 of which: 10,051 by UBI Banca, 5,042 by the Network Banks and 11,407 by the product companies.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 66-70 N ETW O R K B AN K CO MPL AIN TS 1 2016 2015 2014 Total complaints received 15,093 6,944 4,830 of which: ordinary on products and services 14,631 6,342 4,096 for compounding of interest 266 480 610 for securities in default 18 23 11 on privacy 178 99 113 on human rights Complaints received through remote channels 4,967 1,603 Complaints processed 2 15,093 7,121 4,811 of which accepted 9,637 3,332 1,656 3 Average days for response 16 28 20 Appeals to the Ombudsman 23 30 4 Appeals to the Ombudsman completed 19 24 4 of which in favour of the customer 4 3 Appeals to the Financial Banking Arbitrator 516 176 122 Appeals to the Financial Banking Arbitrator completed 436 157 115 of which in favour of the customer 323 60 48 Appeals to the Consob Chamber of Reconciliation and Arbitration Appeals to the Consob Chamber of Reconciliation and Arbitration of which in favour of the customer Mediation cases pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 28/2010 1,115 1,166 1,464 Mediation cases completed 1,114 1,142 1,443 of which with a settlement agreement 107 43 52 1 As a consequence of the “Sing le Bank” Project and the resulting g radual merg er of the Network Banks into the Parent, the fig ures for 2016 relate to UBI Banca and to the Network banks, while those for previous years relate solely to the Network Banks. 2 Total complaints concluded in the year, independently of the year of presentation. 3 Overall averag e, inclusive of both ordinary complaints and investment service complaints. Protection of data and privacy The increasing use of new technologies, not only for consultation services, but also for payment services and the purchase of banking and financial products and the growing pressure of increased Italian and European regulation means that the protection of customer data and customer privacy is even more important. That is why the Group has adopted a Protection of Privacy Rule Book and a series of organisational and technical measures, with locks and other protective devices on IT systems, designed to ensure not only the necessary compliance with security and data protection requirements, but also observance of the consents granted by customers regarding the processing of their personal data for commercial and marketing purposes. Customer protection is also implemented by keeping customers constantly up-to-date with information on the most appropriate anti-fraud procedures and measures for the secure use of Internet and mobile banking services and with a business continuity plan, which involves both a series of technical and organisational measures designed to ensure that the most critical processes will be operational even in emergency situations and also a series of periodic disaster recovery controls and tests. With regard to the acquisition and processing of personal data for commercial purposes, the fundamental rights and th freedoms and the dignity of those concerned are always guaranteed in compliance with Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003 (Privacy Code) on the protection of personal data and the rules laid down in the new Regulation EU No. Quality and customer satisfaction 42 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) on the protection of natural persons are currently being implemented in th national law and will be effective from 25 May 2018. G4-PR8 In 2016 UBI Banca and the Group Network Banks received 178 complaints on the question of privacy, most of which (114) regarded cases of compulsory reporting of personal data on credit to institutional data banks (central credit bureaux: Centrale dei rischi, CRIF, etc.). No formal irregularities were reported concerning data treatment and no events occurred which resulted in the theft or loss of customer data.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 66-70 43 2016 Sustainability Report Operations rooted in local communities UBI Banca is mainly a retail bank, at the service of the real economy in the communities in which it operates. Its physical presence, although reduced and integrated by its digital banking services with a multichannel approach, remains essential for maintaining its local roots and its capacity to understand local social and economic dynamics. Funding and lending in local communities UBI-2 UBI Banca sets itself the objective of generating growth and well-being in the community to serve local economies, supporting families and businesses financially even at times of particular difficulty. By using families’ savings, the Group finances the life projects of families themselves and the business projects of firms, thereby creating a virtuous circle between savings, consumption and investments. It is particularly important in all credit and financing operations to assess a customer’s ability to meet the commitments they enter into. This is done to avoid the risk of over-indebtedness with serious repercussions both on the ability to gain access to new loans and on the quality of the Bank’s credit, which is one of the main indicators monitored by supervisory authorities and market regulators. Great attention is also placed on the different economic sectors in which firms operate. The objective is to propose initiatives to support those economic sectors with the best growth prospects and ability to innovate. Co-operation with local, national and EU authorities and institutions is also important in providing support for the financial requirements of businesses. These include trade associations and the associated guarantee bodies, the Guarantee Fund for SMEs pursuant to Law No. 662/1996, the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) through participation in the TLTRO long-term financing programme (so-called TLTRO II). More specifically, in this area in particular we underline Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria’s initiatives to support numerous local institutions with the stipulation and/or renewal of standing arrangements with local guarantee bodies and/or credit agreements, named local pacts, to encourage the development of firms. The main ones include Assolombarda and Unindustria Reggio Emilia (local branches of national employer associations). In December 2016, loans accounted for 72.8% of total consolidated assets and exceeded direct funding from individuals, firms and local authorities by €12.8 billion. The additional funding was acquired as a result of the Group’s ability to access the financial market and its intermediation activity in public sector funds, some of which subsidised, destined for small and medium-size enterprises.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 107-122 2016 2015 Direct L o an s Direct L o an s Thousands of euro fu n d in g 1 fu n d in g 1 Private individuals 48,628,034 28,481,023 54,470,444 29,604,220 Entities 1,293,606 532,917 1,319,212 592,735 Businesses 19,148,780 52,840,341 16,740,134 54,389,245 of which: small to medium-size businesses 2 n.d. 43,811,611 n.d. 45,362,291 TO TAL 6 9 ,0 7 0 ,4 2 1 8 1 ,8 5 4 ,2 8 0 7 2 ,5 2 9 ,7 9 0 8 4 ,5 8 6 ,2 0 0 1 Direct funding from ordinary customers, including funding from external distribution networks (former Centrobanca), allocated unde 2 The fig ure for 2015 has been restated following an update of the method used to calculate it. The fall in direct funding from private individuals is connected with both its conversion into indirect funding and the gradual reduction in former Centrobanca funding. In order to support the high propensity of Italian households to purchase their own homes, over 14 thousand mortgages were granted in 2016 for a total disbursement of over €2 billion (over 210 thousand mortgages with remaining principal debt of approximately €20 billion outstanding at the end of the year) inclusive of 1 mortgages for young couples and “atypical” workers , in addition to ordinary mortgages .  G4-FS7  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 50 Again in 2016 initiatives continued to support small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), focusing on those sectors representing Italian entrepreneurial excellence, such as the farm and food sector, commerce and the tourism and catering sectors. Our Farm&Food product range is of particular interest for the agricultural and food sector which makes an important contribution to national GDP thanks also to the growing world interest in “Made in Italy” brands. In this area, the Group has signed a memorandum of intent with the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MIPAAF) and has made a loan pool of €2 billion available to be used in investment programmes for the development of farm and food supply chains. 1 The loans granted and the remaining outstanding debt of the former Banca Regionale Europea and the former Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria are as at 31/10/2016. Operations rooted in local communities 44 Special loan pools are dedicated to support growth in new business ideas (Start-up Loan), female entrepreneurship (Invest in Women and Women in start-ups) and to encourage the recovery of SMEs and selfemployed women who are experiencing temporary difficulties as a result of the crisis (Women in business recovery). With its international presence [ G4-6] and with its UBI World programme (in partnership with members of the GoToWorld Consortium and SF Consulting), the Bank provides support to Italian business clients also on foreign markets to make sure they obtain the necessary financial assistance together with a series of support services for the internationalisation of their activities.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 5354 2016 2015 O p eratio n s o f th e year To tal o u tstan d in g O p eratio n s o f th e year To tal o u tstan d in g N u mb er Disb u rsed N u mb er R emain in g N u mb er Disb u rsed N u mb er o f R emain in g L O AN S TO SMAL L MEDIUM EN TER PR ISES o f lo an s (millions of euro) o f lo an s d eb t o f lo an s (millions of euro) lo an s d eb t (millions of euro) (millions of euro) 2015 Credit Accord 701 46.1 3,602 126.0 402 17.7 3,356 133.9 Italy Investment Projects CDP and developing businesses 696 45.4 3,597 125.3 395 17.2 3349 133,4 Public Administration (PA) Credit ABI and Businesses and PA 5 0.7 5 0.7 7 0.5 7 0.5 Subsidised public sector funding 18,030 4,787.8 39,636 8,448.1 16,936 4,849.5 28,952 6,209.9 European Central Bank TLTROs 16,379 4,156.7 30,513 6,916.6 15,817 4,479.0 17,604 4,635.7 European Investment Bank 1,641 613.9 3,499 1,362.2 772 340.7 1,957 1,283.8 Jobs for Youth EIB 10 17.2 35 36.8 11 17.3 26 29.4 Cassa Deposito e Prestiti 5,589 132.5 336 12.5 9,365 261.1 (CDP – state controlled fund and deposit institution) Guarantee bodies and guarantee funds 15,358 1,472.8 52,533 3,481.4 16,595 1,435.8 57,046 3,531.5 Loans backed by guarantee funds 9,503 787.2 37,759 2,089.7 11,047 855.3 43,061 2,328.2 SME guarantee fund Law No.662 5,600 679.5 13,425 1,368.2 5,278 574.6 12,650 1,178.6 Anti-usury credit lines 255 6.1 1,349 23.4 270 6.0 1,335 24.7 Group initiatives 127 3.7 1,030 18.8 206 5.8 1,093 25.8 SME development 56 1.8 441 10.2 96 3.1 469 14.7 Start-ups 71 1.9 589 8.6 110 2.8 624 11.1 Natural disasters 21 3.1 33 4.4 13 1.0 15 1,6 ABI/CDP reconstruction agreement 21 3.1 33 4.4 13 1.0 15 1,6 Female entrepreneurship 13 0.5 37 1.2 26 1.1 30 1.1 Invest in women 11 0.4 23 0.7 13 0.5 16 0.5 Women in start-ups 2 0.0 14 0.5 13 0.7 14 0.6 TO TAL 3 4 ,2 5 0 6 ,3 1 3 .9 9 6 ,8 7 1 1 2 ,0 7 9 .8 3 4 ,1 7 8 6 ,3 1 0 .9 9 0 ,4 9 2 9 ,9 0 3 .8 Following its implementation of Ministerial Decree No. 57/2014, the Group introduced special conditions 2 designed to facilitate the access to credit for companies in possession of Legality Ratings , which include giving these companies priority in loan approval processes. In 2016, 169 applications were received from companies in possession of legality ratings. The Group authorised 158 applications and declined 11 due to failure to report, or delay in reporting possession of the rating or alternatively in providing the documentation necessary for processing the loan application. With a broader vision than that of the legality rating, Banca Popolare Di Bergamo – in co-operation with the Chamber of Commerce and the City of Bergamo – has created a loan pool which proposes Corporate Social Responsibility (€30 million) to support companies in the province with the effective management of social and ethical impact issues both internally and with regard to the communities in which they operate. The perimeter of the recipients of the loan pool was extended in June 2016 to include companies that had suffered serious damage caused by the extremely bad weather that had hit the Bergamo area. In consideration of the importance acquired by the third sector in meeting the needs of communities, especially for the delivery of welfare services to the disadvantaged, in 2011 UBI Banca created a special service model and range of services with its UBI Comunità brand. It is managed by a unit of the same name which reports directly to the Chief Commercial Officer. Within UBI Comunità, the Third Sector and Civil Economy Service promotes and supports economic initiatives in partnership with the public, private and social private sectors, and supports high social impact investments and social enterprise programmes linked to local development and that of the community and new supply chains, where the Bank acts as a partner for the growth of both Church and non-Church nonprofit organisations. Relationships with nonprofit organisations (NPOs) are strategic for the Bank not only in terms of reputation and links with local communities, but also in commercial terms in consideration of the huge growth seen in this sector in Italy over the last two decades and because of the growing awareness of the important role that the civil economy can play in the economic and social development of the country. The Group holds a share of deposits and loans with these organisations which is much greater than that for the sector as a whole. 2 The Legality Rating is a merit instrument, which enables firms who possess it to gain benefits in terms of reputation and when gaining access to credit from banks and also for the purposes of obtaining financing from public administrations. The rating is valid for two years and may be renewed on request by the company concerned and it may take the form of a score ranging from a minimum of “one star” to a maximum of “three stars” on the basis of the requirements that the company possesses. 45 2016 Sustainability Report Deposits from non profit Loans to non profit organizations as organizations as percentage percentage of total loans of total deposit 3.64% 3.74% 0.95% 0.94% 3.59% 3.57% 3.49% 3.63% 0.93% 0.89% 0.84% 0.78% 0.51% 0.52% 0.52% 0.51% 0.49% 0.48% 1.66% 1.74% 1.74% 1.71% 1.74% 1.72% 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Sector UBI Group Sector UBI Group BASTRA data on sub-group 51 (nonprofit organisations) as at 31.12 of each year. Deposits are comprised of current accounts, deposits and certificates of deposit. 3 UBI Comunità Social Bonds are of particular importance in the Group’s support for the third sector and these continue to enjoy success with investors and are also extremely unique. These are bond instruments where, in addition to providing remuneration of the investment made by subscribers at a market interest rate, they also involve a commitment on the part of the issuing bank to allocate a portion of the funding acquired (e.g. 0.50%) to support projects of high social value for communities [G4-EC1], and/or to create a loan pool for the disbursement of finance to nonprofit organisations. UBI Banca, in co-operation with CGM (CGM – the Gino Mattarelli national consortium of social co-operation) and CGM Finance (established in 2012 with the issue of a social bond), supports social enterprises to promote, to start up or to accelerate social innovation and economically sustainable growth programmes, by facilitating access by consortiums and their social cooperatives members to banking products and services under attractive terms and conditions. To-date 27 loans have been granted for a total amount of over €6 million (€3.5 million in 2016). Since 2015 the structuring of social bonds by the Parent also involves measurement of the social impact of the projects supported by using social return on investment (SROI) methods. This instrument, which was extended in 2016 to include Sicav Social 4 Future [ UBI-5] , is a distinguishing feature of the Group in the sector nationally and is of great value in terms of accountability to the customers who subscribe them and to stakeholders in general. At the same time it allows intervention to be directed towards initiatives that have a greater impact on change.  www.ubibanca.com/Social_bond  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 57-59 Support for households and businesses in difficulty UBI-3 As part of its mission to support the development of the economy in order to generate shared value for the community in the medium to long-term, UBI Banca pursues commercial and credit policies designed to meet the real needs of different groups in society and categories of businesses [FS7] (small businesses and small to medium-size enterprises in particular) and of professional communities and non-profit organisations. In order to respond to important social causes and the expectations of the specific groups of vulnerable stakeholders, the Bank has defined subsidised terms and conditions or carried out charitable initiatives as follows: • anti-crisis intervention for families, either with its own or sector-wide initiatives to facilitate access to credit above all with regard to home purchase mortgages and agreements for advances on Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria (the extraordinary state redundancy/lay-off scheme) benefits. Initiatives in Lombardy designed to increase access to credit for ordinary employees and workers already affected by the crisis and company reorganisations and restructurings, include specific agreements signed under the banner of Social Advances (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni in deroga – the exceptional state redundancy/lay-off scheme, Cassa Integrazione Guadagni Straordinaria the extraordinary state redundancy/lay-off scheme and Contratti di Solidarietà – trade union agreements to reduce working hours) with Finlombarda and the Foundazione Welfare Ambrosiano (FWA), while in the Marches Region Banca Popolare di Ancona has renewed an agreement with the Cassa Edile di Perugia for the grant of subsidised loans to workers in the building industry (it has allocated finance to a special guarantee fund); • the fight against usury, with loans guaranteed as part of local community agreements with foundations in order to assist individuals at risk of usury, (according to the criteria established by the Regulation to implement Art. 15 of law No. 108) and with pawn credit business; 3 UBI Banca has received important acknowledgements over the years for its UBI Comunità Social Bonds the most important of which was the National Prize for Innovation awarded in 2013 by the President of the Italian Republic. Operations rooted in local communities 46 • anti-crisis measures for businesses with the deferment of capital repayment instalments on mortgages, loans and leases and the extension of the repayment schedules for mortgages and of the due dates for short-term loans or for agricultural working capital credit, based either on our own or 4 sector-wide initiatives. More specifically, the Group adhered to the 2015 Accord for Credit – an initiative promoted by the Italian Banking Association and the main employers’ associations; • support for households and businesses hit by natural disasters or by exceptionally severe weather, with the creation of special loan pools and through adherence to sector initiatives or the application of legislative provisions. Following the earthquakes which hit central Italy in August and October 2016, in addition to measures taken by government to support the earthquake victims, Banca Popolare di Ancona allocated €10 million to a loan pool to provide concrete help to families, businesses and companies in the community, assisting with the repair of buildings and the recovery of businesses and it also immediately introduced the possibility to defer repayments on mortgages and loans of all types for 12 months.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 55-57 2016 2015 O p eratio n s o f th e year O p eratio n s o f th e year DEF ER R AL /EXTEN SIO N O F MO R TGAGES TO HO USEHO L DS R emain in g R emain in g N u mb er N u mb er d eb t d eb t Initiatives bank 6,266 476.2 5,172 502.4 System initiatives (ABI) 48 5.2 137 14.0 TO TAL 6 ,3 1 4 4 8 1 .4 5 ,3 0 9 5 1 6 .4 2016 2015 O p eratio n s o f th e year O p eratio n s o f th e year DEF ER R AL /EXTEN SIO N O F MO R TGAGES TO SMAL L MEDIUM R emain in g R emain in g EN TER PR ISES N u mb er d eb t N u mb er d eb t (millions of euro) (millions of euro) Initiatives bank 3,469 801.0 2,878 915.2 System initiatives (ABI) 530 174.1 995 349.0 TO TAL 3 ,9 9 9 9 7 5 .1 3 ,8 7 3 1 ,2 6 4 .2 Development of local infrastructures UBI Banca has developed specific expertise in the provision of finance for local infrastructures, a sector of primary importance for the growth of local economies and communities. With its project finance, the Group supports investments for the development of the local realities in which it operates, with particular reference to the environment (renewable energy [FS8]), mobility (highways, metropolitan railways, airports), utilities (water and gas mains) and health (hospitals). The most important of the operations concluded in 2016 regarded participation, together with a pool of banks (€461.5 million – UBI Banca’s quota came to €53 million), in the financing for SGI (Macquarie) to enlarge the natural gas distribution network. In addition to highway infrastructures, we also report participation in financing amounting to €30 million for a residential healthcare facility.

The Bank’s activities are implemented in the highly developed context of Italian and European regulations and they mainly involve investments in infrastructures and for the generation of energy from renewable sources. In order to receive finance, projects must have passed the authorisation procedures set under Italian law (environmental impact assessment, declaration of the start of activity, single authorisations, economic/financial sustainability, building permits, etc.) and the technical, legal, administrative and insurance assessments performed on behalf of the Bank by major independent advisors of international standing. Operations rooted in local communities 48 Involvement in local communities UBI Banca carries out its mission as a bank in the community by being close to families and firms in times of difficulty and by supporting important social causes and projects. It acts as a driver not only for local economies, but also for communities supporting their growth by both its banking operations and its philanthropic action to support social initiatives. This is a virtuous circle which creates community development and favours the creation of strong relationships with authorities, institutions and social organisations. Dialogue with and support for local institutions Through its constant collaboration with schools, universities, local institutions and research centres, the bank contributes to the promotion and dissemination of a culture of finance and financial knowledge among individuals, firms and communities [UBI-4]. The Group has well-established relations with numerous schools and universities (the Bocconi, Cattolica, Bicocca and state universities of Milan, the universities of Bergamo, Brescia, Pavia, Turin, Trento and Bologna, the Insubria University of Varese, the Carlo Cattaneo University of Castellanza, the Polytechnic University of the Marches, the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, the University of Padua and Verona, the LUISS and Tor Vergata universities of Rome , the University of Bari, the Federico II University of Naples, the Bocconi SDA and the Sole 24 Ore Business School. The main recurring initiatives include the following: • the Alternating School Work programmes, which involved over 200 pupils in 2016 from 10 schools in the Bergamo area and which will be extended in 2017 to the main centres in which the Group is present; • collaboration with the Polytechnic University of the Marches on the World Campus project established to support and spread technological and training innovation among university students through internships abroad; • the organisation of “CV advice” sessions and aptitude and career counselling for university students, including collaboration on the Bocconi University “Per Orientarsi al Lavoro POL Project” (a work orientation project), in an employer branding context; • university masters courses in collaboration with Bergamo University for the development of the Group’s “young talents”, the continuation of that managed with MIP – the Milan Polytechnic Business School. In the commercial area, with its treasury and cashier services, the Group supports almost 1,700 public institutions and authorities in their receipt, reporting and reconciliation activities for their tax revenues and capital income and it makes substantial contributions to support their social and institutional aims.  G4-EC1  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 5859 Measures taken for social initiatives G4-EC1 The Group provides support with donations and sponsorships for activities and projects to protect and enhance our historical, cultural and natural heritage, to educate and train young people, to conduct scientific, academic and humanitarian research and to provide assistance with health and welfare, the arts, sports and recreation. This activity is conducted following a solidarity and subsidiarity approach and it involves a huge number of nonprofit organisations, both church and non-church, of local, national and international importance. The funds used come from special budgets allocated from year to year and also from retained earnings (the “Board’s Fund”), where provided for in the Articles of Association.

The donations, whether occasional or recurring or within the framework of key partnerships lasting several years, are designed to promote and enhance the identity of the Group and individual network banks, with no correlation with the achievement of commercial objectives, except for those of social marketing initiatives. 49 2016 Sustainability Report 1 With sponsorships , Group Banks associate their brands with organisations and initiatives able to generate a positive return in terms of image, that is often an expression of their history and tradition in their respective local communities. Before the merger of the network banks into UBI Banca, completed in February 2017, decisions were taken by these at local level with the support of UBI Banca for the more far reaching initiatives, based not on rigid and predetermined policies and guidelines, but on assessments based on criteria of the consistency, efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives and projects found in the community. For charitable donations already in 2016, allocations at UBI Banca from the “Board’s Fund” of budgets to the various sectors of intervention were made on the basis of an Annual intervention plan approved by the Supervisory Board on the basis of proposals formulated by the Chairman, subject to prior consultation with the Senior Deputy Chairman. The proposals and projects were drawn up in consultation with the Chair of the Management Board and taking account of her recommendations. As part of the revision of the Group’s organisational model, which occurred at the time of the implementation of the Single Bank Project, in November 2016 the Supervisory Board drew up special guidelines on the question of donations, which regarded centralised management of the articles of association-related fund (pursuant to Art. 44.3 of UBI Banca’s Articles of Association) and the criteria for the distribution of funds among the Macro Geographical Areas (MGAs). The “Regulation for the process to manage UBI Banca’s charitable donations” was drawn up on the basis of these guidelines, the final version of which was approved th by the Supervisory Board on 14 February 2017, after prior examination of it by the Management Board. The approval of that regulation constituted the preparatory stage for an annual plan of intervention by UBI Banca, th approved for 2017 by the Supervisory Board on 7 March after preliminary assessment by the Appointments Committee. With the new organisational model, Group donations are mainly approved by the UBI Banca Supervisory Board for the more far reaching interventions (normally inter-regional) and by the individual MGAs for intervention of a local nature, as well as by the foundations formed within the Group, which continue to operate independently in compliance with their own constitutions, using their respective endowments which may be supplemented by contributions from the Group. In order to ensure more effective relations with local communities, a “Local Operational Team” has been formed for every MGA where each MGA Manager will be accompanied by a specially designated Member of the Supervisory Board with experience of the relative local area, with support from the UBI Comunità Area manager and the head of the Corporate Social Responsibility Function.

Involvement in local communities 50 In compliance with the new Group policies, in 2016 important strategic partnerships were either created or confirmed with leading nonprofit organisations, which included the following: • the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC) for which UBI Banca has been an institutional partner since 2013 for the fundraising campaign entitled I giorni della Ricerca – “Research Days”, through various initiatives (e.g. fundraising in branches and through internet banking, “payroll giving”, the UBI Comunità EnjoyCard customised for the AIRC, the proposal to use SDD direct debits for recurring donations and innovative functions for sending money using UBI Pay, which allows customers to make a donation using their smart phones with the Jiffy network) targeted at both customers and Group staff. The 2016 campaign enjoyed great popularity on national and local media and it enabled the AIRC to raise approximately €5.4 million, of which almost €700 thousand attributable to the initiatives launched by the Group. The Group has donated approximately €3 million to support scientific research in the field of oncology since 2013. In 2016 the partnership with the AIRC was extended to include the “Oranges of Health” campaign at the end of January and the AIRC-Giunti School project. This was an educational programme, sponsored by the MIUR – Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and targeted at primary school classes IV and V in which over 800 schools and approximately 75,000 children/families were involved; • the Gemelli-Medicinema Hospital Foundation, Save the Children, Unicef, Focsiv (international Christian voluntary work organisation) and AISM (Italian Multiple Sclerosis association), which saw the UBI Banca Group support the following campaigns by making available numerous fund-raising instruments and channels and by increasing awareness of them by the Group's customers and staff: The magic of cinema becomes therapy at the Gemelli; Let’s illuminate the future; Youth & Innovation Lebanon; We smiled for something serious; “La gardenia” of AISM; • the Accenture Foundation and the Bracco Foundation for the organisation of the national Welfare what a business! competition, in co-operation with and with the scientific assistance of the Milan Polytechnic and Aiccon and with the involvement of the incubators Polimi Hub and Campus Goel. The competition was aimed at social start-ups defined as nonprofit organisations in operation for not more than 36 months and generated great interest with over 50 projects entered. UBI Banca made a loan of up to €50,000 available for each winner from the UBI Comunità line of products, interest free and unsecured, together with an “Online Nonprofit Account” with 36 months free of bank charges. 2 • with the launch of the fundraising campaign CESVI sUBIto to help farmers in the province of Rieti, hit by the earthquake, the CESVI Foundation put small and medium-size firms and direct sales of milk back into operation, in co-operation with farmers associations. More specifically, equipment was provided to start animal rearing activities again, such as milking trolleys, refrigerators, milk processing tanks, curdling and whey equipment, electricity generators. In 2016 the Group made donations for social initiatives totalling €13.9 million, down by 7.1% on 2015, of which: • €5.2 million drawn from articles of association-related retained earnings reserves of UBI Banca and the Network Banks available to management bodies for social purposes, net of sums paid to Group Foundations (€1.9 million); • €5.6 million as operating expenses of UBI Banca, the Network Banks and other Group companies, including charitable donations resulting from the placement of UBI Comunità Social Bonds; • €3.1 million by the Foundations. An important role is played by UBI Comunità social bonds and Social 4 Future Sicav’s (€688 thousand) in the generation of funds for donation to social activities and by contributions made to local authorities as part of treasury and collection services (€3.4 million). Since their launch in 2012 and until the end of 2016, the Group has supported 82 important social projects in the community with the issue of an equal number of social bonds, to acquire funding of approximately €878.2 million and to make charitable donations of over €4 million. Ten social bonds were placed in 2016 for a total of €132 million (seven of which issued by the Parent for a total of €112 million), which allowed charitable donations of €425 thousand to be made. In this context we highlight the placement of social bonds for €40 million issued on behalf of the Confederazione Nazionale delle Misericordie d'Italia (National Confederation of the Misericordie d’Italia voluntary associations) for the construction of a new anti-seismic school at Acquasanta Terme (province of Ascoli Piceno), because the previous school was no longer safe as a consequence of the earthquake that hit central Italy. UBI Banca also decided to make a donation of €500 thousand to fund the reconstruction of school. The innovative Social 4 Future Sicav was placed with two subscription periods (February and November 2016) for a total of €386 million, allowing a donation of €270 thousand to be made to the UNICEF Youth & Innovation Lebanon project to rehabilitate hundreds of Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese adolescents at high risk of vulnerability into society and to start them with jobs. 2 CESVI sUBIto is a fundraising initiative targeted at Group customers and staff to support projects of the CESVI Foundation to assist with humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters. The initiative was launched in 2008 after the Sidr cyclone hit Bangladesh and it was revived for subsequent emergencies in Burma (2009), Pakistan (2010), the Horn of Africa (2011), the Philippines (2013) and Nepal (2015). 51 2016 Sustainability Report  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 57-58 The main donations made by the Group’s foundations include the following: • for the UBI per Varese ONLUS Foundation the restoration of the Asilo Veratti (nursery school) at Varese (€15 thousand), the purchase of interactive whiteboards for the Liceo da Vinci di Gallarate high school (€15 thousand), the restoration of the bell tower of Parish of San Vittore at Varese (€25 thousand), the restoration of the arch along the “via Sacra” of the Sacro Monte di Varese (sacred mount of Varese) (€15 thousand); • for the Banca Popolare Bergamo Foundation, the purchase of a multidisciplinary ultrasound machine for the Gazzaniga Hospital of the Bolognini di Seriate Hospital Authority (€70 thousand), support for the 2016 edition of Bergamo Science (€80 thousand); a donation to the Diocese of Bergamo for the restoration of historical artistic buildings in the province supervised by the official “Superintendent” (third and last instalment of €150 thousand, out of a total of €450 thousand); support for the activities of the Modern and Contemporary Art Gallery of Bergamo (second instalment of €75 thousand, out of a total of €225 thousand); • for the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation, a donation to Opera per l'Educazione Cristiana for the organisation of the XIII Colloquio Internazionale di Studio (international study conference) and for printing editions 71 and 72 of the Notiziario dell'Istituto Paolo VI (Paul VI news bulletin) (€100 thousand); a payment to the Diocese of Brescia – Pastoral Office of the Brescia Caritas – for running the “Madre Eugenia Menni” people’s canteen for the needy (€50 thousand); improvements to the physics laboratories and upgrades of the classrooms and laboratories at the Catholic University (€95 thousand); • for the CAB Foundation – Giovanni Folonari Institute of Culture, support to Brescia University for the publication of Volume IV of Annali Storia Bresciana (annals of Brescia’s history) (€10 thousand); donation for the Benedetti Michelangeli Prize awarded to internationally famed musicians and/or “young talents”, in co-operation with the Teatro Grande di Brescia Foundation (€5 thousand); payment to the Ugo da Como di Lonato del Garda Foundation for the purchase of a statue of Arnaldo da Brescia in Carrara marble by O. Tabacchi, the original of the current statue located in the square of the same name in Brescia (€5 thousand); • for the Banca Popolare di Vigevano Foundation, social, welfare and cultural support for a total of €31 thousand. Particular emphasis was placed on the social sector with initiatives aimed at schools on the subjects of living together, cohesion and violence to women; on the welfare sector with intervention in favour of children living in families in difficulty for food and medical necessities; in the field of the arts with the restoration of the sculpture and painting of two statues of the Apostles, St Simon and St Matthew and the publication of the catalogue of an exhibition by the Vigevano artist Carlo Zanoletti. Again in 2016 UBI Sistemi e Servizi – the Group’s service consortium company – donated retired electronic equipment, which nevertheless still functions well (61 notebooks, desktops, banknote counting machines and photocopiers) to 24 schools, institutions and nonprofit organisations with an estimated value of over €5,400. Group employees were again involved in charitable initiatives through participation in the following voluntary schemes: • ProSolidar, a national fund in the credit sector for solidarity and charitable initiatives consisting of a bilateral entity managed by the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of the banking trade unions. It is the first body in the world formed by a national trade union agreement and it is funded on an equal basis by workers and companies. Each employee may contribute a sum of €6 per year deducted directly from salary, against which the company pays in an equal amount (for a total of over €187 thousand in 2016); • charity projects organised by the bank or in which it participates. A charity project was started in 2016 for the people of central Italy hit by an earthquake. Organised by the Italian Banking Association and sector trade unions, it involved a voluntary payment of €10 deducted from salary, to which the bank added a donation of the same amount, for a total of over €55 thousand); • Donate one day, a company voluntary project, organised for the third consecutive year, by which employees can spend one day of their holidays doing voluntary work in a nonprofit organisation which they have chosen from among those selected by UBI Banca in co-operation with the Sodalitas Foundation [ G4-16]. In the 2016, 1,245 employees took part, who were able to choose from among 150 projects of 70 nonprofit organisations located in 34 towns and cities distributed across the country in 14 regions. Over the three-year period, participation has reached 15% of the total workforce with approximately 20 thousand hours of voluntary work donated and a total contribution of €285 thousand. • Enjoy Special Edition, an account card specially for Group employees, with customised graphics and the ability to support social projects simply by using the card. The Group banks that issue the cards 3 waive their interbank commissions on the POS terminal transactions , which are donated entirely to the social project chosen each year by employees themselves by means of a survey carried out on UBILife the corporate intranet portal. In 2016 over €15 thousand was donated to the charity project 3 As a result of Regulation EU 2015/751, from December 2015 the percentage commission on POS transactions was reduced by about one third compared with before, which affected the amount donated to the winning project. Involvement in local communities 52 Dimissioni Protette (protected hospital discharge) run by the Seneca Onlus Association, which came first out of the five projects selected for the 2016 Sodalitas Social Innovation Prize [ G4-16]. Commercially the UBI Comunità Social Edition initiative is also continuing. This involves the issue of an Enjoy UBI Comunità prepaid card, customised with the logos of the nonprofit organisations for which they are issued, on which the Banca waives its right to part of the commissions, which it donates to the nonprofit organisation. Customised cards for 6 NPOs were issued in 2016, including AIDO Lombardia and AIRC, for a total of around 10,000 cards, of which 8,100 are active, to generate a donation of about €6,800. When the partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) was entered into, which involves the marketing of the prepaid Enjoy NBA card, UBI Banca donated €5.00 for each card issued to a Group employee (€6,310 at the end of 2016) to the Federazione Italiana Pallacanestro in Carrozzina (FIPIC – Italian Wheelchair Basketball Federation).  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 60 G4-SO6 No payments – neither direct nor indirect and in any form – are permitted to: political parties, movements, political committees and other political organisations, their representatives and candidates, congresses or festivals with political propaganda purposes. Financial education UBI-4 Understanding trends on financial markets and the characteristics of different financial instruments is seen increasingly as an effective instrument for the protection of investors, because it helps spread economic and financial expertise among the public that is useful for making knowledgeable investment decisions that are consistent with a person’s risk profile. It helps create citizens who are more knowledgeable in their choice of banking products and services, growth in economic democracy and legality and makes the business environment and local economies more competitive. In this context, UBI Banca has built relationships over the years and forms of co-operation with various realities in the community that work in this field. It takes an active part in the initiatives of the Foundation for Financial Education and Savings (FEDUF) created by the Italian Banking Association and it works with private sector organisations and institutions that help to spread financial education initiatives even outside schools and in different groups in society. It organises and/or takes part in events, conventions and seminars to educate and examine economic and financial matters, such as the cycle of meetings on the Italian economy held in co-operation with the Studi Einaudi Centre, and to support the Italian business community both at home and abroad.  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 59 The Group’s contribution – which represents around 20% of the total activity carried out by banks adhering to FEDUF – is focused on three educational programmes, for different age groups, that are now well established and constantly updated and enhanced, partly as a result of support from academics and communication experts, as follows: • Kids, for primary school children, to stimulate initial thinking about the value of money and the need to manage it responsibly, for themselves and for the community, with a view to knowledgeable citizenship; • Junior, to introduce secondary school pupils to economic and financial subjects and to stimulate them to reflect on the principal functions of finance, by illustrating their impact on people’s everyday lives; • Teens, to teach economics and financial subjects, by introducing upper secondary school children to the social, professional and economic reality that surrounds them. At the end of the course in the classroom, the participants may take part in a national competition entitled Mamma che impresa! and Che Impresa, Ragazzi!, the first of which involves the publication of stories written by students in a book of winning business stories (Storie di impresa (av)vincenti), while the second awards a prize to the class that draws up the best business plan for the start-up of a socially useful enterprise in the community. Group banks, again in co-operation with FEDUF, contributed to the organisation of further important events , which included Scegli cosa voglio, a show/conference on financial issues, which involved approximately 4,800 students and adults throughout the country and the Festival €cono-mix, Le giornate dell’educazione finanziaria, a project created to promote a new culture of economic citizenship among new generations. The first edition of this initiative in Lombardy and Piedmont (after Latium, Tuscany, Campania, Marches and Molise) saw the participation of Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia and Banca Regionale Europea in a series of meetings which involved many pupils from primary and secondary schools on a variety of arguments, including “Become sustainable citizens”, “Pay 2.0 the money of the future”, “Once upon a time there was human capital”. Banca Regionale Europea, in co-operation with FEDUF and the Town of Tortona, organised a project Education for economic citizenship in schools to develop greater knowledge of the value of money, savings and legality. The protagonists of the project were pupils from primary schools in the Tortona area to which the Town had made a donation of €50 at the beginning of the year to start off their savings with the supervision of parents and teachers. Again in co-operation with FEDUF, the Bank organised education for a Group of fifty journalists 53 2016 Sustainability Report aimed at creating more awareness on these subjects among these information professionals, thereby addressing the need to raise the level of the definition of the contents to be transmitted, the segments of the population to be involved and the tools to be used. Important activities were also sponsored by Banca di Valle Camonica through the Educate to citizenship initiative with the objective of developing a sense of civic responsibility and legality and greater awareness of these matters among new generations. Primary and secondary schools were involved through a series of meetings, subsequent teaching events and a final convention. The initiative by Banca Popolare di Bergamo, in co-operation with the Bergamo UNICEF Committee, to organise a course on legality entitled All on the same scales and also on the subject of the forgery of payment systems is also worthy of note. The objective of the course, designed for schools and also with participation by bank staff, was education on legality, seeking to create the necessary ethical and cultural conditions for strong opposition to all forms of criminality and for greater knowledge of the importance of integrity in legal relations, of safeguarding individual rights and of the rejection of all types of abuse of power. A total of 56 primary and lower and upper secondary schools were involved in the academic year 2015-2016 for a total of around 8,000 pupils.

In line with the national scenario that has been profoundly modified by recent changes to regulations and in response to the rapid transformation of market paradigms, UBI Banca continued again in 2016 with its programme to update its personnel management policies, and as a consequence was again 1 internationally certified as a “Top Employer” . Employment and turnover G4-LA1 Staff numbers in the Group have reduced progressively in recent years, as a consequence of action taken to streamline the organisational structure and the branch network in order to increase efficiency and profitability. Group policy on this matter is based on criteria of the social sustainability of the action taken. This action is always carried out on the basis of specific agreements with trade unions which involve forms of protection to re-appoint the staff involved in reorganisation plans to new positions and to resort, on a voluntary basis, to forms of flexible working and early retirement incentive schemes, associated with generation turnover plans. The change of role and retraining processes are accompanied by special training programmes, with a view to enhancing human and professional resources. [G4-LA4] Geographical mobility is an important component of the employment conditions of personnel for companies that are distributed across large geographical areas. Mobility policies which form part of the tools used to manage reorganisation processes are oriented towards managing this process insofar as is possible as both an opportunity for career growth and to satisfy requests by staff to move closer to home. Priority is given in accepting requests to move closer to home to the requirements of employees working in professional fields and to those who have been working for at least two years in organisational units at travelling distances of over 40 km (to and from work) from their homes. Moving personnel closer to their homes may result in new or different duties from those performed in their original organisational units.

More specifically, employer branding and recruiting activity conducted in co-operation with local universities and academic institutions allowed young university graduates with high potential to be identified. Also with regard to the recruitment of professionals and senior managers, the career profiles assessed were of people mainly resident in Lombardy, where the Group’s headquarters and policymaking and supervisory activities are concentrated. Nine new senior managers were recruited in 2016 on the outside market. Benefits All Group employees, whether full-time or part-time, benefit, depending on the company to which they G4-LA2 belong, from a substantial corporate welfare package, which involves the following: • forms of supplementary pension and health benefits, with the possibility to participate in supplementary pension schemes either internal or external, benefiting from a defined contribution from the employer under supplementary company labour agreements (employees may also pay a portion of their salary into supplementary pension schemes) [G4-EC3]; • insurance cover against the risk of death or permanent disablement caused by accidents, whether workrelated or not, and the risk of death from illness; • welfare services, which include company crèches, company cultural and recreational clubs, holiday accommodation facilities at tourist locations at attractive prices and shuttle bus services provided for travel to-and-from work at work places with large concentrations of personnel, special terms and conditions for banking charges and commissions, for loans to purchase a home and for credit lines (in line with the best market conditions); • lump-sums granted as gifts on particularly significant occasions such as marriages, births, adoptions and university graduations; • scholarship grants for employees who are students and for children who are students; • cash grants to support single income families or families with disabled members. 2016 2015 2014 CO STS IN CUR R ED CO STS IN CUR R ED CO STS IN CUR R ED N O .

Priority is given in allowing part-time work contracts to applicants with good grounds and in particular to those justified by the need to care for children, whether biological or fostered (below maximum junior school age) or by serious family reasons and/or because of the health of the applicant, a spouse, first degree relatives and person’s under the legal guardianship of the applicant. Smart working has been introduced experimentally for approximately 200 staff (74 in 2015) as a proposal to solve problems and as an innovative way of working, which facilitates reconciliation between home and working life, greater productivity and environmental sustainability. UBI Banca has educated management and all employees on this question, it has carried out a survey to assess the number of potential smartworkers within the Group and it has started to monitor the experiences of existing smartworkers for the development of the project. In 2016 3,013 days were spent smart working, both in co-working spaces in some major towns and cities and at home, with savings of 300,000 km and 6,000 hours of travelling to and from work. As a sign of solidarity, the Bank is attentive to the needs of families going through particularly difficult times. Since 2002 the families of employees both in service and retired, with disabled children who are not self-sufficient, have been able to count on the support of the Clematis Onlus Association (www.clematisonlus.org), created on the initiative of a group of employees and supported financially by the Group. The association has signed an insurance agreement to provide the disabled children with an annual supplementary, index-linked income, currently of €12,000 payable on the death of both parents and it also pays grants toward the costs of “rehabilitation training” and for the purchase of facilities. Seventy two families have taken advantage of the insurance agreement – of which 35 are families of retired employees – for 75 disabled children. On the subject of pensions, coverage for commitments resulting from internal funds, consisting of defined G4-EC3 benefits and having the nature of items on companies’ balance sheets, is performed by allocating amounts to the “provision for risks and charges: pension and similar obligations”, which are subject to periodic actuarial measurement in compliance with IAS 19 “Employee benefits”. Return to work from parental leave The management of leave for births or adoption of children is carried out in compliance with Italian legislation G4-LA3 on parental leave, which provides for a compulsory period of leave, normally during the two months prior to 2 the presumed date of childbirth and three months after childbirth, and leave from work is optional .

Organisational change management G4-LA4 The scenario in Italy is one of a high level of worker protection which UBI Banca considers its duty to maintain both on a daily basis and with regard to the management of large organisational changes; it is a duty which goes beyond mere compliance with regulations. National collective bargaining sets not only minimum wage levels, but also a minimum period for trade union negotiations of 45 days to protect workers before substantial organisational changes take place. UBI Banca has always approached these negotiations with a view to seeking shared solutions, wherever possible, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue which goes even beyond this regulatory limit. Work with trade union representatives was intense in 2016 with 92 meetings held for a total of over 690 hours. The Single Bank Project led to the signing of a Memorandum of Intent in December which regulates measures to ensure the efficiency and productivity of the Group in compliance with the objectives of the 2019-2020 Business Plan and it also confirmed the action taken regarding staff and flexible working hours designed to facilitate a balance between private and working life [G4-LA2].  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 74 Health and safety at work According to the definition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. Italian legislation is also based on that same concept (Legislative Decree No. 81/08 Art. 2 paragraph 0) and UBI Banca adopts it too. Therefore organisational well-being is the objective that UBI Banca pursues on health and safety at the workplace issues with policies and processes oriented towards the substantial and not merely formal application of the regulations. This is also pursued in the knowledge of achieving both a greater competitive advantage as a result of higher productivity and improved performance by workers (less absenteeism [G4-LA6] and staff turnover [G4-LA1] and greater customer satisfaction) and savings for society in general in terms of both tangible and intangible social costs generated for example by accidents [G4-LA6], operating errors, legal disputes, insurance claims, litigation and care expenses. The scientific literature has shown that organisational well-being is strongly associated with factors such as the corporate climate, the commitment of employees, work satisfaction and the work-private life balance. Account is taken of these factors by the health and safety at the workplace management system (HSMS), which also constitutes the concrete implementation of the guidelines contained in the Model of Management and Organisation provided for by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and in the UNI-INAIL (Italian standards authority and Italian national accident insurance institute) guidelines. G4-LA5 The main regulatory reference for health and safety at the workplace is Legislative Decree No. 81/2008 and subsequent amendments, the provisions of which are applied in all Group companies operating within Italy. Responsibilities on this matter are centralised in the Health & Safety Manager Function on the staff of the Chief Operating Officer and they are exercised by means of a regulation to implement corporate policies on the matter which lay down the following: • the duties and responsibilities of the various persons directly involved (the Official Employer, Senior Management, Delegates, Manager of the Prevention and Protection Service; Corporate Physician) and the company and Group units involved in the implementation of policies (the Human Resources Departments of the various companies, UBISS Real Estate, Purchases and Core Applications & Operation Services, UBI Academy); • processes for the active and knowledgeable involvement of personnel; • lines of reporting between the various units and mechanisms for the integration of the HSMS in corporate processes; • processes for the planning, monitoring and periodic review of the effectiveness of the system itself, 59 2016 Sustainability Report explicitly recommended in UNI-INAIL guidelines. In accordance with article 35 of Legislative Decree No. 81/2008 and in implementation of Management System mechanisms, periodic meetings are held in all companies, attended by company representatives (the employer and its representatives), the manager and the staff of the Prevention and Protection Service, the Corporate Physician and workers safety representatives, where appointed. Additional meetings are held, sometimes separately, between the Prevention and Protection Service and each of the parties mentioned above, to study specific issues in detail. The Manager of the Prevention and Protection Service, who is also the manager of the HSMS, is also periodically convened by the 231 (administrative liability) Supervisory Bodies and takes part, as Group representative, in the proceedings of the health and safety working group formed as part of the Trade Union and Labour Department of the Italian Banking Association Trade Association. All actions undertaken have the dual objective of regulatory compliance and risk reduction, with the benefit also of savings on costs due to the reduction in the number of accidents and the lower insurance premiums that INAIl charges companies that can demonstrate that they have adopted virtuous practices on prevention and protection from occupational risks. Prevention relies primarily on constant monitoring of the adequacy of workplaces and equipment. In this respect, technical specifications have been refined for external suppliers, who are required both to document the conformity of their activities in greater detail and to update IT procedures already available to Group staff for reporting the emergence of new risks and/or malfunctions. Projects to build new premises or to refurbish existing premises involve prior examination of documents by the Prevention and Protection Service, which programmes on-site conformity inspections on completion of the works and the entry into service of the premises. From the more specific viewpoint of health, the activities of corporate physicians provide continuous monitoring of the state of health of personnel and the healthiness of working environments both by means of the annual plan of periodic checkups for staff (compulsory health screening by law) and by on-site inspections of working environments. Staff may report specific problems to the corporate physician by means of a dedicated and confidential email address. Other important aspects include work-related stress assessment, conducted and monitored, amongst other things, by means of the subjective perceptions of employees by means of special questionnaires and the management of the impacts of criminal events to which distribution network staff in particular are exposed. The progressive emergence of a new type of aggression, mainly verbal, but also physical perpetrated by customers as a consequence of a deterioration in their socio-economic conditions and connected with more rigid rules for granting credit has resulted in the extension of psychological assistance to include these situations as well. Fortunately, yet again in 2016, the cases that actually occurred were both extremely limited in number and in the seriousness of the events. Training (33,842 hours in 2016) is the second cornerstone of prevention designed to achieve maximum diffusion of the concept of “participated safety”. The training programmes are prepared in co-operation with UBI Academy and the corporate physicians with account taken of the different levels of risk to which employees are exposed as a function of their individual roles. The degree to which these are completed by each employee is monitored by means of an integrated IT system which is used to programme training activity and report on it at individual company level. A special section on health and safety is maintained and kept upto-date on the UBI Life intranet portal on which the following can be easily found: references to laws and corporate regulations; news on safety organisation in the Group (e.g. emergency plans and exit routes to follow in different premises illustrated by actual photographs); material used in classroom training initiatives; and also useful advice and information on correct life-styles to keep in good physical and mental condition. In accordance with the annual frequency required by HSMS procedures, again in 2016 monitoring was carried out in all units concerned by an outside independent auditor from a leading consulting firm. All activities to implement the Health and Safety at the Workplace Management System are accounted for and reported and specific meetings are held with Senior Management to review them in order to verify that goals have been achieved and to set future goals. G4-LA6 No fatal accidents occurred either travelling to and from or at work in 2016.

G4-LA7 An examination of data on accidents finds no categories of workers more exposed to others at risk of accidents in relation to their occupational role. Again in 2016 the highest percentage of accidents recorded continues to be that relating to events occurring 61 2016 Sustainability Report to employees in travelling to and from work [G4-LA6], a risk to which all employees are exposed without 3 distinction . The number of accidents occurring while travelling on business is also very small notwithstanding the significant number of staff who use company cars on a daily basis to carry out their working activities and the total number of kilometres travelled. As concerns the risk of suffering mental or physical harm during the course of robberies or being involved in aggression by customers, a total of three events occurred accounting for 6.12% of injuries occurring at the workplace and 1.61% of total injuries recorded. G4-LA8 The Group applies specific agreements for the different health and safety matters regarding workers on the basis of agreements signed nationally. In 2016 a new agreement was signed at national level between the Italian Banking Association and trade unions in the banking sector, in implementation of the postponement imposed by law on sector negotiations, in order to regulate the election of workers’ safety representatives (number, procedures for nomination and election) and the instruments used to carry out their functions. The agreement introduced important new changes with respect to the previous agreement dating back to 1997. It introduced criteria for calculations at Group level and not just at individual company level. In consideration of the project to unify the network banks within UBI Banca, it was agreed, in the context of the merger agreements, to postpone signing an agreement to implement the national agreement within UBI Group until the first half of 2017, while temporarily maintaining workers’ safety representatives previously elected in the individual Group companies in office.

UBI Academy’s mission is the study, planning, consultancy and the provision of services for the training and the professional and managerial development of staff belonging to Group companies to support the achievement of business results. Training proposals, appropriately structured and integrated with other systems for the development of human resources and accompanied by intense internal communication activity, are designed to be effective tools for organising, developing and enhancing the technical and professional know-how, the managerial experiences and skills and the ethical and cultural conduct of individual staff members and for encouraging the development of a unified corporate identity. Training is carried out both by internal instructors, colleagues who form part of the in-house School for Instructors and who have qualified to perform classroom training by taking a course with a final examination, and by external professional experts. The UBI Academy School for Instructors is responsible for continuous training and refresher courses for the instructor corps with qualification courses and courses to refine teaching techniques, classroom management and the diffusion of virtuous conduct. Instructors are responsible not only for imparting knowledge but also for facilitating the sharing of experiences, positive examples and distinguished conduct in order to diffuse a common language, values and corporate culture and a sense of belonging to the Group. Teaching material on banking, commercial, credit and financial subjects is subject to a compliance opinion by the Compliance Area of the Parent. Consistent with the Group’s social responsibility policies and its roots in local communities, UBI Academy carries out its activities also by means of important partnerships with national and local universities and business schools. In order to finance training activities, Group companies contribute to joint inter-professional funds for continuous professional development: a fund for senior management training in the services sector (FONDIR) and to a banking and insurance fund (the FBA) for training employees working in the banking and insurance sectors. The measurement of requirements and the formulation of training programmes is performed on an annual basis, by means of meetings with chief officers at the Parent to receive recommendations and strategies both in the commercial and the credit fields. Particular attention is also paid to the organisation of training activities, carried out jointly with the relative units at the Parent, to support continuous learning of regulations currently in force and of the relative development/updates. Further meetings to support the preparation of the annual training programme are organised with the human resources departments of Group banks and companies. Furthermore, when specific training courses are held to support strategic initiatives for determined job families or roles, special focus groups are formed to plan training activities that are consistent with and suited as closely as possible to the needs of the staff to be trained. Training activities are also developed by planning specialist courses for distribution network roles in the commercial, credit and finance fields, carried out on the basis of the results of role knowledge surveys. The objective is to design training courses that are increasingly tailor-made in order to improve the level of specialist technical knowledge required by individual roles. It is also important to create a culture of quality through certifications and qualifications for distribution network roles, for which dedicated training programmes are organised and launched. G4-LA9 In 2016 the Group delivered approximately 89 thousand training days, in line with the objectives set, for an average of over five training days per person. The different types of training activities involve compilation of a questionnaire on the perceived quality and – mainly for technical and occupational courses – a learning questionnaire, by which an assessment can be made of the acquisition of the training contents. 63 2016 Sustainability Report TRAIN IN G 2016 2015 2014 Grou p Hours of training 667,915 652,400 609,233 of which compulsory training 1 289,586 304,392 310,726 Cost of training (milion euro) 2.5 2.2 2.2 Employees involved 96% 98% 98% Average hours of training per capita 39 38 35 Average satisfaction in hundreds (objective 69/100) 79 80 78 N etw ork B an ks Employees involved 97% 99% 99% Average hours of training per capita 44 45 41 1 Includes regulatory training on insurance required by IVASS (insurance authority). 2016 2015 2014 TR AIN IN G B Y PO SITIO N AN D AVE RAG E AVE RAG E AVE RAG E GEN DER E MPLO YE E S H O U RS PE R E MPLO YE E S H O U RS PE R E MPLO YE E S H O U RS PE R C API T A C API T A C API T A Senior managers 331 40.7 342 48.0 331 34.0 of which women 36 34.3 34 35.0 28 26.4 Middle managers 7,256 43.4 7,358 47.0 7,276 39.0 of which women 1,900 43.2 1,865 44.0 1,731 35.4 Professional areas 8,758 38.8 9,056 31.0 9,595 32.4 of which women 4,394 38.2 4,513 31.0 4,687 32.0 TO TAL 1 6 ,3 4 5 4 0 .9 1 6 ,7 5 6 3 8 .0 1 7 ,2 0 2 3 5 .3 o f w h ich w o men 6 ,3 3 0 3 9 .7 6 ,4 1 2 3 5 .0 6 ,4 4 6 3 3 .3 Training mode Subject Area 2.3% 3.8% 0.2% Insurance 8.4% Traditional 31.8% Operational/IT/languages classroom and internship 10.1% Commercial Internal training Regulatory Behavioural/Managerial 45.0% External training 11.3% 52.7% Credit Finance and MiFID 18.1% 16.3% Social responsibility and Code of Ethics 2016 1 PARTICIPAN TS 2 DETAIL S O F REGUL ATO RY TRAIN IN G HO URS SEN IO R MIDDL E PRO F ESS.

On the basis of requirements surveyed, the objective for 2017 is of approximately 100 thousand training days (45% conventional classroom, 42% remote training, 13% other methods: internships, on-the-job training, etc.). The training plan is designed to support the implementation of the 2019/2020 Business Plan by means of the following: the improvement of skills and the spread of best practices and effective commercial behaviours; support to meet the distribution network’s revenue challenge; the spread of a digital approach throughout the Enhancement and well-being of personnel 64 Group; the development of management roles, fundamental for the change and supervision of behaviours; support for the professional development and enhancement of all employees with respect to the new commercial model, encouraging also the growth in the skills of all staff in order to ensure adequate levels of productivity. Professional growth In line with the rapid and profound transformation of market paradigms, UBI Banca is constantly committed to updating its personnel management policies, based on improving its knowledge, management and enhancement of its human capital. In this context of continuously evolving approaches and revised processes, the following cornerstones remain: recognition of generation differences; attention to a work-life balance; continuous training; career development and continuous development of skills; the capitalisation of individual potential; and above all respect for the uniqueness of each single person. All this is based on the criteria of consistency, fairness and meritocracy. The use of new technology, in conjunction with the tools of organisation and culture, have also made it possible to rethink traditional schemes and models of working by experimenting with smartworking as an innovative proposal which facilitates reconciliation between work and personal life, greater productivity and environmental sustainability. G4-LA10 UBI Banca pursues personnel management policies and systems oriented towards enhancing skills acquired, services delivered and individual growth potential throughout a person’s working life. In addition to its assessment component, the performance management process involves development activities with the definition of targeted management and training action designed to facilitate customised career growth based on the areas for improvement, the career ambitions and the potential of each person. The assessment stages of the process are always accompanied by the delivery of feedback to the persons concerned, in order to generate a profitable result from the indications that have emerged. In this context specific coaching activity was commenced in the second half of the year for an initial Group of twenty staff, in order to supplement training courses in the classroom. A programme of reverse mentoring-generation comparison is now firmly in place for the over 55s in which senior and junior staff discuss issues in special training sessions in order to profit from the results that a meeting of generations can produce. G4-LA11 The performance management process involved 92.5% of Group staff in 2016 with the exception of: “Key management personnel” for whom special managerial performance tools were employed; new recruits; staff on leave; personnel employed in smaller companies of the Group; and employees with foreign employment contracts.

On the subject also of technical expertise, a strategic requirement for dealing with the complexity of the changes in progress, again in 2016 UBI Banca took part in a working Group of the Banks and Insurance Companies Fund, which maps job profiles in the banking industry and in June it started a pilot project to certify skills which involved over 500 colleagues in the commercial distribution network. 65 2016 Sustainability Report Business lines with social and environmental aims As part of its business activities at the service of local communities, UBI Banca takes account of important social and environmental causes which characterise economic and civil life, with particular attention paid to reducing unjustified inequalities to developing cohesion and social capital and to preventing and mitigating environmental impacts on material and economic growth. Specific guidelines have been adopted to manage business in two particularly critical sectors from an ethical viewpoint: 1 those of armaments and gambling . Products and services for the disadvantaged The Group is constantly striving to facilitate access to financial services by disadvantaged persons, both with regard to physical disabilities in relation to their ability to access Group branches and offices autonomously and also with respect to sensorial disabilities, and that is the use of telephone and digital banking services. G4-FS7 In order to facilitate access to financial services by the economically disadvantaged as a necessary condition for their social inclusion, UBI Banca has adhered to initiatives originating from co-operation between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF), the Bank of Italy, the Italian Post Office and payment services associations for the provision of low-cost basic services: Ordinary Basic Account, free of charge/socially disadvantaged Basic Account and Pensioners Basic Account. In addition, in order to support access to credit, especially for home purchases, the Bank has created two products: the Flexible Mortgage, which allows repayment instalments to be deferred or repayments to be rescheduled when determined extraordinary events occur, and Home Mortgages for young couples, designed also for those who do not have a permanent employment contract. Pawn credit is also available for persons in the greatest difficulty. It is one of the most ancient forms of lending th practiced by the “Monti di Pietà” banks created in the 15 Century by the Franciscans to combat usury, still today the last real resort in access to credit. This business is carried out in nine branches in the towns and cities of Milan, Pavia, Bergamo, Varese, Monza, Como, Brescia, Crema and Rome. The average volume of lending in 2016 was €32.5 million (unchanged compared with 2015), with approximately 28,730 open policies and with growth in new business. The average size of the loans was approximately €1,130 up by around 9% on 2015. Particular attention is paid to the young, with current accounts specially designed for different age groups (Clubino, for children aged up to 12 with over 137 thousand accounts opened, 14 thousand of which in 2016; I WANT TUBI’ for children aged 13 to 18 with around 21 thousand accounts opened of which over 5,900 during the year, the new QUBI’ <30 for the under 30s) and subsidised loans for studies or for fostering new projects (Let’s give them a future, unsecured loans in co-operation with the Italian Banking Association and the Youth Department at the President of the Council of Ministers Office, and the personal loans entitled Small Expenses and Large Projects).  2016 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT P. 50-51 Unsecured loans were granted in co-operation with the Welfare Ambrosiano Foundation. These are unsecured loans granted under special terms and conditions (termed “loans of honour”) to facilitate and support the personal and professional growth of pupils at the Accademia Teatro alla Scala (La Scala Theatre Academy) of Milan: 12 loan applications were received in 2016 for a total amount of €62,100, of which 6 have already been granted for a total of €32,500. 2016 2015 O p eratio n s o f th e year To tal o u tstan d in g O p eratio n s o f th e year To tal o u tstan d in g L O AN S TO HO USEHO L DS R emain in g R emain in g Disb u rsed Disb u rsed N u mb er N u mb er d eb t N u mb er N u mb er d eb t (millions of euro) (millions of euro) (millions of euro) (millions of euro) Home mortgages 14,374 2,343.3 216,180 19,942.6 18,507 1,950.1 231,316 18,897.9 Ordinary mortgages 1 13,674 2,271.3 212,550 19,545.3 17,011 1,786.3 228,209 18,543.4 Mortgages for young couples and atypical workers 700 72.0 3,630 397.3 1,496 163.8 3,107 354.5 Solidarity credit 62 4.7 137 10.9 53 4.3 74 6.3 ABI/CEI loan of hope for needy households 2 Loans for natural disasters (real estate/unsecured) 62 4.7 137 10.9 53 4.3 74 6.3 Support for studies 264 1.7 595 3.9 98 0.5 232 1.6 Under 30 Small Expenses 77 0.2 132 0.3 Under 30 Large Projects 93 1.0 190 1.7 ABI/PCDM Give them a future 94 0.5 273 1.9 98 0.5 232 1.6 Anti-usury 16,749 19.6 28,737 32.4 16,592 18.8 31,213 32.4 Pawn credit 16,749 19.6 28,737 32.4 16,592 18.8 31,213 32.4 TO TAL 3 1 ,4 4 9 2 ,3 6 9 .4 2 4 5 ,6 4 9 1 9 ,9 8 9 .8 3 5 ,2 5 0 1 ,9 7 3 .7 2 6 2 ,8 3 5 1 8 ,9 3 8 .2 1 The loans granted and the remaining outstanding debt for the former Banca Regionale Europea and the former Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria are as at 31/10/2016; the number of loans does not include the former Banca Regionale Europea and the former Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, nor IWBank Private Investment. 2 Initiative inactive in 2015. 1 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by central governments which subcontract operations to private sector companies in return for the payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. Business lines with social and environmental aims 66 Savings are also an important issue for low income families and for the disadvantaged in general. UBI Banca has created fund-based savings plans, which satisfy the requirement of accessibility and allow even small sums to be saved. In 2016 77,100 fund-based saving plan contracts were signed (-16.0% compared with 2015). G4-FS14 With regard to physical disabilities, in 2016 eleven new ramps, four stair lifts or elevators and fifteen conveniences accessible to disabled persons were installed at Group buildings and branches. This work was always carried out in compliance with existing regulations on the elimination of architectural barriers. The IT platforms for the internet banking services Qui UBI and Qui UBI Affari comply with the main navigation requirements for partially sighted persons (e.g. through pages with strong colour contrast and alternative texts to accompany images) and 1,062 Bancomat ATMs exist (50.3% of the total) for use by partially or non-sighted persons. Involvement in controversial sectors G4-FS6 No specific policies exist to limit the Group’s exposure in sectors considered controversial, except for the armaments, gambling and betting sectors, partly because the volumes of business continue to be completely marginal. Again in 2016 lending to companies operating in controversial sectors (€189.4 million) remained totally marginal compared with the total volume of lending to businesses (0.32%). 1 2016 2015 2014 CO N TR O VER SIAL Le ndi ng Pe r ce nta g e Le ndi ng Pe r ce nta g e Le ndi ng Pe r ce nta g e SECTO R S (mi li ons of of tota l (mi li ons of of tota l (mi li ons of of tota l E ur o) loa ns E ur o) loa ns E ur o) loa ns Arms 68.6 0.12% 48.1 0.08% 30.0 0.05% Tobacco 62.1 0.10% 47.9 0.08% 45.4 0.08% Alcohol 45.1 0.08% 28.5 0.05% 17.8 0.03% Furs 7.6 0.01% 5.9 0.01% 5.0 0.01% Gambling 6.1 0.01% 9.3 0.02% 12.0 0.02% Nuclear 0 0.00% 0 0.00% 0 0.00% TO TAL 1 8 9 .4 0 .3 2 % 1 3 9 .7 0 .2 4 % 1 1 0 .2 0 .1 9 % 1 As at the end of October.

We report the following for 2016: • 80 transactions for exports of armaments materials in accordance with Law No. 185/1990, for consideration of €18.7 million (55.6% to EU and/or Nato and/or OECD countries); • 60 transactions for exports of light arms, for consideration of €4.7 million. The total value of the transactions continued to be for exports to OECD countries, while NATO countries accounted for 99.4%. In compliance with the commitment to transparency laid down in the Group’s Armaments Policy, a more detailed report on the business in question is published in the Social Responsibility Section of the Group’s corporate website.  HTTPS://WWW.UBIBANCA.IT/PAGINE/POLICIES-CSR-EN.ASPX 3 As concerns the gambling and betting sector , the distribution network has received instructions to limit this business to a totally marginal level and to employ extremely rigorous conduct in assessing loan applications: parties operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and satisfy criteria of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. Finally, the Group provides commercial services for the sale of diamonds as an investment instrument for customers. In this area, as with regard to business in the armaments sector, it was considered important to consider the potential involvement in activities which could present the risk of a violation of human rights 4 [G4-HR1] and therefore all the diamonds, sourced through the company Diamond Love Bond , must be certified conflict-free (i.e. they do not come from conflict zones, or from transactions for the finance of armed groups and conflicts) and they are guaranteed child labour free (they are not the result of mining and processing that uses child labour). In 2016 2,971 diamonds were sold for a value of approximately €35 million. Policies, products and services with environmental aims G4-FS8 As part of its Environmental Policy the Group is also committed to the provision of banking, financial and risk management products and services designed to support customers to manage their activities in a sustainable manner (e.g. by using renewable energies, improving the energy efficiency of their homes, increasing the efficiency of production processes). The role of the Project and Real Estate Finance Unit introduced as part of Private and Corporate Banking Units in the commercial area is of particular importance in this respect. For some years now the Group has provided a series of specific financing products for household and business investments for the use of renewable energies and energy savings as follows: • for individuals, the Forza Sole (Sun Strength) products to finance domestic photovoltaic systems and the Creditopplà Home Refurbishment products to refurbish buildings and for energy savings upgrades, making use also of tax incentives; • for businesses, New Energy Photovoltaic products, for the installation of photovoltaic panels, Renewable Energies products for wind, biogas and biomass powered plants to generate electricity and/or heat and “Full Power” leasing for investments in renewable energies. Financing was disbursed in 2016 in relation to Full Power leasing amounting to €2.7 million (down 10.0% on 2015) accounting for 0.3% of the total disbursed during the year, compared with 0.5% in 2015. Loans and finance contracts outstanding at the end of the year numbered 376 for a residual debt of €538.8 million (down 9.5% compared with 2015), accounting for some 7.6% of total outstanding financing compared with 8.3% in 2015. 2 In 2016 a mistakenly accepted transaction was ratified regarding two transactions involving incoming funds from Bahrein amounting to €241 thousand for work carried out on tanks. 3 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by central governments which subcontract operations to private sector companies in return for the payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. 4 Diamond Love Bond is a diamond company located in Antwerp authorised by the Belgian Ministry of the Economy, Commerce and Energy, with an international organisational network and it is present on all world diamond exchanges. The company adopts rigorous ethical principles. It follows and supports the UN Global Compact principles and adheres to the rules of conduct for Diamond companies – best practices recommended by the World Diamond Council System of Warranties and by the Diamond Trading Company – and it adheres to and complies with the Kimberley Protocol designed to break the link between illegal diamond transactions and armed conflicts.

The process to restructure the renewable energy sector continued in 2016, in the photovoltaic segment above all. More specifically, following the entrance into force of the decree entitled “spread the incentives” the process to centralise investments made and to refinance those already existing became stronger. This government measure either cut or restructured incentive rates, moving most of the incentive rate from the first part of the incentivised period to the second part. For many of the photovoltaic plants financed by banks this meant revising the credit lines to align them with the new tariff schemes. Even though the growth in the renewable energy sector is slowing, UBI Banca has continued to play an important role both in the refinancing of systems already constructed and in financing for new projects. At the end of the year, UBI Banca had a portfolio of renewable energy operations amounting to €1.9 billion (of which €1.1 billion in project finance), accounting for 3.5% of total financing to firms. The transactions concluded during the year in the renewable energy field numbered 47, to give a total amount disbursed of €168.6 million. It is estimated that the power output financed in project finance by UBI Banca amounts to over 1 million MWh of electricity per year, equal to the electricity requirement for over 421 thousand households (almost as big as the city of Naples) with savings on emissions of almost 370 thousand tons of CO2. 2016 2015 2014 PRO JECT F IN AN CE O PERATIO N S IN PO RTF O L IO F O R REN EW AB L E PO W E R PO W E R PO W E R PO W E R PO W E R PO W E R NO .

UBI Pramerica has created a range of funds for clients who are sensitive to sustainability and social responsibility issues. These funds invest in companies chosen from an investable universe selected by ECPI Group srl, (a leading independent, ethical finance consulting firm) on the basis of the following criteria: • companies involved in the following are excluded: the production and/or trade in arms, pornographic material, contraceptives, alcohol, tobacco and other products harmful to health; the promotion and practice of gambling; the construction of plants for the production of nuclear energy; research, development or production of GMOs; • the inclusion of companies that achieve important social and environmental performance, that demonstrate attention to sustainable development and respect for human rights and that adopt clear and transparent governance. Should circumstances change or news be received that leads to a change in the rating of an issuer made by the advisor, UBI Pramerica shall take steps to dispose of the relative financial instruments as quickly as possible, with account taken of the interests of the participants. The Sicav Social 4 Future, invests its bond component in financial instruments issued by companies that stand out for their important social and environmental performance and its equity component in the 100 top companies in the world that, again in observance of the criteria of high ethical and social responsibility standards, play a key role in managing the global challenges of emerging markets, population trends, scarce resources and climate change. As occurs for social bonds, the issue is associated with support for social projects. In this case 4% of the entrance and management fees for this Sicav will be donated to two projects: • the UNICEF Youth & Innovation Lebanon Project, the objective of which is to provide hundreds of highly vulnerable Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese adolescents present in Lebanon with an alternative and innovative learning programme to give them a better chance to integrate into society and find a job; • the Build Integration Project of the Astalli Centre, the purpose of which is to facilitate the complex process of the integration of forced migrants in Italy. The ethical funds also donate 5% of the management fees and commissions to institutions or associations that pursue beneficial initiatives. The main beneficiaries of the over €40 thousand donated in 2016 were: the Fondo per L’Ambiente Italiano (FAI – Italian fund for the environment), the Save The Children Fund and CESVI for humanitarian assistance.

Priority is given to action which optimises the relationship between environmental benefits and implementation costs. More specifically, reducing energy consumption associated with the use of electricity from renewable sources helps fight climate change, respect for the everyone’s right to good health and a natural environment that is as unharmed as possible, while also containing operating costs. Materials used The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for Group companies [ G4-12] in compliance with the Environmental Policy. The main raw materials used are paper and toner for printouts for internal use and also those for customers. Various initiatives have been undertaken to reduce consumption, including the following: • remote monitoring of printers and setting printers for “both sides” printing; • the “dematerialisation” of documents with: the extension of signatures on tablets to additional branch transactions and an initial range of contract documents; action taken to rationalise the use of internal forms and printouts in offices and branches; • the development and spread of Digital Bank consultation and payment services. A further reduction in paper and toner consumption is also expected for the coming year with the continuation of action taken to dematerialise documents and an increase in the spread of their processing and transmission in electronic format with the development of Digital Bank services.

Waste products UBI Banca is subject to specific regulations on waste, which include the following: • that concerning the management of records, forms and SISTRI (the traceability decree): Legislative Decree No. 152 of 3/04/2006 “Environmental regulations – Part four: Regulations on waste management and the cleanup of polluted sites”; Ministerial Decree No. 78 of 30/03/2016, the “Consolidated SISTRI Law”; Ministerial Decree No. 148 of 1/04/1998 on “Regulations on the approval of the waste loading and unloading record form”; Ministerial Decree No. 145 of 1/04/1998 “Regulations on the definition and contents of the waste accompaniment form” and Law No. 70 of 25/01/1994 (establishment of the environmental declaration form – MUD); • Presidential Decree No. 254 of 15/07/2003, containing regulations on the management of medical waste. 71 2016 Sustainability Report The UBI Sistemi e Servizi Facility Management operating unit manages relations with suppliers engaged for the collection 1 and treatment of waste products and it verifies by using the fourth copy of the “accompaniment form” that waste has been treated in compliance with the applicable regulations in force. Solid urban waste is managed by the public collection service and therefore we are unable to measure the quantity and the method of disposal. Hazardous waste accounts for 0.25% of total separated waste and consists of retired electronic equipment containing dangerous substances (96.7% of hazardous waste) and medical waste (3.2% of hazardous waste) and they are entrusted to authorised local companies. 99.99% of the separated waste (100% for paper, paper packaging, cardboard and toner) was destined to materials recycling, 0.003% to energy recovery and the remaining 0.005% to incineration. G4-EN23 Calculation method G4-EN25 Waste by employee and by surface area was calculated by dividing total separated waste by the number of employees and associate workers (17,518, amounting to 99.5% of the Group total) and by the net internal floor area of the properties (969,919 sq.m) of the Group companies within the relative scope.

It operates in properties generally classifiable as for service use and it is subject to specific regulations on energy and energy efficiency as follows: • Law No. 10/191 “Regulations to implement the national energy plan on the rational use of energy and energy savings and the development of renewable sources of energy” and the relative Presidential Decree No. 412/93 “Regulations containing rules for the design, installation, running and maintenance of heating systems in buildings for the purposes of reducing energy consumption in implementation of Art. 4, paragraph 4 of Law No. th 10 of 9 January 1991”; 1 This form, which accompanies transported waste, is a compulsory waste identification document, which must be drawn up in four copies, filled in, dated and signed by the producer or by the holder of the waste and countersigned by the shipper. One copy of the accompaniment form remains with the producer or holder, while the other three, countersigned and dated on arrival at the recipient consist of one acquired by the recipient and two by the shipper, who sends one to the holder/producer. The receipt of the fourth copy of the accompaniment form by the producer/holder is necessary for the release of that party from responsibility for the proper disposal or recovery of the waste. The copies of the accompaniment form must be kept for five years. Reduction in direct environmental impacts 72 • Directive No. 2002/91/EC “On the energy performance of buildings”, and the relative decree to implement it, Legislative Decree No. 192/2005 and subsequent amendments, Legislative Decree No. 311/2006; • Legislative Decree No. 102/2014 “Implementation of Directive No. 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency”. The Energy Manager who heads the relative operational Energy Management Unit at UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which is allocated a specific budget, is responsible for the management of energy consumption. The Energy Manager is responsible for analysing the energy requirement, for drawing up policies and actions to optimise consumption (including the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings and systems) and for monitoring their application and the results achieved. Monitoring of consumption takes place through the annual reporting cycles of the Sustainability Report and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) – the data from which are subject to independent audit by the auditing firm Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. – and by means of half yearly consumption progress charts drawn up for the UBISS Real Estate Department (a summary of electricity consumption only is submitted monthly to the UBISS Management Committee). In order to reduce energy consumption internally, the Group has adopted a more eco-compatible design model for the construction and refurbishment of offices and branches. The model is constantly updated to keep abreast of technological innovation available on the market and it involves an energy section with three lines of intervention: electricity and lighting, systems and machinery and architecture and structure. More specifically, during the course of 2016: • as part of an evolved programme for system maintenance, work was carried out on 24 boilers, 17 air conditioning systems and 22 heat pumps; • UPS’s were replaced on strategic Group sites and an innovative free cooling system was installed for the Brescia data-processing centre (DPC); • a contract was signed for continuous “smart metering” in 772 branches, which came into operation between 2016 and the first months of 2017; Again in 2016 UBI Banca adhered to the initiative M’illumino di meno (I use less light), an educational campaign for the rationalisation of energy consumption, conceived of by Caterpillar (a famous radio programme broadcast by the Italian state broadcaster, RAI), with the sponsorship of the Presidency of the Italian Republic and the European Parliament, the Senate and Chamber of Deputies of the Republic and also adhered to by the Ministry of the Environment and of the Protection of the Territory and of the Sea, the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research and the Ministry of Infrastructures and Transport. UBI Banca participated in the initiative by symbolically switching off the neon signs of the main headquarters of Group banks and companies and it educated staff with the publication on the UBI Life intranet portal of a news article on the campaign together with an Energy Vademecum, a document which illustrates 15 simple “tips” for saving energy and safeguarding the environment both in the office and at home. As part of the periodic renewal of IT equipment, 3,165 desktops with monitors, 100 notebooks and 379 monitors with Energy Star certification were purchased. The energy efficiency of the new models purchased is normally higher than that of those they replaced. Initiatives were undertaken with the company car fleet to reduce the number of vehicles in circulation and to renew the fleet with vehicles with lower consumption and emissions. The action undertaken had the effect of reducing consumption by around 30% over three years. The results achieved in terms of reducing energy consumption (down 5.4% on 2015 and 9.6% on 2014) [G4-EN3] were in line with those expected and therefore there was no need to identify and apply corrective action. The goal for the next three years is a further 5% reduction in electricity consumption by UBI Banca and UBI Sistemi e Servizi. Total CO2 equivalent emissions (scope 1 and 2) also reduced significantly (down 1.9% on 2015 and 11.4% on 2014) [G4EN18]). More specifically, emissions resulting from electricity consumption were reduced to almost zero with the purchase of GO certificates (guarantee of origin for energy produced from renewable sources) to cover 95.5% of the electricity purchased. G4-EN3 Calculation method Data calculated on the basis of final figures by source of energy provided by the SAP corporate accounting system. Average prices given in the invoices available or recommended by Italian Banking Association guidelines were used to calculate the quantities of fuel. The consumption included in condominium expenses not reported in the table above are estimated as 70% of the condominium expenses themselves which were: approximately € 6.83 million for 2016, € 7.17 million for 2015 and € 7.09 million for 2014.

Sustainable mobility The Group has a number of large business centres (the headquarters of the Parent, UBI Sistemi e Servizi, the Network 2 Banks and the Product Companies) on which problems of sustainable mobility and initiatives to solve them are concentrated. With the aim of achieving increasingly greater sustainability, the issue of corporate mobility is managed by a Mobility Manager who operates within the Human Resource Area of the Parent. This manager is responsible for activities connected with the reduction of the environmental impact of home-work journeys and business travel by staff. As concerns to-and-from work mobility, for some years now sheltered parking areas have been provided for bicycles in some of the main headquarters and a coach shuttle service runs between Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan (and actually within the city for the latter). The shuttle coaches transported an average of 310 passengers per day in 2016 which prevented at least 1,000 tons of CO2 emissions compared with the use of cars [G4-EN4, G4-EN17]. Smart working continued in 2016 with an appreciable increase in the participants. It is a project introduced in 2015 which contributes not only to reconcile personal and work dimensions of life, but also to reduce travel to-and-from work, because it allows employees to work from their own homes or at Group locations closer to where they live. A total of 3,013 days were spent smart working in 2016, with average savings of approximately 307,300 km of travel. In 2012 the Group adopted a specific policy document for business travel, which gives priority, where possible, to the use of public and/or collective means of transport. A substantial contribution is made to the reduction of business travel and the related greenhouse gas and polluting emissions caused by transport by increasingly greater use of video conferences (up 20.8% on 2015 and 32.9% on 2014) [G4-EN19]. G4-EN30 In consideration of the activity carried out, the indicator is not considered important, except in relation to employee mobility [Sustainable mobility, G4-EN4, G4-EN17]. 2 The separate legal entities have no longer existed since February 2017, while the management and operational units of UBI Banca’s Macro Geographcial Areas remain on local markets for the operation of a unified branch network.
