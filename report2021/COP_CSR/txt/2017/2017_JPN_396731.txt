KONICA MINOLTA CSR REPORT 2017 56 Expert Opinion of Konica Minolta’s CSR Report We asked Yoshinao Kozuma, Professor of Economics at Sophia University, to give us feedback on this report. His comments are presented below. We will use this feedback to improve our future CSR activities and our 2018 CSR Report. 1. Business Model for a Sustainable Society The company started two new initiatives in fiscal 2017. One is the Medium-Term Business Plan SHINKA 2019, which seeks to solve implicit customer challenges with digital and innovative technologies, with the ultimate aim of contributing to society. The other is the Medium-Term Environmental Plan 2019, which attempts to simultaneously solve environmental and social issues from the perspective of the SDGs. Both are characterized by the development of solutions businesses required for solving social issues by leveraging accumulated management resources and technical knowhow. For example, in the first initiative, Konica Minolta is looking to evolve into “a digital company with insight into implicit challenges,” and in the second, it is seeking to expand its carbon reduction consulting business to achieve “Carbon Minus” status, which is incorporated in the targets of its New Eco Vision 2050, Yoshinao Kozuma which starts in fiscal 2017. Professor, Faculty of Economics, Having promoted the integration of business activities and CSR management Sophia University based on the creation of shared value with society, Konica Minolta now states its intention to pursue these initiatives with the aim of transformation to build a more sustainable world. This should lead to the full-scale implementation of business model transformation as an adaptive strategy. I look forward to the future results. 2. Transparency of the CSR Report The company has made improvements in information disclosure every year. This fiscal year, a configuration diagram of communication tools was added to the editorial policy, and information about accidents causing absence from work in and outside Japan was added to the scope of data collection and disclosed. In addition, efforts to improve the accessibility of the CSR Report, such as effectively arranging graphs within the text, can be seen throughout the report. Konica Minolta not only received outside expert opinion to evaluate and to advise on the appropriateness of its CSR management, but also sought external assurance on the reliability of the information disclosed. The scope of this assurance has expanded even to cover social information. I believe that the careful consideration the company gives to improving the transparency of the information disclosed is a factor that is highly acclaimed by external stakeholders, as shown by the company’s inclusion in global environmental ratings and investment indices. 3. Vision for Long-Term Growth Konica Minolta’s structurally evolving CSR management faces a future challenge̶the formulation of a vision for long-term corporate growth that is compatible with a sustainable society. While the company has set out its Eco Vision 2050 as a long-term vision for the environment, in reality, it is already significantly integrated with the business strategy. The need now is for a long-term growth vision that holistically integrates corporate growth and CSR management, as well. I believe the company is expected to establish a new CSR management system that links the medium-term business plan and the medium-term environmental plan with a long-term growth vision aligned with a sustainable society. 57 KONICA MINOLTA CSR REPORT 2017 External Assurance Konica Minolta engaged KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. to provide assurance on whether its CO2 emissions from procurement, production/research and development, product distribution, sales and service, and product usage; energy use; waste discharged externally from manufacturing; atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs); water consumption; and the number of regular employees (by gender) have been measured, gathered and disclosed in accordance with the criteria set by the Group. Indicators that have been assured by KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. are marked with ★. Period: March to June 2017 On-site audit of the Tokyo Site Hino of Independent Assurance Report Konica Minolta, Inc. To the President and CEO of Konica Minolta, Inc. We were engaged by Konica Minolta, Inc. (the “Company”) to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the environmental and social performance indicators marked with ★ for the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 (the “Indicators”) included in its CSR Report 2017 (the “Report”) for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s Responsibility The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the “Company’s reporting criteria”), as described in its website, which are derived, among others, from the Environmental Reporting Guidelines (2012) of Japan’s Ministry of the Environment, the Act on the Rational Use of Energy, the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004) by World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Our Responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators based on the procedures we have performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with ‘International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’, ‘ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, and the ‘Practical Guidelines for the Assurance of Sustainability Information’ of the Japanese Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information. The limited assurance engagement consisted of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included: ● Interviewing with the Company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for the preparation of the Report and reviewing the Company’s reporting criteria. ● Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators. ● Performing analytical reviews of the Indicators. ● Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with the Company’s reporting criteria, and also recalculating the Indicators. ● Visiting to one of the Company’s domestic factories selected on the basis of a risk analysis. ● Evaluating the overall statement in which the Indicators are expressed. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Indicators in the Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Company’s reporting criteria as described in the Report. Our Independence and Quality Control We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. In accordance with International Standard on Quality Control 1, we maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan August 16, 2017 Comment from the Assurance Provider Chie Uchiyama, KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd. Based on the reevaluation of materiality performed last As for the environment, the Eco Vision 2050 declares year, the company identified “social innovation” as a new Konica Minolta’s commitment to “Carbon Minus” status, material issue. Last year’s CSR report presented some while the Medium-Term Environmental Plan 2019 shows its future directions and several examples, but this year’s strategy for increasing contributions to sales and profit by report goes further to present “Background and Issues,” solving issues from the perspective of the SDGs. They both “Vision” and “Key Measures and KPIs.” The reasons why demonstrate Konica Minolta’s ambitious approach, which is the Konica Minolta Group is working on social innovation not limited to merely reducing Konica Minolta’s own and the direction it is trying to go have been more clearly environmental impact. In this field, too, I think it is presented. In the years ahead, as shown in “Key Measures important to consider ways to foster understanding of the and KPIs,” I think that the question of how to set effective reduction of environmental impact that has been appropriate KPIs to measure social outcomes based on created together with outside stakeholders using Konica the characteristic features of individual businesses will Minolta’s technology and knowhow, as well as the social become important. outcomes achieved in the execution of the Medium-Term Moreover, social performance indicators are now Environmental Plan. included in the scope of external assurance. It is advisable that Konica Minolta gradually expands the scope of assurance, while considering the needs of information users.
