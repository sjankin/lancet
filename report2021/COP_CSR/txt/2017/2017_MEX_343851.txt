The last year has been one of continued growth for the company; in all nine of the airports in our Group, total traffic increased by 8.7% to 28.4 million passengers in 2016, up from just over 26.1 million in 2015 and 23.2 million in 2014. All of these extra travellers mean that to maintain a high standard of service it has been necessary for us to expand our airport infrastructure, which has a series of sustainability implications. 2016 was the first full year of operations for two major infrastructure projects inaugurated in 2015: the remodelling and expansion of the terminal building at Veracruz International Airport, and the extension of Terminal 3 at Cancún International Airport. Additionally, Terminal 4 at Cancún Airport was under construction during the year; this completely new terminal is expected to be inaugurated in 2017. All of these projects have been planned and executed in such a way that they have the smallest environmental impact possible; however, these new facilities need power, and as a result the company’s total electricity consumption increased year-over-year by 19%. 6 annual sustainability report | 2016 Given that the company’s indirect greenhouse-gas emissions from electricity consumption constitute almost all of our carbon emissions, we have therefore been looking at ways in which we can maintain energy efficiency, in line with our main strategic priority of mitigating the effects of climate change. During the year, ASUR has continued to be a dependable source of employment in the communities where we operate. Our total number of staff members increased by a little less than 4%, and we maintained a good standard of working conditions and employment benefits, an excellent health-and-safety record, low staff-turnover rates, and positive relations with our airport workers’ union. As always, the goal of this report is to increase transparency and to encourage dialogue with all our stakeholders. We welcome any comments or observations about additional matters that our readers would like to see included, or suggestions as to how we can improve our reporting process. adolfo castro rivas chief executive officer asur 7 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 2 Company profile 8 annual sustainability report | 2016 2.0 company profile Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. operates a group of airports in the southeast region of Mexico under the brand name ASUR. These airports are located in the cities of Cancún, Cozumel, Huatulco, Mérida, Minatitlán, Oaxaca, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa. The company’s headquarters are located in Mexico City. In February of 2013, the concession for the operation of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was granted to Aerostar Airport Holdings, LLC, a company in which Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste, S.A.B. de C.V. holds a 50% stake. These are the only operations outside of Mexico in which ASUR currently has an interest. 2.1 business activities The company’s core activity is to administer In addition to the above, the company enters and maintain the infrastructure of its airports into agreements with external providers for a to ensure sufficient capacity for safe, efficient range of additional services, which may include operations and a high standard of service. Basic complementary services for aircraft (such as infrastructure includes that required for aircraft baggage handling and ramp services) and comtakeoff and landing operations and for arriving mercial services for passengers (such as resand departing passenger flows, as well as facilitaurants, shops and car rental, among other ties for the authorities involved in airport operbusiness lines). The company’s aeronautical, ations (air-traffic controllers, customs, immigracomplementary and commercial activities reption, etc.). resent its three revenue streams. asur 9 Consequently, there are facilities and personnel that, while located at ASUR’s airports, are not under the direct operational control of the company. These include all those corresponding to the government agencies, complementary service providers and commercial concession holders mentioned above, as well as the facilities and staff members of the various airlines that operate out of the company’s airports.

Under the privatisation scheme, an initial stake of 15% in the company’s capital stock (the BB series shares) was sold to a strategic partner, Inversiones y Técnicas Aeroportuarias, S.A. de C.V. (ITA), with expertise in Mexican business operations and in the international airport industry. The remaining 85% of the company’s shares (the B series) began trading on the stock exchanges of Mexico City and New York in two public offers in September 2000 and March 2005. ASUR is therefore a one-hundred-per-cent privately owned company, subject to a series of national and international regulatory frameworks. 10 annual sustainability report | 2016 2.3 shareholder structure In June 2007, the strategic partner ITA reduced its shareholding in the company from 15% to 7.65%. As of the 31st of December 2016, ITA is owned by Fernando Chico Pardo, a Mexican investor, who has a 50% stake in the company; and by Remer Soluciones a la Inversión, S.A. de C.V., a subsidiary of the Mexican bus transport company Grupo ADO, S.A. de C.V., which also has a stake of 50%. The 92.35% of ASUR’s shares that are not held by Figure 2: Structure, Holding Company and Subsidiaries ITA are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: ASR) and the Mexico City Bolsa (BMV: AEROPUERTO DE CANCÚN, S.A.

It will therefore focus in particular on social and environmental matters without including detailed financial data, except insofar as they relate to the standard disclosures contained in the company profile (Section 2) and to economic performance indicators (Section 8). The environmental performance indicators mentioned in Section 6 include data from the Group’s nine airports in Mexico only, as these are considered to be the most relevant due to the nature of the company’s activities. All other indicators refer to the nine airports, the company’s head offices in Mexico City and other company subsidiaries, as described in Section 2.4. The report covers operations performed directly by the companies that form part of the ASUR business group. At this time, mechanisms are not in place to include the activities of clients, suppliers or subcontractors within the parameters of this report, unless otherwise stated. This report has been prepared on a consistent basis with ASUR’s Annual Sustainability Report for 2015 in terms of measurement methods, and contains no restatements or reinterpretations of data contained in that report. At this time, it is not company policy to seek external assurance of our Annual Sustainability Report. asur 19 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 4 Corporate Governance 20 annual sustainability report | 2016 4.0 corporate governance As a company that is publicly traded on the stock markets of both Mexico City and New York, ASUR adheres to a strict set of regulations in its corporate-governance practices.

During 2016, 100% of the company’s employees were provided with training relating to the Code of Ethics. ASUR’s Internal Auditing Department carried out audits in all nine airports in the Group, as well as the airport located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which is operated by the company as a joint venture, and several commercial concession holders operating at the airports. These audits resulted in a total of four relevant observations. A total of 33 reports were submitted via the internal reporting system during the year, if which 10 were considered to be of critical importance, nine were of medium importance and nine were of minor importance. Of the critical matters that came to the attention of the Internal Auditing Department during the year, most were related to internal procedural concerns and no disciplinary action was taken. However, two staff members were dismissed and one staff member was disciplined for failure to adhere to the company’s policies on ethical conduct. The company incurred no fines or penalties in relation to instances of corruption. asur 27 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 6 Environmental Responsibility 28 annual sustainability report | 2016 6.0 environmental responsibility 6.1 significant Issues and management strategy ASUR has a written policy that expressly and formally sets forth the commitment of the company and its subsidiaries to take positive action in relation to the environment.

The principal consumable required on a consistent basis for our airports’ day-to-day operations is fuel, which is discussed in greater detail in Section 6.2.5 of this report. 30 annual sustainability report | 2016 Each of ASUR’s airports has an Environmental Management System that establishes detailed guidelines and procedures for aspects such as training, monitoring, emergency response, and the environmental requirements for projects and contractors. Each airport’s Environmental Management System is currently certified under the ISO 14001 programme. In addition to ISO 14001 certification, ASUR’s airports have consistently been awarded Environmental Quality Assurance certification, which represents official confirmation by the Mexican environmental authorities that the recipient has complied in full with all observations resulting from the audits conducted by the authorities to enforce Mexican environmental During 2016, there was one major infrastruclegislation. ture-expansion project ongoing at Cancún Airport, which involved significant extensions to For additional information relating to key environthe built-up surface areas or “footprint” of the mental issues, such as performance against environairport: the construction of Terminal 4, which mental objectives, specific risks and systems, and began in 2015. targeted strategies and procedures, please see the information contained in Section 6.2 of this report. Environmental-impact-mitigation measures, including the relocation and replanting of endangered and non-endangered wild plant species, and a government-mandated payment to the 6.2 overview of principal mitigation Mexican Forestry Fund, were implemented mostmeasures ly in 2015 prior to the start of construction work, 6.2.1 Mitigation of Infrastructure Expansion and are discussed in more detail in the Annual Sustainability Report for that year. Large-scale infrastructure expansion at any of ASUR’s airports, which tend to be surrounded by undeveloped land, often necessitates the modification or destruction of natural habitats. For this reason, projects of this type are only undertaken following careful consideration and analysis of the mitigation measures that can be applied, and when it is determined that there is ample justification, usually to eliminate operational hazards or serious capacity constraints, which in turn may have negative consequences for local economies and the environment. asur 31 6.2.2 Energy Efficiency As mentioned above in Section 6.1, the electricity used in the company’s airports constitutes our main source of carbon emissions. One of the most important ways that the company moderates elecThese figures state only the intermediate energy protricity consumption is to carefully monitor duced by Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission and the capacity of our airport installations, purchased by ASUR.

Eight of ASUR’s nine airports are equipped with treatment plants that receive all waste water from terminals and administrative buildings. In the case of Cozumel Airport, waste water is sent to the municipal drainage system and is treated at the municipal plant. The airports’ plants use biological, mechanical and chemical treatment processes to purify waste water to a standard where it is clean enough to be either reused or discharged without presenting a risk to other water sources. The water that is recycled is mainly used for watering green areas, which helps to reduce the demands placed by the airports on local resources. Any water that cannot be stored and used for this purpose is released into either the subsoil or into local wetlands, in accordance with the permits issued by Mexico’s National Water Commission (CONAGUA). ASUR also takes care to ensure that the quality of the storm water that runs off our airport facilities is in full compliance with local regulations. asur 33 Given the weather conditions in the southeast region of Mexico, no de-icing or anti-icing fluids are used in any of the airports in the group. Furthermore, the company has equipment in place on the aircraft aprons of each of our airports to ensure that any spills of liquids such as fuels or oil are appropriately eliminated before they can be flushed into local water sources. Overall, in 2016 ASUR’s total water consumption in the nine airports decreased by 6.1% from 927,038 to 870,931 cubic metres (m3). Water consumption on a per-passenger basis (measured in litres per passenger) decreased by 13.5%. The amount of metered discharge increased by 29.2% in absolute terms (from 255,009 to 329,390 m3), and by 18.9% in litres per passenger. 3 Figure 10: Total Water Consumption vs. Passenger Growth 1,000,000 26 23 millions 29 35 millions 900,000 millones 30 800,000 19 21 millions millions 25 700,000 17 18 600,000 16 millions millions 18 millions 20 millions 500,000 15 400,000 300,000 423,190 569,624 m3 555,939 m3 596,197 m3 701,660 m3 717,969 m3 909,949 m3 927,038 m3 870,931 10 m3 m3 200,000 5 100,000 0 0 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 TOTAL WATER CONSUMPTION PASSENGERS Source 3: Internal ASUR data. See tables in Section 6.3 Environmental Management System. 34 annual sustainability report | 2016 6.2.4 Waste Management An important aspect in ensuring that our operations do not damage local environments and ecosystems is to make sure that all the waste materials generated in our airports are appropriately disposed of. Consequently, each airport has waste management facilities for hazardous and non-hazardous waste. The waste materials that are classified as hazardous under Mexican legislation include a series of toxic, inflammable and corrosive substances, as well as items of equipment that have come into contact and are contaminated with these materials. In our airports, all substances and articles of this kind are safely stored, appropriately labelled and eventually handed over to specialist waste disposal companies, in strict adherence to the applicable regulations. The waste disposal companies, which are required to be licenced by the Mexican authorities, eliminate the hazardous waste using methods that avoid pollution and provide ASUR with waste disposal certificates stating the methods used. Non-hazardous waste is handled in completely separate facilities at ASUR’s airports to avoid cross-contamination. Cancún Airport, which currently produces approximately 89% of all the non-hazardous waste in the Group, has a dedicated refuse-recycling plant, where materials such as glass, PET plastic, cardboard and aluminium are sorted and sent for recycling. Several other airports have also established recycling programmes. Despite these programmes, the amount of non-hazardous waste disposed of in landfills increased from a total of 2,761.6 tonnes in 2015 to 5,275.4 tonnes in 2016 (91.0%). This was largely due to increases in passenger numbers and modifications to the operation of the recycling plant at Cancún Airport. 4 Source 4: Internal ASUR data.

Source 6: Bird-strike incidents that cause damage to aircraft are reported to the Mexican civil-aviation authorities by the airlines, as the directly affected parties. ASUR does not compile data on the numbers of bird strikes at or within the vicinity of its airports. 36 annual sustainability report | 2016 6.3 environmental management system ASUR has an Environmental Management System that is applied in all nine of the airports the company operates. The purpose of the system is to establish environmental objectives for each airport, as well as a framework for the achievement of those objectives. The system creates a series of parameters that can be used to monitor and assess each airport’s performance in relation to the environmental objectives established, providing the company management with valuable information for the decision-making process. The Environmental Management Systems in Environmental objectives are determined by each aireach of ASUR’s airports are certified accordport on an ad hoc basis, in order to ensure that local ing to ISO 14001.

The airports at Cancún, Huatulco and Oaxaca were recertified for the period 2015-2018, and those at Cozumel, Mérida, Minatitlán, Tapachula, Veracruz and Villahermosa were recertified for the period 2013-2016. Mexico’s Environmental Protection Agency (Profepa) also performs audits once every two years to ensure that ASUR’s airports are in full compliance with the country’s environmental legislation. Following the inspection procedure, provided that no violations of environmental legislation are identified, the individual airports are issued certificates confirming their compliance with the law. All nine of ASUR’s airports currently have valid environmental compliance certification: the airports at Cozumel, Huatulco, Oaxaca, Tapachula and Villahermosa were recertified during 2016, and those at Cancún, Mérida, Minatitlán and Veracruz are due to be audited during 2017. To date, no administrative or judicial sanctions, including fines or non-monetary penalties, have been imposed on the company for failure to comply with national, international or local environmental laws or regulations. asur 39 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 7 Quality of life for Employees 40 annual sustainability report | 2016 7.0 quality of life for employees As a fundamental part of ASUR’s duty of care toward its employees, we aim to provide decent working conditions in all the subsidiaries that form part of the Group. The company’s main goal in relation to human resources is to ensure that our airports constitute a reliable source of safe employment for local populations. Between 2015 and 2016, the number of full-time employees in our organisation increased by 2.0%, while our agency-hired employees increased by 12.6%. During the period, we have maintained both a low level of staff turnover and an excellent occupational health and safety record. Further information on these aspects is available in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this report. 1 The company has a permanent training programme for employees in all ten locations where we have operations (the head offices in Mexico City and the nine Positive relations between the company’s employairports).

The company’s non-unionised workers are also offered a series of employment benefits, such as health and life insurance, holiday entitlements, Christmas bonuses, matching-funds savings accounts and, in some cases, performance bonuses, that are in excess of the minimum benefits required under Mexican labour legislation. In addition to the permanent employees and the agency-hired personnel mentioned above, there are significant numbers of workers based at each of the company’s airports who are not directly employed by the company. They may be broken down into a number of different categories, including: government employees, such as those working for the air-traffic-control, immigration and customs services; the employees of ASUR’s commercial concession holders, such as food and beverage or retail outlets and car rental offices; the employees of other businesses with a permanent base at the airport, such as ramp service providers and the airlines; and the employees of those companies subcontracted by ASUR to provide specific services in the airports. In the latter case, the most significant services subcontracted by ASUR in all nine of its airports are cleaning services for terminal buildings, administrative offices, and so on; and security services, including general surveillance staff and the personnel manning security filters and passenger inspection points. At this time, data are not available in relation to employment types, contract types or collective bargaining agreements for the aforementioned workers. 44 annual sustainability report | 2016 7.2 safety in the workplace The right to physical integrity, and therefore a safe workplace that does not expose employees to unnecessary risks, is included in the company’s written policies. During 2016, the 958 permanent employees of ASUR worked a total of 2,760,048 hours, equivalent to 345,006 days (eight-hour shifts). In the period in question, there were in total 26 cases of accidents in the workplace, affecting 3.0% of staff members, with no cases of occupational disease and no fatalities. During the year, the total number of lost days resulting from these accidents was 590, equivalent to 0.17% of total days worked. In accordance with the system used by the Mexican Social Security Institute, accidents in the workplace are defined as incidents leading to an injury that requires the staff member in question to miss one or more days of work. The total number of lost days includes all calendar days between the initial accident and the date on which the employee returns to work, even when these days are not working days. The date on which the accident occurs is counted as day one for this purpose. Minor accidents requiring first-aid treatment only are not included in the number of accidents in the workplace. In the same period, the absentee rate (defined as the total number of days that employees were absent from work due to general, non-work-related illness or when no justification was presented for the absence) corresponded to a total of 1,424 days, or 0.41% of total days worked. These data refer exclusively to the 958 direct, full-time employees of ASUR as of the 31st of December 2016. At this time, there are no systems in place that require subcontractors, service providers or other parties with employees working at the airport to provide ASUR with accident, injury and absenteeism data. asur 45 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 8 Community Involvement and Support Measures 46 annual sustainability report | 2016 8.0 community involvement and support The contribution that ASUR makes towards creating decent living standards for its employees and their families is one of the most significant ways in which the company provides support for local communities. The basis for this is the financial success of our business, and we are therefore constantly seeking ways in which we can increase value for both our shareholders and other stakeholders. We are also aware that the airports we operate play a significant role in facilitating business for other companies and individuals in the regions where they are located; our airports form a key part of local transport networks, and are therefore important for the promotion of regional economic development.

During the year 2016, ASUR did not receive any financial assistance from the Mexican government. 48 annual sustainability report | 2016 Awareness campaigns were implemented throughout the company to promote healthy eating and a healthier lifestyle. In the field of assistance for people with disabilities, upgrades were made and equipment acquired to continue to improve disabled accessibility in several of the group’s airports, and an awareness campaign was provided throughout the year for all company employees. In relation to education, the various airports in the group continued to organise guided tours of their facilities for local educational establishments, as well as children’s workshops on a range of subjects such as environmental protection. In the field of culture, ASUR provided funding for a range of film and theatre projects, and several airports in the Group hosted art exhibitions in their terminal buildings. Finally, several of the group’s airports also participated in different ways to support environmental initiatives in their local communities. Among the projects were donations and volunteering for local beach-cleaning and reforestation initiatives. asur 49 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 9 Commitment to Human Rights 50 annual sustainability report | 2016 9.0 commitment to human rights The goal of ASUR’s management in relation to human rights is to ensure that the company and its employees do not incur any human rights violations, and that in those cases where possible abuses are detected, the corresponding steps are taken to resolve them quickly, efficiently and transparently. The Internal Auditing Department is entrusted with investigating any potential human rights abuses. The head of this Department reports directly to the Audit Committee, which is ultimately responsible for enforcement of the company’s policies on human rights. Internal campaigns are carried out on at least an annual basis, in which employees are encouraged to use the company’s reporting system to notify the Internal Auditing Department of any rights abuses. ASUR has a written policy in which the company formally sets forth its commitment to upholding and promoting human rights. This policy expressly states that the company will guarantee its employees the right to personal integrity, which means that workers may not be subjected to corporal punishment or verbal abuse of any nature, and that sexual harassment of any kind is strictly forbidden. The policy also represents a statement of the company’s position on gender equality and non-discrimination: it contains a clause that guarantees equal opportunity for all in hirings, promotions, salary levels, training and day-to-day treatment, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, gender, marital status, physical ability, religion, sexual orientation, social circumstances or political affiliation. During 2016, two complaints of harassment in the workplace were received; the alleged harasser was not an employee of ASUR, and the matter was forwarded to the relevant party for resolution. asur 51 The company has assumed the obligation to protect its employees’ right to freedom of association. As mentioned in Section 7.1 of this report, the company management and the airport workers’ union adhere to a regular collective bargaining procedure to establish employment conditions and benefits for unionised employees. During 2016, no threats were identified to the freedom of association or collective bargaining rights of the company’s employees. According to the company’s policy on human rights, ASUR does not use or benefit from forced labour or child labour of any kind. All working agreements are governed by consensual, written employment contracts, and the company’s policy is not to employ anyone who is under 15 years of age. Currently, no one under the age of 18 is employed by ASUR and no situations involving forced labour have been identified. Finally, the company has the obligation to avoid any situations in which it might be complicit in human rights abuses; in practical terms this means that no investments should be made in, or products and services procured from, other companies that incur human-rights violations. During the period, no instances of human rights violations have been identified in the company’s supply chain. 52 annual sustainability report | 2016 2016 ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT SECTION 10 External Programmes asur 53 10.0 external programmes 10.1 sustainability indices In 2011, ASUR was selected as one of the first group of companies to be part of the Mexico Stock Exchange Sustainability Index. To be considered for inclusion in the index, companies’ practices and procedures in the areas of environment, governance and stakeholder issues are subject to a rigorous evaluation process, with the intention that the index can be used as a responsible-investment guide for ethical investors.
