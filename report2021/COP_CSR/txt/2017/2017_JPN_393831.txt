(“Minebea”) and MITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD. (“Mitsumi”). We interviewed directors who came from each company about the technology development synergy which is the driving force behind growth. Dialogue Hiroshi Aso Michiya Kagami Director, Managing Executive Officer Director, Managing Executive Officer Deputy Chief of Engineering Headquarters Chief of Engineering Headquarters Managing Executive Officer of MITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD. Kagami: Minebea did not have such great breadth in Background to Business Integration its technological development. Hitherto, it expanded Kagami: Minebea has focused its efforts on expanding based upon a certain number of core technologies, the electronic product business in order to realize further developing unsurpassed products in those fields. growth. However, the company actually suffered from a Meanwhile, from Minebea’s perspective, Mitsumi had severe deficiency of in-house engineers. In considering a very wide expanse of technologies. It excelled at how to supplement this, we realized that Mitsumi, quickly responding to the demands of customers and which had over 1,000 diverse and highly specialized society to develop new products. personnel, was our ideal partner. Aso: Originally, Mitsumi purchased components for Aso: Mitsumi has operated for many years as a assembly, and had a history of producing high valuemanufacturer of components for electronic devices, added products. By working with Minebea, which and was bolstering efforts in precision mechanical possessed a core of strong technologies, we create components with an eye on the future. Minebea, with a situation where we have what we need without the its foundation in mechanics, possessed proficiency in need to acquire products and technologies from outside microfabrication, and was therefore able to supplement the company. By fusing together the different types of Mitsumi in the area of precision products, which had technologies possessed by the two companies, we will been a deficiency of the company. Furthermore, by achieve greater results than the simple sum of the two combining electrical elements of Mitsumi’s circuit elements. and wireless technologies with Minebea’s business, Kagami: In addition, we can see that Minebea’s centered on ball bearings, we will be able to make product line-up was centered on output devices such better products faster. I believe that the combination of as actuators and monitors, while Mitsumi’s line-up seemingly opposite elements of a mechanical company included many input devices, such as sensors and with an electronics company will enable us to achieve a cameras. The fact that the two companies specialized greater synergistic effect. in the different fields of input and output meant they could supplement one another, which is why we had high expectations for the integration. 9 MinebeaMitsumi Group CSR Report 2017 gain an advantage unmatched by our competitors. The DNA of Minebea and Mitsumi Commitment from Aso: We will certainly be able to leverage the strengths Kagami: The DNA of Minebea lies in the sincerity of of the two companies in force sensors, which measure its manufacturing. For many years, we have worked load. In addition, we will also be able to propose the CEO faithfully to create strong technology in niche fields. We products which utilize sensors developed by Mitsumi followed an uninterrupted path of steady and diligent for temperature, humidity, and airflow. For example, efforts for the improvement of products such as ball we could combine them with back lights and actuators, bearings, enhancing their precision, for over 50 years which are Minebea’s specialty. until the present.

Exercising the Synergy of Integration Social Report Kagami: A good example of products where we can readily produce synergy are the sensors required for the future IoT*1 society. Minebea boasted among the highest volume of strain gage production globally, while Environmental Report Mitsumi possessed a line-up of sensors utilizing MEMS*2 technology. By combining our sensors, developed through different approaches, we believe that we can MinebeaMitsumi Group CSR Report 2017 10 Special The New Value Creation Which MinebeaMitsumi Aims for by Leveraging Feature 1 the Synergy of Business Integration converts analog phenomena detected by sensors into digital data, the subsequent data processing, and the “exit” that converts digital signals into analog movement through motors and actuators. This is an area where MinebeaMitsumi, with its analog focus, can make a major contribution. Aso: There will be no change to the fact that we, as analog specialists, will have unique strength in offering value in areas linking analog and digital. In addition, there is also the potential for the secondary creation of new business related to the digital sector.

These plants adhere to environmental laws of the countries and Situation check at waste disposal site for the Cambodia Plant localities in which they operate, and independently monitor Special Feature 2 such wastewater discharges, including regular testing for such metrics as pH1, COD2, BOD3, SS4, and n-hexane extracts5. 1. pH: A scale indicating whether substances are acidic or alkaline. pH7 is neutral. pH values below 7 indicate increasing acidity, while values above 7 indicate increasing alkalinity. 2. COD (chemical oxygen demand): The amount of oxygen consumed to oxidize organic substances (pollution) in water. COD measurement takes less time than BOD measurement, but is less reliable. COD is generally used as a metric in wastewater management for sea, lake, and marsh waters. Management Report 3. BOD (biological oxygen demand): The amount of oxygen required for bacteria to consume and decompose organic matter (pollution) in water. Higher values indicate greater degrees of pollution. Measurement takes several days. BOD is generally used to observe effluent water in rivers. Energy conservation patrol at the Shanghai Plant (facility inspection) 4. SS (suspended solids): The volume of substances suspended in water. The higher the number, the greater the degree of water pollution. 5. n-Hexane extracts: Substances extracted from oils and detergents that are difficult to volatilize in water using a substance called n-hexane as solvent.
