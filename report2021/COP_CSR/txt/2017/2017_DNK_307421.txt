Our DNA emerges from the regulated pharmaceutical industry and significantly reflects our approach to quality and business ethics as well as our definition of corporate responsibility. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy integrates and reflects our business objectives and our core business values: open and honest, conscience driven, and value adding – while keeping in mind that corporate responsibility must be carried out through the mutual commitment of management and employees as an integrated part of our daily work. The company’s ’Business Ethics’ outline the responsibilities of employees and directions to protect NNIT from malpractice that may undermine NNIT’s business integrity. Approved by NNIT’s management board and the Board of Directors, it provides the fundamental guidance for responsible and proper business conduct at NNIT. With this document, we confirm our support of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the principles in our business. Best regards, Per Kogut, President and CEO 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 3 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 2 One world, one NNIT NNIT is a leading provider of IT services and consultancy. We offer a wide range of IT services and solutions to customers, primarily in the life sciences sector in Denmark and internationally and to Danish customers in the public, enterprise and finance sectors. As a wall-to-wall provider, NNIT delivers IT services within all categories spanning advisory, business solutions, application outsourcing, infrastructure outsourcing and support. Rooted in the pharmaceutical industry, NNIT supplies services that meet the highest requirements for quality, security and standardization. NNIT operates with a well-integrated global delivery model with delivery centers located in Western Europe, Asia and North America. Our global presence allows us to remain competitive against offshore-based vendors and to deliver 24/7 customer support making optimal use of normal work hours in different time zones. Employing 2,865 staff, covering more than 50 nationalities located in 11 different office locations around the world, NNIT is a global organization. 2.1 Risk related to Corporate Social Responsibility NNIT operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. In order to sustain profitable growth, NNIT considers risk management a necessity and has adopted a structured approach to address this area. In NNIT, risk management contains four elements: risk identification, risk assessment, identification of mitigating actions and risk reporting. NNIT identifies risk using a combination of a bottom-up and a top-down approach. Key risks are initially identified within each divisional area and reported to Group Management together with information on what has been done and what is intended to be done. High risks are aggregated and a broad list presented in an annual risk report and challenged by Group Management and finally by the Audit Committee of the Board as well as the Board of Directors. Group Management continuously follows up and reports monthly on risk development with mitigating actions to the Board of Directors. A risk matrix providing an overview of the key risks important to NNIT’s business including root causes and the mitigating actions undertaken by the company is presented in NNIT’s annual report 2016, page 29. While ‘saving the planet’ is a concern, by far and away the main drivers for NNIT’s actions on corporate social responsibility are business related. Employee recruitment and retention issues are important focus areas. Thus, failing to implement and preserve sound social responsibility may impair our attractiveness as an employer and consequently put our business at risk if we are not fully equipped to meet our customers’ demands. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 4 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact As such, the main risks identified in relation to Corporate Social Responsibility are related to company brand and reputation. Measures installed to mitigate such risks are described below in each section under items ‘implementation’. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 5 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 3 Human Rights Principles 3.1 Commitment NNIT complies with the requirements of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and The United Nations Convention against Corruption, and we ask of all our employees that they work actively to ensure continued compliance in all their work. In all respects, NNIT respects and acknowledges cultural difference and disassociates itself with discrimination based on race, religion, gender, age, nationality or sexual orientation. NNIT places high priority on a sound and healthy work environment, as it is a precondition for flexibility, adaptability and personal development. 3.2 Implementation As part of the company’s internal processes, NNIT has developed a Working Environment Process that covers all activities that are required to ensure a healthy working environment. A Working Environment Council was established in NNIT in 1999 and has since continuously worked to create optimal work conditions for employees and secure the absence of work place accidents. Following Danish legislation, NNIT carries out the mandatory APV (workplace assessment survey) every two years. Actions based on the results of the survey are taken. 3.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire operations. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights violations in 2016. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 6 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 4 Labor Rights Principles 4.1 Commitment NNIT complies with the requirements of the International Labour Organization’s conventions and declarations, including the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, convention no. 155, as well as the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 4.2 Implementation NNIT’s Code of Conduct forms the basis for diligent and proper conduct of business in NNIT. All employees are trained in the Code of Conduct, and all suppliers undergo an approval process to ensure they meet NNIT’s safety and quality requirements as well as our business standards. NNIT expects all suppliers and subcontractors to share the fundamental principles of NNIT’s responsible sourcing standards and that they meet and comply with the requirements of United Nations Global Compact. All employees in NNIT further participate in annual performance reviews, and individual development plans are made for all employees. NNIT monitors absence related to sickness on a monthly basis to be able to react if a negative trend is discovered. 4.3 Performance evaluation NNIT employs more than 2,800 people, located in 6 different geographies, covering some 50+ nationalities. Individual development plans and performance reviews have been carried out for all employees in all locations. NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy is publically available from the company’s website, confirming NNIT’s commitment to sustainable and socially responsible behavior. A total of nine work place accidents were reported in 2016, none of which involved terminal or permanent injuries. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 7 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 5 Environmental Protection Principles 5.1 Commitment NNIT’s business activities comprise IT and advisory services, including general office activities and business travel, primarily in connection with servicing clients. Although these services and business activities do not directly affect the environment, the associated energy consumption, first and foremost, and business travel do have an impact. While such activities are necessary when working in a global business, NNIT continuously aims to reduce the use of resources and the environmental impact of its business activities. The company thus maintains focus on how to reduce energy consumption in all business areas. 5.2 Implementation The company’s headquarters in Copenhagen as well as its established datacenter have been constructed with emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency. Wherever possible, NNIT makes use of technology solutions, including virtual meetings via the Internet, to reduce the need for travel. Further, NNIT promotes sustainable and low-energy devices. The company car fleet includes stipulations to only select cars that are fuel-efficient and environmentally optimized. 5.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire doings. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving environmental protection violations in 2016. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 8 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 6 Anti-Corruption 6.1 Commitment NNIT’s Business Ethics and Code of Conduct form the basis of NNIT’s business in its entire operations. They provide guidance, and outline the responsibilities of the employees and management to protect NNIT from any malpractice that may undermine the company’s business integrity and impact its long-term business success. NNIT considers corruption and bribery wrong and illegal, and not acceptable. The company’s business ethics and code of conduct clearly lay forward the consequences of engaging in such unlawfulness. Giving or accepting business gifts, hospitality or entertainment is not allowed, however minor gifts and moderate entertainment may be part of customary business dealings and hence considered acceptable. To avoid that gifts, hospitality and entertainment have undue influence on business decisions a maximum amount is defined by NNIT’s management board and applies to all employees in the group. 6.2 Implementation NNIT’s DNA emerges from the regulated pharmaceutical industry as a former subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A/S. The company’s origin reflects its approach when it comes to quality and business ethics. All employees are trained in the company’s business ethics and code of conduct, including rules for gifts, hospitality and entertainment. If and when the documents are updated, all employees will receive notification to familiarize themselves with the content of the documents and officially sign that they have read and understand and comply with the guidelines. 6.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, the company’s business ethics and code of conduct, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire doings. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving anticorruption violations in 2016. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 9 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 7 Diversity – Board of Directors 7.1 Commitment NNIT recognizes the value of diversity and hence the importance of promoting diversity at management levels, including gender-related diversity. It is NNIT’s ambition to increase diversity at management levels by providing equal opportunities for men and women, promoting international experience, and maintaining the management’s capability to effectively undertake its managerial responsibilities considering the company’s international profile. NNIT aims to employ the best candidates, and the candidate’s qualifications must therefore always be the decisive factor in external and internal recruitment processes. 7.2 Implementation In accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, section 99 b, the Board of Directors set its diversity ambition in 2013 to include:  At least two shareholder-elected Danish Board members  At least two shareholder-elected non-Danish Board members  At least two female and two male shareholder-elected Board members 7.3 Performance evaluation The Board of Directors initially resolved to meet its diversity ambition by 2017, but has decided to postpone the target timeline to 2019. Currently, the Board of Directors consists of one shareholder-elected female board member and one non-Danish board member; hence NNIT has not yet reached its target. It has been a focus area to ensure continuity of the Board of Directors following the IPO in 2015. Therefore, in 2016, the Annual General Meeting elected only one new member to NNIT’s Board of Directors, while the rest was re-elected in uncontested election. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 10 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact 8 Diversity – other management levels 8.1 Commitment NNIT recognizes the value of diversity and hence the importance of promoting diversity at management levels, including gender-related diversity. It is NNIT’s ambition to increase diversity at all management levels by providing equal opportunities for men and women, promoting international experience, and maintaining the management’s capability to effectively undertake its managerial responsibilities considering the company’s international profile. NNIT aims to employ the best candidates, and the candidate’s qualifications must therefore always be the decisive factor in external and internal recruitment processes. 8.2 Implementation The company’s general procedures for employment seek to provide equal career opportunities for men and women and they are actively used when seeking to employ persons to management positions with the Group. Consequently, job descriptions, job advertisements, screening of applicants and job interviews are never aimed at a particular gender. Engaged search and selection firms are requested to identify at least one female candidate for all management positions. All internal and external searches for vacant positions must include at least one female candidate on the short list. Succession planning is carried out for all management positions, aiming to identify female successors for management level positions. Further, an internal training course, ‘Discover Your Leadership Potential’, is aimed at talented employees with a clear potential for becoming a people manager. Participation in the program is based on the manager’s recommendation. Finally, awareness of women in leadership at top management level in the company is addressed at least annually, as it is a recurring topic at a board meeting and at a meeting of the Executive Management. 8.3 Performance evaluation At the end of 2016, NNIT employed a total of 2,865 staff globally. Of these were 31% women, 69% men. This is an increase of almost 2 percentage points compared to the year before, when only 29.3% of the staff was female. The gender distribution is vastly in line with the candidate pool from where NNIT recruits. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 11 of 12 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections NNIT 99 a and 99 b of the Danish Financial Communication on Progress 2016 Statements Act for the financial year 2016 UN Global Compact Some 10% of the female staff is currently employed in various management positions. In 2017, NNIT will focus on female participation in the ‘Discover Your Leadership Potential’ training program. Further, following the program all female participants will be assigned a mentor selected among the current female managers. 2017-01-25 Version: 1.0 Page 12 of 12
