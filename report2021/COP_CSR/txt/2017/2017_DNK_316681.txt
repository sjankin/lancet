At the same time, Roskilde Airport maintained its position as Denmark’s preferred training base for pilots, with around 30,000 training flights a year, and in 2016 another flying school was established at the airport. As well as being an important training base, Roskilde Airport is one of Europe’s leading business airports, with around 10,000 private business jets landing and taking off there every year. In 2016, the airport was named best airport at handling business aviation by European Business Air News in its survey of more than 400 fixed-base operators in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Russia. In addition to personal service for flight customers, Roskilde Airport also offers conference facilities and has hosted various events, including the Roskilde Airshow. 36 M A N AG E M E N T ' S R E V I E W > P E R F O R M A N CE > S E G M E N TA L P E R F O R M A N C E Segmental performance AERONAUTICAL BUSINESS by DKK 107.9 million to DKK 761.7 million, an DKK million 2016 2015 Ch.

CPH evaluates the carrying amounts in order to assess whether tial impairment such as purchase and sales prices, and general market conditions. events have occurred that require an adjustment of these amounts because they are not expected to be recoverable. In the estimation of the runways’ useful lives, CPH has chosen to divide the system into three elements: foundations, surface and technical installations. CPH’s assessment is that each unit has a different useful life. The runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundations due to immediate wear. Useful life expectancy is 10 years. This assessment is supported by historical replacement of runway surfaces and planning for future replacement. Technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 15 years. It is assessed that these technical installations do not have the same useful life as other technical installations, taking into account the security measures. 95 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N CI A L P E R F O R M A N CE A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued) 2016 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools and equipment under DKK million equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,342.2 7,165.3 1,694.6 770.0 16,972.1 Additions 990.0 990.0 Disposals (60.8) (44.9) (174.5) (280.2) Transferred 323.6 432.1 209.0 (964.7) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,605.0 7,552.5 1,729.1 795.3 17,681.9 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,841.6 3,516.2 1,211.1 7,568.9 Depreciation 199.3 257.6 131.6 588.5 Depreciation on disposals (56.4) (44.9) (174.5) (275.8) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,984.5 3,728.9 1,168.2 7,881.6 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,620.5 3,823.6 560.9 795.3 9,800.3 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total of DKK 507.5 million (2015: DKK 507.7 million). 96 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N CI A L P E R F O R M A N CE A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (continued) 2015 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools and equipment under DKK million equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,112.9 6,840.8 1,656.3 527.8 16,137.8 Additions 1,039.5 1,039.5 Disposals (10.5) (120.5) (74.2) (205.2) Transferred 239.8 445.0 112.5 (797.3) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,342.2 7,165.3 1,694.6 770.0 16,972.1 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,675.8 3,371.1 1,163.4 7,210.3 Depreciation 179.0 263.1 121.7 563.8 Depreciation on disposals (13.2) (118.0) (74.0) (205.2) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,841.6 3,516.2 1,211.1 7,568.9 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,500.6 3,649.1 483.5 770.0 9,403.2 * See previous page for information. 97 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N CI A L P E R F O R M A N CE A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Note 12 TRADE RECEIVABLES The year’s movements are recognised in the income statement under External costs.

The duration of CPH’s loans at 31 December 2016 has been determined at approximately 7.1 A decrease in the GBP rate of interest of 1 %-point (8.3) (3.7) years (2015: approximately 7.0 years), including the effect of swap contracts. A change in the DKK, USD and GBP interest rate will have an opposite effect on the loan portfolio. However, as the liability is recognised at amortised cost, it will not impact the carrying amount and Most of CPH’s loan portfolio is at fixed initerest rate or has been swapped to fixed interest thereby equity. rate. Fluctuations in the interest rate levels would therefore have only a limited impact on CPH’s income statement. As the exchange rate and interest rate risk of debt denominated in USD, GBP and DKK is hedged by USD/DKK, GBP/DKK and DKK interest rate swaps, a change in interest rate levels would affect equity. 108 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N CI A L P E R F O R M A N CE A N D S TAT E M E N T S > F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S Notes Note Note 18 FINANCIAL RISKS (continued) 19 NOTES TO THE CASH FLOW STATEMENT Exchange rate risks Exchange rate fluctuations would have a moderate impact on CPH’s operating results DKK milion 2016 2015 because most of its revenues and costs are settled in DKK.

CPH is responsible for ensuring that reporting is provided on the areas that are relevant to CPH’s stakeholders and have a material impact on CPH’s business now and in the future. In 2014, we integrated the reporting on CPH’s financial and non-financial performance and thoroughly restructured the targets that drive our work relating to operating and expanding Copenhagen Airport responsibly. To better reflect CPH’s holistic approach to corporate responsibility, the business-driven targets were integrated with the traditional CR areas – environment and energy, employees, safety and security, and procurement – in this new target structure. The targets are organised into three strategic areas of focus – Position, People and Planet – as presented on page 25. The non-financial statements follow the same structure. 118 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N OT AU D I T E D) Notes Note Note 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 2 PASSENGER SATISFACTION Changes compared to 2015 Accounting policies Further to the clearer integration of business and traditional CR targets carried out in Passenger satisfaction is measured by means of personal interviews conducted with current 2014, the targets, indicators and format of the non-financial reporting were changed and potential passengers to identify their travel behaviour, satisfaction and attitudes to in the Annual Report 2014.

In 2015, Copenhagen Airport was the most punctual medium-sized airport in the world. In 2016, Copenhagen Airport was the most punctual Scandinavian airport. Despite the decline in 2016, Copenhagen Airport was the second most punctual airport in Europe, according to the air travel intelligence company OAG. The decline was due to general challenges with arrival punctuality at Copenhagen Airport by European airlines, very bad weather around Europe in the winter months and a higher number of strikes in Europe, both air traffic control and airlines.

In all three cases, the DTCA has concluded that no violation of the noise abatement provisions has occurred. As per the terms of reference of Unit 2016 2015 2014 the Advance Approval Committee for Night Traffic (FUNA), the other eight noise events of 82 dB or above have not been submitted to the DTCA, as they were subject to exemptions. TDENL dB 145.1 144.7 144.5 The number of noise events above 80 dB was in line with the previous year. Viewed over the year as a whole, the number of aircraft operations increased by 4.3%. In the three busiest months, traffic was up from a total of 69,438 operations in 2015 to 72,370 operations in 2016 – an increase of 4.2%, corresponding to 0.2 dB. The distribution of operations between day, evening and night changed from 2015 to 2016, with relatively more take-offs and landings both in the evening and at night in 2016 (during the three busiest months). 134 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N OT AU D I T E D) Notes Note 28 AIR QUALITY Accounting policies Air quality: The air quality at Copenhagen Airport is monitored and logged by CPH’s air Unit 2016 2015 2014 quality-monitoring system in compliance with CPH’s environmental permit for air quality for air traffic at Copenhagen Airport.

Emissions are ­determined for aircraft operations below an altitude of 3,000 feet (approximately 1 kilometre). The amount of NO2 in the air in 2016 increased to the 2012/13 level. This may be due to both the level of activity at the airport and external factors, as external sources have a big impact on concentrations of NO2. Emissions increased compared to 2015 because of the increasing number of aircraft operations. A new and improved model for calculating emissions was implemented during 2015 and is the main reason for the changes in levels recorded. The figures for 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable to historical data. 135 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N OT AU D I T E D) Notes Note Note 29 DRINKING WATER 30 WASTE WATER Accounting policies Accounting policies Water consumption is calculated on the basis of volumes purchased/registered less volumes Most waste water is discharged to the Tårnby treatment plant, and a minor part is discharged distributed on to other companies at the airport.

The water is analysed for BOD, COD, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), fuel, heavy metals, glycol, ammonium and formic acid. The volume of surface water discharged into the Øresund is determined by the year’s rainfall on CPH’s land. This means there can be large variations in the amounts from year to year. To minimise the discharge of oil components via the surface water system, approximately 143 oil separators have been set up in the airport area. A fixed procedure of regular The number of recorded oil spills increased compared to 2015, and the total volume sounding and emptying ensures optimal removal of oil to prevent it from ending in the also increased. As these spills represent unintended events, there can be relatively large surface water system. fluctuations from year to year. The volume of surface water discharged into the Øresund is measured at the largest outlet and is calculated based on areas and precipitation data for the other outlets. Oil and fuel spills: The number of oil and fuel spills is calculated as the number of reports filed by CPH’s internal organisation or the fuel delivery companies. Calculation of the volume of spills is subject to some uncertainty, as it is rarely possible to measure the exact volume of a spill. 137 C O N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N – N OT AU D I T E D) Notes Note Note 32 RUNWAY DE-ICING 33 AIRCRAFT DE-ICING Accounting policies Accounting policies The consumption of runway and taxiway de-icing agents is calculated on the basis of the Copenhagen Airport is at its highest alert level during the winter season.
