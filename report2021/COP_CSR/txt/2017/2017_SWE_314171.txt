CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 55 FINANCING Financing at low risk – a cornerstone of Castellum’s strategy Owning and managing real estate is a capital-intensive business, which requires readily accessible funding. Funding can be carried out utilizing shareholder equity as well as borrowed capital, and the look of a company’s capital structure depends on the financial risk that the company and its owners are prepared to take. 56 CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT REPORT 2016 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT Paula and Jens FINANCING Financing The chosen capital structure is pivotal for the finance policy, the Group can control and manage Financing 31-12-2016 financial returns and risk exposure anticipated by financial risks and ensure risk management owners.

With the support of the strength, transparency and flexibility. CASTELLUM’S FIVE CORNERSTONES ABOUT FUNDING DIVERSIFICATION Castellum will oversee a diversified loan portfolio and avoid dependence on both individual counterparty and source of financing. In addition, the maturity of various kinds of funding sources and individual loans will be distributed over time. Castellum will monitor and follow developments on financial markets, enabling us to act quickly and to match business requirements. At year end, Castellum’s interest-bearing financing amounted to SEK 38.2 billion, of which SEK 17.0 billion came from capital market financing (an MTN-program totalling SEK 9.3 billion and a commercial paper program totalling SEK 7.7 billion) corresponding to 44%. Remaining financing came from bank financing from major Nordic banks and credit institutes. At year end, the average maturity of credit agreements amounted to 3.0 years and ranged from 1 month to 13.5 years. LIQUIDITY Castellum will keep unutilized credit facilities available, in order to respond rapidly to business needs and opportunities that arise. Moreover, there will be revolving credit facilities for the purpose of reducing the need to invest the surplus. At year end, Castellum had SEK 53.3 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 15.0 billion was unutilized. STRENGTH The Group’s financial key ratios will be strong, with a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 55% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%. The strength of our real estate portfolio is enhanced by the quality of our cash flow as well as by the composition of our debt and interest rate portfolio. Castellum is to reduce the risk of sudden negative impact on net financial items – resulting from interest rate changes and/ or the assessment of Castellum as borrower – that cannot be adjusted by opposing effects on income related to business operations. The loan-to-value ratio was 50% at year end, while the interest coverage ratio for 2016 was 348%. TRANSPARENCY Castellum will encourage long-term relationships with both banks and other lenders/investors and aim to be transparent in order to increase stakeholder understanding of the Group’s operations and, consequently, credit exposure. FLEXIBILITY Castellum is to have flexible financing for the purpose of supporting business developments regarding acquisitions, sales and project development. Our credit facilities will provide us with high flexibility to withdraw and repay with short notice and at no extra cost. Furthermore, Castellum is to have access to flexibility, both in terms of pricing (fixed and floating) and maturities. At year end, Castellum had SEK 36.3 billion in bank agreements, of which SEK 23.0 billion consisted of revolving credit facilities.

CASTELLUM ANNUAL REPORT 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT 67 P R O P E R T Y VA L U AT I O N A property portfolio valued at SEKm 70,757 On December 31st, 2016 Castellum’s investment properties were assessed a fair value of SEKm 70,757 corresponding to SEK 16,558 per sq.m. The average valuation yield for Castellum’s real estate portfolio, excluding development projects, undeveloped land and building rights can be calculated to 5.8%. The valuation was carried out in a uniform manner using internal valuation based on a 10-year cash flow model with individual assessments for each property. This was to reflect both future earnings capacity and required market yield. In order to provide further assurance and validation of the valuation, 180 properties – representing 57% of the value of the portfolio – have been valued externally. 10 68 CASTELLUM CASTELLUMÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT 2014 2016 DIRECTORS’ REPORT PROPERTY VALUATION Property valuation Internal valuation Assumptions in Castellum’s internal valuations Castellum records the investment properties at Office/retail Warehouse/logistics fair value and has made an internal valuation of Cash flow year 1 all properties as of December 31, 2016.

measures presented by Castellum are not defined in accordance with the IFRS accounting standards. However, the company believes that these measures provide useful supplementary information to both investors and Castellum management, as they facilitate evaluation of company performance. It is to be noted that, since not all companies calculate financial measurements in the same manner, these are not always comparable to measurements used by other companies. Hence, these financial measures should not be seen as a substitute for measures defined according to the IFRS. Unless otherwise stated, the table below presents measures, along with their reconciliation, which are not defined according to the IFRS. Definitions for these measures appear on the page 161. Jan – Dec 2016 Jan – Dec 2015 Average number of shares, thousand (related to financial key ratios) * 234,540 189,014 Outstanding number of shares, thousand (related to balance sheet ratios) * 273,201 189,014 *) The number of historical shares that have been recalculated with reference to the bonus-issue element (i.e. the value of the subscription right) in the completed new share issue, and utilized in all ratio calculations for SEK-per-share. The conversion factor is 1.15. INCOME FROM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT Castellum’s operations are focused on cash-flow growth from ongoing management operations – i.e. income growth from property management – the prime yearly objective being a 10% increase in property management income. Income from property management also forms the basis of the annual shareholder dividend: at least 50% of property-management income. Income from property management is calculated before paid tax, as well as after the theoretical tax that Castellum would have paid on income from property management, had there been no loss carryforwards.

Based on this equity, Castellum wants to create return and growth at a low level of risk. Net asset value can be calculated both long and short term. Long-term net asset value is based on the balance sheet, with adjustments for items that will not lead to any short-term payment. In Castellum’s case, these would include such things as goodwill, derivatives and deferred tax liability. Actual net asset value is equity according to the balance sheet, adjusted for the market value of the deferred tax liability.

Further, assessments have been made that tax loss carry forwards are realized in 2 years with a nominal tax of 22%, giving a present value of deferred tax liability of 21%, and that the properties are realized in 50 years where 33% are sold directly with a nominal tax of 22% and that 67% are sold indirect through company disposals where the buyers tax discount is 6%, which gives a present value of deferred tax liability of 4%. Furthermore, deferred tax assets attributable to non-deductible losses in the derivatives portfolio have been valued at a nominal tax of 22%. 100 CASTELLUM CASTELLUMANNUALANNUALREPORTREPORT20162016DIRECTORS’ DIRECTORS’REPORT REPORT QUARTELY AND MULTI-YEAR SUMMARY FINANCIAL RISK Castellum’s strategy is to own, develop and manage properties at low financial risk.
