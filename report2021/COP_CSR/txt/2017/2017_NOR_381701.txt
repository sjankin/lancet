For several years, Opera has made data-center efficiency, low-power CPUs in our servers and procuring power from renewable energy sources key components of our hostingexpansion strategy. Our colocation agreements with data centers require the use of renewable energy and compliance with our power efficiency standard. Across all locations, we are 27% more efficient than the Uptime Institute industry average. Opera’s approach reduces the cost per transaction and the negative environmental impact of our company. When purchasing servers and other larger infrastructures, we focus on reducing waste throughout the lifecycle of the product. New purchases are assembled at the factory and delivered with minimal packaging. We focus on using the equipment as long as it is efficient, often years longer than the original expected life. When used equipment is ready for retirement, Opera has entered into a collaboration with Greentech, part of the Arrow Group, who buy and refurbish equipment, before they resell or recycle it. Opera works actively to reduce the production of paper waste from our operations. Further, Opera has effectively removed all disposable cups and glasses from our offices. Instead, our employees receive a personal cup and water bottle upon joining the company. We encourage keeping the lights out after hours and in unused areas. We encourage the use of video conferencing, rather than extensive traveling. Measurement of outcome: We support the environment and seek to prevent negative environmental impact our activities might have. As a consequence, all employees are obliged to follow the Ethical Code of Conduct, containing the company environmental policy. We are continually evaluating our green-technology data centers and other measures to reduce our environmental impact. ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Commitment: Opera abstains from and works actively to combat corruption, including extortion and bribery. Corruption distorts economic decision-making, deters investment, undermines competitiveness and, ultimately, weakens economic growth. 9 Our actions: There is no single, comprehensive, universally accepted definition of corruption. Therefore, each Opera employee must adhere to the existing laws and regulations in his/her country of operation. At a minimum, Opera’s internal regulations apply to all employees. Controls are made to ensure that the rules are followed. The following is an extract of these guidelines. Conflicts of interest Economic and/or other benefits for employees Our employees must neither directly nor indirectly receive payment, gifts, travel, overnight stays or other benefits from the company’s business partners when these are: 1. not in accordance with common and approved business-related hospitality or concern 2. not of an immodest scope in connection with value and frequency 3. not to be regarded as appropriate according to time and place 4. considered to influence the receiver’s conduct on behalf of the company for some reason or other The company’s employees must neither directly nor indirectly have personal business-related contact with contractors who work within his/her area of responsibility without approval from the supervisor. No employees must work on or deal with any matter in which they themselves, their spouse, partner, cohabitant, close relative, or any other person with whom they have close relations, has a direct or indirect financial interest. Employees must also be opposed to situations where a personal friend/relation, according to pt. 3, is put in a situation the employee him-/herself would be prevented from according to pt. 4. If the employee or a personal friend/relation is offered a personal benefit that exceeds what is regarded as allowed above, this must be reported to the supervisor. Further, the company’s employees must avoid any conflicts between their own interests and those of the company. For that reason, no one should participate in or try to influence matters for which special conditions pertain which could diminish confidence in the person’s independence or impartiality. Conditions such as this are present when the employee him-/herself or someone close to that person has a direct or indirect interest in the matter. Anyone who is disqualified needs to personally inform his or her superior of this immediately and abstain from any involvement in the matter. If employees know of any circumstances likely to undermine trust in his/her impartiality and integrity of work, the employee must notify Opera's Legal department. Economic and/or other benefits for business partners, etc. No employee shall offer or perform illegal or unauthorized economical or other benefits to or for public employees or customers’ employees in order to achieve or 10 maintain business-related advantages for the company. Services that are allowed under pt. 4 may normally be given. The above point entails among other things that it is illegal to make use of particular methods such as sub-delivery, purchase orders and consultant arrangements, etc., to transfer illegal or unjustified economical or other benefits for the persons mentioned. Insider trading Opera employees are prohibited from trading in Opera securities based on information that is material, non-public information; that is, the public does not yet have access to this information, and this information may be deemed interesting for an investor to use when deciding whether to buy or sell securities. This rule also applies to other companies, where Opera employees may have access to such nonpublic information. Gifts It is a normal part of business life to exchange business courtesies, such as meals, transportation, recreation, facilities or small gifts. Such an exchange of business courtesies must always follow local laws and regulations and not put any Opera employee in the position of a sense of obligation to return the favor, compromise professional judgment or create the appearance of compromise or corruption. Opera employees should always check with their manager or the HR department, if in doubt, and consider whether the exchange of business courtesy would be acceptable if it should become publicly known. No person acting on behalf of Opera is allowed to accept any amount of cash or cash equivalents (such as gift certificates or market securities and similar), regardless of sum. Correspondingly, cash or cash equivalents may never be offered by Opera employees as a business courtesy, regardless of sum. Money laundering Money laundering is the process of concealing illicit sources of money. Opera employees are forbidden to engage knowingly in transactions that facilitate money laundering or result in unlawful diversion. Bribery No person acting on behalf of Opera shall attempt to influence someone in the conduct of their post, office or commission by offering an improper advantage. Nor shall improper advantage be offered to anyone for the purpose of influencing third parties in the conduct of their post, office, or commission. Correspondingly, no person acting on behalf of Opera shall request, accept or receive improper advantage in connection with his/her position or assignment or for the purpose of influencing a third party. Improper advantage can take different forms, including but not limited to money, objects, credits, discounts, travel, accommodation and other services. 11 Political contributions The company must, as a main rule, not make any contributions in support of political parties. Exceptions to this rule may be made only by the company’s CEO. Measurement of outcome: All Opera staff members must adhere to the existing laws and regulations in his/her country of operation. Staff must further obey by the internal Opera guidelines regulating anti-corruption. There has been no report of corruption, including extortion and bribery, in the period covered by this report. 12
