The Board of RBPlat sets the direction for how we approach and address risk. Our enterprise risk management (ERM) framework aligns our strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge with the purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties we face in protecting and creating stakeholder value. Our risk governance structures and processes, which include the oversight, management and assurance of risk management, are based on the three lines of defence and a combined assurance model. It enables an effective internal control environment and supports the integrity of information used for internal decision-making, strategy development and planning by management, the Board and its committees. To take risk management in RBPlat to the next level we aim to maintain an Optimised level of risk management. Linking strategy, risk, performance and reward RISK REWARD Enhance performance by Set the scene and 8QGHUVWDQG tracking Balanced targets based on the the risk and performance monthly stakeholder reward operating opportunities and and based on risk versus environment proactively implement performance manage them corrective actions STRATEGY PERFORMANCE Our approach to risk appetite and risk tolerances In line with the recommendations of King IV RBPlat’s Board has ultimate responsibility for risk management including the development of our risk appetite and the setting and monitoring of risk tolerances. Our risk appetite statements are designed to ensure that the RBPlat Group includes risk factors in any major strategic or tactical decision and the compatibility of a course of action with our risk appetite, is always questioned. RBPlat’s risk appetite statements All companies must assume a certain degree of risk, but there are limits as to how much risk RBPlat can accept in its pursuit of creating economic value for all its stakeholders. Assuming too much risk could cause the fabric of the organisation to unravel if several of these risks materialise, and in extreme cases could cause it to collapse. Failure to contain risk exposures within acceptable limits could also cause harm to people and jeopardise the interests of VWDNHKROGHUV,WLVYLWDOWKHUHIRUHWKDWWKH&RPSDQ\PDQDJHVULVNZLWKLQGHÀQHGOLPLWV RBPlat has a low tolerance for an aggregate level of risk that jeopardises the Company’s four-pillar strategy. The Company’s strategy is to sustain asset quality, so the Board of Directors set a low appetite for the pursuit of lower-grade assets and thus has no appetite to acquire lower-grade businesses or assets merely for the sake of market consolidation. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2016 I 25 OUR INTEGRATED APPROACH Risk management — a strategic imperative continued The Board set the following risk appetite at strategic level: Risk appetite statement Risk appetite measure Key risk indicator Risk appetite measure The Company will seek to meet or The Company has a low Headline earnings per share 20% fall in HEPS exceed budgeted earnings and appetite for a drop in (HEPS) minimise the volatility of earnings to six-month or full year HEPS 10% fall in HEPS meet shareholders’ expectations 0% fall in HEPS The risk appetite measures for each capital can be found under the relevant capital.

It also has a major establishment of an ethical impact on poor communities and corrodes the very fabric of society.

It assessed the risks and opportunities, the possible impact on our strategy and our business model, and our sustainability and value creation process, and took decisions that protected value and our sustainability. The plan that the Board approved for 2016, which allowed for development to continue at a pace dictated by the rand basket price achieved, protected 94 both value and sustainability and proved to be a successful one (see SDJHRIÀQDQFLDO capital and page 106 of manufactured capital for details).

RBPlat also establishes the issues that could have the greatest impact on our ability to achieve our strategy and create value for our achieving its strategic objectives stakeholders. This process allows us to assess what value we have added to the business and 34 what we need to do to add value in the future (see page 34 of this report). Our Audit and Risk Committee oversees the governance of risk in conjunction with our Social and Ethics Committee through our enterprise risk management framework and our system of internal controls. The ERM approach we have adopted at RBPlat provides us with an integrated approach to the management of our business risks within a complex and ever changing environment. In addition, our ERM framework (see page 33 of this report) allows for risk-based decision33 making and provides a streamlined process for evaluating opportunities within the business. Our ERM strategy, framework and policy are closely aligned with RBPlat’s business strategy and business plan, which form the basis of RBPlat’s risk appetite statement and related risk tolerances. In addition to the ERM policy, our risk management policy suite includes a safety, health, environment and risk (SHER) policy, a fraud corruption prevention policy and a Code of Ethics. Our ERM framework also embeds the culture and practice of risk management in our day-to-day business activities by aligning strategy, process, people, technology, knowledge and reward with the purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties RBPlat faces in creating stakeholder value.

It is also important that we provide our stakeholders, and in particular our investors, with accurate up-to-date information on the status of our resources and reserves at year-end. This section of our integrated report provides a summary of the status of our mineral resources and reserves as at 31 December 2016. The RBPlat Annual Mineral Resources and Reserves Statement 2016, which provides detailed information on our resources and reserves as at 31 December 2016, is available on our website at www.bafokengplatinum.co.za/stake-annual-reports.php. RBPlat’s operations lie on the Western Limb of the Bushveld Igneous Complex, immediately south of the Pilanesberg Complex. Rocks of the Lower, Critical and Main zones of the Rustenburg Layered Suite (RLS) underlie our operations, apart from a very small portion of the northern boundary area where rocks of the Pilanesberg Complex occur. RBPlat’s mining operations, on the farms Boschkoppie 104 JQ, Styldrift 90 JQ and Frischgewaagd 96 JQ, are exploiting the two primary economically favourable stratigraphic PGM horizons of the Western Bushveld Complex, the Merensky 5HHIDQGWKH8*5HHI%RWKUHHIKRUL]RQVDUHHQULFKHGZLWKEDVHPHWDOVXOSKLGHVDQG3*0VRIZKLFKWKH0HUHQVN\ Reef historically has been the most important platinum producing layer in the Western Bushveld Complex.

Ordinary resolutions numbers 1 to 4 are proposed to re-elect the directors who retire as directors of the Company by rotation in accordance with the MOI and who, being eligible for re-election, offer themselves for re-election. A brief biography of the directors offering themselves for re-election is contained on page 62 of the integrated report and the Company’s website www.bafokengplatinum.co.za. The Board, with the assistance of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, has reviewed the composition and performance of the Board in accordance with corporate governance guidelines and transformation requirements and has recommended the re-election of the directors offering themselves for re-election. 3.

The authority will be subject to the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements. 6. Issue of shares for cash (ordinary resolution number 11) In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a general authority for the directors to issue shares for cash requires shareholder approval. The directors also require approval in terms of the MOI to issue shares for cash on a non-pro rata basis. The existing authority granted by the shareholders at the previous AGM held on 13 April 2016 expires at the AGM to be held on Wednesday, 12 April 2017, unless renewed. The Board has decided to seek renewal of this authority in accordance with best practice. The authority will be subject to the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements. 7. Approval of remuneration policy (ordinary resolution number 12) In terms of the King III recommendations, shareholders should annually, through a non-binding advisory vote, endorse the Company’s remuneration policy at the AGM, allowing shareholders to express their views on the remuneration policies adopted and the implementation thereof. Ordinary resolution number 12 is proposed to consider and approve, by way of a non-binding advisory vote, the remuneration policy of the Company, as set out in the Remuneration report on pages 54 to 59 of the integrated report. Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2016 I 179 NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Notice of Annual General Meeting continued 8. General authority to repurchase shares (special resolution number 1) The effect of special resolution number 1 and the reason for this resolution is to grant the Company or any of its subsidiaries a general approval in terms of the MOI, the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements, to acquire the Company’s shares, which general approval shall be valid until the earlier of such next AGM of the Company or its variation or revocation of such general authority by special resolution at any subsequent general meeting of WKH&RPSDQ\SURYLGHGWKDWWKHJHQHUDODXWKRULW\VKDOOQRWH[WHQGEH\RQG ÀIWHHQ PRQWKVIURPWKHGDWHRI this AGM.

Amendments to the MOI (special resolution number 2) The reason for special resolution number 2 is to amend the MOI to provide for electronic delivery of the notice of shareholder meeting to any shareholder who has elected such option as well as to provide for the new fraction entitlement principle as required by the JSE Limited Listings Requirements by replacing clause 10.7.1.

Non-executive directors’ fees (special resolution number 3) In terms of King IV and the Act, the shareholders of the Company are required to approve by special resolution the fees to be paid to non-executive directors. Please see the Remuneration report on page 59 for additional information on non-executive directors’ fees. The Board believes that the proposed fees are competitive enough and will enable the Company to retain and attract people of the calibre required to make a meaningful contribution to the Company, having regard to the appropriate capability, skills and experience required. The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, recommends to shareholders that these fees be approved. Statutory disclosure Proxies In terms of section 58 of the Act, a shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy or two or more proxies to attend, participate in and vote at the meeting in place of the shareholder. The proxy need not be a shareholder of the Company. (A proxy form together with a summary of section 58 of the Act pertaining to a shareholder’s right to be represented by proxy is attached hereto.)
