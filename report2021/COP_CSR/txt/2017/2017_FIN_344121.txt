The Paris Agreement, settled in COP21 in 2015, was ratified earlier than expected. Metsä Group continues to make headway into desired developments throughout its operations and investments. Energy, water and material efficiency are constantly in focus, and we contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals in various ways – also presented in this report. Metsä Board made it onto the CDP’s global Water A List as the only forest industry company, along with seven other companies from 607 applicants. The CDP also awarded Metsä Board leadership status in its Forest Programme and a position on the Climate A List. Related to that, science-based targets have been acknowledged as a tool for keeping the rise in temperatures to below 2°C compared to pre-industrial times. Since 2009, Metsä Group has reduced its fossil CO2 emissions by 35% per produced tonne and improved its energy efficiency by 6% with 86% of our production made with bioenergy. We are helping to build a path to a vital and sustainable circular and bioeconomy. We have therefore promoted a resource-wise bioeconomy and the sustainable use of wood, which is a renewable though limited resource. Metsä Fibre’s bioproduct mill in Äänekoski, Finland, has been identified as an example of a resource efficient bioeconomy ecosystem that produces alternatives to fossil-based living. Representing the biggest forest industry investment ever in Europe, worth EUR 1.2 billion, it has received wide interest, both nationally and in the EU. Of particular interest is how it will utilise materials and side streams efficiently, provide METSÄ GROUP SALES 4.7 BILLION PERSONNEL 9,300 METSÄLIITTO COOPERATIVE GROUP’S PARENT COMPANY OWNED BY 104,000 FINNISH FOREST OWNERS METSÄ FOREST METSÄ WOOD METSÄ FIBRE METSÄ BOARD METSÄ TISSUE WOOD SUPPLY AND PULP AND TISSUE AND FOREST SERVICES WOOD PRODUCTS SAWN TIMBER PAPERBOARD COOKING PAPERS SALES SALES SALES SALES SALES EUR 1.5 BILLION EUR 0.5 BILLION EUR 1.6 BILLION EUR 1.7 BILLION EUR 1.0 BILLION PERSONNEL PERSONNEL PERSONNEL PERSONNEL PERSONNEL 900 1,500 1,250 2,500 2,750 HOLDING HOLDING HOLDING HOLDING HOLDING METSÄLIITTO 100% METSÄLIITTO 100% METSÄLIITTO 50.2%, METSÄLIITTO 41.8%, METSÄLIITTO 100% METSÄ BOARD 24.9%, 61.5% OF VOTES ITOCHU 24.9% RENEWABLE ENERGY 22.3 TWh Sawmills reported in Metsä Fibre 4 Opening words renewable energy for its own needs and for society, as well as offering new business opportunities for smaller and industrial partners.

The debate on the sustainable limits of circular and bioeconomy has increased. We have invited environmental organisations, authorities and decision makers to join Metsä Group’s bioeconomy roundtables to discuss topics related to growth and sustainable use of natural resources, as well as biodiversity of forests. The meetings have been constructive and brought different parties together to share their views and learn from each other.

Today, we convert annually more than 100,000 m3 of organic side stream materials into organic bioproducts,” says Biolan’s owner Pekka Kariniemi. Biolan manufactures growing media and fertilisers, and also plastic products such as composters and dry toilets. Raw materials for its bioproducts come from many sources, including from Metsä Group’s pulp, board and sawmills. ”During our 20-year relationship, the cooperation with Metsä Group has expanded into R&D looking at new bioproducts manufactured from side streams”, says product manager Tuomas Pelto-Huikko. Metsä Group has an important role in providing homogenous raw materials year-round to Biolan. Pelto-Huikko cites as an example, Garden Black Soil, which uses bark as the main raw material. “Tree bark brings structure to the soil, as does mill sludge, which contains fibre.

In 2015, we introduced mounding, a soil preparation method that benefits the growth of seedlings. After successful testing, it came into wide-spread use in 2016. The advantages are obvious: planting is easier and growth is rapid with less brushwood and reduced costs. Nutrient runoff into waterways is also lowered and roots remain better intact. Mounding is expected to help control the vigorous spread of aspen, a problematic issue in Russian forestry. We cooperate with a research institute and authorities to develop Russian forestry practices, new forestry standards and introducing a more effective method in the precommercial thinning of young stands.

Each has its important role that supports the other. Protection areas are usually established by state among environmental organisations and forest nature management measures, such as leaving or other large forest owners. In Finland, almost owners. Metsä Group, along with other forest retention trees, has now been recognised in 90% of protected forests are owned by the state. industry companies and stakeholders have scientific research.

In 2016, the targets set for these factors were largely met, with some shortages in leaving retention trees in Finland and meeting the target share of certified wood in Latvia. Nature management is a basic skill for everybody working in the forest, and one of the targets is to keep employees up-to-date on this. In 2016, around 50 of Metsä Group’s forestry specialists took part in a Nature Management Card course and passed the exams that included questions on species, habitats, water conservation and landscape. www.metsagroup.com/CSR 34 Forest biodiversity 50,000 HOMES FOR BIRDS For 18 years, Metsä Group’s employees have organised nesting box events to give boxes to forest owners. Annually, around 5,000 nesting boxes are made out of aspen – purchased from Finnish forest owners – and Metsä Wood’s plywood. In 2016, the total number of nesting boxes reached 50,000. BIODIVERSITY INNOVATION – HIGH STUMPS Every hectare of forest that Metsä Group harvests in Finland could include two high biodiversity stumps. The voluntary practice has been offered to forest-owners since October 2016 in connection with wood sales to Metsä Group. As the high stumps gradually decay, they provide a home to different species, from fungi to birds. CONTROLLED BURNING WITH WWF FINLAND Since 2011, Metsä Group and WWF Finland have worked together to increase forest biodiversity, for example, with training on managing valuable habitats and, in 2016, accepting the Forest Challenge. We have also controllably burned forests in Northern Finland. In 2016, a field trip was made to a burned site to monitor the species development. In four years, various kinds of fungi and robustly-growing trees have found their way into the area demonstrating the effectiveness of controlled burning.

All the members of the cluster are contractors involved in the process industry, which enables joint audits. With joint audits, different aspects and requirements of health, safety, environment and quality are considered, and the audit report gives clear recommendations for developing service provider operations. Based on the HSEQ evaluation, Metsä Group can choose its contractors, verify their capabilities and mitigate risks as necessary. The evaluations also help to develop operations effectively and in a customer-oriented way. METSÄ GROUP’S PURCHASING CATEGORIES DIRECT MATERIALS (EXCL.

The facilities are modern and 100% self-sufficient in energy. In addition to producing Kerto LVL purely with bioenergy made from production side streams, the site provides wood-based bioheat for the local community. The bioheating plant is next to the mill to capture the full potential of the production. Other sidestreams, such as chips, are utilised at the Group’s pulp production plant. Kerto LVL has many larger scale benefits: it stores carbon from the atmosphere for the entire life cycle of a building where it is used.

The second bioboiler at Metsä Tissue Katrinefors mill in Sweden was introduced in 2015. The boiler provides electricity and heat to the mill and the surrounding community, and has decreased the mill’s oil use by 90%. The next bioboiler investment will take place at Metsä Tissue Nyboholm mill in Sweden with the purpose of making heat generation 100% biobased. The boiler will be introduced in autumn 2017, after which the mill will use oil only as a reserve fuel for heat generation. In Finland, the project to modernise the energy plant at Metsä Tissue Mänttä mill site is under way and will be finished in autumn 2017. This investment will rise the share of bioenergy for heat to 60% through decreasing the use of peat and replacing it with dried de-inking sludge and biomass. Dried de-inking sludge binds sulphur and hence reduces emissions to air. It also improves the quality of ash for further utilisation as a soil fertiliser and construction material.
