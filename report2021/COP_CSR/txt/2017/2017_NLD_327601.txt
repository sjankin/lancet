United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2016 7th April 2017 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ( AMG ) reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20170407 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and refers to this commitment in its annual report to Shareholders. Although always an integral part of AMG, our formal commitment in this area started in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct. 20170407 Communication on Progress 2 This was augmented in 2011 by the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: A review of this policy in 2016 determined it to still be adequate to articulate AMG’s commitments and it remains relevant to the current business climate. A network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of a Chief Compliance Officer and a core Compliance team monitors the commitments made in these publications. The core Compliance team meets typically twice per year to review Compliance and Ethical issues and is supported by an independent external consultant. This consultant has assisted in the development of policies, procedures and training programs and in responding to enquiries from stakeholder 20170407 Communication on Progress 3 groups with interests in human rights issues. There is an ongoing program of employee surveys to gauge the workforce’s perceptions about AMGs commitments to ethical business practices and human rights and reviewing AMGs programs against the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. To date the results of these surveys has been positive. In 2016 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG also contributes through philanthropic donations to support local community needs including to schools, colleges and hospitals with a focus on education in STEM subjecys. AMG sustains a network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers covering all sites and based in countries and at major sites where AMG companies are operating to locally identify any potential human rights abuses. In instances where this needs to be done independently and confidentially, a Whistle Blowing policy is in force allowing any employee to come forward and report issues. The Whistleblowing policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. The Chief Compliance Officer and their team carefully review any and all Whistleblower complaints. AMG also has a Supplier Conduct Charter, shown below, which is part of a process to ensure the standards relating to Human Rights which AMG holds itself to, are expanded to our suppliers as well. In particular, this policy states that: “AMG’s suppliers should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” This Supplier Conduct Charter was reviewed during 2016 and remains adequate under AMG’s current business climate. 20170407 Communication on Progress 4 LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative 20170407 Communication on Progress 5 (GRI) indicator LA4 (Percentage of Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our 2016 Annual Report we state: “The rights and freedoms for individual employees to join, or choose not to join, unions, as described in Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are fully respected by AMG. Across AMG, 1,924 employees (67%) were covered by such collective bargaining agreements. 72% of AMG Critical Materials are covered by these arrangements, while AMG Engineering, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, has 52% of its employees covered. Once again in 2016, AMG facilities had no strikes or lockouts.” Additionally, we utilize indicator HR5 (Operations identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be at significant risk, and actions taken to support these rights). In the 2016 Annual Report we state: “Protection of internationally proclaimed human rights is an area in which AMG is both highly aware and fully committed, and the Company strives to make sure it is not complicit in human rights abuses. Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk because of political or business factors. In 2016, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains restricted. Similarly, the Company has reviewed sites to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. No sites have been identified that pose a risk at this time. AMG also aims to ensure rights are protected in our supply chain through its Supplier Code of Conduct. Our policy on human rights is included in the Company Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and detailed in the Company’s human rights policy; all are available on the AMG website. Refresher human rights and ethics training was performed in 2016, and employees were given refresher training in ethical businesses practices, including 1,568 in human rights and anti-bribery based materials. Compliance officers at the major sites monitor and implement the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.” Further, with the development and implementation of our Supplier Conduct Charter we begin to hold our suppliers to the same standard stating: “AMG’s suppliers should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring. AMG has development projects which may expand the boundaries of the company into countries with more challenging environments and AMG recognizes this may bring an increased level of diligence. Again, our Supplier Conduct Charter adopted in 2014 introduces our commitment to this principal to our suppliers stating: “AMG’s suppliers should support the elimination of all 20170407 Communication on Progress 6 forms of forced and compulsory labor.”  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor, and expects our suppliers to do the same through the requirements of our Supplier Conduct Charter. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator HR6 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measure taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor”. In its 2016 annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 29 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor. In particular our Tantalum supply chain in Brazil is certified as Conflict Free by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. The size of AMG’s workforce has been relatively stable over the last year and at year-end 2016, AMG Critical Materials had 2,110 employees and AMG Engineering had 778. For the facilities covered by this report, the total AMG workforce was 2,888 (other facilities not yet covered in this section employ a further 165 people). Geographically, these were located in Asia (301), Europe (1,589), North America (545) and South America (453). In addition to direct employees, a further 238 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites in 2016. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age, but not ethnicity. The multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of AMG’s business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but it is not possible to define minority employees in such an environment. Of the total employees, 16% are female; 19% are under 30 years of age, 54% are between 30 and 50, and 27% are over 50. The Management Board is 100% male. The Supervisory Board is 89% male and 11% female. One Supervisory Board member is aged 30-50 while 8 are over 50. However, AMG is continuing to work to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 28 of our 2016 Annual Report we note: 20170407 Communication on Progress 7 “Gender Diversity: The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in terms of gender. Dutch regulations require the Company to pursue a policy of having at least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the management Board be held by men and at least 30% of the seats be held by women. The company will, with increased focus, continue to take this allocation of seats into account in connection with the following actions: (1) the appointment or nomination for the appointment of the new members for the Supervisory Board and the Management Board; and (2) drafting the criteria for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. At the end of 2016, AMG did not comply with the diversity criteria with regard to the composition of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for both the Management Board and the Supervisory and in particular, is pleased to announce the nomination of Mrs. S. Rich Folsom as member of the Supervisory Board at the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2017.” ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. Collection of this data is vital to help sites focus on improving efficiencies – including reducing energy use and concurrent greenhouse gas emissions, but also reducing solid and liquid wastes and reducing water consumption. AMG is transitioning to the latest GRI guidelines G4. These environmental impacts are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Additionally AMG reports its greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon disclosure Project (CDP). Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. Many of the technologies that AMG produces, which we refer to as “enabling technologies” contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation and buildings sectors. The contribution of those technologies is outlined in the CEO letter on page 10 and 11 of the 2016 Annual Report to Shareholders: “The other stakeholder who needs our special attention is the environment. I will hasten to say that other big stakeholders, such as suppliers and customers, need not be specially referred to here, as they are our daily work, and the basis of our corporate existence. The environment is different. When we initially conceived of AMG, we envisaged a new concept of material sciencebased, incremental and transformational innovations to create value. We focused on lightweighting of materials, from aluminum and titanium alloys to carbon-reinforced composites; on surface treatment and coating technologies to enable materials to endure higher operating temperatures; on recycling technologies turning metal-containing hazardous waste into a new raw material source (a new ‘mine’, so to speak); and on energy saving materials for buildings, 20170407 Communication on Progress 8 just to name a few. It is safe to say that our biggest ‘client’ has been the environment. We began our focus on CO2 reduction in our IPO documents. We believe that it is necessary to buy an insurance policy against atmospheric CO2 concentration, and our industrial CO2 reducing solutions can be seen as such an insurance. When you buy life insurance, you don’t prolong your life; you do something for the next generation. Our contributions to our biggest client, the environment, can be quantified using a fairly straightforward methodology. The selected AMG products and solutions which we regularly measure have enabled our customers to reduce CO2 emissions in 2016 by a total of 28.4 million tons compared to a CO2 saving of 23.7 million in 2015. Those are very significant numbers for our planet and for a company our size. This can be put into the context of our direct CO2 emissions of around 600,000 tons per annum as a result of our production activities in 29 sites around the world. The total CO2 savings of 28.4 million tons as a percentage of total assets of roughly $900 million gives a ratio of 3.2. This measure of our ‘greenness’ can be used to draw comparisons. To state the result simply, AMG is a leader in ‘greenness’, considerably ahead of our competitors. It is clearly visible that our work for the environment, as our most prominent client, has had a significant impact on the motivation of our employees and on the pride that we are contributing to future generations in a material way. This has been particularly important to me in my capacity as the founder of this company.” Additionally, the relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility The principles outlined by AMG’s CEO and founder referred to above eloquently describe AMG’s broader approach to the environment. In terms of detailed environmental management at local sites, twelve of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities now have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies, with several larger energy users, including the largest, holding ISO 50001 energy management certification. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies As described above, AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. In 2016 AMG continued its investment in the production of titanium aluminides used in the aerospace industry. Investments in the plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill, has resulted in significant capacity increase, with minimal 20170407 Communication on Progress 9 increase in carbon footprint. Further, this technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts such as turbo chargers and piston heads. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft and where AMG’s ceramic coating technologies further enable fuel efficiency savings. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct was reviewed and updated in 2016, adding safety as a core value, and it discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. AMG also has a stand-alone policy on Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption. This is available under the Corporate Governance section of the AMG-NV website. Training in these aspects is carried out on an ongoing basis. AMG further promotes these values throughout the Company with multi lingual posters (updated in 2016) prominently displayed at operational sites to raise awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and various ethically based programs. 20170407 Communication on Progress 10 20170407 Communication on Progress 11 ATTACHMENT 1 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM THE 2016 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20170407 Communication on Progress 12 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 38 AMG GLOBAL CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY Sustainable Development SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GLOBAL CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY AMG 39 This section provides our ninth They include mining and manufacturing operations and sales and administrative offices in 13 countries annual sustainability report, across 4 continents.

ENERGY CONSUMPTION 2,334 GRI INDICATORS EN 3 AND EN 4 Energy remains a major area of focus for AMG for both environmental and economic reasons. In particular, hightemperature metallurgical processes and mining operations 824 utilized in AMG Critical Materials are energy intensive. The two most significant energy carriers are electricity and 208 natural gas, although other fuels and energy sources are 17 captured in the data discussed here.3 2014 The reported energy usage for AMG Critical Materials was DIRECT INDIRECT marginally lower in 2016 compared to 2015, decreasing from 3,193 terajoules (TJ) in 2015 to 3,130 TJ in 2016. Direct energy usage was 765 TJ and indirect was 2,365 TJ. The energy used by low-energy heat treatment processes utilized by AMG Engineering remains low in comparison. 2,410 The segment used 192 TJ in 2016, 4.5% lower than in 2015 (199 TJ). Indirect energy, in the form of electricity, accounted for 186 TJ, while direct energy use, primarily through natural gas, totaled 6 TJ. Across AMG, the split between renewable and non-renewable 783 indirect energy sources is difficult to determine since utilities do not generally publish this information (with some 187 13 exceptions; e.g. CEMIG in Brazil now produces this data). 2015 However, AMG does generate its own renewable energy. In 2016, AMG’s hydroelectric generating facility near São João DIRECT INDIRECT del Rei, Brazil generated 55,530 gigajoules (15,425 MWh). This supplied AMG’s local requirements at its São João del Rei, Brazil plant. Additionally, AMG Vanadium’s solar power system generated 911 gigajoules (253 MWh) in 2016. 2,365 WATER CONSUMPTION GRI INDICATOR EN 8 Water is essential to many manufacturing processes and is used by AMG primarily for non-contact, evaporative or single-pass cooling purposes, although a small number of AMG facilities 765 do use wet chemical processes for the production of metal oxides and other chemicals. In addition, mining operations can 186 6 utilize water from mine dewatering or for ore processing. Water utilized for cooling, processing and sanitation is reported by AMG 2016 facilities. Reported water use for AMG Critical Materials was DIRECT INDIRECT lower in 2016 at 4,220,000 cubic meters (a 10% decrease). AMG Engineering’s water consumption was 100,800 cubic meters during 2016, also similar to that of 2015 (99,600 cubic meters). AMG Engineering AMG Critical Materials has its largest water use at the mine AMG Critical Materials sites in Brazil, Germany and Sri Lanka, and the silicon metal production plant in Germany. Of these, the mine in Nazareno, 3 Indirect energy consumption does not include the energy consumed by electricity producers to generate the electricity or transmission losses. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 44 AMG GLOBAL CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY Brazil remains the largest user with 2,495,000 cubic meters in 2016, a 15% decrease 2015, and a result of process water GHG EMISSIONS (‘000 MT) recycling and improved measurement. Full data are provided in the table on page 47. 413 BIODIVERSITY GRI INDICATOR EN 11 Of the 29 locations reporting for 2016, there were three reported land areas on or adjacent to AMG’s properties which had 177 high biodiversity value, sensitive habitats or were protected. These areas are: native forest in São João del Rei, Brazil; river 39 frontage and setback areas in Nazareno, Brazil; and wetlands in 0 Ohio, United States. AMG remains very aware of the need to be 2014 responsible stewards of these important areas. DIRECT INDIRECT CLIMATE CHANGE GRI INDICATOR EN 16 AMG facilities utilize processes that are associated with both direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and both 352 types are reported here. Electricity used for the generation of heat for metallurgical processing has been, and remains, the most significant source of GHG emissions for AMG. This 183 electricity use gives rise to indirect GHG emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which are dependent on the nature of its generation. Whenever possible, emissions have been calculated using up-to-date emission factors available from the 34 0 electricity supplier, the local environmental agency, or the GHG protocol. Indirect emissions are defined as those emissions 2015 generated by sources outside of AMG’s control, but where AMG DIRECT INDIRECT ultimately uses the energy. Direct GHG emissions result primarily from the combustion of carbon-containing materials often as part of the metallurgical process, such as using coke as a reductant, but also for the generation of heat, such as burning natural gas in a boiler. 363 Other GHGs occurring from processes other than combustion, such as hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, are minimal for the AMG business units, but are included if relevant. 182 AMG Critical Materials’ GHG emissions were marginally higher in 2016 at 546,000 mt of CO2e (2015, 535,000 mt). 67% of these emissions are attributed to indirect sources (electricity) 33 0 while 33% are attributed to direct sources. Emissions remain dominated by the silicon metal production activities which 2016 account for 390,000 mt of CO2e (approximately 6.62 kg CO2e DIRECT INDIRECT per kg silicon metal produced). This activity also dominates AMG’s overall GHG emissions, accounting for 67% of total group emissions. Further, changes in supply mix, including reduction of nuclear and variations in renewable energy in Germany, resulted in lower emission factors for this electricity and accounted for some of this increase. These factors, outside of AMG’s control, AMG Engineering outweighed additional reductions achieved elsewhere. AMG Critical Materials AMG Engineering GHG emissions in 2016 were 33,000 mt, a decrease from 33,000 mt in 2015. 99% of these emissions are indirect and associated with electricity usage.
