In 2001 the company defined “7 go Green” as the strategy to becoming environmentally friendly and sustainable in every business endeavor, leading to the sustainable and efficient usage of natural resources, minimized environmental impact and the implementation of environmental development programs. The “7 go Green” strategy is driven by CP ALL’s “Green Philosophy” which is at the heart of the company’s environmental efforts. Programs initiatives are implemented at 7-Eleven stores nationwide. Through continuous operation and communication, the company strives to maintain a good relationship with local communities in four areas as shown below. Figure 1 “7 go green” strategy 7.3.1 Green Stores Many projects have been implemented in order for 7-Eleven to become an environmental friendly network of stores. 7.3.1.1 Energy-efficient prototype store CP ALL enjoys continuous yearly growth, leading to an inevitable increase in energy consumption. Therefore an energy-efficient prototype store was designed according to the Thai’s Rating of Energy and Environmental Sustainability (TREES) standards which are guidelines for constructing a “green” building. The 7-Eleven at Tara Square serves as the prototype for energy-efficient stores in seven areas. 1. Encouraging employees to use public transport and planting one tree per 100 square meters of open space. 2. Installing water-conserving toilets in public and staff restrooms to minimize impact on natural water resources. 3. Installing energy-efficient materials and equipment. • Insulation Pair Glass double glazing window comprises two panes of glass, separated by a cavity which is filled with inert gas – is 28% better in preventing heat transfer than normal glass windows. • Aerated concrete walls prevent heat transfer and reduce the use of electricity by 30%. • Insulation ceiling controls in-store temperature and reduces the use of electricity by 25%. • Installing LED bulbs reduces the use of electricity by 30%. • Poly crystalline solar cell panels can generate 13,750 Kwh of electricity per year. • Solar heaters in water heating units reduce the use of 1,095 Kwh of electricity per year. • Inverter type air conditioning system reduces the use of electricity by 30%. • Natural light from skylight is equivalent to 20 fluorescent bulbs. 4. Construction waste management reduces the amount of construction waste which has h a direct impact to the environment. For example, waste sorting at the construction site and the store, and selling recyclables to recycling facilities. 5. Promoting a better in-store environment, such as ventilation and lighting systems for a better atmosphere mosphere for customers and employees. 6. Pollution prevention measures within the 7-Eleven construction onstruction site. From the start towards the completion of the store construction, barriers are set up to reduce dust and noise pollution to the surrounding community. 7. Energy and environmentally-related environmentally innovations for a better quality of life such as Eco Open Space which can serve as recreational areas. 7.3.1.2 LED bulbss CP ALL is committed to reducing energy consumption and has established concrete measuresres to fulfil its promise. Newly constructed and renovated 7-Eleven 7 Eleven stores nationwide are using energysaving LED bulbs instead of normal light bulbs. In 2016, 7-Eleven 7 replaces in-store bulbs with LED bulbss in three areas. 1. Replacing cold storage unit un bulbs with LED bulbs reduces the use of electricity by 2.88 kWh per branch per month or 9.5 Baht per branch per month. Figure 2 Cold storage units LED bulb installation 2. Replacing bulbs on cold storage unit doors with LED bulbs, s, reduces the t use of electricity by 264.96 kWh per branch per month or 863 Baht per branch per month (7.63 7.63 million units). Figure 3 Cold storage unit doors LED bulb installation 3. Replacing electronic ballasts with LED ballasts, reduces the use of electricity by 831.6 kWh per branch per month or 2,844.28 Baht per branch per month (21.82 million units). Figure 4 LED ballasts As of todayay 5,317 7-Eleven Eleven branches have undergone these replacements, reducing energy consumption by 29.52 kWh per year 7.3.1.3 Centralized compressor for open showcase s units Initially, open open showcase units in the stores use separate digital scroll s compressors, which are connected to multiple condensing units. By installing a centralized digital scroll scrol compressor system, which is a network of compressors connected connect to a single condensing unit, the electricity used can be reduced significantly. Figure 5 Centralized compressor for open showcase units 7.3.1.4 Inverter air conditioning system As a part of CP ALL’s energy saving efforts, the company plans to replace existing air conditioners in 7-Eleven stores with inverter air conditioners, reducing energy consumption and reducing the use of greenhouse gases such as CFC. Table 1 Decrease in energy consumption by project, 2016 Project (kWh) Decrease in energy Percentage decrease Number of completed consumption(kWh) stores LED bulbs 29,524,063.00 59 5,317 Centralized compressor for open 2,747,266.92 8 1,057 showcase units Inverter air conditioning 14,595,877.64 34 1,537 system 7.3.1.5 Solar Rooftop From the successful installation of the solar rooftop at the energy-saving prototype store at 7-Eleven Tara Square, the company continued to install solar rooftops at five more locations namely Tara Pattanakarn, Khlong Lam Chiak 13, Nawamin 111, Lad Pla Kao 63, and Seri Thai 41 Table 2 Solar cell energy output, 20156 Branch Solar rooftop installation Store electricity Percentage of solar output Capacity Actual output requirement compared to store electricity (kKp) (kWh / month) (kWh / month) requirement Tara Square 10.00 1,200.00 29,368.50 4.09 Tara Pattanakarn 20.00 2,100.00 15,152.00 13.86 Table 3 Solar cell energy output, 2016 Branch Solar rooftop installation Store electricity Percentage of solar output Capacity Actual output requirement compared to store electricity (kKp) (kWh / month) (kWh / month) requirement Khlong Lam Chiak 10.20 1,224.00 17,337.75 7.06 Nawamin 111 20.40 2,448.00 15,010.50 16.31 Lad Pla Kao 63 23.99 2,878.20 21,198.92 13.58 Seri Thai 41 20.40 2,448.00 13,588.00 18.02 Table 4 CP ALL’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission from 2012-2016 Year Branches (not including sub Energy consumption (units) Scope 2 greenhouse gas emission areas) (KgCO2eq) 2012 6,304 993,335,629.69 605,239,399.18 2013 6,841 1,061,967,548.97 647,056,827.59 2014 7,486 1,174,473,255.79 715,606,554.75 2015 8,165 1,273,316,288.51 775,831,614.59 2016 8,850 1,462,370,953 886,016,876.66 7.3.1.6 Microbial powder in grease traps By installing grease traps, 7-Eleven minimizes the amount of harmful substances entering the wastewater disposal system. However, the grease removal process causes discomfort to employees, due to the hazardous nature of the task. Through adding microbial powder to the grease trap by a specially-designed automatic fermentation container and dispenser, the frequency of emptying grease traps can be reduced from eight times per month to once every two months, significantly increasing employee’s health and welfare. 7.3.2 Green Logistics CP ALL realizes the importance of an environmentally friendly logistics management and has implemented various projects and prototypes in selected distribution centers. 7.3.2.1 Heat exchange water boiler In order to reduce energy consumption, the company has successfully put in place a heat exchange system which transfers heat from refrigerant to water. The water heated by the system can be used to effectively clean product crates, saving 824,116 kWh of electricity, 3.2 million baht and 412 tons of carbon emission per year. This project is further explored and developed into a prototype water recycling system at Suvarnabhumi Distribution Center (CDC). Waste water is treated by passing through a 0.05 micron ultra filter and an ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, eliminating impurities and microorganisms. The treated water has the same purity as tap water and can be reused, saving 8 cubic meters of water per day. 7.3.2.2 Energy-saving bulbs In addition to 7-Eleven stores, product distribution centers are also undergoing bulbs replacement. 1. Replacing high pressure sodium bulbs with T8 and T5 fluorescent bulbs, saving 322,917 kWh of electricity per month, which translates to 15.5 million baht and 1,938 tons of carbon emission per year. 2. In place of fluorescent bulbs, the Chonburi Distribution Center (RDC) has adopted Smart LEDs which are more responsive in brightness control, saving 318,000 kWh (85%) per year, which translates to 1.2 million baht and 159 tons of carbon emission per year. 7.3.2.3 Reducing pollution from product delivery The company has a high regard for stakeholder health and wellbeing which can be affected by vehicle exhaust emissions. A prototype project has been developed at Mahachai Distribution Center (DC) and its network of stores to reduce emissions. The efforts include turning off ignition while loading and unloading, and conducting a comprehensive vehicle emissions testing, resulting in the center receiving zero complaints on emission and pollution. 7.3.3 Green Packaging 7.3.3.1 Environmentally Friendly Packaging In terms of packaging, CP ALL is committed to moving towards using environmentally friendly packaging. The effort comprises of a short-term, mid-term and long-term plan. Short-term plan 1. Reduce: reducing or cancelling the use of packaging that is harmful to human health and the environment. 2. Reuse: encouraging the reuse of packaging materials such as reusable ice boxes for frozen products instead of plastic bags. 3. Recycle: converting waste materials into new materials and objects, especially plastic which are not biodegradable. Medium-term plan 4. Biodegradable: using biodegradable materials in packaging, such as using biodegradable plastic, to minimize environmental impact Long-term plan 5. Renewable Resources: researching and exploring the possibility of bioplastics from renewable sources, which can replace traditional plastics from petroleum.

CP ALL has been proactive in delivering consumer awareness campaigns and urging consumers to “Reconsider plastic bags” and “Say no to plastic bags”. The main target audiences of the campaigns are children and youths who can still be persuaded to change their behaviours, and are able to shape the society in the future. The project has been running since 2012 and now in its fifth phase.
