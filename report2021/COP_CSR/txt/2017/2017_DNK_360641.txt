UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2016 STATEMENT OF CONTINUED SUPPORT In the following, we present our annual Communication on Progress, where we describe our actions to integrate the United Nations Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. Since our last state of affairs, Baxx Promotion have increased the focus and effort on our corporate social responsibility as well as environmental impact. Our overall politics, goals and processes to advance within these fields have been defined and are now more firmly rooted in our business procedures. Through our ISO management systems we have been able to further implement both environmental and quality policies, which have become key guidance points for us. In the coming year we will continue the progress within these two fields, to better achieve our overall goal of practicing responsible sourcing. In order to move forward with Baxx Promotion’s CSR and further develop our environmental strategy, this year we have launched a joint project with a local University. Through this project, we can define a more specific strategy and construct a road map for our efforts in these fields. We are pleased to reaffirm Baxx Promotion’s continued support to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-corruption. Yours sincerely, Michael Eriksen CEO, Baxx Promotion 2 VISION AND FOCUS AREAS The CSR and environmental strategy of Baxx Promotion is founded on the 10 FUTURE ROAD MAP principles of the UN’s Global Compact, relating to human rights, labour rights, respect for the environment and anti corruption.
