ING Group Communication on Progress 2016 CEO statement It is our role as a financial institution to support and promote economic, social and environmental progress, leading to a better quality of life for people in society while generating adequate returns for shareholders. We work on this every day together with our employees, customers and partners. Together, we have the scale, ability and drive to make a difference. ING became a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact in 2006, and I am pleased to reaffirm ING Group’s support of the Global Compact's 10 principles governing the private sector's responsibilities in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment & Anti-Corruption. There are many serious challenges that we as global citizens face. From the dangers of climate change to equal opportunities and human rights. We understand the responsibility that the private sector has to drive positive and sustainable change, and therefore remain fully committed to the Global Compact.
