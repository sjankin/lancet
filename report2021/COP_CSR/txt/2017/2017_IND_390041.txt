Considering transport, is one of the most polluting activities the increase in numbers of personal and commercial in the economy. Burning of fossil fuels by vehicle vehicles on roads, various measures can be taken contributes to air pollution by increasing the amount to control the number of vehicles on roads, such as of suspended particulate matter and hazardous gases shifting to public transport or use of vehicles with in the atmosphere. The increased travel demand has more passenger carrying capacity, etc. resulted in rapid growth in number of motor vehicles The following pros and cons were observed: in the cities and this leads to congestion of roads and mismanagement of traffic. Consequently, the average Pros: Environment friendly, Cost effective and lesser travel time increases by at least 12-15 minutes for a vehicles on the road, hence less congestion. journey of about 15 km and in turn, leads to more fuel Cons: Vendor dissatisfaction due to more consumption.

That means fuel used in less fuel emission and less carbon footprints. 9 Case Study #2: Ergonomics, and Occupational Health and Safety Training Background: In line with the organization’s Occupational Health and Safety Policy, there was a need a need to train employees in ergonomics so ensure right postures and avoid posture related injuries common in the IT industry. This would ensure a risk-free workplace where everyone would be more productive. Scope: To train the employees on various aspects of Workplace Ergonomics and Occupational Health & Safety through e-modules. Implementation: Two learning modules on “Ergonomics” and “Occupational Health & Safety” were launched online through our intranet portal. Every employee had to peruse the training material provided and take the test online. These modules were easy to understand, in comprehensible English supported by audiovisual representation. Impact: In FY16, 36,348 employees took the test online on Occupational Health & Safety Module and also 39,890 employees took the test online on Ergonomics Module, totaling up to 2, 28,714 man hours of training. This was possible due to rigorous follow up methodology and control mechanisms put in place. Best Practices across Global Development Centers (GDCs) Scope – To evaluate the energy utilization trend of overall business utilities across Pan India locations and develop a solution which helps in optimize the utilization with enhanced efficiency and eco benefits. The special project team put in efforts to help the organization not only increase operational efficiency but also provided guidance in the organization’s commitment to environment conservation.

Cattle grazing being the only source of income for her impoverished family, Muniamma was forced to drop out of her village school during Class 7. Upgradation from Telugu (the only medium available) to Tamil medium further demanded the family to spend extra money for private schooling. Left with no option, Muniamma joined her parents in rearing cattle. When HCL Foundation started a Gurukul in her village, jointly with the Rural Development Council, new doors opened for Muniamma. Her zeal for education was identified by the RDC staff member who helped enrol her in the Gurukul. She is happily perusing class 8 in Tamil Medium, again, a dream in the past.
