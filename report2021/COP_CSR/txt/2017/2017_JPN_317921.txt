Net sales in the aftermarket applications were 113.6 billion yen, up 1.2 billion yen (1.1%) over the previous fiscal year. The impact from China's economic slowdown this fiscal year has been felt in Japan and other regions. A similar slowdown in the emerging economies of South America effected, but owing to MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) engineering services and expanded sales of automotive parts, sales outside of China exceeded the previous fiscal year's numbers. Operating income was 17.7 billion yen effecte by exchange-rates, which was 1.5 billion yen (8.0%) less than the previous fiscal year. Overview of the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2017 In Japan, though business is likely to be impacted by the continuing economic slump, we will try to increase our market share amongst target customers by strengthening our engineering services. In Americas, we will seek out MRO projects by increasing cooperation with big name distributors, and add more Fukumatsu Kometani distributors to our network in order to expand sales channels for our auto parts. Executive Director In Europe and Asia, we will also hunt for MRO projects and expand sales channels for our auto parts, but we expect customer demand is slowdown in some emerging countries in Europe. In China, the current economic slowdown is expected to continue, but we will build up our sales network by expanding our sales reach to parts of the country where we do not have a presence. Comments of Director in Charge In the aftermarket business, we are strengthening 4 pillar areas: 1. product supply force by shortening lead-time; 2. product appeal by expanding our ULTAGE series of world highest class quality bearings; 3. expanding global inventories for industrial machinery aftermarket and strengthening product lineup by developing auto parts for automotive aftermarket; 4. strengthening engineering services via technical workshops and technical service units. Going forward, we will be working to strengthen our brand image by improving packaging and taking action against imitation products, to achieve world’s No.1 customer satisfaction level. 25 PRODUCTS * Photos are cross-sectional models of products.

In Japan, NTN saw a decrease in sales for construction and mining machinery, and similarly for related gearbox bearings. In Americas, product sales for wind turbines grew, but fell for construction and mining machinery applications. In Europe and China, sales for wind turbines were strong. Operating income was 5.6 billion yen. But, despite cost cutting efforts and favorable exchange rates, income was down 600 million yen (10.3%) from the previous fiscal year largely because of the decline amount of sales. Overview of the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2017 The outlook in Japan is for a further decrease in product sales for construction and mining machinery, and a projected slump in demand for steel mill equipment, machine tools and other industrial machinery. In Americas, we foresee a further decline in sales for construction and mining machinery similar to the current trend in Japanese market, but we expect an increase in sales of Kazuki Kawashima products for wind turbines. On the other hand, in Europe we expected Director increases in product sales for aircraft, gearbox, and general machinery. In Asia and other areas, sales for construction machinery and machine tool applications will decrease in Korea, we expect a momentary decline in sales for wind turbines in China as a backlash to the increased demand seen last year. Comments of Director in Charge In the industrial machinery business, we are stepping up our technological development, production capacity and sales efforts in the wind turbine, aircraft, rolling stock and robot markets, which we view as growth areas. Moreover, we are directing development not only at bearings but also CMS*, linear modules, and modular products that combine bearings and sensors. In applications for construction machinery, agricultural machinery, machine tools and other forte areas of industry machinery applications, we are set on providing service support and solutions alongside a plethora of highly reliable products as part of our commitment to industrial advancement. 29 * CMS: Condition Monitoring System PRODUCTS * Photos are cross-sectional models of products.

(renamed) 31 NTN ACTION TODAY 01 Integrated production of industrial machinery bearings in the Noto area NTN established NTN HOUDATSU SHIMIZU Corp., NTN SHIKA Corp. and NTN NOTO Corp. in the Noto area of Japan after opening NTN HAKUI Corp. in 2007 as a second production base for making industrial machinery bearings, its lone predecessor being located in Kuwana, Mie Prefecture. Currently in the Noto area, NTN is producing large bearings for wind turbines and a variety of bearings for the industrial machinery aftermarket. The process typically involves forging, machining, heat treatment, grinding and assembly in that order. The heat treatment part is key to determining the bearing’s durability, but since there were no heat treatment systems in the Noto area, products had to be shipped to the production base in Mie Large bearing made in the Noto area Prefecture for heat treatment, which consumed much time after calculating transport in. However, a heat treatment plant is being built on the grounds of NTN NOTO Corp., which will give the Noto area its own integrated production system that will speed up production and stabilize supply. The new heat treatment plant will serve as a model for additions at NTN’s overseas production sites and will lead global standardization of Monozukuri. Large bearing during the manufacturing process 02 Robot-related business In our robot-related business, we are applying our Group’s unique technology as seeds for developing products which match those seeds to new needs and expand these products on a global scale. Better and improved “Parallel Link High Speed Angle Control Equipment’ The positioning device that is used in production equipment must swiftly and accurately position the unit over a wide range of moving angle, with only a small amount of space to work with. NTN seeks to improve that performance with its “Parallel Link High Speed Angle Control Equipment.” An improved model has been downsized from conventional product by about 10% in the overall height. Moreover, positioning is 10% faster and more precise, so both tact time and down time are shorter, Parallel Link High Speed Angle Control which contribute to improve productivity for the customer. Equipment Microscopic Coating Applicator with Microgeometry Measuring Function The need for quality control by measuring the shape of all applied adhesive or the coating volume became apparent following developments in the mounting field calling for even smaller electronic components. Until now separate devices were required for application and measurement. Under this situation, NTN has started proposing the “Microscopic Coating Applicator with Microgeometry Measuring Function” that adds the “3D Microgeometry measuring” function, which measures 3D coated shapes, to the “Desktop Type High-speed Microscopic Coating Applicator” that is capable of high-accuracy Microscopic Coating Applicator with Microgeometry Measuring Function coating of microscopic droplets of a few pl (picoliter)* at a high speed of 0.1 seconds. The developed product is capable of coating at a high speed of 0.7 seconds as well as conducting measuring, which contributes to greater production efficiency. * pl (picoliter): 1 trillionth of a liter 32 Review of Operations Automotive Applications Our business for automotive applications begins with us proposing new technologies and products, such as hub bearings, driveshafts and needle roller bearings, to automotive manufacturers and supporting industries around the world.

In Japan, compact vehicle sales were stymied by a tax hike, but NTN made up the difference via strong demand for vehicle exports to North America. Though demand in North America was strong, overall sales to the Americas were slightly down because of delays in the mass-production launch of some new vehicles and market slumps in South America. In Europe and China, customer demand grew. After calculating in a decrease in variable costs and the effects of exchange rates, operating income was 24.4 billion yen, a 6.1 billion yen (33.2%) increase from the previous year. Operating margin also improved 4.9%. Overview of the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2017 New vehicle sales in Japan are expected to recover, as our automotive customers will be introducing new vehicle models. In Americas, sales of large vehicles like SUVs and pickup trucks should remain strong because of the weaker price of crude oil. This is also expected to benefit sales by NTN Hideaki Miyazawa MANUFACTURING DE MEXICO, S.A.DE C.V., which commenced massManaging Director production in December 2015. In Europe, the markets in Russia and other Eastern European countries will likely decline, but the overall tone is for strong sales to continue across the continent. In Asia, demand in China is projected to continue expanding customer demand, and sales of driveshafts and motorcycles parts are expected to increase in India and ASEAN.

Japan has committed to reducing its CO2 emissions with the specific goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 26.0% below fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030. In the future, it is likely that governmental authorities, customers, institutional investors and other stakeholders will also require that we further reduce its CO2 emissions. Japan’s commitment in the draft of the Paris Agreement was a 6.3% increase relative to fiscal 2013 levels by fiscal 2030 as the assumption for energy consumption by the industrial division. In light of this situation, we have established a mediumand long-term CO2 emissions targets in Japan with the goal of limiting our energy consumption in fiscal 2025 to a mere 4.4% increase above fiscal 2013 levels. In addition, we have adopted a new energy-efficient budget framework in order to aggressively and effectively implement energy efficiencies in order to achieve this mediumand long-term target. We intend to incorporate our mediumand long-term CO2 emissions targets in Japan into our annual environmental targets in addition to applying our energy-efficient budget framework. Moreover, we intend to continue promoting a variety of such initiatives.

I think that maintaining continuity of membership is to identify the company’s natural energy business and important too, but I think that it can be gradually expanded. Responding to the Third-Party Opinion I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Mr. Mizuguchi for once again submitting his invaluable opinions following his previous effort last year. We endeavored to reflect the third party opinions and the comments we received at the stakeholder dialog last year. And “NTN Report 2016” represents the various initiatives we are implementing, including prevention of global warming, our entry into the natural energy business, promoting CSR across the supply chain, strengthening of our global network, promoting diversity, and our initiative involving sustainable social contribution. At the same time, we are visualizing the relationship between NTN’s value creation, operations and Hiroshi Nakano CSR initiatives. We give serious consideration to the invaluable opinions we received, including those Director and Corporate addressing our response to “climate change” and “protection of human rights in the supply chain,” and General Manager, we refer to these opinions as sources of informative advice on our future development. We intend to meet CSR Headquarters our responsibilities as a manufacturing company in order to contribute further to international society. 76 Financial Review Summary for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 Net sales: 717.0 billion yen, an increase of 15.1 billion yen (2.2%) year-on-year Operating income: 47.8 billion yen (Operating margin 6.7%) Interest-bearing debt: 325.2 billion yen, a decrease of 33.9 billion yen from the previous fiscal year end Capital expenditures: 36.3 billion yen, an increase of 5.0 billion yen (16.1%) year-on-year Dividends: 10 yen (5 yen at 2nd quarter end, 5 yen at fiscal year end) Net Sales and Incomes while sales of wind turbines and other products increased, Sales Performance construction machinery and other applications decreased, Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 resulting in an overall decrease.
