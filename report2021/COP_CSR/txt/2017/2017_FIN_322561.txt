HiVision™ is a next generation solution and a practical example of our position as the forerunner in digitalisation. The system was introduced in April and opened for sales in October. It received the KWF-Vision Award (“Oscars of the forestry industry”), with the jury stating: ‘The safety and comfort are remarkable and complemented by a precise control system and good visibility.’ CASE Hudiksvall Test and Innovation Centre Hiab’s Test and Innovation Centre in Hudiksvall, Sweden was completed in June. The centre increases Hiab’s ability to test, validate and verify materials, components and products. It also adds to our connectivity and digitalisation competence and drives innovative solutions in this area. The centre has accelerated product development by starting the process with desktop environment simulations, followed by a rigorously controlled engineering process and field testing. The time-to-market has already been cut by one third for some products. Collaboration with external partners is also a success factor. CASE Health and safety – key priority in Dundalk Hiab’s truck mounted forklifts multi-assembly unit in Dundalk, Ireland took health and safety (H&S) to new levels by making H&S targets tangible and personal to each employee. Instead of merely hanging up signs announcing ‘Safety is everyone’s responsibility’, it was ensured that everyone had specific information about what they personally can do to make the workplace safer. Now, every Dundalk employee has a personal H&S target, every operation has an H&S stamp and addresses a clear H&S concern. When strategy is discussed with employees, it is always divided into two focus areas: business and H&S.

We utilise a vessel’s cargo mix data, operating profiles, and route-specific data to find the best fit for the vessels’ cargo proles and earning opportunities. A cargo boost’s scope varies from calculations and loading manual updates to an updated cargo system design and hardware and related trainings. In 2016, we delivered a cargo system upgrade for eight container ships, helping them adapt to changing markets with additional payload capacity and operational flexibility. CASE Fibre-rope retrofit expands operational window We introduced a fibre-rope retrofit option, with which a crane’s original steel wire rope can be replaced with a synthetic fibre rope. It weighs virtually nothing in water, so a crane’s lifting capacity is not limited by water depth. With a fibre rope, smaller cranes and vessels can be used for more assignments, allowing owners to bid their vessels on a wider range of contracts. The retrofit’s modular design allows factory system testing and rapid installation. Fibre rope can be spliced to replace damaged sections or increase length. It also does not require lubrication, which eliminates a pollution source. CASE ‘Hack the sea’ for safety, efficiency and the environment In November 2016, we organised an open innovation hackathon ‘Hack the Sea’ in Germany about opportunities to reduce maritime industry waste. In the hackathon, ten teams worked with safety on vessels, fleet efficiency and other vessel sustainability themes. Hackathon participants (individuals, start-ups, SMEs and university teams) created several concepts that have potential to become part of our development and technology roadmaps. The winner was Team Cybercom with a concept for rapid application development for both customers and MacGregor.

YEAR YEAR 2016 COMPANY BUSINESS AREAS SUSTAINABILITY SUSTAINABILITY 47 UNGC GRI CONTENT REFERENCE AND OMISSIONS principle G4-12 THE ORGANISATION’S SUPPLY CHAIN p. 43 Building a sustainable business: Policies and management approach Cargotec appreciates long-term and localised suppliers throughout each business area. We choose our suppliers with care and on the basis of objective factors such as quality, reliability, delivery and price. Compliance with laws and regulations as well as respect for international human rights are required of each supplier. In Kalmar, the total number of direct suppliers was around 1,200 at the end of 2016. Kalmar spend was broken down geographically as follows: 33 percent of purchases were from the Americas, 21 percent from Scandinavia, 19 percent from APAC, 12 percent from Eastern Europe and 15 percent from Western Europe. The share of Eastern European and Chinese partners will continue to increase. The top 50 suppliers represented 60 percent of the spend, and the top 100 suppliers represented 75 percent of the spend. Kalmar runs enhanced Supplier Relationship Management programmes with a few selected strategic partners to generate competitive advantages, business benefits and customer values for both Kalmar and the suppliers. Hiab had a total of just over 800 direct suppliers at the end of 2016, of which 30–35 were preferred suppliers. Focusing on these preferred suppliers enables continuous development of the supply chain management. Hiab also runs extended Supplier Relationship Management programmes together with a few selected suppliers. In 2016, the top 50 suppliers covered 65 percent and the top 100 suppliers 80 percent of the supply volume. The major share of Hiab suppliers was from Europe (83%), while the share of Eastern Europe suppliers is increasing due to the strong focus on the factory in Stargard, Poland. The rest of the suppliers were from America (13%) and Asia (4%). MacGregor has a history of more than 20 years of collaboration with particular suppliers. Due to the uncertain market situation and an increasing focus on preferred suppliers, the number of direct suppliers decreased from 900 at the end of 2015 to close to 700 at the end of 2016. The top 50 suppliers covered 67 percent and the top 100 suppliers 80 percent of the supply volume. Approximately 55 percent of the supplier volume was from Asia and 45 percent from EMEA.

Accounting principles for the consolidated financial statements G4-18 DEFINING THE REPORT CONTENT AND ASPECT BOUNDARIES p. 44–45 Sustainability accounting principles and reporting boundary Cargotec aims to report on sustainability issues in a manner that meets the needs of our customers, investors and other stakeholders. This review describes our work and sustainability focus areas, also taking into consideration the communication needs towards external stakeholders. Our strategy defines our sustainability approach and reporting principles. The reported material indicators are based on our internal KPIs, measurements, processes and policy statements. To ensure that the review is comparable with other companies and fulfils requests by external stakeholders, our current sustainability reporting framework has been influenced by peer and competitor benchmarking, as well as day-to-day work that involves analysing investor and customer requests. Our sustainability reporting has also been influenced by requests arising from Cargotec’s commitment to the UN Global Compact and other key international commitments and organisations relating to sustainability. From 2010 onwards, Cargotec’s sustainability reporting content has been approved by senior executive management representatives or the Executive Board. The reporting content of this 2016 review has been assessed by executive management representatives to evaluate its alignment with our strategy and sustainability targets, and to ensure that we report matters that are both internal priorities and of interest to our stakeholders. Although no major requirements were received from external stakeholders regarding the reporting content, we made some adjustments to further prioritise the material issues and ease comparisons in later reporting.

G4-26 APPROACH TO STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGEMENT Examples of Cargotec’s stakeholder interaction Customers Our business areas gather customer feedback regurlarly and engage in active dialogue with customers through direct meetings, marketing, extranet, newsletters and social media, for example. See results of customers satisfaction surveys on business area sections from pages 26, 30 and 34. Personnel Our Human Resources Information System ZONE and our intranet’s People Portal section serve as a platform for distributing people processes. We periodically conduct structured surveys with our employees, such as our employee satisfaction survey Compass, and arrange co-operational group meetings, target and performance discussions as well as personnel info and team meetings. See results of Compass 2016 on page 21. Investors Cargotec provides rapid and easy access to the latest company information online to support fair valuation of the company share. We also regularly arrange meetings with investors. In 2016, Cargotec’s Investor Relations arranged a site visit to Kalmar Technology and Competence Centre in Tampere. Roadshows took place in Great Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Norway and the Netherlands. The AGM was held in Helsinki 22 March 2016. Local Kalmar and MacGregor arranged their first hackathons in 2016, attracting experts from digital communities communities around the world. In 2016, Cargotec also awarded a grant of EUR 600,000 to Tampere University of Technology, which is one of Kalmar’s most significant research collaboration partners. Authorities and With our own operations located in 45 countries, we engage with local governments and governments authorities to ensure regulatory compliance in our operations. Suppliers We run extended supplier relationship management programmes with selected suppliers to create joint value for our own and our suppliers’ business. Research and Cargotec frequently collaborates with universities and other research institutions. We have ongoing education collaborations with Swedish, Polish and Finnish universities, for example. As an example, Kalmar institutions launched a digital business development programme together with the Swedish Linné University to create new smart services for industrial products. In addition, Cargotec announced its participation in an initiative aimed at creating an ecosystem of autonomous ships for the Baltic Sea by 2025. Media Cargotec arranges press meetings in connection with trade events and result publications, among others. We issue tens of press releases every year covering a wide array of topics. We also serve press globally by providing information, images and other material about our products and solutions, and about the company in general. 50 ANNUAL REVIEW 2016 UNGC GRI CONTENT REFERENCE AND OMISSIONS principle G4-27 RESPONSE TO KEY TOPICS AND CONCERNS RAISED Our interaction with employees builds a foundation for both innovations and a committed workforce. We receive highly valuable feedback from our employees. Structured methods of gathering employee feedback include our employee engagement survey Compass. In 2016, Compass received an 88% response rate (2015: 86%). Among other things, the 2016 Compass results show that leadership performance, quality of work and equality as perceived by employees has increased slightly from the previous year (see also p. 9 and p. 21). Additionally, goals and expectations were perceived as clearer than before. On the other hand, the results also showed that we need to increase our efforts in creating understanding of individual actions and targets and the company strategy. It was also evident that uncertainties in the market environment are causing concerns about the future outlook of our businesses.

The risk for violation of international human rights is increased in our supply chain in certain countries. As a measure to mitigate the risk and emphasise the request to support human rights, Cargotec has set a clear target for supplier audits and audit development for 2017; please see the sustainability targets on page 42. Additionally, we have started a project to identify any needs to update our existing supplier requirements or to have more trainings to our sourcing employees regarding human rights assessments.

SOCIETY ANTI-CORRUPTION G4-SO3 TOTAL NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF OPERATIONS ASSESSED FOR RISKS RELATED TO CORRUPTION 10 AND THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS IDENTIFIED Cargotec initiated a risk assessment of corruption risks in 2013 covering the operations of Cargotec. Most of the identified risks were related to interaction with third parties. There have been numerous initiatives and trainings for key organisations after the risk assessment to prevent the risks. As an example, a new agent appointment process was defined. The process includes several actions ensuring the prospective agent’s compliance with the anti-corruption legislation. Training sessions on the new process were arranged for employees working with agency management. G4-SO4 COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 10 Cargotec’s Code of Conduct, Anti Corruption Policy and related processes were discussed by the Cargotec Board of Directors before the Board approved the documents. Cargotec’s Code of Conduct and the Anti-Corruption Policy have been communicated to all Cargotec employees via several channels. Both policies are available on the Cargotec intranet. The Code of Conduct is part of new employees’ initiation. The Code of Conduct e-learning course was launched in 2014 and the participation rate within the target group achieved a 90 percent level. The target group includes employees with an individual company email address and access to the intranet. The e-learning tool covers all sub-sections of the Code of Conduct but lays particular emphasis on anti-corruption. The course will be updated regularly, after which the participation rate will be re-evaluated. The next update of the course will be implemented during 2017. The Code of Conduct and participation in the e-learning of each employee is also revised in the personal development plan (PDP) discussion. As of 2013, trainings on anti-corruption have been organised for business area management teams on several levels, and for the corporate Executive Board. Cargotec’s Code of Conduct is also communicated to agents and suppliers, and it is available on Cargotec’s website.

Customer health and safety is the top priority in Cargotec’s offering. Health and safety impacts are evaluated in all product categories. The scope of health and safety impact evaluation depends on the product type, usage, customer demands and existing regulative requirements. The EU Machinery directive and related standards guide the evaluation when applicable. Outside the EU, local regulations and requests are followed. Products are tested carefully before being delivered to customers. Delivery processes that need special logistic solutions are assessed separately for possible risks to health and safety. The usage of products is tested carefully before delivery to customers and/or when the final assembly at customer’s facilities is carried out. Possible hazardous materials used in the components of the equipment are controlled with appropriate safety management practices and safety data sheets. Production is always planned taking into account the special features of produced product safety.
