Aviation industries are bound to have more foreign currency-denominated debts than Management assets and spend more foreign currency than revenue received on foreign currency. We also have a continuing demand for air fuel. Thus, the changes in exchange rate and oil price have significant impact in company's profit and loss. That is why Asiana Airlines has established and applied risk management policies for more structured and efficient risk management. A risk management committee has been established to promptly respond to external risks, having business Management Office Head as Committee Chair, and executives and team leaders from relevant departments as committee members. • Risk Management Committee Committee Chairperson: Strategy & Planning Dept. head Committee members Financial Strategy & planning Procurement Practical business affairs officer officer officer team leader • Purpose • Develop risk management strategy against external risks and define hedging tactics and the optimal hedging ratio • Structure • Chairperson: Strategy & Planning Dept. head • Committee Members: financial officer, strategy & planning officer, procurement • Period • Periodic quarterly meetings complemented by ad-hoc meetings whenever needs arise • Activities in 2015 • 4 periodic meetings (quarterly), 2 ad-hoc meetings • Main issues • Exchange rate – discussed exchange rate exposure management • Oil price – established program hedge strategy • Interest rate – established strategies for different types (variable/fixed) of interest rates To deal with the exchange rate issues, we preferentially apply internal management techniques such as matching the foreign currency income and expense through the change of the currency of settlement and/or expanding the borrowing portion of the currency in long position(income > expense). We are coping with the exchange risk through the external techniques such as forward exchange dealing for the remaining exposed currency. As for the oil price, we pay due regard to the effect of oil surcharge, an interrelation between oil price and corporate performance and the level of oil price. Then we apply ‘Program Hedge’ by buying certain portion of prospective annual oil supply consistently. With that, Asiana Airlines reduces volatility by oil price fluctuation. lastly, as for the interest, we take the equal maintenance of the portion of amount between fixed interest rate and variable interest rate as our basic strategy. but when new borrowings or aircraft rental contract takes place, the portion of amount is varied flexibly to deal with the changes in the financial market actively. ✽ Program Hedge: a method of ensuring the purchase prices of aviation fuel and USD equal to the average of the previous hedge period by continuous and evenly distributed purchase of required aviation fuel and dollar from the futures market for a certain period 40 41 Fair Trade & Disclosure Fair Trade Sustainable Management Asiana Airlines has an internal fair trade compliance program in place to ensure voluntary compliance for fair trade and better competitiveness. For more rigorous compliance, we provide information on relevant laws home and abroad, and case examples of law enforcement via the bulletin board and other in-company systems.

In 2014, regular trainings on Fair Trading Act were provided to new hires, and overseas assignees working in relevant practices and employees in domestic and foreign branches. We gave fair trade law educations for those who work at high-risk departments. In 2015, as part of our regular education program, Fair Trade Act was introduced to our new employees, overseas employees, and domestic and overseas branches, as well as to departments and staff who are likely to violate the said law.

In 2015, 207 newly recruited employees (general, sales, airport, maintenance, etc.) and 50 current workers received the education. 50 51 Climate Change Response Local and Emission Trading Sustainable Management ● Asiana Airlines became subjected to the emission trading system since 2015. Currently, 525 Korean International companies participate in ETS, according to which the Government assigns the legal limit on the quantity Response of GHG to companies and allows them to trade surpluses or shortages. To meet the requirements set by the emission trading system, Asiana Airlines has been verified by a third-party organization and submitted the monitoring plan to Ministry of Environment. In addition, we are conducting various fuel reduction activities consistently to reduce GHG. ● EU-ETS Since 2012, global commercial/non-commercial airlines operation flights in EU member countries all joined the EU ETS. We have been assigned the emission limit for 2012-2020 based on our transport performance in 2010, and the emission right is calculated by comparing the assigned limit and actual emission. During QT1 n 2015, we were verified by the German panel for our emission related to intra-EU flights in 2014 and submitted the relevant result to the German Ministry of Environment. On November 9, 2012, the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) general assembly concluded to set up International standards on GHG emission and as such the system was to be applicable only for intra-European flights. As of April 3rd, 2014, upon the voting result of EU Commission, the system is to be extended to 2016. However, regardless of the suspension, Asiana Airlines manages procedures such as GHG emission monitoring, report and verification. ● Voluntary Agreement for GHG Reduction In July 2010, Asiana Airlines signed a voluntary GHG reduction agreement with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport to set the GHG reduction target by renewing the agreement regularly and works to reach the target. In 2012, the company exceeded the GHG reduction target by far, and, subsequently, was selected as the airline with the highest fuel efficiency. During QT1 in 2015, Asiana Airlines was verified of its performance of the 4th agreement before signing the 5th agreement (with the agreement period extended from 1 year to 2 years), targeting 2% improvement of fuel efficiency. GHG Reduction ● GHG Reduction Activities Asiana Airlines has set up ‘Fuel Management Committee,’ which meets on a monthly basis, as Activities a way to concentrate its fuel-managing capability and to coordinate and promote inter-team opinions and information exchange to optimize communication for better business decisions. Since September 2015, we have been conducting a fuel reduction campaign titled Green Flight 6, which covers the entire flight process from pre-takeoff preparation to post-landing maintenance. In addition, we made a poster promoting fuel-reduction activities. We are implementing a series of fuel conservation activities such as optimized flight planning and operation procedure for fuel saving and economical flight. Optimal flight planning includes 2016 ASIANA AIRLINES SUSTAINABILITY REPORT reasonable fuel load based on statistical analysis of flight history data, and selection of most economical route from various possible routes in the planning phase. Flight procedures for fuel saving and economical operations refer to keeping economical altitude, and short-cut flight whereby the shortest airways are taken as a route depending on flight conditions. ● Fuel Reduction Activities in 2015 ➊ Operate Discussion Groups (monthly) ➋ Green Flight 6 Campaign • Corporate Fuel Management Committee • Engine washing Collect opinions of head office/division and make • Weight reduction relevant decisions on a monthly basis • Flight plan optimization • Economic Route Task Force • Short cut (fuel reduction – economical altitude, Set up in February 2012 to analyze and discover speed) optimized economic routes • Minimal use of APU ➌ Improved Fuel Efficiency ➍ Shorter/Economical Routes • Apply 3% contingency fuel to A380 and improve • 14 new routes developed stability and efficiency ➎ Engine Water Wash • Remove fine dust and sediments inside the engines to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 52 53 Sustainable Management ● Plan for 2016 Increase • Increase participation and practice rates related to Fuel Efficiency Checklist fuel reduction • Standardize the fuel reduction flight procedures in flight • Implement the fuel reduction flight procedures procedures (green-taxi, reduced flap takeoff, idle reverse landing procedure) Apply efficient • Check the flight planning reliability and stabilize application of optimal fuel loading policy fuel loading • Improve efficiency of A380 flight plan policy • Promote application of flexible taxi fuel • Analyze and improve aircrafts/routes that consume excessive fuel Improve • A  ctivities performed by the economic route development team efficiency of • D  evelop shorter/economical new routes flight planning • D  evelop nearby replacement airports • 2  016 plan for managing fuel over destination (FOD) • Improve 1% compared to 2015 Improve • Drag reduction project efficiency of Reduce drag based on APM fuel data maintenance Improve the maintenance process procedure Manage goals for engine and fuselage • APU time optimization project Use the optimal ground power by comparing APU and GPU costs of overseas airports Reward outstanding maintenance mechanics (staff who participated in or proposed a campaign) • Active maintenance for improved fuel efficiency Collect opinions of on-site staff and reflect them in policy based on fuel management-mechanic communication program 4,928 Review performance and proposed ideas for improving fuel efficiency improvement Actively participate in maintenance-related fuel reduction forums held 4,324 4,347 by international organizations • Costs reduced by engine water wash (1million KRW) 3,503 3,266 ● Engine Water Wash Since 2005, Asiana Airlines has been conducting regular engine water washes, by using the state-of-art equipment manufactured by Lufthansa.
