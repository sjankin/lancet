Communication on Progress 2017 United Nations Global Compact Statement of support Dear readers, It is my pleasure to present the Communication on Progress Report prepared according to the UN Global Compact guidelines, which covers our activities in the field of human and labour rights, environmental protection and the fight against corruption for 2016-2017. After a significantly prolonged period of gloomy economic conditions, 2016 turned out to be a year that finally displayed positive signals to entrepreneurs. As we have consistently been proving our operations to be resilient and sound, we remained strong and agile and readily welcomed these positive tendencies. Therefore, Privredna banka Zagreb dd and its subsidiaries, supported by our strategic partner Intesa Sanpaolo, managed to substantially outperform our peers in most relevant business aspects. We continued executing our predetermined business strategy built around customer relations and well-diversified sources of income, thus keeping a steady course and reflecting the ability to strengthen our earnings power. In 2016, the PBZ Group members coped well with the overall economic conditions that resulted in positive financial outcomes. All our business segments managed to increase the size of their loan portfolios, especially the SME and Corporate segments, thus proving our commitment to be one of the elements required to be put forward in the efforts to revitalize our economy. Supplementary to this, we have been investing significant efforts into shaping ourselves into a good capacitator, an experienced and agile entity able to conduct exceptional management of non-performing loans. Our proactive credit risk management and execution of well-defined collection strategies are providing continuous downward trends in the non-performing loans stock and share. Our strategic objectives are jointly planned on the PBZ Group level progressing with a multi-year plan of investments for the infrastructural and technological modernization, organizational changes in terms of increasing competitiveness and faster reactions to market changes and continuous assessment of risk profiles. Implementation of these objectives are already giving good results to the current business but also represent a solid foundation for future endeavors. The PBZ Group is well-fitted to not only face up to challenges, but also to seize opportunities. We have a strong capital base, liquidity and funding positions, preparing us for potential market uncertainties and for tighter regulation. We are continuously transiting to a better balanced, more diversified and lower-risk business model. Responsible growth will continue to be our main strategic choice. Boosting trust and improving the relationship with all parts of society that interact with the Bank represents the condition of a continuous improvement of our business.

A considerable progress was also made in the area of fiscal policy, where the general government deficit was reduced to approximately 2.0%, with a simultaneous decrease in the public debt level below 85% of the gross domestic product. The international environment was particularly favourable given the expansionary monetary policy of the European Central Bank, and also a mostly calm climate with the exception of slightly more turbulent movements following the UK referendum in June and the US presidential elections in November. At the same time, the domestic financial market saw a continuation and further monetary policy relaxation through structural repo operations conducted by the Croatian National Bank, which contributed to a further fall in interest rates and a gradual strengthening of the credit activity, especially ones denominated in Kuna. 5 Although the conversion of housing loans in Swiss francs (conducted in early 2016) and the cleaningup of balance sheets through sales and write-off of non-performing loans (throughout the year), reduced the exposure to the private sector by around 5% (November 2016), transaction data indicates that placements to the private sector over the first eleven months cumulatively increased by 1.7%, with a stronger increase in placements to corporations (3.0%) compared to retail loans (0.8%). It is particularly important to emphasise that in 2016 there has been a significant increase in the demand for kuna loans, due to which their share in total loans to the private sector rose to 40% compared with 32% recorded at the end of 2015. Currency risk aversion of clients has remained disproportionate to kuna savings, given the dominant share of FX deposits in total deposits of the private sector (around 67%), although a stronger fall in deposit interest rates on FX deposits from those on the kuna slowly increases the inclination to kuna savings. Regardless of the gross domestic product growth of almost 3% in 2016, and we are expecting a similar trend to continue in 2017, it is clear that without structural reforms a long-term potential growth rates will remain insufficient for a faster convergence to the EU average and a more considerable improvement in the wellbeing of citizens. Already in 2017 we may expect a new series of uncertainties over the impact of Brexit, the direction of the new US President's economic policy, but also the expectations that 2018 will bring a change in the direction of the European Central Bank monetary policy, after the US FED has already strengthened its policy at the end of 2016, sustainable economic growth has to be ensured by enhancing and strengthening the domestic economy's competitiveness through prompt structural reforms. In the text to follow, we provide an overview of the CSR activities of Privredna banka Zagreb in respect to the Global Compact Principles: Human Rights & Labour PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHT ABUSES PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION 6 PBZ completely respects all guidelines related to respect for human and labour rights which are regulated by the laws and Constitution of the RoC. Moreover, we continuously improve the quality of our working conditions, education and satisfaction of our employees. All employees are protected from any kind of discrimination by the PBZ Labour Relations Code and all decisions, regarding the employees, are approved by the Labour Council. We take all the necessary measures to protect our clients and improve our relationships with our suppliers. Actions taken: Code of Conduct The Bank recognizes the principles established by international conventions and has adopted the protection and maintenance of human rights as established by the Universal Declaration of 1948, as values of the Group. Our Code of Conduct, adopted in May 2010, was updated in September 2013 in order to additionally describe measures aimed at reinforcement of preventing the conflict of interest situations, even if potential ones. Our Code of Ethics is founded on a common system of values recognized within the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, of which we are a part. It is the framework within which we shape our everyday operations in relation to our stakeholders. In 2008 we undertook a series of activities aimed at promoting and establishing these common values amongst our employees. In 2009 the Code of Ethics was updated on the issue of transparency in remuneration. The model for the implementation and monitoring of the Code of Ethics was adopted in 2010. Latest update of the Code of Ethics was adopted in May 2012, further promoting values and principles at ISP Group level. Working conditions According to the principles of the Global Compact, respect for human rights is also seen in all the measures taken to ensure good working conditions and a safe and comfortable working environment for our employees.  Selection procedure and employment Employment policy is based on objectivity and transparency ensured by use of psychometric methodology which consists of psychological tests (intellectual ability, numerical and verbal reasoning, and personality profile) and motivational interview. All candidates go through the same steps during their evaluation: application, psychological testing, interview, hiring. From this year there are three levels of the interview process. The experts in evaluation within HRO department are in charge of professional and trait evaluation. This is where some candidates do not meet the required standards, and those who do continue to the interview with HR experts and competent manager who ensures objective and adequate evaluation of candidates’ expertise. The newly introduced step of interviewing is the final conversation with responsible manager of HRO department, which is obligatory for all new employees and also all employees who continue their employment through an open-ended contract. The selection procedure enables equal opportunities for all candidates and tries to match job requirements with the competencies of candidates to ensure best performance and long-term employees' satisfaction. All personal data of candidates is protected and confidential. The great accent is put on sending feedbacks to all candidates that have participated in selection procedure. 7 Starting from 2013, changes in selection process and internal rotation were made. Retail experience was put as a cornerstone for all new employees which should result in improved internal communications and understanding between different organizational parts. Changes in internal rotation procedure made possible for employees to make a career change more easily.  Structure of employees and management bodies → Total employment in the Bank State as on 31st Dec 2016: 3.635 employees Structure (31st Dec 2015): 973 men (26%) 2.662 women (74%) → Education Break-down of work force according to level of education and gender (degree, diploma, other): University Degree: 58,4 % (Bachelor, Master) High school: 41,1 % Other: 0,5 % → By category Executives: 63 (1,7%) Officers: 580 (16%) Employees: 2.992 (82,3%) → Age structure <=30: 367 (10%) 31-50: 2.310 (64%) >50: 958 (25%) According to the age and category, the majority in PBZ are employees between 31 and 50 years old.  Education and development of employees PBZ carefully and thoroughly plans the development and training of all employees, investing in creating a pleasant work environment, and endeavors to enable the fulfillment of the professional goals of individuals. Alongside the standard intern program, in cooperation with other companies and external experts, we continuously run courses in foreign languages, information technology, specialist programs, in-house academies and programs aimed at developing managerial and highly technical skills. In 2016 the total number of participants in these educational programs was 2.436 and a total of 15.346 days of training. It brings us to the respective average number of 4.2 training days per employee. In February 2007, the bank established the PBZ Business School that provides continuous managerial training programs for employees with high managerial potential on three levels: young potentials, junior managers, senior managers. In 2016 the eighth generation graduated the 3-year program. In 2016 PBZ business school counted 220 active participants. By having more than 20% of our employees involved in these programs we have made a significant impact in the sense of company identity. During 2016 PBZ continued to intensify e-learning approach to training by converting additional basic programs into LMS platform (such as Introduction program for new employees). Using e-courses we enabled them for all of our employees regardless their (dis)location while making our high quality 8 programs also timely, flexible and cost effective. In observed period, approx. 200 training days were produced via LMS platform.  Evaluation of work results and individual results Work results and individual results are evaluated each year through the Annual performance appraisal. Taking into account specificity of different job position levels and adjusting methodology to best fit business processes, (three) different/tailored methodologies are in force. Strategic managerial methodology ensures the balance between goals that are oriented towards professional growth and financial success with those that endorse responsible and sustainable business. Two sets of goals are predefined. One set of goals are financial/quantitative goals that have objective measures and the results are easily evaluated. However, at the same time and equally weighted, as their key annual goals managers get a set of sustainability goals that are qualitative, based on criteria that do not have direct financial impact and that ensure responsible business towards all included parts. All other employees are evaluated according to methodology that also balances business-oriented behavior and those that ensures responsible behavior towards colleagues and clients. Methodology for evaluation of employees engaged in sales and collection stimulates achieving and exceeding the target budget but discourages risky and excessive sale. In addition to sales result, working behavior that guides towards integrity, responsibility and accountability is being evaluated. For non-sales employees, through setting and evaluating a shared (solidarity) goal on the team level, team work and striving towards achieving team goals is encouraged. And through evaluating role specific goal, key parts of individual working role is covered. In addition to KPI evaluations, key competencies for each role are also evaluated. The Performance evaluation process is supported by IT system and it empowers employees and makes them responsible for fulfilling goals which are more closely related to the Bank's results. An important part of annual appraisal is setting goals for the next year. An evaluation conversation between a manager and an employee is key part and allows both sides to discuss their viewpoints, expectations and possible problems. Through the HR IT system, eHR, every employee has an insight in his own performance goals, expected date of fulfillment and comprehensive performance evaluations history. In case of dispute regarding performance appraisal, any employee can ask for an internal arbitration procedure, which is mediated by HR, and it can be initiated throughout the performance appraisal process.  Organizational climate and satisfaction at work Privredna banka Zagreb aims to research and measure its employee's attitudes and perceptions concerning their work environment in order to timely discover and identify what employees value and what might affect them, their motivation and their performance. The Human resources & Organization department conducts organizational research annually with focus on organizational climate and employee engagement and also proposes and implements changes and improvements with the goal of keeping employee job satisfaction levels high. The 2016 organizational climate research gathered important information from 3084 employees or more than 77% of all employees, the highest participation rate in all previously conducted organizational climate researches. From all these anonymous responses we were able to conclude that job satisfaction in PBZ Group was very high, with 81% of employees reporting that they are satisfied with their job. They are mostly satisfied with their relationships with colleagues (87%), customer's trust (83%) and job security (70%). Satisfaction is lowest regarding bonuses (which 39% of employees are satisfied with) and participation in innovative projects (41%). 93% of participants perceive the Bank as stable (93%), leading (91%) and as member of a Group with an excellent international position (88%). Regarding direct and strategic management, employees largely express positive attitudes and perceptions, seeing the management as interested in the good of the company (78%), competent (78%) and capable of respecting the commitments undertaken (78%). These results encourage the Bank to continue improving important aspects of the workplace in order to achieve positive feelings and perceptions which in turn influence employee performance and overall business results. 9 The employee engagement research was conducted in 2016 within the Small Business & SME Division in order to look into the commitment the employees feel towards their organization and division and how devoted employees are to their business goals. Research results were used to actively manage processes and important motivational factors in order to achieve better job satisfaction. Seeing that this research attracted many participants and that its results served as a driver in further enhancing management practices it will be conducted on Group level and will as such allow for deeper understanding of employee job satisfaction and the factors that influence it.  Mamforce certificate Thanks to the implementation of a series of socially responsible practices, PBZ is one of the first Croatian companies that have obtained the basic 'Mamforce Company' Standard. The same is awarded to organizations that implement 'family friendly' policies which means that were successful in achieving a work-life balance, i.e. a successful organization of work and working environment, especially for working mothers who, in this way, are enabled to realize both a smooth professional career development and responsible parenting.

Use of organized recreation is also open to the immediate families of employees, meaning their spouses and children. The Association has been active for twelve years, and in September 2017 PBZ Standard has about 2,155 members from all PBZ Group Subsidiaries. The fundamental purpose of the Association is to achieve better health and general well-being through the realization of its objectives, which will positively affect the satisfaction and welfare of employees, directly improving their mental and physical health. This effect may significantly contribute to reducing the rate of sick leaves which are increasingly caused by a sedentary lifestyle and reduced physical activity of employees. With the help of PBZ Standard, employees are encouraged to engage in more physical exercise and sports activities, i.e. to lead a more active lifestyle which also increases their quality of life. PBZ Standard strives to provide recreation through as many sports as possible so as to stimulate Bank employees to socialize with each other and jointly contribute to the achievement of set goals, as well as to strengthen their team spirit and make them aware of the fact that it is easier to achieve such goals with joint forces. That is why PBZ Standard expands its recreation offer throughout Croatia, ensuring that employees have possibility for recreation in as many cities as possible. PBZ Standard organizes activities under the Towards Better Health initiative, through financing medical gymnastic recreation in fitness centers. Also, from 2013 greater focus is put on cycling and encouraging employees for greater use of bicycles as a mean of transport. Steps toward improvement of cycling infrastructure are already done in terms of organizing changing rooms with lockers for the employees. Additionally, during previous years also Bank has participated in campaign of the Union of cyclists named 'Biking to work' and in 2017 first time there was organized ISBD Bike Event in Italy. These initiatives bring together cyclists employees in order to adopt the working environment needs of cyclists and promoting cycling as a desirable lifestyle. One of PBZ Standard's activities is also arranging a large number of discounts cooperating with the PBZ Group clients who offer discounts on their products and services to all PBZ Group employees. The Association is regularly informing PBZ Group employees about all its activities and news through internal house newspaper and intranet.  Internal communications The internal communications system is very well developed through various channels: Intranet, email, the internal magazine Moja Banka (published in the on-line edition) and the monthly internal newspaper PBZXpress (regular published every 15th in month, 12 times in year, specificity is that readers manage content employees' correspondents). The 100th jubilee edition of PBZXpress has seen the light of day in January 2014. On the occasion of this anniversary, here we present the impressive figures collected in the course of eight years. About 2,751 articles have been written by 527 employees. 100 employees have been interviewed for the “Ten questions” section, whereas in the section on the best branches as many as 96 branches have been presented. Besides presenting projects, sponsorships and internal communication campaigns, through its internal house organ PBZ organizes and promotes several initiatives aimed at employees and their children. In the scope of humanitarian actions, for example, since 2011 about 690 individual wishes have been fulfilled and more than 400 gift packages have been donated to fifteen children’s homes and social care institutions thanks to the selfless engagement of colleagues. During 2015. in humanitarian action have been participated 240 employees who have collected packages for 250 families. Also, as part of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, we are connected with colleagues from other banks through internal newsletters (Wats up, News from the group), and internal communication channels (Sharing Forum, etc...). They contain all relevant information and interesting details from the Banks within the Group and in this way contribute to a feeling of belonging to this large international and 12 multinational group. Also, all employees are invited to contribute to the content of all the internal communication channels.  Corporate volunteering In 2016 Privredna banka Zagreb has been involved in manifestation Croatian volunteers in 2016 , organized by the Croatian network of volunteer. It is an event that mobilizes an extremely large number of volunteer organizers and volunteers. This year's event took place in the period 16 to 21 May 2016 in the cities of Zagreb, Osijek and Split, and the goal of the campaign was to promote volunteering in business sector. In this manifestation has been attended 40 employees of the Privredna banka Zagreb. Employees have been volunteered at the Center for Rehabilitation Sloboština where they were included in editing area, garden and sandy hippodrome, together with beneficiaries and employees of the Center. For employees who were participated in volunteering, Privredna banka Zagreb has been approved a day of paid leave. For years now, Privredna banka Zagreb at the end of the year, has been organizing humanitarian actions with the help of its employees for those in need. In 2016. PBZ has decided to initiate a slightly different humanitarian action by offering immediate help to those in need, under the name PBZ volontira (PBZ volunteers). As part of this action cooperation was arranged with the institutions taking care of the most vulnerable groups such as the poor and homeless, as well as institutions that care for people with developmental disabilities. Most of these institutions have already been receiving donations from our Bank over the past few years; the aim of the action was to introduce, sensitize and connect our employees with the users and workers of these institutions. From 13th to 14th December 2017, around 60 of our colleagues volunteered with goodwill and enthusiasm in Dubrovnik, Split, Varaždin, Čakovec, Oborovo and Zagreb. While some were preparing meals, folding clothes or washing windows, others participated in the workshops and daily activities of the users of these institutions. Although the experience is still being processed, what everybody has in common is that, no matter where and when the volunteering took place, after it was completed, all the volunteers went back to their homes with a sense of fulfilment and a new, precious experience. Due to the limited number of volunteer places, everyone who applied did not get the chance to volunteer, but they all have an opportunity to contribute as much as they can since all donations are more than welcome.  Strategic volunteering In June 2017 PBZ has started with The Financial Education Project in cooperation with ISBD and Museum of Saving in Torino. With this project we will organize for the first time strategic volunteering in our Bank in the field of financial education. The goal of the project is week before World Savings Day (October 31st) and during World Money Week, which will be held in the week of 12 till 18th March 2018 organize a series of educational activities and events aimed at promoting financial literacy. Since the project is based on strategic corporate volunteering, PBZ EduVolunteer group has been formed, whose members are PBZ employees, volunteers who will carry out financial education of young people through workshops in elementary schools on the subjects of savings. Security and safety We believe that protecting the security of our customers, as well as their assets and confidential information, is not only a primary duty but also the basis of the trusting relationship that we wish to maintain with them and we:  undertake to protect persons, their assets and valuables, as well as their fund of information and internal organizational processes in such a way as to provide a service that completely meets the requisites of reliability, continuity and confidentiality 13  guarantee constant compliance with the law  observe criteria of absolute transparency in informing our customers about their rights to privacy and the way in which we handle their personal information.

Suppliers' chain We guarantee equal opportunity in the selection of suppliers, taking into account their compatibility with the size and needs of our company. We undertake to make sure that the contracts stipulated with our suppliers are based on fairness, especially regarding terms of payment and administrative compliance.

In 2015 we have implemented so called Supplier Portal, e.g. publicly available pages where any interested company can apply as a potential PBZ Group and ISP Group supplier. Additionally, through the same tool we are now managing our tenders what is additional value/insurance of the process fairness and transparency Future goals: In the future period we will continue to promote company unity and increase transparency in employee relations through internal communication channels. Also, our goal is to adopt policies and offer conditions that will result in a first-rate working environment for all employees. In relation to our suppliers, we will ensure that the process of supplier selection is transparent and fair and establish a cooperative relationship based on dialogue and mutual trust. Also, we will increase intensity of dialog with ISP Group subsidiaries in the procurement area with the goal of recognizing and adopting best procurement practices regarding responsible social and environment friendly management of procurement. Environment PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES 14 We pursue the conscientious consumption of the resources necessary for carrying out our business while actively improving the energy efficiency of our activities.

On a regular basis we have been sending our employees personalised emails so as to remind them about mandatory shutting down of their PCs after office hours, turning off their air-conditioning and heating units over the weekend, separating used paper from other waste for recycling purposes. Double sided copying of documents has been our standard for several years, reusable envelopes and other activities in that direction have resulted in a substantial decrease in the consumption of paper, which over the last two years is at its lowest level, and is now only reflected in the increase or decrease of activities in business, and not irrational spending: Also, since June 01 2012, all the envelopes used for machine inserting in the Bank are made of recycled paper as well as A4 paper for automatic letter folding which resulted in a substantial increase in recycled paper usage. In fact, all A4 and A5 paper, 80g. that is consumed in branches and everyday business throughout the whole company is exclusively recycled. We have introduced some years ago the recycled paper confectionary and some hygienic products (recycled paper towels and toilet paper) and now they are standard. Within the last 5 years a reduction of over 100,000 kg in paper consumption has been realized and in the same period an increase of recycled paper usage of over 250,000 kg We are monitoring the market of printed forms and other paper products used in Banks in order to find even more alternative products made from recycled paper. Installing energy efficient light bulbs and electronic ballast in order to cut energy consumption for lighting is a common practice. Upon replacement of worn-out equipment, attention is paid to having such equipment replaced with one of optimal characteristics (classic light bulbs are replaced with energy efficient bulbs, air-conditioning devices with inverter technology and of higher energy efficiency degree are installed, the material and elements of good insulation properties are used in construction, LED lighting is used in advertising signs and also, heat recovery ventilation is installed. As a result of our efforts in that direction since January 2013 we are an official Partner in the GreenLight Program. In 2016, we had an increase in electricity consumption (a total of 17,342 MWh) compared to 2015 (16.788 MWh) due to a very high temperatures during the summer, which caused a much greater use of the air conditioners than usual. PBZ is compliant with the legislation in energy efficiency and always actively monitors all changes. The Bank educates its employees and is always looking to use new energy-efficient equipment. Accordingly, the Bank supported and acquired:  activities defined by the Law: PBZ Group conducted Energy audit of large companies according to the Energy regulation.  employee education: Employee form General administration, successfully completed education for European energy managers in duration of 220 teaching units.  energy-efficient equipment: In branch Valpovo were installed 85 pc. LED lighting (downlighters). In new branch Split 3 were installed 60 pc. LED lighting (downlighters) and eco heating/cooling system with eco-friendly medium R-410. In branch Stradun were installed new air recuperation system. In branch Dražice were installed new air condition system. 15 We encourage coming to work by bicycle. Earlier this year we opened locker / dressing rooms with showers for cyclists and we are currently in the process of constructing additional parking spaces. For the second year in a row, we participated in the ‘Bike to Work’ national initiative – organized by the Cyclist Union, which took place from May 9 to June 2, 2016, and involved 155 of our staff. Cyclists have their own column on the Bank's intranet and internal bulletin. We are undertaking a series of active measures to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to the previously purchased electric mopeds (without CO2), old cars in the carpool have been replaced with eco-friendly cars with low CO2 emissions. Today, we use the following for carpooling: 2% of the cars meet the Euro 4 standard 83% of the cars meet the Euro 5 standard 13% of the cars meet the Euro 6 standard Future goals: As for future plans, we will continue to implement measures consistent with our environmental policy and promote the responsible use of natural resources, especially the efficient use of energy and paper, and proper waste disposal. We will also strive to improve employee training, informing and raising public awareness regarding environmental issues and problems. Anti-Corruption PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESS SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY PBZ Group does not tolerate any form of corruption or bribery. Actions taken: Corporate Governance PBZ systematically monitors best practice principles in the field of corporate governance, which are incorporated into PBZ’s operations in accordance with the principles of good banking practice. The principles of corporate governance are implemented through the principle of publicly accessible operations, the powers of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, internal control systems and co-operation between the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. Suitability assessment of members of Management and Supervisory Board, as well as Key Function Holders is conducted on annual basis. An integral part of the Bank's internal control systems is the compliance function. Along with risk control functions and internal audits, it is a system of processes established with the goal of insuring that the Bank operates pursuant to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, along with guidelines of the parent bank, codes and adopted professional practices. The compliance function guarantees the existence of rules, procedures and operating practices which efficiently prevent the breach or violation of applicable regulations in the area of all the Bank's business activities. The compliance function guarantees the existence of rules, procedures and operating practices which efficiently prevent the breach or violation of applicable regulations in the area of all the Bank's business activities, including the areas of financial mediation, anti-money laundering, usury, 16 transparency, embargo, payment systems, safety and health at work, personal data protection, consumer protection as well as regulations in the area of environmental protection. Policies, Systems and Commitments that support anti-corruption principle include: ISP Group's Code of Ethics ISP Group's Code of Conduct PBZ Code of Ethics PBZ Code of Conduct Croatian Chamber of Commerce Business Code of Ethics Rulebook on Measures and Actions for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing with its constituent part – Indicators for suspicious transactions Guidelines for the Fight against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and for the Handling of Embargoes Sanction Management Rules Whistleblowing procedures. PBZ has enacted Procedure for protection of employees who report irregularities whistleblowers which allows the employees to report the alleged violations of regulations that may be committed by the responsible persons or other employees, in the manner as to establish a special, independent and autonomous internal channel for such reports and resolution thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Credit Institutions. Anti –Money Laundering, Combating Terrorism and Embargo The Republic of Croatia, with the aim of preserving or re-establishing international peace and security, has adopted restrictive measures and embargos imposed by the United Nations Security Council Resolution, resulting in the partial or full suspension or weakening of economic relations with one or more third world countries. When rendering decisions on implementing restrictive measures and embargos the Republic of Croatia, as a member state of the European Union since 1st July 2013, applies the common position or joint action of the member countries of the European Union. In addition, PBZ, as a member of the ISP S.p.A. Group, accepts the regulations on embargo stipulated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), in charge of management and implementation of economic and trade sanctions which the United States of America impose on foreign countries, terrorists, drug traffickers and all entities suspected of being involved in trade, manufacture or use of weapons of mass destruction. The repression of corruption in all its forms is an integral part of AML measures and activities conducted by PBZ. In that way the Know Your Customer standard which is incorporated in the Rulebook on Measures and Actions for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing implies learning more about the customers' habits, their activities, income, business environment and reasons for choosing our Bank as their commercial bank, including all other details that help us to have an overall picture of our prospective and existing customers, to minimize potential risks and to protect the good name and reputation of our Bank. In the aim to perform needed sanction checks of payment transactions as well as to perform customer due diligence the Bank implemented certain tools and regularly improves its applications and business procedures to be in line with new demands imposed by relevant bodies. 17 The Bank uses SW for automated processing of majority of AML processes so Customer Due Diligence – CDD is applied for onboarding clients as well as ODD for existing clients. The Bank detects through automated process also unusual and suspicious transactions and customers and checks all foreign currency payments in line with obligations proscribed in embargo measures defined by UN, EU and OFAC. During 2016 PBZ AML department received and acknowledged number act from the parent bank, which are expected to be implemented in 2017, through amendment and/or revision of following document (which are still in force): Iranian Policy Additionally, to describe above, the Bank still uses some in house solutions as part of four eye principal . The Bank periodically does re-assessment of all clients’ data base and is specially focused on high risk categories of customers but also on medium risk categories which are subjected to verification process during existence of business relationship between those client categories and the Bank. The Bank performs each year self-evaluation of ML Risk Exposure in which is included quality of internal control system. The overall risk is evaluated based on assessment of inherent risk and vulnerability risk which includes some subjective criteria but also 50 indicators are part of assessment done on objective criteria based on concrete data. Training The Bank is dedicated to perform each year regular training programs/activities and main aim of those trainings is to introduce the basic values and principles that Bank stands for and applies in relation with clients, and also to specific knowledge related to AML to all front staff employees. In the 2016 further number of employees were educated throughout: Annual Classroom training – 1620 Bank's front office employees attended the classroom education in 64 educations (classroom trainings including exam). Education was jointly organized by the Compliance and AML functions regarding anti money laundering, combating terrorism and embargo issues, ethical principles, dealing with conflict of interest and personal transactions in general (including personal transactions in financial instruments), nonarmament policy, off shore policy. Training was organized for front-office staff of 6 retail (Zagreb, Central Croatia, Dalmatia, Istria-Rijeka-Lika, Slavonia and Northern Croatia) and 5 SME regions (Zagreb, Central Croatia, Dalmatia, Istria-Rijeka-Lika and Slavonia, as well as staff of Large Corporate training of new employees (17) through separate educations (2). Special focus is also put on training of AML stuff so each employee who works in AML function needs to be informed and updated on new practices and trends applied by credit institutions so it is obligatory for them to participate on, at least one conference per year. Also, as an efficient channel of internal communication, PBZ newsletter is delivered to all employees on a monthly basis. Capital Markets In the area of capital markets PBZ assumes dual role as issuer of financial instruments (PBZ shares are listed on Zagreb Stock Exchange) and provider of investment and ancillary services. Therefore, PBZ has adopted direct measures and procedures with the clear aim of preventing or interrupting 18 any form of corruption or conduct that may be interpreted as being on the level of less than professional involving both of the previously mentioned roles. In that sense, and in addition to the previously mentioned tools, PBZ has three main principles around which its anti-corruption efforts (in the area of the capital market) revolve:  prevention of conflict of interest  management of the price sensitive information  supervision of the personal transactions of relevant employees. The Policy for Personal Transactions with Financial Instruments (updated in July 2015) contains following main points:  all relevant persons / insiders intending to trade in any financial instrument must notify Compliance Department thereof before placing any order for the purchase/sale of financial instruments (for transactions in PBZ shares a prior consent is required – already existing provision)  clear indication that third-party employees can and must be recorded onto registers if they have potential access to the inside information (relating to the Bank and/or thirdparty issuers)  clear designation of responsibilities for recognition and recording in case an information should be registered onto the List of relevant business activities  update of the content of registers. This internal act, along with Conflict of Interest Management Policy (updated in 2014) demonstrate PBZ’s commitment to transparent conduct in providing investment services and activities and ancillary services pursuant to the Capital Market Act and relevant subordinate regulations, in order to ensure the best possible management of legal and reputation risks in relation to the price sensitive information. During 2016 PBZ received and acknowledged number of acts from the parent bank, which are expected to be implemented in 2017, through amendment and/or revision of following documents (which are still in force):  Code of Ethics  Market Abuse Prevention Policy  Insider Lists Policy  Personal Transaction Policy,  Conflicts of Interest Management Policy. Note: All activities performed within PBZ are implemented throughout PBZ Group. Membership PBZ is member of: The Croatian Banking Association Bank Association at the Croatian Chamber of Commerce Banking Association for Central and Eastern Europe Future goals: Since the PBZ Group does not tolerate any form of corruption or bribery or any form of improper conduct, it continuously strives to pass on its corporate values to all employees (training, e-learning 19 etc.) and to efficiently implement measures of control in relation to money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Further and continuous developments are needed along with greater and continued IT system support with sustained educational efforts to improve and facilitate the suppression of money laundering and terrorism financing altogether.
