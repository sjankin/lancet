Legacy, our new potash plant in Canada, will sustainably enhance our resource and production base, and is about to produce its first ton of potash. The rail connection to the network of our partner, Canadian Pacific Railway, has been finished and the construction of the harbor facility in Vancouver is almost complete. In short: we are entering the final stretch to supply our customers with high-quality plant nutrients and later also potash for numerous industrial applications – products that are needed around the world – from Canada. In addition, since the beginning of this year, we have once again had the option of deep-well injection for larger volumes of saline wastewater from potash production at the Werra plant in Germany. This is an important step to securing domestic production and against the background of our application already filed in April 2015 for a long-awaited decision. However, we should not forget the significant impact that the restricted and ultimately unavailable option of deep-well injection had in 2016 – also financially. Production standstills were inevitable as operations were suddenly dependent on the water flow of the Werra river; in other words, it was contingent on the weather. More than 1,000 of our miners as well as our colleagues above ground were affected by shortened working hours. 6 In 2017, production still may not run totally smoothly due to the restrictions included in the deepwell injection permit. However, the ‘Kainite Crystallization Flotation’ facility (KCF), which is currently under construction, will help reduce the volume of wastewater by an additional 20 % from 2018 onwards, thus improving the situation significantly. Our goal is to avoid deep-well injection from 2022 onwards as much as possible. We have therefore implemented various projects to further explore residue reduction and alternative disposal measures. On top of that, the agreed trials to cover tailings piles are being prepared and further options to backfill large volumes of brine in underground mines are being examined. These efforts ensure that we will make further progress in the future to the benefit of our company and the environment. Key data 2016 The environment our operating business faced in 2016 was anything but favorable. The winter weather both at the beginning and the end of the year was once again mild. Low potash prices led to a strong decline in earnings in our Potash and Magnesium Products business unit. In addition, we suffered from the issues at our Werra plant which burdened our operating profits by almost € 200 million. As a result, we were not able to earn our cost of capital, and the proposed dividend will experience a significant decline. Despite all this, we achieved operating earnings of € 229 million. One reason for this is our successfully concluded ‘Fit for the Future’ programme. The savings achieved in the past three years ex7 ceeded our own expectations every step of the way. Whether in production and materials handling or logistics and IT, we managed to sustainably reduce costs and to create more efficient structures – a path we will continue to follow. The company has also once again proved that it is able to successfully get through difficult times. This is the virtue of our more than 14,000 employees globally. Our team has shown continued dedication to K+S, and everybody has done a great job despite the challenges. Many have shown solidarity with their colleagues at the Werra, and for that alone our employees deserve the respect and sincere thanks of the entire Board of Executive Directors. Personally, the team spirit in our company has impressed me and fills me with pride. Outlook Dear Shareholders, Your K+S will continue to make progress – the year 2016 was not a benchmark for the future. Our business unit Salt is well on track to achieving the goals of its “Salt 2020” strategy. We are no longer so dependent on the volatile de-icing business compared to a few years ago and have achieved significant improvements with regard to efficiency and growth. 8 We are confident that our Potash and Magnesium Products business unit will increase its capacity by 2 million tons by the end 2017 with the successful opening of the Legacy Project, despite the incident there last summer. Against the complexity of such a large project, it is an outstanding achievement that from today’s point of view we remain within the budget of about € 3.1 billion. In addition, we are making good progress to enhance areas that distinguish us from the competition. The acquired activities of Huludao Magpower in China and stake in Saudi-Arabian Al-Biariq specifically strengthen our Specialty business. We consequently want to continue on this route. All of the above are cornerstones for the growth of the K+S Group. Our goal to achieve an EBITDA of about € 1.6 billion by 2020 remains. This may seem ambitious in light of the current potash prices, but the motivation within our company to reach the target is huge, and therefore we will stick to it. Ladies and Gentlemen, The lines above report on a company that had to withstand considerable operating challenges, but which also remained to a large extent untouched by the many crises and upheavals the world faced. My desire for our K+S is that this remains true beyond my service as CEO of K+S Aktiengesellschaft, which will end in May 2017 after 17 years on the board of the company. With regard to this, I would like to express my thanks to you – our employees, our customers, shareholders, 9 and partners. Let me conclude by saying that I wish my successor, Dr Burkhard Lohr, all the best for continued success in future endeavors.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The annual financial statements of foreign Group companies are converted to euros in accordance with the functional currency concept set out in IAS 21. All companies conduct their operations independently in financial, economic and organisational terms. The functional currency generally corresponds to the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated applying the average exchange rates for the quarter. The resulting currency translation differences are recorded in equity without recognition in profit or loss. If Group companies are no longer consolidated, the relevant currency translation difference is released and recognised in profit or loss. In the case of 12 companies, the US dollar, in deviation from the local currency, is used as the functional currency, as these companies generate the majority of their cash inflows and 152 2.6 Notes The conversion of key currencies in the group was based on the following exchange rates NEW OR AMENDED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS per euro: NEW OR AMENDED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS TAB: 2.6.9 EXCHANGE RATES TAB: 2.6.7 Date of  2016 Date of mandatory Period-end mandatory application for exchange Quarterly averQuarterly averQuarterly averQuarterly averapplication 1 K+ S Group 2 rate on age exchange age exchange age exchange age exchange Standard / interpretation 31 December rate Q1 rate Q2 rate Q3 rate Q4 Collective stanper € 1 dard for the US dollar (USD) 1.054 1.102 1.129 1.117 1.079 amendment of 1 February Change several IFRSs Annual improvements in IFRSs, cycle 2010 – 2012 1 July 2014 2015 Canadian dollar (CAD) 1.419 1.515 1.455 1.456 1.440 Performance-oriented schemes: 1 February Czech koruna (CZK) 27.021 27.040 27.040 27.029 27.029 Change IAS 19 Employee contributions 1 July 2014 2015 Brazilian real (BRL) 3.431 4.304 3.963 3.622 3.555 IFRS 10, 12, Investment entities: Application of Chilean peso (CLP) 706.669 772.367 764.979 738.881 717.092 Change IAS 28 exemption from consolidation requirement 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 Great Britain pound (GBP) 0.856 0.770 0.787 0.850 0.869 Change IAS 16, 41 Agriculture: Fruit-bearing plants 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 Collective standard for the amendment of EXCHANGE RATES TAB: 2.6.8 Change several IFRSs Annual improvements in IFRSs, cycle 2012 – 2014 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 Accounting for the acquisition of  2015 Change IFRS 11 shares in joint business activities 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 Period-end Change IAS 27 Equity method in separate financial statements 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 exchange Quarterly averQuarterly averQuarterly averQuarterly averChange IAS 1 Disclosure initiative 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 rate on age exchange age exchange age exchange age exchange 31 December rate Q1 rate Q2 rate Q3 rate Q4 Clarification of acceptable depreciaChange IAS 16, 38 tion and amortisation methods 1 January 2016 1 January 2016 per € 1 US dollar (USD) 1.089 1.126 1.105 1.112 1.095 1 To be first applied according to IASB to financial years commencing on or after this date. 2 To be first applied to companies with their registered address in the EU to financial years commencing on or after this date.

The goal of interest rate management is to curb the risks arising from an increasing interest burden for financial liabilities as well as the risks arising from declining interest income from financial assets as a result of changes in the general level of interest rates. Since some of the promissory notes issued in the year under review have variable interest rates, interest caps were acquired in order to eliminate the risk of higher interest charges. In the case of the financial assets, there is currently no identifiable need for action on account of the short residual term and the low interest rates meaning that the risk of declining rates is minimal.

Basically, it is also possible to use compound options consisting of an option on a simple option, which can be acquired at a later date for a fixed amount. The terms of hedging transactions in respect of billed receivables are, in keeping with the agreed payment terms, less than one year. The hedging transactions in respect of anticipated net positions as described above are used in the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit for US dollar positions as well as for Canadian dollar positions for future production in Canada. Hedging transactions in respect of billed receivables are concluded in the Potash and Magnesium Products business unit. Trading in all the aforementioned derivatives is solely OTC. Forward exchange operations and option contracts are generally transacted via a trading platform through which quotations are obtained from several banks so that a transaction can then be executed with the bank providing the best quotation. In the case of forward exchange transactions, there is a market value risk on the respective reporting date. However, there are countervailing effects stemming from the currency-based measurement of receivables when derivatives are used in order to hedge foreign currency receivables. 166 2.6 Notes The following derivative foreign exchange financial transactions existed as at 31 December 2016: (20) EQUITY The development of individual equity items is shown separately on page 134.

Cogeneration Cogeneration is a method enabling the generation of useful heat at the same time as producing electricity. Compared with separate production facilities, cogeneration plants use the respective fuel, for example, natural gas, more efficiently. The heat generated during the cogeneration process is available in the form of hot water or high-pressure steam.
