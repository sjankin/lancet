ELVANG A business idea began taking shape after our backpacker travel in the beautiful Peru and our visit to a local market where we experienced the quality of alpaca wool. We wanted to combine the better of two worlds at Elvang by uniting one of the world’s finest fibres from the Peruvian alpaca with modern Scandinavian design. We wanted to place production in Peru for two reasons: to contribute to the country’s economic growth and to make use of the Peruvian tradition and expertise of weaving textiles of high quality in alpaca wool. Most important, we wanted to contribute to a sustainable future within the industry and we believe that our sphere of influence and greatest impact will be within securing good working conditions. Elvang became a member of an exclusive club in 2010, when it became Fair Trade certified through World Fair Trade Organization (WFTO) – today, only one of three Danish companies to do so. Elvang selects only suppliers in Peru who provide training to alpaca shepherds and opportunities for single mothers to work the wool in their home, secure good working conditions at the textile factories, and pay the shepherds and workers fairly for their work. We take opportunity of the close contact to the shepherds to train them in the care of the alpacas and breeding and shearing techniques. Kind regards, Tina Elvang Director, Elvang Denmark A/S LABOUR & HUMAN RIGHTS Vision Elvang was founded with Peru in the heart. The issues of human rights and labour standards lie at the heart of our work and we will pursue our business with pride and integrity based on the principles of ethical and fair trade. One of the most important areas of concerns is the conditions at our factories in Peru, but increasingly we try to look further down the chain to the livelihoods of the rural shepherds and their communities. Our goal is to eliminate all kinds of discrimination in terms of work procedures and employment of people. We will encourage all those in our supply chain to engage in collective bargaining so best pursue their needs. We will conduct our own business with the same principles we expect of others. Progress and results The standards at our biggest and primary supplier are very high. Among many initiatives the workers have access to free health and dental facilities on site, and salaries for the workers are equal, transparent and non-discriminative between men and women, the workers has a free right of association. All salaries exceed the Peruvian minimal wage. Furthermore child labour is completely avoided at our supplier’s factory. Our production supports more than 290 workers at the factories and approximately 60 percent of our primary supplier’s wool is bought directly from the alpaca shepherds thereby avoiding middle men and providing steady income for the workers and their families. It is important to Elvang to visit our suppliers and continuously engage in constructive dialogue on the improvement of human rights and labour standards. We will seek to go above and beyond national and international legislation to the best of our ability. We seek to be transparent and open throughout the organisation. We urge our employees to raise any issues of doubts with their management for clarification and decision. Further we are always open for good ideas to develop our business in an even more sustainable and ethical direction. ANIMAL RIGHTS The careful nurturing, breeding, treatment and shearing of the alpacas is very important. From a business perspective it ensures better wool, and from an ethical perspective we ensure the Alpaca and their shepherds can develop with one another. Our animal welfare approach centers mainly on the supplier’s development projects where the shepherds are taught all of these issues first hand. By showing them that the good treatment of the Alpaca means more money for them, their families and their communities, we are seeking to create winwin situations in which the shepherds are proud too. Our direct contact to the shepherds gives the opportunity to train the shepherds in the care of the alpacas. This include both general care, breeding and shearing techniques. Furthermore the shepherds are offered a bonus if they shear the animals correctly. When the alpacas are sheared correctly the wool can be graded in a far simpler way than is otherwise possible and even sold for a higher price. ENVIRONMENT Vision From its beginnings, Elvang has deliberately chosen to maintain its production in Peru in order to contribute to Peru’s economic growth and relieve the poverty of the alpaca shepherds. Elvang is working towards reducing the emission of Co2 by working towards 100 percent of shipping through sea freight. By focusing all production to one region we will streamline shipping and transport as much as possible. Progress and result Last year we sourced all our packaging from Peru, meaning every Elvang product is entirely sourced from the region. We will maintain our commitment to and engagement with the Peruvians and their tradition and expertise of weaving textiles of alpaca wool. Our commitment to WFTO (see next page) also adhere Elvang to respect the environment. As we are aware that freight with airplanes is less environmental friendly we have decreased our total transportation by air to only 15 percent in 2012/13. Rare delays in production makes it difficult to reach 100 percent of transportation by ship, hence our goal is at least 90 percent. Fair Trade PROJECTS Supply chain In 2010 Elvang became Fair Trade certiThough our suppliers we engage in a developfied. This mean that Elvang complies with ment project.

At Messe Frankfurt Elvang became “Company of the Year 2011” – it did so because of our extensive support of rural areas in Peru. Elvang selects only Global Compact suppliers in Peru who provide training to We are also a member of the UN Global alpaca shepherds and opportunities for single Production in Peru Compact, a strategic policy initiative for mothers to work the wool in their home, Elvang have from the beginning wanted to keep businesses committed to aligning their opsecure good working conditions at the texthe production in Peru.

As a By producing in Peru we retain their traditional member we must expertise for weaving textiles in alpaca wool. implement and report our initiatives within these areas every year. ANTIKORRUPTION Vision We maintain a completely open dialogue with our suppliers and encourage them to offer a price that includes all possible cost. We always offer to pay up-front thereby providing the best possible working conditions for our suppliers. Furthermore, we strive towards being as loyal to our suppliers at possible and aim for a long-term and steady business relation. We maintain a commitment to dealing with them directly and never deal through intermediaries. Progress and results Through the rural development project the alpaca shepherds are getting a fair price of up to 40 percent higher than their usual pricing. It ensures that shepherds are not being offered below-valuation prices for their goods and gives them a clear view of their actual market value. We will continue being loyal to our suppliers offering them the needed support to avoid extortion and bribery and we have increased the percentage of alpaca wool purchased directly of sherperds without the use of middlemen.
