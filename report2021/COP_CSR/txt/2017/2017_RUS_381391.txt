The technology has been successfully tested at the Labagansky, Kuyumbinsky and Yurubchensky license areas as part of the pilot development program and moved into the deployment phase A study to explore the potential of Upper Jurassic intervals at license areas operated by RN-Yuganzkneftegaz has been completed, with an extended logging set recorded along with a core analysis program completed in three wells. Based on the study, a 1D geomechanical model and a directional hydraulic fracturing model have been built, followed by HV slickwater fracturing in two deviated production wells. The results will be used to build a multi-stage fracturing model that will be tested on two horizontal wells Rosneft has developed 20 new methods for analyzing core samples from complex or unconventional reservoirs. The new analytical methods are designed to provide more insight into reservoir lithological and mineralogical composition, porosity, permeability, mechanical properties and other parameters. Following their approval by government authorities, the methods have been adopted by the Company’s research and design (R&D) institutes A beta version of a hydraulic fracturing simulator has been developed and is now being tested at the Company’s specialist units. Building unique geotechnical capabilities will allow the Company to improve the economic and operating performance of its OFS business and end dependence on foreign technologies The Company has developed a high-resolution electrical resistance sensing technology and designed a prototype of an electromagnetic probe with toroidal coils Rosneft has developed a system of catalytic hydrogenation of vacuum gasoil, consisting of HtVG-610RN hydrodesulfurization catalysts and HtVG-600 RN denitrogenation catalysts, to obtain an improved-quality product containing less than 500 ppm of residual sulfur, 350 ppm of nitrogen and 10 ppm of heavy metals A pilot batch of Ht-100RN diesel hydrotreating catalysts has been produced, with independent tests performed in the course of the hydrotreatment of directly distilled diesel to compare catalyst performance against its foreign counterpart. The produced catalyst has proved to be more effective than its foreign counterpart at temperatures of 380-410°С, pressure of 4.0 MP and the feedstock flow rate of 1.0 h-1 The Company has developed isodewaxing catalysts to produce mineral base oils with a low pour point (not higher than minus 50°С) that are used for low-temperature adapted lubricants. The main advantage of the new catalyst is that it has a higher base oil yield Implement the Pilot Testing and Deployment Projects As part of the implementation program, in 2016 the Company deployed and rolled out 141 new technologies which had previously undergone pilot tests and demonstrated technical and economic efficiency. The Company spent RUB 12,528 million to deploy and roll out 10.8 thousand items Environmental safety Develop a package of measures to improve environmental awareness A package of measures to improve environmental awareness has been developed, agreed by top managers, and approved by Vice President for HSE and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
