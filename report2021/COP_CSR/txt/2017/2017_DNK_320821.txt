Nr.: 16229414 Turbinevej 4-­‐6 Established: April 12, 1918 2860 Søborg Domicile: Gladsaxe Phone: +45 7011 5011 Member of Global Compact since: www.febording.dk September 9, 2009 fe@bording.dk Statement of support At Bording, we take social responsibility seriously. Both the social responsibility for our employees and the impact we have on the environment and the local community. Bording is more than 200 years old which has led to a culture of constant development and improvements. This is something we are proud of, and every year we strive to provide positive changes through sustainability management. Bording has been part of the UN Global Compact since 2009. In the year to come, we will continue following the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. At Bording, we want to be known as a reliable partner who respects the Global Compact. This does not only apply to Bording and its associated companies, but also to suppliers and business partners. As a Scandinavian business with several suppliers both within and outside Europe, it is important for us to make sure that suppliers live up to certain standards. We will therefore continue to encourage that suppliers and business partners live up to our ethical guidelines presented in the Code of Conduct which can be found on our website through this link: www.febording.dk/code-­‐of-­‐conduct. Yours faithfully Hans Therp Chief Executive Officer Bording’s view on Corporate Social Responsibility Bording believes that a part of being responsible is making a difference both locally and globally, whenever we have to opportunity to do so. Being responsible also means that we are responsible not only for our employees, but also for our suppliers, our customers, people around us as well as the environment. Bording and the principles With a history as a Danish printing company, Bording has focused on environmental concerns and opportunities for a long time. We do our best to create and uphold working procedures that protect the environment. Our longtime focus on environmental issues has created a unique base for suggesting, and to some extent demanding, improvements from our suppliers. The Bording Group understands that we cannot change the whole world, but by utilizing the Global Compact as a strategic tool for our work with social, ethical and environmental responsibility and values, we believe that we have taken an important step in the right direction. We continue to see CSR and sustainability as an important opportunity to work constructively with the challenges that we come across in our business operations. This adds value to our employees, the society, the environment and our business. The strength of the UN’s Global Compact is that the 10 principles are built upon internationally recognized conventions. The principles help us match expectations of good behavior and ethics when we do business across national and cultural borders. Furthermore, it gives us a strategic tool when it comes to sending our customers a clear signal on corporate responsibility and human rights. To a division such as Bording Vista, which is based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where many employees work under less fortunate conditions, we believe that it is important to send this clear signal in order to encourage other companies to treat the local employees with dignity and respect as well. For further information about UN’s work with Global Compact please visit: http://www.unglobalcompact.org/ The ethical guidelines of Bording As a Scandinavian Group we see globalisation as an opportunity to expand our market and to participate in international projects. However, associated with these opportunities are the risks and challenges of doing business across different legal and cultural traditions. Bording has acknowledged these risks and challenges, which have led to a process of making our own set of ethical guidelines. These have become an integrated part of our daily operations. Bording’s Code of Conduct (our ethical guidelines) is meant as a guide to our management team, employees, customers, suppliers and other cooperative partners about behavior and values in the Bording Group. Please visit our webpage, www.febording.dk to read our Code of Conduct. In Bording we strive to achieve the goal of always following the highest ethical standards and reducing the environmental impact our business may have on its surroundings as much as possible. At the same time, we assign a high importance to responsibility, trustworthiness and honesty.
