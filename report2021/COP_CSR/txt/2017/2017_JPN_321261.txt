Back Number 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 -3KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Top Commitment Responding to Environmental Changes and Technological Innovation On December 12, 2015, a historic global climate deal was adopted by 196 countries at COP21 in Paris, France, that is a framework of measures against global warming beyond 2020. This Paris Agreement indicates each country's strong sense of crisis for increasing disasters of climate change worldwide. Global businesses such as ours must further advance initiatives addressing environmental issues within our future businesses. Meanwhile, technological innovation continues to grow at an ever-accelerating pace, as we see advances that were once thought likely to take several years start to materialize before our very eyes. People's lifestyles and workstyles are being redesigned while their needs are profoundly changing. We believe that an environment where diverse people can work proactively will be the foundation of our competitiveness. We must endeavor to make this a reality. Achieving the Declaration of Kaneka United As set forth in our long-term vision formulated in 2009, the Declaration of Kaneka United for the future, Kaneka is focusing on “innovation and growth”, positioning research and development (R&D) and a global network as the driving force behind our growth. In fiscal 2015, we went ahead with plans to commercialize organic EL lighting, biopolymers and protein A resins. We are also strengthening our R&D in the medium to long term by establishing a regenerative medicine and cell therapy R&D center in Kobe. Creating new social value through R&D enables us to raise our corporate value and fulfill our social responsibility, resulting in our growth and development. By developing technologies and products that protect the environment and improve energy efficiency, we are moving forward in our businesses with environmentally responsible management. In terms of a global network, after establishing our regional headquarters in Asia and America in April 2012, we established a European regional headquarter in Belgium last year. Utilizing this headquarter, we will further promote our business operations in Europe as well as in Africa and the Middle East. It is essential for us to understand the customs and culture of the countries and regions where we operate, and offer products that suit local customer needs. Contributing to Society through Business in Key Strategic Domains In fiscal 2016, Kaneka began implementation of a new mid-term plan. Kaneka Group is making every effort to promote projects that can help address environmental and energy problems by bringing a solution to zero energy houses using combination of our products such as thin-film silicon photovoltaic module, insulation materials and storage batteries that serve to reduce the weight of vehicles and airplanes. In addition -4KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 to such a solution, we offer new value such as biopolymers to conserve ecosystem. Kaneka is also making a concerted effort to utilize our expertise in the business, where human health care and food production are concerned, through bio-pharmaceuticals, regenerative medicine and cell therapy, and plant supplements. Through these products, we at Kaneka are carrying out our corporate philosophy: With people and technology growing together into creative fusion, we will break fresh ground for the future and tie in to explore New Values. We are also committed to challenging the environmental issues of our planet and contributing to upgrading quality of life. “Safety First” is our Top Priority Based on our belief that “safety is a competitive strength in itself” for manufacturers, Kaneka's management policy for all operations is “safety is our top priority.” To achieve our goal of zero accidents, we will further raise safety awareness and strengthen disaster prevention through continuous initiatives together with top management, including facility inspections by Board of Directors and CSR safety and quality inspections. Kaneka Group joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2015. We are working on sharing our corporate philosophy to gain the trust of our stakeholders worldwide by implementing corporate initiatives in line with the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact in the four areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. We sincerely welcome your continued support. -5KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special Features This section presents how we at the Kaneka Group are working on two of our four key strategic domains―food production support and health care―in our core businesses. We also present the stakeholder dialogue with the Japanese Association for the World Food Programme, as well as various articles to facilitate better understanding of our CSR activities by stakeholders. Special FeatureⅠ Special FeatureⅡ Stakeholder Dialogue Food Production Support Health Care (Full Report) Communication Is Our Start Line KANEKA at a glance CSR Topics 2015 -6KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special FeatureⅠ Food Production Support Around 800 million or approximately one in nine people in the world today are starving. Meanwhile, in developed countries such as Japan, Europe and the U.S., roughly one-third of food is wasted. Food wasted by consumers, from leftovers and passed expiration dates, amounts to around 222 million tons each year. This is comparable to the total food production of sub-Saharan Africa (see note 1). Kaneka Group has initiated efforts to increase global agricultural production and reduce food waste. Note 1: Sub-Saharan Africa's total food production is 230 million tons. Source: Global food losses and food waste－Extent, causes and prevention, FAO, 2011. With its dedication to addressing social issues through business, Kaneka Group has been expanding its core technologies. As one of its core technologies since its establishment, the Groupʼs fermentation technology has created functional foods such as bread yeast and coenzyme Q10. We are further expanding into products that contribute to increasing food supply, such as KANEKA PEPTIDE, a new type of fertilizer that helps address food scarcity, and an anti-freeze ingredient that helps reduce food waste by retaining the quality of frozen foods, in collaboration with universities and research institutes. -7KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special FeatureⅠ Food Production Support New Fertilizer for Agriculture KANEKA PEPTIDE Technology to Efficiently Produce Oxidized Glutathione (GSSG) Based on Fermentation KANEKA PEPTIDE is a new high-performance fertilizer containing oxidized glutathione (GSSG), which provides nutrients to plants. GSSG works as a fertilizer to make plants grow effectively. It causes corn kernels, for example, to grow larger even as the number of kernels increases. Heavy use of conventional chemical fertilizers has reached the limit of their ability to increase yield, while some have also been known to cause soil degradation. GSSG, on the other hand, stimulates the innate power of plants to further increase yield while improving the ecological profile of fertilizers. GSSG is a natural ingredient commonly found in plants and animals, including human cells. Kaneka developed the technology to efficiently produce naturally existing GSSG. Moreover, in collaboration with the Research Institute for Biological Sciences, Okayama Prefectural Technology Center for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, which has been studying the effect of GSSG on plant growth, we are developing effective plant fertilization methods. “We use fermentation technology for glutathione production and pharmaceutical technology for the purification process, both of which are Kaneka Group's core strengths.” (Taku Mohri, Bioproducts Research Group, Biotechnology Development Laboratories) KANEKA PEPTIDE We are targeting more than 10 billion yen in sales in 2020 by accelerating our global business development Pilot Studies All Over the World Find 10% 40% Yield Increase Effective technology will further benefit society when it is used widely. Anticipating the global market, Kaneka Group has begun pilot studies of KANEKA PEPTIDE on various crops in collaboration with universities, agricultural experiment stations and large-scale farms in countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, India, China, Canada and the U.S. Remarkably, 10% 40% increases in yield have been confirmed in potato, cassava, sweet potato, corn, onion, eggplant and other crops. Another key to gaining more customers is its simple application. A method of integrating the product into existing fertilization systems has to be devised, since even a single spraying can become costly in countries such as the U.S., where efficient farming is practiced over vast land areas. Furthermore, when we expand the product's range to small-scale farms and regions where people are suffering from starvation, it is crucial that we implement awareness programs and create fertilizer formulas for spray amounts and timing. We are conducting such pilot studies to resolve each of these issues. “Even with the limited workforce available for R&D, the food issue is such a pressing one that we are testing various methods for crops in various countries. We need to launch this product simultaneously worldwide for timely widespread adoption. With its power to enhance plant growth, GSSG has the potential to expand agricultural land to areas with poor soil or those prone to cold weather damage.” (Taku Mohri) Taku Mohri Encouraging Agriculture through Materials R&D for Plants Bioproducts Research Group As the pilot studies progress in various parts of the world, an agricultural experiment Biotechnology Development station staff provided the Group with an important insight: the human body has been Laboratories -8KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 extensively studied in the course of developing therapeutic drugs and supplements, while many aspects of plants are still unknown. “That's why I believe we can still make great strides with plants. We hope to encourage agriculture by developing ingredients that are useful to plants.” (Taku Mohri) Moving forward, Kaneka will continue to concentrate on technologies acquired from advanced research for food production support, one of our key strategic domains. Developing formulations while studying easier dispersion and irrigation for farmers Stakeholder Message I hope more young people will work in agriculture. Kaneka and I share the same motto: For the farmers. The Okayama Prefectural Technology Center for Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries works on developing and promoting technologies that support agriculture, forestry and fisheries, while fostering their future leaders. At the Research Institute for Biological Sciences, we conduct basic, fundamental research in biotechnology that promotes agriculture, manufacturing and industries in the environmental field. I have studied GSSG, an ingredient in KANEKA PEPTIDE that carries an important function. I began collaborating with Kaneka because we share the same motto and goal: For the farmers, providing products at reasonable prices. Further agricultural development requires products to be available at affordable prices to everyone. Ken'ichi Ogawa -9KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Also, I look forward to Kanekaʼs efforts to promote the effective use of KANEKA Dr. Sci. (Kyoto Univ.) PEPTIDE. Director, Plant Redox Regulation As Japanʼs agricultural population declines and ages, the key to raising our food Research Group self-sufficiency rate is to improve profitability, so that young people will consider Research Institute for Biological Sciences farming as their career. KANEKA PEPTIDE will certainly help increase agricultural Okayama Prefectural income; actually witnessing this themselves will make more young people aspire to Technology Center for work in agriculture. Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 10 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special FeatureⅠ Food Production Support Preserving the Quality of Frozen Food Anti-freeze Ingredients Anti-freeze Protein Discovered in Antarctic Fish In subzero temperatures, water freezes in the bodies of ordinary living organisms and destroys the cells. Fish, plants, insects, mushrooms and other life forms living in the Antarctic and other cold regions can survive because they have anti-freeze proteins in their bodies that protect them from freezing. Anti-freeze protein was first discovered in an Antarctic fish in 1969. There are many benefits in applying anti-freeze protein to food products. For instance, “freezing damage,” which leads to a decline in the foodʼs taste and texture, does not occur, and the quality of the frozen food after thawing is maintained since it can inhibit the growth of ice crystals during storage. Moreover, products that were once difficult to freeze can now be stored frozen, which lengthens their shelf life and reduces food waste. The challenge was determining which organisms have anti-freeze protein that Anti-freeze protein can be extracted and how to extract it. A stable industrial production method for Exploring uses in frozen noodles, processed egg anti-freeze protein did not exist. Kaneka Group began communicating with one products, cooked rice, fish of the world's foremost authorities on ice crystals, Professor Hidehisa Kawahara paste products and of Kansai University's Department of Life Science and Biotechnology. desserts Successful Natural Extraction and Mass Production with Open Innovation In 2008, Kaneka Group collaborated on R&D with a joint venture company and Kansai University, which was promoting open innovation; in 2012, anti-freeze protein was successfully mass-produced from radish sprouts. Since it allows defrosted food to be savored without losing its taste, smell and physical properties by just adding a tiny amount of 0.02% 0.2% to the food, our product has earned an excellent reputation from many food manufacturers of frozen sushi, udon noodles, kamaboko (steamed fish paste), rolled eggs, gyoza (fried ground meat dumplings) and others so far. In 2015, we launched another new product: anti-freeze polysaccharide extracted from enoki mushrooms. It is tolerant to heat and acid as it is not a protein, and is used with hamburger and deep-fried chicken. Kaneka Group currently has over 100 products using anti-freeze ingredients. “I think Kansai University chose us as its partner in open innovation because, as a B2B company dealing with many food manufacturers in Japan, they believed that we can make anti-freeze ingredients more widespread. For this project, Kaneka Group facilitated the commercialization of the universityʼs research seed.” (Atsushi Takaragawa, Manager, New Business Planning Group, Strategic Planning Department, Foods Division) Atsushi Takaragawa New Business Planning Group Strategic Planning Department Research on New Ingredients to Reduce Global Food Waste Foods Division In April 2015, our anti-freeze protein was awarded the 2015 Commendation for Science and Technology Prize by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Development Category). This prize honors the achievements of those who have invented or researched 11 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 and developed groundbreaking work that is actually used or applied to improve people's lives, society and the economy. “I believe reducing food waste is a really worthwhile project for society. Shelf life will be extended dramatically if all kinds of food can be frozen. This will allow us to get closer to nearly zero waste.” (Atsushi Takaragawa) “A long time ago, people used to throw food out.” We believe the time will surely come when we will look back and say this. Kaneka Group will continue exploring and spreading the use of new anti-freeze ingredients. With the growing need for frozen foods, we are developing simple products for the expanding market Stakeholder Message The new frontier in Japanese confectionery. Freeze while still delicious; enjoy by natural thawing. Kagetsudo makes and sells Japanese confectionery, such as freshly pounded soft rice cakes and sweets using finely ground green tea powder, named after Sakai, the birthplace of the famous master of the Japanese tea ceremony, Sen no Rikyu. We sell soft rice cakes using Kaneka's anti-freeze ingredient. Japanese confectionery such as rice cakes are best eaten fresh, as their flavor quickly deteriorates. However, when they are frozen with the anti-freeze ingredient, they retain their freshly made flavor, and our customers can enjoy this fresh taste after the natural thawing process. And because it is a natural ingredient, I can proudly inform the customer, “This is the new frontier in Japanese confectionery.” Masahiro Maeda Kagetsudo Our first product using the anti-freeze ingredient is the One Charge S, which was 12 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 developed for athletes. We wanted to create a product that can easily supply energy to people participating in sport, who lead busy lives with work and so forth. With this product, people can stock up when they have time. While playing sport, they can then easily get their supply of energy just by thawing the product naturally. With such safe ingredients provided by Kaneka, we hope to devote all our efforts into expanding and introducing new rice cake desserts in the future. The rice cake dessert One Charge S 13 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special Feature II Health Care Over 30 years have passed since Kaneka Group started exporting fiber for hair accessory products. We are not just another raw materials manufacturer. We have built a relationship based on trust by being deeply involved with the market and offering products that fit our customers' needs. We have also been donating part of our sales to the school meal program of the World Food Programme (WFP) since 2013, thereby helping improve school attendance rates of children in Africa. Wigs Made of Kanekalon Kanekalon is a modacrylic fiber closely resembling the texture of human hair. Currently capturing the largest market share in Africa, wigs made of 100% Kanekalon are widely known for their high quality. Africaʼs Hair Goods Market Women in Nigeria and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally enjoy dressing up by adorning their heads with colorful cloths, or adding hair extensions and wigs. Kaneka Group has helped improve womenʼs quality of life through safe and high quality beauty products offered in partnership with wig manufactures, beauty salons and our women endusers. 14 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special Feature II Health Care Improving Womenʼs Quality of Life in Africa Kanekalon, a Brand for Women Exploring Their Future “When I was fitting a young girl with a wig for the first time in her life, her face lit up the moment she saw herself in the mirror, as if she was saying: I can't believe this is really me! It was also a wonderful moment for me. Kanekalon is a brand that makes a difference to women exploring their future.” (Yukiyo Oda, Technology Management Department, Kanekalon Division) Kanekalonʼs wigs can be styled in various ways, because they are light, easy to braid and is naturally beautiful. The hairs of African women are difficult to comb through because of their curls; wigs enable them to realize their gorgeous and elegant self. In the spirit of helping women working hard toward their dreams, we held the Miss Kanekalon beauty pageant in Nigeria in 2015. The winners, who were chosen based on the two selection criteria of inner and outer beauty, gave speeches about their ideas on African beauty and their dreams. “Forming the womenʼs self-identities is the same as creating a culture. In the future, we plan to expand the Miss Kanekalon beauty pageant to cover the whole of Africa.” (Koshi Imazu, Marketing Group II, Kanekalon Division) From among more than 3,000 applicants, the top three winners are expected to actively work in many fields as Kanekalon brand ambassadors for one year. Taking Root in African Countries, Supporting the Value Chain Kaneka Group started cultivating the African market more than 30 years ago, in the early 1980s. An employee, staying at New York for a business trip, saw a Senegalese buying large quantities of Kanekalon wigs, and was prompted to fly to Africa to study the market. Confirming that there was a potential market in Africa, we entered the Senegalese market together with our business partner in the U.S. Today, we cover the market over the whole of sub-Saharan Africa in partnership with various wig manufacturers. Kanekalonʼs business model is unique, as we have built our own value chain instead of just being upstream as a raw materials manufacturer. For hairdressers working in beauty salons, we hold training seminars on correctly assessing quality and new styling methods, and styling beauty pageants. For wig manufacturers, we have introduced new styles in the African market by providing advice on quality control and proposing plans for marketable products based Yukiyo Oda on our market research. Technology Management Department Kanekalon Division Supporting Job Creation Kaneka Group is joining hands with a group partner, a wig manufacture in Kenya, who has been assisting local hairdressing schools for many years. “To deliver the message of Kanekalonʼs quality and attractiveness to end-users, it is important to send out to the world more hairdressers with the right knowledge and skills. Training professionals in hairdressing schools also supports job creation and economic independence for the youth.” (Yukiyo Oda) 15 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Kaneka is also planning to start initiatives that are more deeply rooted in Africa as soon as possible. “In 2016, Kaneka Group will establish the Kaneka Africa Liaison Office. With the new base close to our partners and end-users, we can further collaborate with various stakeholders and capture the constantly changing trends in Africa to meet peopleʼs and community's various needs.” (Koshi Imazu) We will further strive to be trusted by our stakeholders through new job creation and other efforts for the community while strengthening our Koshi Imazu value chain by offering products and creating frameworks to meet local Marketing Group Ⅱ needs.

The FC Group of Companies provides safe and high-quality beauty to Ghanaian women through the management of beauty salons and hairdressing schools, and production and sales of related products. Also, the beauty salon association, which I chair, is composed of about 100 salons, and endeavors to maintain and improve the standards of the beauty industry. Kanekaʼs wigs do not just provide a variety of styles to Ghanaian women; Ms. Grace Amey-Obeng they also have a high-quality feel and do not easily fade and discolor under CEO, FC Group of Companies light.

Improving People's Living Standards Leads to Steady Business Growth As a WFP corporate partner, Kaneka supports the school meal program in Sierra Leone, one of Kanekalonʼs markets. By donating part of our sales of Kanekalon to this program, we supplied school meals to about 700,000 elementary school children in total from 2013 to 2015. We decided to continue our support for this program from 2016 until 2018. In areas where the elementary school dropout rates of girls are high, we are also providing rice and vegetable oil to girls whose families lack food. We received the following feedback from a child in the elementary school supported by the program: “(Because of the WFP school meal program,) I can eat breakfast and lunch at school every day. I can concentrate in class and actively take part in the discussions. My grades are also better and I donʼt get sick. I am thankful for the WFP and its supporters.” Enjoying lives at school, studying and gaining knowledge allows the children to dream of their future. Dreams support children to grow up to play key roles in helping develop a future society. As a WFP corporate partner, Kaneka will continue to help improve the living standards in communities we operate, which will lead to steady growth of our businesses. ©WFP/Rein Skullerud ©WFP ©Mayumi.Rui ©WFP/Rein Skullerud 17 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Special Feature II Health Care Sixth Stakeholder Dialogue (Summary) Kaneka holds dialogues with various stakeholders to exchange different perspectives and opinions to deepen mutual understanding, and collaborate by sharing common issues. On February 26, 2016, we held a dialogue with the Japan Association for the World Food Programme to discuss the importance of continuing support and their expectations from corporate support. The World Food Programme (WFP) The World Food Programme (WFP) is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, which is part of the United Nations, and is voluntary funded. The Japan Association for the World Food Programme is a certified nonprofit organization supporting it in Japan. WFP is in charge of logistics and telecommunication; in emergencies, aiming to bring ©WFP/Hukomat Khan food and other relief supplies to the field within 48 hours, with 70 airplanes, 5,000 trucks and 20 ships for this purpose. ©WFP/Lou Dematteis Solving social problems takes a long time. Continuous support is needed. WFP works toward a world without hunger in Africa and various other regions. Almost none of its programs end in a single year. We are truly grateful to Kaneka for its long-term commitment to help the communities of Sierra Leone for a Kunio Suzuki total of six years. Executive Officer From Kaneka Japan Association for We will continue our commitment to support the development the World Food Programme of African countries in our own way, which we believe will strengthen the communities' trust on us and support our business growth. We hope Kaneka will teach children about the situation on global food and hunger. At an event held by one of our sponsor companies in Japan, we conducted a food tasting of the corn-based porridge supplied to the local people in Africa. Through the event childrenʼs attitude toward food changed: They had more Yuji Kotera appreciation for their food. I believe talking about the global General Manager food situation at corporate events also educates the children Business Development Japan Association for about food. the World Food Programme From Kaneka At our 65th anniversary event held in 2014, we introduced the school meal program and conducted fund-raising activities. We will continue working on awareness programs in the future. Please read the Stakeholder Dialogue (Full Report) for more details. 18 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Stakeholder Dialogue (Full Report) As a WFP Corporate Partner Kaneka holds dialogues with various stakeholders to exchange different perspectives and opinions to deepen mutual understanding, and collaborates by sharing common issues. As the first partner of the WFP (see note 1) corporate program, we held a dialogue with the Japan Association for the World Food Programme (JAWFP) in February 26, 2016. Note 1: The World Food Programme (WFP) is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide. It is part of the United Nations and is voluntarily funded. The Japan Association for the World Food Programme is a certified nonprofit organization that supports the WFP in Japan. At the Japan Association for the World Food Programme, February 26, 2016 Participants Kunio Suzuki Yuji Kotera Minetoshi Marufuji Kiyotaka Kondo Mika Fujii Executive Officer General Manager Executive Officer Manager Assistant Manager Japan Association for Business Development General Manager CSR Administration Office Administration the World Food Japan Association for Division CSR Committee Office Programme the World Food Administration Office Kaneka Corporation CSR Committee Programme CSR Committee Kaneka Kaneka Corporation Corporation 19 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 “Solving social problems takes a long time. Continuous support is needed.” (Mr. Kunio Suzuki, JAWFP) • Please tell us why you started the WFP corporate program. Mr. Kotera:The WFP corporate program facilitates partnerships between companies and WFP, so that the companies can provide their continuous support over a period of three years. Although companies had occasionally offered us assistance, it was difficult to obtain continuous support. WFP works toward a world without hunger in Africa and various other regions. Almost none of its programs end in a single year. Continuous support enables people working on the ground to continue their initiatives with confidence. “Steady market growth requires improved quality of life of the people in the region.” (Minetoshi Marufuji, Kaneka) “Kaneka is committed to regional development in the long term.” (Mr. Kunio Suzuki, JAWFP) • Kaneka supported school meals in Sierra Leone from 2013 until 2015, and will give further support for another three years from 2016. What caused you to begin supporting this program? Marufuji: For more than 30 years, Kaneka has been expanding its Kanekalon wig business in Africa. The Kanekalon brand has gained an excellent reputation in sub-Saharan countries such as Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Ghana. We hope to continue steadily expanding our business in Africa in the future. However, this requires the improvement of living standards in African countries. Countries develop when their children, who are the country's future, attend school to learn then go on to enter the workforce. If we can contribute to achieving this in some way, then it will certainly be a welcome development for the people of Africa, and it will also be welcome for Kaneka because it will lead to market growth. Hence, we decided to join the WFP corporate program and support the school meal program. Considering that such programs will not be effective in only one year, we decided to provide school meal support in Sierra Leone for three years. Mr. Kotera:Education is the foundation of a country's development. Although impoverished families cannot provide money for school meals, parents will make their children go to school if the school provides them with free meals. The low school attendance rate of girls is another issue, because girls shoulder the burden of domestic work. In addition to school meals, we also implement a program that allows girls who reach a certain percentage of attendance to bring food home to their family. Through this program, the girls' school attendance rates 20 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 have greatly increased to almost the same rates as boys. By going to school, the children can study, acquire knowledge, and dream of their future. Dreams support children as they grow up. We have been continuing this initiative for many years with the hope of raising many such children. Marufuji: Although Kaneka conducts business based on the B2B model (business between companies), just ahead of B2B is the customer. As the world changes, we believe that we should always be aware of customer trends in our work. We think that engaging in these kinds of wide-reaching initiatives is important for us to know the hopes, desires and needs of consumers in the regions where we conduct business. Mr. Suzuki:Kaneka is committed to regional development in the long term because our business in this region does not end in one year. Through the school meal program, we are also attempting to improve communities in the long term, so I believer we have mutual needs. Kondo: Aside from the WFP corporate program, we also had the opportunity to support the WFP essay contest and aid the Ebola virus disease emergency system in 2014. In the same year, the Japan ambassador for WFP and Kaneka celebrity endorser, Ms. Kurara Chibana, came to give a talk and raise funds at a company event attended by employees and their families. From here on, we would like to focus on gaining the understanding of our stakeholders outside the company. “The ultimate goal of WFP is to end world hunger, and to end the need for WFP.” (Mr. Kunio Suzuki, JAWFP) • From the standpoint of collecting donations, what is WFP promoting? Mr. Kotera:WFP is still unfamiliar to many people; we have to keep sending out the message that we provide food and emergency assistance. Our strength is that all the aid we receive can be delivered to the destination without fail. In emergencies, WFP works with the aim of delivering food and other relief supplies to the field within 48 hours. Mr. Suzuki:Each division of the UN has its own role and responsibility. For example, after devastating earthquakes, the UNICEF (see note 2), as well as WFP, take action. In the case of refugees, the UNHCR (see note 3) takes action. WFP is in charge of transportation and communication; we go in first to establish a base, secure the means of communication, survey the situation, and dispatch information on the necessary food provisions, medicine, medical staff and so on. Mr. Kotera:In order to deliver the necessary relief supplies and such, we have 70 airplanes, 5,000 trucks and 20 ships. All of these are currently employed somewhere around the world, which is actually very sad. If WFP does not have to act, then it means we have a world where nobody lacks food. Mr. Suzuki:The ultimate goal of WFP is to end the need for WFP. Note 2: The United Nations Children's Fund Note 3: The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 21 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 “We hope Kaneka will teach children about global food and hunger.” (Mr. Yuji Kotera, JAWFP) • What do you require from corporations? Mr. Kotera:Mr. Kondo talked about this a while ago. You promoted WFP among your employees and their families in Kaneka's anniversary event two years ago. We request supporting companies to promote their participation in WFP activities at company events and other occasions. Fujii: Our employees' families, including mothers and children, participated in the anniversary event. When we described the current situation where many people are starving in Africa, most of the mothers told their children Itʼs important to remember that not all children in the world are happy. The children also gave us feedback such as I wish the children in Africa could go to school. I realized once more the importance of talking face-to-face, and how it stays in their hearts. Mr. Kotera:Last year we set up a WFP booth in the exhibition space of a wholesale food company that supports us. We held a food tasting event where we served the corn-based porridge supplied to the local people, and similar to Kaneka, I saw how the children's attitudes toward food changed. They had more appreciation for their food. The head of that company told me that, WFP not only provides food aid in developing countries, but it also educates people about food in countries like Japan. Based on that insight, we are now creating educational materials, because children's attitudes change if they learn about the global food situation at corporate events or while eating their school lunch. “I believe Kaneka is aiming to improve peopleʼs quality of life and bring happiness to humanity through its businesses.” (Mr. Kunio Suzuki, JAWFP) “With WFP and the regional community as our partners, we will continue to build a win-win-win relationship.” (Minetoshi Marufuji, Kaneka) • How do you rate Kaneka's initiatives? Mr. Suzuki:I believe Kaneka is aiming to improve peopleʼs quality of life and bring happiness to humanity through its businesses. Also, you clearly express that all the stakeholders should be able to enjoy the benefits. Your actions are highly convincing, and I feel that you have 22 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 drawn a persuasive framework for your stakeholders as well. Increasing agricultural production is a big issue, and Kaneka produces fertilizers. In Asia and Africa in particular, developing self-reliance in agricultural production gives local people a chance to escape starvation. We are truly grateful to Kaneka for its desire for people living where it operates to enjoy their lives, its wish to move forward together, and for its long-term commitment to helping the communities of Sierra Leone for a total of six years. Marufuji: In Kaneka's corporate philosophy, we have stated our commitment to contribute to the global environmental issues and upgrading the quality of life. It is important that rather than Kaneka, the local people themselves feel that their quality of life has improved. This means improvements in the quality of their clothes, food and housing. We will patiently work on the various issues with the power of science and carry out our management philosophy. We also believe that our capability is greater than you imagine. It is difficult for us, for example, to directly address the issue of food for children. However, by partnering with WFP and lending our support, we can build a win-win-win relationship together with local communities. 23 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Communication Is Our Start Line True to our goal of leveraging science to make your dreams happen we at the Kaneka Group have strived to fulfill people's dreams through our diverse range of businesses. In the process, we highly value communication with all our stakeholders. Through proactive discussions, we draw out people's desires and needs to provide them with new values. In this article, we present some of our achievements along with the initiatives to make them possible. Dream 1: Accelerate R&D to Enable Practical Use of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy! Centers Integrating R&D Divisions In November 2015, Kaneka Group set up R&D centers for regenerative medicine and cell therapy in the Kobe MI R&D Center and Kobe International Business Center. Both centers are now fully operational, and the previously scattered R&D divisions have been integrated to allow us to conduct work all the way from basic research to commercialization. Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy Project At the R&D centers, we focus our work on cell preparation for disease treatment, drug discovery technologies using induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and devices for cell separation and cell culture. Situated at the hub of regenerative medicine and cell therapy, we aim to contribute to healthcare and medicine in the future by developing technologies in collaboration with RIKEN and other related medical institutions. Directly overseen by Kaneka's president, the Regenerative Medicine and Cell Therapy Project was launched in April 2016 to further speed up our activities. Kaneka has a wealth of knowledge cultivated from our business in pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We will continue our efforts to help advance regenerative medicine by developing and applying our life science technologies.

Materials for the Net Zero Energy House To reduce CO2 emissions from homes, the Japanese government is promoting the net zero energy house (ZEH), with a vision to make it the standard for newly built houses by 2020. Kaneka manufactures and sells diverse materials that are necessary for ZEHs. 24 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Our ZEH Solution as a Measure to Address Climate Change Kaneka manufactures and sells materials necessary for ZEHs, such as thermal insulators and photovoltaic modules, as well as organic EL lighting. We also offer the Solar Circuit construction method, which has superior environmental performance, and in fiscal 2016, we began selling storage batteries for residential use. We also launched the cross-divisional J-Project in 2015, and actively develop Group-wide solutions. ZEH design entails expertise and complicated documentation, which is why it is not making headway in the housing industry. Kaneka began offering specific ZEH solutions for the housing industry. We believe that our efforts to help build more ZEHs will lead to less CO2 emissions, which will benefit society. Exhibit at the Eco House and Eco Building Expo, March Jun Ikegami 2016 Administration of J-Project Corporate Planning Department Kaneka products utilized in ZEH Dream 3: Do You Have any Effective Fertilizers for Agricultural Produce? Development of a New High-Performance Fertilizer KANEKA PEPTIDE is a new high-performance fertilizer that integrates various Kaneka technologies. With the anticipated food shortage from the growing global population, Kaneka Group has set food production support as one of its key strategic domains. Testing KANEKA PEPTIDE Around the World in All Kinds of Climates, Crops and Soils A KANEKA PEPTIDE pilot study conducted in Hebei Province, China enabled many farmers to experience its effectiveness first-hand. Conventional chemical fertilizers require application by the ton, while overuse degrades the soil. In contrast, environmentally conscious KANEKA PEPTIDE does not leave unnecessary residue in the soil. In China, we are promoting its use with the recognition and support of the relevant government authorities in charge of fertilizer registration. KANEKA PEPTIDE's success will not only bring higher income to farmers, it will also mean more food supply to communities experiencing food shortages. Promoting its use with confidence, I also hope to contribute to the development of my home country, China.

Beauty, Health and Independence to Women in Africa Kaneka Group has been operating the Kanekalon wig business in the African market for more than 30 years. We have achieved a high brand value by providing safe beauty products in partnership with wig manufacturers, beauty salons and female consumers. Providing High Value to Our Stakeholders in Beauty Product Market In the African market where flammable, cheap and inferior wig products are sold, Kaneka Group has been providing safe beauty products while strengthening relationships with wig manufacturers, local beauty salons and female consumers. Ms. Grace Amey-Obeng (photo center), president of the Professional Cosmetologists and Beauticians Association of Ghana, is involved with evaluation of our products. Kanekalon's ideal is to provide safe and high-quality beauty to women. Collaborating with associations of beauty salons, as well as our direct customers such as wig makers, we stay abreast of market needs and find difficulties that even consumers do not realize from our perspective as a maker. Our goal is to serve Africa by developing higher quality products.

Safety and Disaster Preparedness 28 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 CSR Topics 2015 Report on the Kaneka Group's CSR initiatives in fiscal 2015. Topics 01: Tohoku Recovery Support Supplying Polystyrene Foam to Reconstruct Roads in Tohoku Soil Blocks work behind the scenes. Although unseen, they support roads and reclaimed land as embankment material Kazuhiko Kurobe Soil Environment Division Kaneka Kentech Co., Ltd. In areas affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku, Japan, many roads are still waiting to be restored. In such cases, it is important to quickly restore strong, resilient roads economically. Kaneka Kentech Co., Ltd. supplies Soil Blocks to these road reconstruction projects. Soil Blocks are large polystyrene foam blocks made for civil engineering works. They are water resistant and strong enough to withstand structural loads while being light, and are particularly effective for embankment works on soft ground and steep slopes. Formed by expanding 1-mm diameter particles to 50 times their size, they are also environmentally friendly. With the use of lightweight Soil Blocks, road subsidence due to heavy weight can be avoided. They are also easy to work with, making it possible to shorten the construction period. In the long term, Soil Blocks enable an economical 3 construction method by saving a lot of time and effort for repair. We have supplied Soil Blocks for up to 100,000 m of reconstructed roads, particularly those on soft ground. Road reconstruction helps disaster-affected areas by providing routes for emergency evacuation and goods transport, and creating tourist routes. Through such products and technology, we look forward to contributing more to the recovery efforts. Topics 02: Acting on Climate Change Group of Materials Help Lighten Vehicles The red areas show where Kaneka products are used (bumper, dashboard and seat core material) 29 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Amid the trend for tackling climate change, automakers' efforts to reduce vehicle weight are increasing as they strive to cut CO2 emissions by improving fuel efficiency. The use of plastics for auto parts is one such example. Kaneka's resin products have been used to make plastic for various auto parts because of their exceptional heat resistance, strength and moldability. Recently, they have also been noted as excellent lightweight materials. For example, the engineering resin for injection molding, Kaneka Hyperite JP, is used widely for its low liner thermal expansion (elasticity) properties and dimensional stability to lighten the exterior parts such as slide rail covers, rear spoilers and pillar garnish. Also, a molding method for polypropylene foam made using the bead method, Eperan PP, was successfully developed to achieve high strength while being lightweight, and is now used for lighter interior seats. We also developed a modifier to enhance the toughness of epoxy resin, Kane Ace MX, and other modifier to improve the moldability of polypropylene-based resin for further lighten vehicles. In January 2016, we showcased our unique technological solutions at the Automotive Lightweight Technology Expo in Japan. We will continue the material development to satisfy the sophisticated needs of customers and to contribute to the sustainable society. Topics 03: Support for Raising the Next Generation Participating in the 2015 Children's Chemistry Show Letting children experience the wonders of science Children make their one and only eraser in the world, listening closely to the explanation of the staff The Childrenʼs Chemistry Show, a Chemistry Day event for experimenting with chemistry, was held at the Kyocera Dome in Osaka on October 24 and 25, 2015, and was sponsored by the Dream Chemistry 21 Committee.Chemistry Week celebrations are held annually during the week of October 23, the date of Chemistry Day, which commemorates the Avogadro constant (see note 1). This was the third show held in the Kansai region, with the first two shows held in 2014. Around 4,300 people attended the two-day event, with approximately 330 children visiting Kaneka's booth for eraser making. The children were given 25 minutes each to experiment with creating their one and only eraser in the world in three different colors. Drawing on the assistance from the staff, the children and their parents were absorbed in making their very own eraser. We will continue to show children the power of science through the wonders of chemistry. We look forward to continuing our support for educating the next generation at the next Childrenʼs Chemistry Show to be held in Kansai in fiscal 2016.

In support of this trend, in April 2015, Consumer Affairs Agency, Government of Japan introduced a new labelling system for Foods with Function Claims (FFC), in addition to the existing programs for Foods for Specified Health Uses and Foods with Nutrient Function Claims. In September 2015, Your Health Care Co., Ltd., a Group company, began mail-order sales of Glavonoid as a Foods with Function Claims product. Glavonoid is a supplement containing fat-soluble polyphenols derived from licorice root, extracted using our own unique technology, to produce the functional food item licorice extract containing 3% Glabridin (product name: Kaneka Glavonoid). This product helps consumers maintain a healthy lifestyle; it has been scientifically demonstrated to assist with improvements in BMI (see note 2) by reducing excess visceral fat, which is known to contribute to various diseases. As a mail-order sales company of dietary supplements such as reduced foam of coenzyme Q10, Your Health Care aims to further promote a healthy society in the future by increasing its product line of scientifically reliable FFC products. Note 2: Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value used to indicate the degree of obesity: BMI = (body weight [in kg]) ÷ (height [in m])² The Japan Society for the Study of Obesity defines a standard BMI as being between 18.5 ~ 25, with a value of 25 or higher indicating obesity. TOPICS 05: Helping Innovate Digital Device Technology Polyimide Film Wins the 47th Ichimura Prize Kaneka Group conducts R&D on materials to meet the growing need for enhanced performance and smaller and slimmer information devices arising from the evolution of electronic products. One such material is our ultra-heat-resistant polyimide film, Pixeo, which was developed using our unique manufacturing process. Widely used primarily in flexible printed circuit boards (FPC) for smartphones and tablets, it is more reliable than previous FPC and makes slimmer devices possible. The three engineers involved in developing Pixeo were awarded the 47th Ichimura Prize in Industry from the New Technology Development Foundation (see note 3), in recognition of their development of a 31 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 groundbreaking technology and its commercial success. In addition, the product was developed using Pixeo and Apical, with the European High-performance film Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) from Kaneka and then Kaneka boasting top High-Tech Materials, Inc. receiving the 61st Award of the Society of performance in heat Polymer Science, Japan. (400℃) and cold As one of our key strategic domains, we will continue actively pursuing (-180℃) resistance research and product development related to the information and among commercially available plastic films communications field. Note 3: The Ichimura Prize is awarded to technological developers for achievement in developing outstanding technology in Japan that contributes to the advancement of science and technology, industrial growth, improving culture and national welfare and safety. TOPICS 06: Providing Global Product Technology Reflecting Local Needs Establishing a Three-Hub Structure from America and Asia to Europe Kaneka Group recognizes the importance of global businesses rooted in local communities. In October 2015, the Group established Kaneka Europe Holding Company N.V. in the Belgian capital of Brussels, as its regional hub for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The hub is mainly engaged in studying and planning regional business strategies, R&D, human resources, legal affairs and governance, and to enhance those functions and promote our business operations in the region. Before this, we have established Kaneka Americas Holding, Inc. in the U.S. and Kaneka Asia Co., Ltd. in China as regional hubs in 2012. With this current addition in Europe, we now have a three-hub global structure. This brings us steadily closer to realizing our Basic CSR Policy to strive to fully understand the cultural backgrounds, manners and Aiming to increase sales in the Middle East customs of the countries and regions where we do business as a means and Africa with regional hub establishment of actively contributing to local societies and communities. TOPICS 07: Toward a Safe Manufacturing Site Expanding Sensory Learning to Group Companies in China Kaneka Eperan (Suzhou) employees learn first hand HiHua Fiber employees experience the danger of the danger of an accident on a device to experience falling a hand becoming caught 32 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Sensory learning is a safety-training program to improve danger sensitivity by safely experiencing accidents and hazards in the workplace. The danger of accidents and hazards are physically felt by trainees through simulating a hand accident using a gloved dummy arm at the end of a stick or showing experiments on accident mechanisms of dust particle explosions. From 2015, we began sensory learning at three company sites in China: HiHua Fiber Co., Ltd., Kaneka Eperan (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., and Kaneka (Foshan) High Performance Materials Co., Ltd. It deeply impressed in me that 'always' staying safe is important. Carelessness is the enemy of safety. (Shu Jing, HiHua Fiber) I learned the importance of keeping safe. (Ya Yun Feng, Kaneka (Foshan)) Safety means protecting yourself. Avoiding injuries due to inattentiveness means protecting the company. (Niu En Ling, Kaneka Eperan (Suzhou)) Repeated training is important to improve and maintain safety consciousness. We are committed to creating a culture of safety by continuous sensory learning in the future. 33 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Kaneka Group's corporate philosophy, as expressed in the Declaration of Kaneka United is dedicated to breaking fresh ground for the future and tie in to explore New Values. We are also committed to challenge the environmental issues of our planet and contribute to upgrade the quality of life. In keeping with these ideals, we continually strive to be a global corporate citizen for growth and innovation through providing valuable products, technologies and services. Briefing sessions were held throughout Japan to share information from our CSR Report 2015 and Employee Handbook on Corporate Social Responsibility: Practical Guide. In fiscal 2015, sessions were held at 16 operation sites of six companies.

Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Corporate Governance Structure Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ (1) Basic Principles of Corporate Governance The Board of Directors, on behalf of the shareholders, is responsible for the company's sustainable growth and for increasing corporate value in the medium to long term through efficient and effective corporate governance. The Board of Directors exercises its oversight functions on overall management to ensure fairness and transparency, as well as appoint management positions, evaluate and determine remuneration, evaluate serious risks and determine strategies to counter them, and make the best decisions on important business operations. (2) Corporate Governance Structure We currently have two independent external directors and two independent external auditors. Since both the overseeing of business operations by the Board of Directors and auditing by the Board of Auditors are functioning well, Kaneka has chosen to be a Company with Board of Auditors under the Companies Act. The Board of Directors makes resolutions on important matters related to the management of the Kaneka Group after deliberation by the Management Committee, which includes the president. There are at most 13 board members. Of these, two are independent external directors to strengthen the oversight function. Directors serve for a period of one year to clearly define management responsibilities. (3) Internal Audit Auditors and the Board of Auditors, on behalf of the shareholders, are responsible for ensuring healthy and sustainable corporate growth, and for establishing a structure with good corporate governance that can gain social trust by checking on the performance of directors in regard to their duties. The Board of Auditors comprises four members, two of whom are independent external auditors in principle, and performs audits in coordination with the Accounting Auditor and the CSR Division's Internal Control Department. Auditors are given a space to periodically exchange views with the president, and monitor the state of business operations at least once a year, by attending key meetings of the Board of Directors and those of the Management Committee, which decides on the implementation of important matters, and division head meetings. Moreover, independent external director's meetings are held and an appointment and remuneration advisory committee will be created as an ad-hoc committee to make full use of independent external directors. Kaneka has adopted the executive officer system to separate the oversight function of directors from the implementation function of business operations, which also facilitates decision-making and clearly defines roles. The Board of Directors decides on key management strategies and business operations of the entire Kaneka Group, while executive officers handle business operations in their respective areas of responsibility. Division heads, as well as executive officers appointed by the Board of Directors, exercise extensive authority over daily 41 operations. However, directors handle several divisions to ensure overall coordination and hold monthly division head meetings to enable the directors and auditors to directly hear progress reports from each division head. The Internal Control Department of CSR Division evaluates the eﬀectiveness of internal control and conducts an internal audit. (4) Corporate Governance and CSR Chaired by the president, the CSR Committee was established to ensure that we adhere to laws and regulations, are accountable to our stakeholders, and are engaged in activities that contribute to sustainable social progress. The CSR Division was created in April 2015 as a division that directly reports to the president to reinforce CSR initiatives. ■ Corporate Governance Structure Compliance Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Compliance with relevant laws and regulations is important to our corporate management as well as to all directors and employees at the Kaneka Group. Our corporate Intranet provides ready access to our Compliance Guidebook, which provides a clear explanation of our Ethical Code of Conduct as well as the laws and regulations to be observed by all of our directors and employees. Additionally, a variety of training sessions and meetings, and activities of the Compliance Subcommittee ensure that we strictly adhere to our compliance policies. The compliance online course for all employees, launched in 2014, was also conducted during ﬁscal 2015, and in ﬁscal 2016 it will be extended to Group companies in Japan. Training sessions on the Antimonopoly Act are conducted KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 regularly with all of our managerial officers involved in sales, purchasing, and business development, all of whom are required to submit a pledge. Additionally, CSR evaluation audits were carried out for all Group companies in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. We also started site visits of Group companies in Japan for antitrust-related training. Moreover, we set up compliance consultation hotlines both internally and with outside law firms in order to answer inquiries from those within the Group. We strive to respond quickly to provide a rapid resolution to any concerns that may arise. A compliance training session 43 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Basic Policy on Our Internal Control System Systems for ensuring proper execution of duties by the Board of Directors and employees adherence with laws, regulations and articles of incorporation. (1) Appointment of a minimum of two independent external directors to strengthen the supervisory function of the Board of Directors. (2) Establishment of an Appointment and Remuneration Advisory Committee as an advisory committee to the Board of Directors in order to ensure sound corporate governance practices. (3) Facilitation of an independent external director's meeting, comprised of independent external directors and independent external auditors, to discuss corporate governance-related matters, and to report to the Chair of the Board of Directors any issues and improvement measures. (4) Establishment of the CSR Committee, chaired by the president, to lead our CSR efforts and Responsible Care activities. (5) General responsibility of the Compliance Subcommittee, which falls under the CSR Committee, to oversee the Group's corporate ethics and compliance programs and procedures; including coordinating programs; monitoring progress; verifying business compliance, establishing and operating appropriate consultation and creating a whistleblowing mechanism. (6) Consolidation of special bodies to oversee programs to address company-wide issues, including the subcommittees under the CSR Committee, namely the Safety & Human Health Subcommittee, the Earth Environment Subcommittee, and the Product Safety Subcommittee. (7) Relevant internal regulations to ensure compliance with laws; and education and training programs, self-checks and audits to ensure such regulations are fully understood and complied with. (8) Implementation of strict measures to ensure that the Group as a whole has absolutely no relationship with any anti-social elements, as well as to reject any illegal or improper demands. In addition, we established an in-house office that is responsible for the collection and management of relevant information and that cooperates with external organizations, including the police, to undertake and strengthen measures to prevent the influence of any anti-social elements. (9) Undertaking of the necessary monitoring activities by the Internal Control Department to ensure the reliability of financial reporting, as well as put in place internal controls over financial reporting. 44 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Promoting CSR Kaneka Group established a CSR Committee to promote the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities. This committee, chaired by the president, oversees four subcommittees: the Safety & Human Health Subcommittee, the Earth Environment Subcommittee, the Product Safety Subcommittee and the Compliance Subcommittee. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Implementing CSR Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In order to strengthen its organizational problem-solving capacities related to CSR matters, Kaneka Group created the CSR Committee in March 2009. The CSR Committee determines and revises the basic policies that provide direction for the Group to fulfill its responsibility as a good corporate citizen. The Committee also develops comprehensive strategic plans and produces action plans for CSR activities, and assesses their implementation status. In fiscal 2015 the CSR Committee met twice, and the Safety and Human Health subcommittee once, and each of the Earth Environment, Product Safety, and the Compliance Subcommittees twice. ■ CSR Structure 45 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 CSR Inspections Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To ensure that the Kaneka Group is fully in conformance with the relevant laws and regulations, as well to pursue increased performance for occupational safety and health, CSR safety and quality inspections by the CSR Inspection Committee are conducted every year at all four parent plants, and once every two years at all Group companies around the world. In fiscal 2015, we conducted CSR safety and quality inspections focusing on conformity with applicable regulations, countermeasures against major risks and prevention of accidents and hazards, and the status of change management frameworks at all four parent plants and one research center, 16 sites of 16 Group companies in Japan, and at six sites of six Group companies outside Japan. In addition, we conducted CSR evaluation audits to assess assess compliance with labor laws (including regulations for HR management) for 43 Group companies in Japan. We also carried out audits relating to competition laws including the Antimonopoly Act for all of the business operations divisions, 24 Group companies in Japan and four outside Japan. We will continue to conduct such audits to improve our CSR performance. CSR Education Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We at Kaneka conduct CSR trainings for employees at all levels, based on our CSR Handbooks covering fundamental and practical aspects. In fiscal 2015, training sessions were held twice for new employees and twice for mid-career entrants, as well as one time each for those newly promoted to managerial and supervising positions. We also held 17 sessions to explain our CSR activities, including at meetings of Group company presidents and at briefing sessions held for newly appointed corporate heads and new employees at Group companies in Japan. We strive to fulfill our responsibility and be a good member of the local community by having everyone in our Group consciously implement CSR activities through our businesses. Booklet on Community Initiatives Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We at the Kaneka Group place great importance on our outreach and communications activities. As part of such efforts, we issued a booklet that highlights our community initiatives as a good corporate citizen. Distributing these booklets mainly to our external stakeholders will promote a greater appreciation and understanding of our Group and help improve our corporate brand. Booklet on Kaneka Group Community Initiatives 46 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 CSR Briefings (For Kaneka and Group companies in Japan) Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ As part of our ongoing education activities starting in fiscal 2014, CSR Briefing sessions were held for employees of Kaneka and Group companies in Japan using our CSR Report 2015 and the CSR Handbook: Practical Guide in fiscal 2015 at six companies in a total of 16 locations. These sessions helped to assure better understanding of top commitment, our long-term vision, the Declaration of Kaneka United, our health, safety and environmental initiatives, and our goals for our CSR activities. 320 people participated in these sessions. Thus far, such sessions have cumulatively reached 30% of Group companies in Japan. ■ Fiscal 2015 CSR Briefings for Group companies in Japan Date Company Name Number of Participants November 10, Kaneka Foods Manufacturing Corporation 28 (president and employees) 2015 Ako Second Plant, Osaka Synthetic Chemical 31 (plant manager and November 19 Laboratories, Inc. employees) 30 (plant manager and November 20 Yanahara Plant employees) November 26 Nishinomiya Headquarters 54 (president and employees) December 8 Taiyo Yushi Corporation 38 (president and employees) January 14, 2016 Kaneka Medix Corporation (Tokyo, Kanagawa) 24 (employees) January 15 Nagashima Shokuhin Co., Ltd. 58 (employees) Kaneka Kentech Co., Ltd.

The UN Global Compact is a voluntary code of conduct through which the top management of signatory companies commit themselves to take action aimed at achieving ten principles in the four areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment, and Anti-Corruption. Starting in fiscal 2015, the Group has participated in the working groups of the Global Compact, which enables us to gather a wealth of information about CSR for our new initiatives through enhanced communication with other companies. As a group with a global network, we actively share information about our commitment to global sustainable growth as a responsible corporate citizen with our stakeholders and the international community. ■ United Nations Global Compactʼs Ten Principles Area Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of Human internationally proclaimed human rights; and Rights 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Labour 5 the effective abolition of child labour; and 6 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental Environment responsibility; and 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, Corruption including extortion and bribery. The United Nations Global Compact Learning Forum 48 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Promoting and Implementing Responsible Care Responsible Care is important to the Kaneka Group. We have put in place policies governing safety and Responsible Care, as well as internal regulations to ensure proper implementation of the Responsible Care approach. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Group Management Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ All members of the Kaneka Group share a commitment to Responsible Care (RC) (see note 1), and all of our activities are managed in keeping with Responsible Care principles. We carry out CSR safety and quality inspections for all Group companies in and outside Japan. These address considerations related to environmental protection, occupational health and safety, product safety and quality assurance, and compliance. We also actively monitor the progress of implementation of the relevant policies and actions. Kanekaʼs Environmental Health and Safety Management Regulations and Quality Management Regulations clearly define the actions and responsibilities expected from Group companies. Employees of Group companies are urged to be proactive, and together we endeavor to reduce the environmental impact and risks of occupational accidents, as well as to improve our capacity to respond to natural disasters or product-related accidents that may occur. Note 1: Responsible Care refers to actions undertaken on a voluntary basis by the chemical industry to promote improvements in aspects of environmental, safety, and health performance, throughout the entire process from the development of chemical products to their manufacture, usage and disposal. The initiatives and achievements are communicated to the public to raise public confidence in their operations. Kaneka has been actively promoting this approach since 1995 as a founding member of the Japan Responsible Care Council (which merged with the Japan Chemical Industry Association in fiscal 2012). Basic Policies for Responsible Care Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In keeping with our corporate philosophy, we at the Kaneka strive to ensure the conservation of resources and reduce environmental impact throughout the entire product lifecycle, while working to help realize the sustainable development and prosperity of society. ■ Basic Policies for Responsible Care Protect the natural ecosystem and reduce environmental impact Focusing on the impact of corporate activities on the global environment and the ecosystem, we 1 endeavor to reduce environmental impact and promote resource conservation and energy saving throughout the lifecycle of products. 2 Offer safe products and information We endeavor to offer products that are safe to distribute and use, and to provide adequate information on the products such as instructions on how to use and handle products correctly. 49 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Develop products and technologies in consideration of the environment and safety Upon the development of new products, we give consideration to the environment and safety 3 throughout the lifecycle of the products to the greatest extent possible, and endeavor to develop products and technologies with low environmental impact. Reduce waste and promote the recycling of plastics We reduce waste associated with manufacturing and its processes. We actively develop technologies 4 for the adequate disposal or recycling of plastic waste concerning our products in cooperation with relevant industries, and endeavor to dispose of and recycle waste in a proper manner. Enhance process safety, disaster-prevention, and occupational safety and health Safety and disaster prevention constitute the foundations of the local communityʼs trust, and 5 occupational health and safety are issues that need to be fulfilled by chemical companies. We persistently strive to make improvements in these areas. Win public confidence From the management to every employee, all our members shall act in compliance with laws, 6 regulations, standards, etc. relating to environment and safety both at home and abroad. Our approach to Responsible Care as such shall be publicized accurately to the public, in hope of rightfully gaining public recognition and confidence. Implementing Responsible Care Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ At Kaneka, we carry out a range of Responsible Care activities to further promote measures that can be taken by the chemical industry to protect human health and safety and preserve the environment. To ensure progress with respect to the six RC codes (environmental protection, process safety and disaster prevention, occupational safety and health, chemicals and product safety, distribution safety, and interaction/communication with the public), Kaneka has set up a system to guide its initiatives. The CSR Committee, chaired by the president and its four subcommittees, provides venues for the consideration and establishment of policies governing the operations of the Kaneka Group as a whole, as well as for monitoring related progress. Such venues are also used for information sharing and discussions to solve problems. Responsible Care Education Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ At Kaneka, we conduct Responsible Care education activities in a thorough manner tailored to each of our facilities and employees' areas of responsibility. RC training is provided to staff members in their third year and to newly promoted executives, in order to deepen their understanding of, and to enable them to act on, our company's activities related to the RC codes: such as environmental protection; process safety and disaster prevention; occupational safety and health; and chemicals and product safety. 50 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Kaneka Group Overview / Registered Trademarks and Other Trademarks for Kaneka Group Products Kaneka Group Profile ■ Corporate Profile Name KANEKA CORPORATION Head Office Osaka Head Office 2-3-18, Nakanoshima, Kita-ku, Osaka 530-8288, Japan Tel: +81-6-6226-5050 Fax: +81-6-6226-5037 Tokyo Head Office 1-12-32, Akasaka, Minato-ku,Tokyo 107-6028, Japan Tel: +81-3-5574-8000 Fax: +81-3-5574-8121 Date of Establishment September 1, 1949 Paid-in Capital 33,046 million yen (as of March 31, 2016) Facilities in Japan Sales Office Nagoya Plants Takasago (Hyogo Prefecture) Osaka (Osaka Prefecture) Shiga (Shiga Prefecture) Kashima (Ibaraki Prefecture) Research Institutes Frontier Materials Development Laboratories, Medical Device Development Laboratories, Biotechnology Development Laboratories, Photovoltaic & Thin-Film Device Research Laboratories, Molding & Processing Development Center, Thin-Film Process Technology Development Center, and Process Technology Laboratories Overseas Facilities U.S.A., Belgium, Singapore, Malaysia, China, India, Taiwan, Korea, Australia, Brazil, and others Kaneka Group 104 subsidiaries (including 40 (in Japan) and 35 (outside Japan) consolidated subsidiaries) 51 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Net Sales (Consolidated) ■ Net Income (Consolidated) ■ Number of Employees (Consolidated) *From fiscal 2014, we changed the basis on which we calculate the number of employees at Group companies (excluding temporary employees). ■ Consolidated Sales by Business Segment ■ Consolidated Overseas Sales by Area (Fiscal 2015) (Fiscal 2015) Kaneka Group Product Registered Trademarks and Other Trademarks The following product names in the CSR Report 2016 are registered trademarks of the Company or Group.

We fulfill our corporate social responsibilities by considering the environment at every stage of our business activities and working to reduce environmental impacts̶not only in the manufacturing-related functions such as raw materials procurement, manufacturing, and transportation, but also in our office operations. In fiscal 2015, Kaneka generated 4.7 tons of final landfill waste, or 0.007% of the 67,856 tons of total waste generated, which means we have achieved zero emissions for ten consecutive years. Material Balance in Production Environmental Accounting Addressing Climate Change Activities Environmental Management Reducing Waste and Preventing Reducing Chemical Substance Systems Pollution Discharge Biodiversity Conservation 56 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Material Balance in Production Activities Kaneka Groupʼs fiscal 2015 energy and resource inputs, as well as material outputs through emissions and products, are listed below. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ 57 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Environmental Accounting We calculate the environmental costs (investments and expenditures) and benefits (material quantities), as well as economic impacts (in monetary units) of environmental measures on a consolidated basis for parent and group companies in Japan. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Results of Environmental Accounting for Fiscal 2015 Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Compared to the previous fiscal year, environmental costs (for investments) declined by about 40 million yen and 30 million yen, respectively, for pollution prevention and resource recycling. Environmental costs (for expenditures) declined by about 240 million yen and 80 million yen, respectively, for pollution prevention and resource recycling, but increased by about 310 million yen for research and development. Regarding the economic impacts of environmental measures, we had a cost reduction of approximately 300 million yen due to better resource efficiency (output per unit of input) and a cost reduction of about 320 million yen due to energy conservation and other savings. Note: These calculations are based on the 2005 edition of Environmental Accounting Guidelines by Japan's Ministry of the Environment and other reference materials, with partial modifications. ■ Environmental Costs Millions of yen Fiscal 2015 Cost Classifications Main Efforts Investments Expenditure Business Area 1,054 5,175 1.

Investments related to the environment in fiscal 2015 totaled about 750 million yen, of which 44.8% was for air quality, 23.8% for the work environment, 19.6% for water quality, 6.8% for noise, 2.7% for dust, and 2.3% for odors. Cumulative environmental investments come to about 12.8 billion yen during the 16 years since fiscal 2000, with the most being for air quality (44%), followed by water quality (22%), and the work environment (17%). We will continue to invest proactively to maintain and improve the environment. 59 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Environmental Investments in Fiscal 2015 ■ Cumulative Environmental Investments 60 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Addressing Climate Change We are undertaking efforts to address climate change, with the Earth Environment Subcommittee established under the CSR Committee, and the Energy Officers Conference in charge of implementation. We are working to conserve energy and to reduce carbon intensity through various measures, for example by utilizing our own environmental capital investment program. We are also using carbon life cycle analysis (cLCA), which involves calculating a product's contribution to carbon dioxide emission reductions by quantitatively assessing the emissions throughout the product lifecycle and making a comparison with similar products. We also calculate our indirect carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 3) through the supply chain. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Energy Conservation Efforts Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Our efforts at the Kaneka Group to address climate change include energy conservation, using energy intensity index (see note 1) as an indicator for management. The energy intensity index of all parent plants in fiscal 2015 was 83.5, a reduction of 2.9% from the previous fiscal year due to factors such as energy conservation activities and differences in the product mix. Annual reduction over the five years was 1.5% on average, which means we met our target. Non-consolidated energy consumption (see note 2) was 429,000 kiloliters, a decrease of 4.9% from the previous fiscal year. Note: 1. Energy intensity index is a numeral value calculated by dividing the energy used in manufacturing (at all our parent plants) by the active mass and indexing it against the baseline year of fiscal 1990 as 100. 2. This energy consumption is the total for Kaneka alone (manufacturing plants and other facilities), with the boundaries being consistent with the Act on the Rational Use of Energy and the Action Plan for a Low Carbon Society prepared by the Japan Chemical Industry Association. ■ Energy Consumption (Crude Oil Equivalents) and Energy Intensity 61 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Initiatives to Cut Carbon Intensity Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ At Kaneka, we are working to reduce carbon intensity, using a carbon intensity index (see note 3) as an indicator for management, based on carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption associated with production activities. The carbon intensity index of all parent plants was 77.8 in fiscal 2015, so we achieved our target of 77.8 for the year, based on a target of 74 for fiscal 2020. Non-consolidated carbon dioxide emissions (see note 4) decreased by 2.9% from the previous fiscal year to 1,123,000 tons. Main factors in the decrease included activities to reduce carbon intensity and differences in the product mix. Note: 3. The carbon intensity index is calculated as carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption in production activities divided by activity volume, with the index set at 100 in the base year of fiscal 1990 (using fixed numbers for Kaneka). It helps in the visualization of the impact of our activities, and was used to establish targets for fiscal 2020. 4. Carbon dioxide emissions are calculated as prescribed by the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. Since last year's report, the carbon dioxide emissions from purchased electricity are calculated using actual emission coefficients, and as with energy the figure is a non-consolidated total for Kaneka. ■ CO2 Emissions from Energy Consumption and Carbon Intensity Other greenhouse gases on a non-consolidated basis include carbon dioxide, methane, and dinitrogen monoxide from non-energy sources. Emission volumes are calculated in keeping with the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. Investments in Energy-Efficient Facilities Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To continue reducing energy intensity and carbon intensity, we are implementing our own environmental capital investment program (with an annual budget of 200 million yen for small and medium investments that have a relatively long payback period), through activities in three areas (addressing climate change, efficient use of resources, and reducing environmental impacts) that are priorities in Kanekaʼs environmental management program. In fiscal 2015 we continued allocating a large portion of this fund to projects that address climate change, including broader initiatives such as on visualizing energy consumption. Going forward we will continue to use this investment program for activities to reduce energy intensity and carbon intensity. 62 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Results of Our Own Environmental Capital Investment Program Fiscal Year Investments Number Reduced CO2 Emission 2011 \200 million 30 2,027 tons-CO2 per year 2012 \200 million 19 1,929 tons-CO2 per year 2013 \200 million 29 1,993 tons-CO2 per year 2014 \200 million 37 1,644 tons-CO2 per year 2015 \200 million 22 1,435 tons-CO2 per year Energy-Efficiency Initiatives in Logistics Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To achieve an annual 1% reduction in energy intensity as a specified consigner under the amended Act on Rational Use of Energy, in fiscal 2015 we continued working plant by plant on the theme of new reductions of energy intensity, with a focus on modal shifts and improved cargo load ratios. In fiscal 2015 we worked to improve cargo load ratios and greater use of the Japan Freight Railway Company, leading to an 11.1% decrease in energy intensity compared to fiscal 2014, but carbon dioxide emissions only decreased by 1,000 tons, due to an increase in the distance of coastal shipping. ■ CO2 Emissions and Energy Intensity from Logistics Fiscal 2006 is the base year for indexing the logistics energy intensity as 100. 63 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Environmental Management Systems and Environmental Efficiency Indices Kaneka Group operates based on ISO 14001 and Eco-Action 21 standards. We also use the Japan Environmental Policy Priorities Index (JEPIX) to assess the total environmental impact of our business, in the context of aiming for a sustainable society.

February 12, 2016 0011039 Environmental Compliance Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Kaneka Group continues working to reduce environmental risks through various means, including ISO 14001 internal audits and CSR safety and quality inspections, to check compliance with environmental regulations and legislation such as the Air Pollution Control Act and the Water Pollution Control Act, and with criteria in agreements with local governments. Environmental Efficiency Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We assess the environmental impacts of our production activities using Environmental Impact Points (EIP), which are compiled using the JEPIX methodology (see note 1), and we use those points to assess our environmental efficiency (see note 2). Our total environmental impact in fiscal 2015 decreased 6.1% from the previous year, to 4.6 billion EIPs, while our environmental efficiency improved by 3.8%, as we reduced emissions of hazardous air pollutants and the impact on marine environment. 65 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Note: 1. The Japan Environmental Policy Priorities Index (JEPIX) methodology involves the calculation of an eco-factor coefficient for each emitted substance that has an environmental impact, using a ratio of the annual target for emissions under national environmental policies versus actual annual emissions ( Distance to Target ). The ecofactors are then multiplied by a quantity for each environmental impact to produce a single integrated index known as Environmental Impact Points (EIP). Calculations of eco-factors are done by the JEPIX Project (www.jepix.org, in Japanese). 2. Environmental efficiency is a yardstick to measure efforts to maximize value while minimizing environmental impacts, with the aim of achieving sustainable growth. Kaneka calculates this by dividing net sales (yen) by the EIP. ■ Environmental Efficiency ■ Details of Total Environmental Impact Check & Act The total environmental impact declined due to decreases in COD, nitrogen, and phosphorus discharge to coastal waters, as well as lower emissions of hazardous air pollutants. We will continue working to reduce total environmental impacts and improve environmental efficiency by upgrading our facilities. 66 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Reducing Waste and Preventing Pollution Through pursuing the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle) aimed at the reduction and recycling of industrial waste from our operations, Kaneka has been able to achieve zero emissions (see note 1) for ten consecutive years. We are also working toward all group companies in Japan being able to achieve zero emissions. We also meet all standards for environmental pollution levels in applicable laws and regulations, and in agreements concluded with various municipalities. Note 1: Kaneka defines zero emissions to mean that the final landfill volume is less than 0.5% of total waste generated. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Cutting Waste Sent to Landfill Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We effectively achieved zero emissions for our tenth consecutive year in fiscal 2015, with a final landfill volume (see note 2) for Kaneka of 4.7 tons, equivalent to a final landfill rate of 0.007%. For our group companies in Japan, we are working to implement thoroughgoing waste sorting and resource recovery, and reevaluating waste processing contracting arrangements, in order to reduce landfill volumes. In fiscal 2015, we achieved zero emissions in Japan for the fourth consecutive year since fiscal 2012, on a consolidated basis including 28 group companies in Japan. We will continue to work towards further reductions in landfill volumes. Note 2: Fiscal 2015 final landfill volume: Starting with fiscal 2016 (reporting the figures for fiscal 2015), the values reported as Kaneka's landfill volume, landfill rate, industrial waste volume, and recycling amount indicate totals for the company as a whole, including its manufacturing plants and other facilities. ■ Volume and Ratio of Waste sent to Landfill 67 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Waste Generated and Recycled ■ Waste Flow: From Generation to Landfill (FY 2015 actual) Proper Disposal of Industrial Waste Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We conduct regular site visits of our waste processing contractors, and carry out inspections based on a checklist to confirm that waste is being processed in the proper manner. 3R Initiatives Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Because reducing waste leads to improving global sustainability by means of resource savings, cost reduction, as well as carbon dioxide emissions reduction, Kaneka is pursuing waste reduction on a company-wide basis. We at Kaneka and group companies in Japan are pursuing activities at each of our production facilities, mainly through the 3R approach to achieve waste reduction and recycling of materials. In addition, we have been pursuing improvements, utilizing the Material Flow Cost Accounting (MFCA) approach, which involves all employees in manufacturing, research and other sections. Preventing Air and Water Pollution Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Kaneka is in compliance with the standards specified in the Air Pollution Control Act and the Water Pollution Control Act and the criteria included in agreements made with local governments. While soot and dust emission levels for all parent plants were lower than the previous fiscal year, SOx and NOx emissions were increased. The environmental impact on water resources decreased with respect to all criteria. 68 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 69 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Note 3: From fiscal 2015, values reported for water usage and wastewater by Kaneka include amounts for production facilities and non-production facilities. Check & Act Of the total amount of waste generated in fiscal 2015 by all of our facilities (not only plants), 61.7% was recycled―roughly the same as in the previous fiscal year. In fiscal 2016, we will continue to reduce and recycle waste internally and through our contractors. We will continue to work to further reduce our impacts on water and the air, and to strengthen our monitoring systems so that we are able to respond rapidly in the event of any abnormalities. 70 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Reducing Chemical Substance Discharge We at Kaneka are working in an ongoing manner to reduce the discharge of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as to voluntarily reduce emissions of six hazardous atmospheric pollutants subject to the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR). Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Voluntary Plan to Cut VOC Discharge Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We are committed to reducing the discharge of VOCs (see note 1), which are known to cause photochemical smog. In fiscal 2015, total discharge was 1,702 tons, 2.0% increase compared to the previous year. We will continue our efforts to reduce VOC discharge through prevention of leakages from equipment, and by changing production conditions. Note 1: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are organic chemical substances that cause suspended particulate matter and photochemical oxidants. ■ VOC Discharge: Voluntary Plan and Performance Hazardous Atmospheric Pollutants Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Total emissions in fiscal 2015 of six hazardous atmospheric pollutants (shown in the following graphs) were 23.9 tons, which represented a slight year-on-year decrease of 1.2%. We will continue to implement emissions reduction measures to reduce our environmental impacts. 71 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 PRTR Discharge Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We are working to reduce the discharge of substances subject to the PRTR. Total emissions of these substances in fiscal 2015 were 77.0 tons, a decrease of 0.2 tons from the previous year. ■ Fiscal 2015 Parent Company Emissions Subject to the Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Law (Kilograms) Designated Emissions Transferred Number Discharges Chemical Substances Atmospheric Discharges Internal Fiscal under into Public Total Total Ordinance Emissions into Soil Landfill 2014 Waterways 94 Chloroethylene (PVC) 12,760 110 0 0 12,870 13,170 990 392 Normal hexane 10,900 0 0 0 10,900 10,400 121,420 275 Sodium dodecyl sulfate 0 8,600 0 0 8,600 8,700 0 240 Styrene 6,130 39 0 0 6,169 6,817 3,340 Large 420 Methyl methacrylate 5,100 3 0 0 5,103 5,103 8 Discharges of 10 Dichloromethane 186 4,451 0 0 0 4,451 4,617 52,890 Substances (methylene chloride) 7 Acrylic acid butyl 4,130 0 0 0 4,130 3,870 2,591 232 N,N-dimethylformamide 2,700 810 0 0 3,510 4,670 330,000 157 1,2-dichloroethane 3,500 0 0 0 3,500 3,500 0 134 Vinyl acetate 3,450 0 0 0 3,450 2,960 950 Total Other than the 10 Substances Above 8,358 6,001 0 0 14,359 13,415 98,786 Grand Total for All Substances 61,479 15,562 0 0 77,042 77,222 610,975 Of the 462 substances subject to the PRTR, Kaneka reports about 65 items.

Discharge by group companies in Japan increased by 5.6 tons and totaled 71.3 tons due to increased emissions of N, Ndimethyl formamide and toluene from expanded production. We will continue our efforts to reduce the discharge of chemical substances while controlling large discharge. 73 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Biodiversity Conservation Considering the impacts of our businesses on ecosystems, we at Kaneka strive to develop technologies, materials and products that have less environmental impacts, as well as to mitigate environmental impacts of our production. As part of our corporate social responsibility efforts, we also collaborate with stakeholders outside the company in biodiversity conservation activities. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Partnership for Biodiversity Conservation We join the following initiatives. • Promotion Partners of the Declaration of Biodiversity by Keidanren • Keidanren Committee on Nature Conservation • Keidanren Nature Conservation Fund • Japan Business and Biodiversity Partnership Lake Biwa Walnut School Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We join the Steering Committee of the Walnut School, established to manage and conserve the Konooka Biotope (see note 1), located near our Shiga Plant. Established as a collaborative effort by Shiga Prefecture, Otsu City and the local community members including our Shiga Plant, the Walnut School works to preserve this precious natural environment for future generations. Such activities include grass mowing, sidewalk maintenance, and updating educational signboard, and it also hosts seasonal nature observation gatherings some three times each year. The gatherings provide valuable learning opportunities for children to observe rare plants, wild birds, insects and other wildlife living in the biotope. We will continuously contribute to the conservation of the beautiful natural environment of Lake Biwa. Note 1: Biotope: A place where organisms live as they do in nature. In human environments such as cities, biotopes are artificial environments created to regenerate and preserve a natural habit. Outdoor activities by the Walnut School Children enjoy tasting tempura made from wild herbs 74 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Kaneka Forestry for the Future Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Since 2012, we have been participating in private forest preservation project promoted by Hyogo Prefecture. Named Kaneka Forestry for the Future, employees at our Takasago Plant have maintained the habitat in Taka Town, Hyogo. After listening to the lecture by the town officials, some 60 employees, mainly newly hired, carried out tree thinning in April 2015, and about 65 employees and their family members participated in another session in November. Since 2013, trainings for all newly hired employees have been carried out as part of the project. Through assisting each other on the precarious forest terrain in cutting and transporting timber, the participants were able to deepen their bonds of solidarity and learn to function well as a team. Over the five-year period from June 2012 through May 2017, these activities will be carried out over some 15 sessions at an area of forest of roughly 15 hectares. New employee training in the forest Reforestation by employees and their family members Settsu-no-mori Kaneka Biotope Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Since 2013, our Osaka Plant has maintained the Settsu-no-mori Kaneka Biotope. We have leased part of greenery area of the plant to Settsu City, and managed the biotope collaborating with the Settsu Firefly Society. The biotope provides a wetland environment where fireflies and other wildlife can be observed. Firefly larvae that were introduced to the biotope in November 2014 successfully grew into adults, and when the area was open to the public in 2015 from May 24 to 31, local residents enjoyed watching the dance of the fireflies in flight. This was the second firefly watching gathering held since 2014, and the number of participants grew from 634 on the first occasion to 1,123, indicating the steady growth in awareness of this initiative. We look forward to the biotope serving as a recreation area for the local community into the future. Entrance sign of the biotope The dance of the fireflies was seen again this year 75 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 With Our Customers Our customers are the people who purchase Kaneka Group products. A business cannot survive without the support of its customers. We provide them with quality products and services, ensure product safety, and disclose information. To ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, the various divisions and group companies have obtained ISO 9001 certification, the international standard for quality management systems for products and services.

We consider them as equal partners that share with us the goal of growing our respective businesses. We build mutually beneficial relationships with vendors, ensuring that transactions are faire and that we offer equal opportunities to do business. Aiming to promote the safety in our logistics operations, our Osaka Plant worked in conjunction with freight handling contractors to identify potentially unsafe on-site locations and then to improve them. Of the 53 locations identified during fiscal 2015, improvements have been made for 48, for a ratio of 90.6%. Sustainable Procurement 83 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Sustainable Procurement We draw on our Basic Procurement Policy to engage in rational procurement that is fair, equitable, and environmentally friendly to mutually improve corporate value with our business partners. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Green Procurement Based on Basic Procurement Policy Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To reduce burdens on the global environment, in fiscal 2011 we adopted our Basic Procurement Policy, which declared our goal to pursue green procurement; this served as the foundation of our Green Procurement Standards established in fiscal 2013. In pursuit of green procurement for all raw material inputs, we periodically undertake surveys on the status of environmental management system certifications attained by our suppliers, as well as inspections of materials for the presence of any prohibited substances. ■ Basic Procurement Policy 1. We will engage in procurement activities that enhance the corporate value of both Kaneka and our business partners. 2. We will endeavor to reduce environmental damage by engaging in green procurement. 3. We will provide opportunities for business partners to make fair and rational transactions in consideration of quality, price, supply stability, technical development capabilities, environmental protection, and safety. 4. We will abide strictly by the relevant Japanese and foreign laws and regulations. Procurement Initiatives Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Our procurement departments stay in close communication with our business partners, continually working with them to strengthen our partnerships. Together with our business partners, we keep our eye on continually changing market conditions to create new value and to grow together. In accordance with our Green Procurement Standards, we strive to keep up-to-date concerning the environmental activities undertaken by our business partners, and are exploring ways to make effective use of our website to share information about Kaneka's initiatives and perspectives to further promote green procurement efforts. 84 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Initiatives to Prevent Transportation Disasters Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ For fiscal 2015, jointly with our transportation contractors, we carried out a year-long awareness-raising initiative to promote safe driving. It included patrols to check whether drivers carried the Yellow Card (see note 1), and programs to raise awareness of products characteristics that should be kept in mind during transportation. In addition, we monitored the status of legal compliance checks of mobile tanks, and held transport accident emergency reporting drills based on specific scenarios. A simulated training on emergency handling of poisonous materials was held at the Takasago Plant. All these activities have contributed to make staff members confident with the actions to be taken in the event of accidents, and on quick reporting to prevent the worsened emergency situations. Note 1: The emergency response card on transportation of hazardous materials. Joint drills held with business partners are filled with A training scenario involving a chlorine leak from a a sense of urgency tanker truck Check & Act In fiscal 2016, Kaneka Group will carry out methodical investigations based on the Green Procurement Standards set in fiscal 2013 and in keeping with plans formulated in fiscal 2015 (which requires inspection of all existing raw materials in the order of priority, to ensure they do not contain substances that have been prohibited by the company). 85 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 With our Shareholders and Investors Shareholders and investors recognize the value of our corporate brand and own our shares. For them we not only provide stable and consistent returns, but also enhance management transparency through appropriate and timely information disclosure. Our basic policy on profit sharing for shareholders is stability and consistency, with a target of 30% for the consolidated payout ratio through dividends, combined with flexible repurchasing of company shares. Dividend Policy and Information Disclosure 86 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Dividend Policy and Information Disclosure Kaneka Group strives not only to provide stable and consistent returns to shareholders and investors, but also to disclose information in an appropriate and timely way, in order to maintain their trust, meet their expectations, and help them accurately understand the Group. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Shareholder Composition and Dividend Policy Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ As of March 31, 2016, there were 350 million shares issued and outstanding, and 15,860 shareholders. Financial institutions accounted for 48.9% of the total, foreign companies 27.6%, and individuals 15.1%, while other companies and financial instruments business operators constituted the remainder. Our basic policy on profit sharing for shareholders is stability and consistency, with a target of 30% for the consolidated payout ratio through dividends, combined with flexible repurchasing of company shares. (The payout ratio for the year ended March 31, 2016 was 28.6 %.) Regarding retained earnings, we work to make the best use of these funds in order to realize sustained growth for the company, while also ensuring financial stability in the face of highly changeable economic conditions. ■ Shareholder Composition Shareholder Reporting Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We issue reports to shareholders twice per year and also publish them on our website for anyone to read. For topics the reports cover developments of the preceding period using photos and a readable format, and interim reports carry the presidentʼs explanation of the companyʼs management strategy, as well as special articles of interest to shareholders.

Annual Report 2015 An investor relations meeting Check & Act In fiscal 2016, we will continue to build on our fiscal 2015 efforts to ensure proper information disclosure to shareholders and investors. 88 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 With Local Communities We can boost corporate value by fulfilling our responsibilities to citizens and consumers. Our efforts extend from contributions to society and welfare and community engagement to ensuring that our plants operate safely. We are also proactive in other activities to meet the needs of society, such as fostering youth development, and promoting safety and disaster preparedness. The group companies have been conducting various drills for actions such as evacuation, incident reporting, and firefighting, and in fiscal 2015, they implemented emergency drills especially in safety confirmation sequence, calling over the names of participants and examining emergency hotlines.

We also provide support for reconstruction after earthquakes and other disasters, and will continue a variety of support activities in the future. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Enhancing Crisis Management Systems Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We at the Kaneka Group conduct drills for a possible earthquake affecting geographically wide areas, and prepare standards and manuals to mobilize initial responses and ensure business continuity. In fiscal 2015, we held drills that assumed a disaster struck in the morning at the start of operations, at Kanekaʼs six business sites and one sales office, and eight group companies in Japan, with a total of 6,143 employees participating. The drills used a system to confirm employee safety to check (1) the safety of all participants, (2) communication using hand-held satellite phones, and to verify (3) response measures in damage scenarios. We also published a risk management handbook for employees to help them clearly understand the emergency procedures: proper incident notification, instructions, consultation, and response, as well as the smooth flow of information. Building further upon the activities of fiscal 2015, we will continue with routine educational activities and drills to ensure business continuity. At the Task Force in Osaka Head Corporate Task Force checks reports Risk management handbook Office, staff confirm that employees from each business site are safe 90 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Support for Reconstruction after 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Kaneka Group has been providing relief and recovery support during the five years since the Great East Japan Earthquake. We will continue to provide a variety of reconstruction support activities in the future. Participation in IPPO IPPO NIPPON Project We donate 500,000 yen annually to the disaster reconstruction support activities of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai). We have installed learning equipment at vocational high schools in the coastal areas of the Tohoku region (from 2013 onward). Reconstruction Assistance for Main Roads in Disaster-Affected Areas For road reconstruction in disaster-affected areas, we provided Soil Blocks, a large polystyrene foams designed for civil engineering work (for details, please see “CSR Topics 2015”). Reconstruction of Only Manufacturing Plant for Molded Polystyrene Foam Products in Kesennuma City, Miyagi Prefecture Group company Kanae Co., Ltd. manufactured molded polystyrene foam products for storing and transporting fish, but operations were halted when the tsunami swept over the plant. We invested 600 million yen (including government subsidies) to rebuild the plant, which reopened in June 2013. It is contributing to local employment and the recovery of the fisheries industry. Supplying KANEKA Surfactin, a Radioactive Decontamination Detergent This highly biodegradable natural detergent made using the Bacillus subtilis bacteria cleans soil particles contaminated with radioactive cesium and other substances. Since 2012, it has been used in some of the areas designated for decontamination. Tohoku Products Fair at Osaka Plant On February 25, 2016, we organized the Tohoku products fair, dubbed the Tohoku Waku-Waku Market, at our Osaka Plant. The event was implemented as part of the support activities of the Kansai Economic Federation, of which Kaneka is a member. The concept of the fair was to provide access for people to purchase special products only available in Tohoku. The goal was to help Tohoku businesses develop marketing channels and improve their employment situation, and thereby to provide assistance from the Kansai region to the disaster-affected areas. On market day, employees from our group company Kaneka Osaka Service Center Co., Ltd. worked with market staff to sell products from six prefectures in Tohoku (including sake, side dishes to go with rice, and sweets). Many employees from the Group and partner companies came to the market, resulting in sales of 270,000 yen. On April 22, 2016, a market was also held at our Takasago Plant. 91 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Tohoku Waku-Waku Market 92 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Fostering Youth Development Kaneka is active in its efforts to foster youth development in communities where it operates. We continued supporting learning in elementary schools through the activities of Core-Net, a non-profit organization of retired executives from Kaneka and other companies. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Kaneka Manufacturing Class Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Pro bono activities have been in the spotlight as a new trend in Japan, and these include activities in which professionals from various fields volunteer their knowledge, experience, and skills as a contribution to the community, and Core-Net (Co-operation Program of Retired Executives Network) is one such organization. Its activities include support for elementary school education using know-how from industry to foster youth development. Continuing from 2014, we offered Kaneka Manufacturing Classes in which participants assembled kits to build Scrollers (a small self-powered rolling robot). The classes were offered in June 2015 at Torikai Nishi Elementary School near the Osaka Plant (94 students in sixth grade), and in October at Takasago Elementary School near the Takasago Plant (72 students in sixth grade). Kaneka employees, mainly newly hired at the plants, joined the classes to guide and assist the students, and to show them the enjoyment and sense of achievement that can come from creating something. In their questionnaire responses, more than 90% of the students said the class was interesting and they would like to do it again. In fiscal 2016, we plan to hold the class at a school near our Shiga Plant as well, to continue our efforts to contribute to the community by fostering youth development. Kaneka employees instructing students Unveiling the Scroller in the gym 93 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Safety and Disaster Preparedness Our plants operate in a close relationship with local communities. Kaneka Group works to ensure that its plants earn the confidence of local communities through a variety of safetyrelated initiatives aimed at maximizing safety and security. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Targeting Zero Process Accidents Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Safety is a top management priority for the Kaneka Group and we have various initiatives aimed at completely eliminating process accidents. Despite our efforts, 14 process accidents occurred in fiscal 2015. We are striving to prevent accidents by enhancing safety techniques, including identifying risks and developing preventive actions, through safety inspections (of static electricity and heat build-up risk) at all group companies. We will continue these activities to promote safe and secure business operations. ■Basic Safety Policies ◇ Safety forms our management foundation, and is the basis of all corporate activities. ◇ Safety is the foundation of local and worldwide communitiesʼ confidence in Kaneka. ◇ Safety is based on our belief that “All accidents can be prevented.” ◇ Safety is the responsibility of every employee in accordance with his/her duties. ◇ Safety must be maintained continuously. Emergency Drills Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In fiscal 2015, as in previous years, we held comprehensive disaster drills at all parent plants, as shown in the table below. The drills are conducted to boost our capacity to respond to emergencies through various approaches, for example, checking whether personnel at the local headquarters are able to execute decisions and instructions appropriately without knowing the scenario in advance, and whether they can communicate and share information smoothly. 94 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■Comprehensive Disaster Drills Plant Date Participants Details The plant held a joint firefighting drill with the Takasago City Fire Department based on the scenario Takasago Plant December 11, 2015 1,976 of an earthquake resulting in a chemical leak from a high-pressure gas storage tank, and fire outbreak due to aftershocks. The plant held a joint firefighting drill with the Settsu City Fire Department based on the scenario of an July 14, 2015 964 earthquake resulting in a leak from municipal gas supply pipe and a fire in a warehouse. Osaka Plant The plant held a joint firefighting drill with the Settsu City Fire Department based on the scenario of an March 29, 2016 986 earthquake resulting in a hazardous substance leak and a fire on the roof of a research center. The plant held a firefighting and rescue drill based on November 19, the scenario of an earthquake resulting in chiller Shiga Plant 395 2015 equipment catching on fire and workers falling and getting injured. The plant held a firefighting drill based on the scenario of an earthquake resulting in the leak of a hazardous Kashima Plant May 16, 2016 297 substance from a delivery pipe flange of a storage tank, thereby causing a fire. Firefighting drill, part of routine safety activities (Takasago Plant) Plant Safety Initiatives Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To prevent explosions and fire accidents, we continue to implement efforts to reduce the accident risk, by conducting site inspections paying special attention to potential ignition from static electricity, and by quantitative assessments of the risk of chemicals coming into contact with each other, to identify any risk of unintended chemical reactions. We will continue to improve these safety techniques to ensure the safety of our plants. 95 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Check & Act Fourteen process accidents occurred in fiscal 2015, showing no significant change from the 16 in fiscal 2014. In many cases, the cause of the accident was equipment-related (aging equipment, inadequate maintenance, etc.), so we will make a greater effort in the future to implement plan-based maintenance and to conduct predictive maintenance. Fire at Incineration Facility at Takasago Plant Incident Outline At about 12:50 on October 26, 2015, an accident occurred when fire broke out in the sludge storage area of an incinerator at the Takasago Plant (Takasago City, Hyogo Prefecture). Company employees discovered the fire and notified the public fire department, and the fire was put out with water. The fire caused damage to a portion of the sludge storage building, but no one was injured. We apologize to the local residents and anyone affected by the disturbance. Cause of Accident The fire is believed to have occurred when rubber coagulum in sludge was exposed to direct sunlight for an extended period of time, and eventually ignited due to chemical decomposition and the build-up of heat. Safety Measures to Prevent a Recurrence Heat analysis and other tests helped to clarify the materials and mechanisms that resulted in ignition. In an effort to prevent recurrence, information will be circulated within the Kaneka Group regarding the risk and proper handling of waste materials. Fire at Foam Extrusion Equipment at Kashima Plant Incident Outline At about 19:20 on November 9, 2015, an accident occurred when foam became ignited during the cutting process for extruded polystyrene foam board at the Kashima Plant (Kamisu City, Ibaraki Prefecture). The public fire department was notified and employees immediately suppressed the fire using fire extinguishers. No one was injured and there was no physical damage. We apologize to the local residents and anyone affected by the disturbance. Cause of Accident When a nichrome wire was lowered, it made contact with the metal part of the ground wire clip that was temporarily attached to the side of the cradle apparatus, resulting in a spark. It is believed that this ignited the combustible gas that was being used to expand the polystyrene foam board. Safety Measures to Prevent a Recurrence The mechanisms that resulted in ignition were clarified in the laboratory. Measures to prevent recurrence will be adopted at plants that utilize cutting equipment with nichrome wires. 96 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Community Initiatives (Awards) Kaneka Group engages in highly open and transparent corporate activities to build strong ties with communities and deepen stakeholder understanding of its operations as a good corporate citizen.

Kaneka Group's most valuable asset is our employees―and it is their growth that makes our growth as a corporate group possible. We offer employees appropriate treatment, remuneration, self-fulfillment, and safe working environments. The Women's Network Program, established in fiscal 2015, provides a venue for female employees to proactively discuss concerns and advance proposals for transformative change―both for themselves and for the company. Seventeen women responded to the call during the first phase of activities, working together as a team to make the most of this initiative. Basic Concepts for People and the Respect for Human Rights Employee Development System Organization Promoting Diversity & Inclusion Work-Life Balance Occupational Safety and Health 110 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Basic Concepts for People and the Organization We work to achieve organizational change through fostering employee growth along with organizational growth. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Basic Concepts for People and the Organization Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ The basic concepts for people and the organization―based on our corporate philosophy and long-term vision―are also at the heart of our personnel system. This concept, the Kaneka Spirit, has derived from ongoing dialogues between labor and management and was evolved through the infused human resources systems, through which we foster people eager to meet new challenges, as well as a strong organization, diverse human resources and inquiring minds. 111 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Check & Act To promote diversity and inclusion, in fiscal 2016 we will undertake a number of concrete initiatives based on our action plan for the Act on Promotion of Women's Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. Additionally, we will also develop specific measures with respect to important themes, such as enhanced recruitment, active use of job rotation for skills development, early career fostering of leaders including global leaders. 112 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Respect for Human Rights Our company respect for human rights and acknowledge and appreciate the diversity of individual values. We do not act in a discriminatory manner toward any of our employees, while upholding all relevant laws and regulations. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Human Rights Education Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We have established respect for human rights as the most fundamental principle to be upheld by our employees and the company. We ensure that it is well understood through our Rules of Employment and Ethical Code of Conduct, as well as the trainings for new hires and newly promoted managers This is also supplemented through participation in external trainings and conferences held by local governments. ■ Human Rights Education Fiscal 2015 Content Training sessions for new Training concerning sexual harassment, power harassment, and employees (132 participants) discrimination based on nationality, and other issues. New managers training (45 Human rights education session with external experts participants) New manager raining session Labor-Management Relations Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In keeping with the labor and management joint targets, dynamic discussions are held through management conferences, central labor and management meetings, and meetings of representatives.

Central labor and management meeting Employee Satisfaction Surveys Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Surveys are held once a year for all employees to provide self-assessments regarding their career vision, and job and workplace satisfaction. Measures Against Sexual Harassment and Power Harassment Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Aiming to maintain a work environment that is free from sexual harassment or power harassment, we take measures to ensure that all employees are aware of the Rules of Employment and Compliance Guidebook; we also work to prevent incidents of harassment and to deal with matters that may arise at an early stage, including through consultation desks at each of our worksites and an intranet-based reporting system. Privacy Protection Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To protect the privacy of our employees, customers and others, we have established a Personal Information Protection Policy in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. We are also continually working to enhance levels of information security, through conducting trainings and various information security education sessions, making use of the Information Security Guidebook prepared by the Information Systems Department. 114 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Employee Development System We develop our human resources to lead our company's long-term vision, the Declaration of Kaneka United, formulated in fiscal 2009. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Commitment to People and Organizations Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We are conducting activities to speed the development of global human resources―through expanding our education and training programs, active use of job rotation for skills development, and expanding strategic recruitment efforts. In fiscal 2015, we strengthened our efforts to foster leaders and managerial human resources, including through the School of Leadership Challenge for newly appointed managers and organizational administrators. Furthermore, we have been continually carrying out upgraded next-generation leader trainings and overseas leader trainings. Career Development and Life Design Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ To cultivate professionals who embody the Kaneka Spirit, we carry out various off-site trainings, such as professionspecific programs and career development support programs. We also established a self-development support program for employees to pursue capacity building at their own initiative based on their own selections. In fiscal 2015, we revised our career development and life-design training system, establishing age-specific career and life-design trainings. In addition, as a result of the discontinuation of the general career track and regional staff job classifications in fiscal 2014, we carried out Lively Training and My Work Training for former regional employees. ■ Implementation of Career Development and Life Design Support Activities Program Name Number of Sessions Number Participating in Trainings Career-design training 18 301 Life-design training 23 257 Lively Training 8 140 My Work Training 7 156 Global Human Resource Development Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Seven years have passed since the introduction of our Global Employee Development Program and overseas dispatch trainings. Starting with fiscal 2015, we are working to improve the practical and communications skills of employees by expanding trainings that dispatch young employees to newly industrialized countries such as India and Indonesia, and 115 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 launching a language training program (with local homestays) for employees scheduled for transfer overseas. Also, we strengthen leadership and build our global network by expanding the number of companies participating in our Multinational Leader Development Program and the Leadership Challenge Workshop; group trainings held outside Japan that focus on locally hired staff. Going forward, we plan to further enhance our global training programs, with the aim of securing true leadership throughout the Kaneka Group. ■ Global Human Resource Development Plan (Fiscal 2015) Number of Program Name Content Participants Global Employee Practical acquisition of foreign (registered participants) Development Program language for communication 2,122 Language training in Japan English and Chinese Acquisition of languages required for 121 language trainings overseas business Overseas Trainee One-year work experience at a group 15 Dispatch Program company outside Japan Overseas Short-term Activity at a group company outside Trainee Dispatch Japan on voluntarily selected themes 4 Program (about 3 months) Overseas dispatch training Overseas language Short-term study abroad and 2 study program homestay experience Language training In-country language acquisition before overseas 2 program before transfer transfer Trainees from group companies People-to-people Global Employee outside Japan dispatched to Kaneka 2 exchange Exchange Program (in Japan) Multinational Leader Case studies and action learning on (outside Japan) 12 Development Program practices of leading global companies Group training The Leadership Acquiring and practicing leadership (outside Japan) 112 Challenge Workshop skills (in Japan) 159 116 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Promoting Diversity & Inclusion We at Kaneka seek out diverse human resources, and continually strive to build their capacity and provide an environment where they can capitalize on their strengths. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Active Promotion of Female Employees Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In fiscal 2015, we created the Women's Network Program. The goal of this program is to bring about a workplace where women can play an active role, and female employees are encouraged to voluntarily join together to collaborate and proactively address workplace challenges. During the first phase, 17 women of all job types worked as a team over six months to propose specific measures aimed at solving workplace problems. In addition, 50 female managers and employees in senior staff positions attended external leadership trainings, and lectures for promoting women in the workplace were held for management, along with a seminar for those managing female subordinates conducted as part of training for new managers. In addition to further working to create a workplace supportive of female employees, we continue to expand our efforts to actively support their capacity development. A group work session of the Women's Network Program ■ Action Plan under the Law to Promote Women in the Workplace Through creating a workplace environment where highly motivated and skilled female employees can play a greater role, we actively promote their capacity building. To this end, we have developed the following action plan. 1. Time period April 1, 2016 through March 31, 2021 2. Objectives, activities and timing ＜Objective＞ Doubling the number of female officers, as well as the appointment of multiple women to senior manager positions. ＜Activities 1＞ 117 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 To develop a work environment where female employees can play a greater role. 1) April 2016 Create a model workplace where women play an active role. Based on this example, expand such supportive conditions to other workplaces. 2) April 2016 Improve work arrangements in order for work duties to be more efficiently conducted within set working hours. Promote the use of telecommuting and shorter work-hours programs for creating an environment where employees can balance work and personal life. 3) August 2016 Expand the activities of the Women's Network Program for female employees to make further recommendations for transforming their activities and the company. 4) April 2017 Establish a Career Consultation Desk within the Human Resources Department to provide advice for employees to improve their career vision, with more experienced female employees serving as advisors. ＜Activities 2＞ Actively promote the capacity building of female employees. 1) April 2016 Create personalized training plans for manager candidates, provide them with jobs with greater responsibilities, and monitor the status of progress. 2) April 2016 Encourage opportunities for female employees to actively exchange views with their peers in other companies, enabling them to gain a clearer vision for their career. 3) October 2016 Through continued training sessions and lectures, train managers working with female subordinates to be advocates for women empowerment. ＜Activities 3＞ Proactively recruit and hire female employees. 1) April 2016 Expand information sessions for female students, and increase the percentage of new female graduates hired. 2) April 2016 In order to expand the cohort of future manager candidates, proactively hire women for senior staff positions. 3) October 2016 In collaboration with universities, plan and conduct seminars targeted to female students, providing opportunities for them to think about their employment options and life plans. ■ Change in Ratio of Female Managers Percentage of female managers among all executive positions 118 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Hiring and Support of Employees with Various Nationalities Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We proactively recruit employees with various nationalities. In order for those newly hired to quickly become accustomed to the workplace and play an active role, we have set up consultation desks for those who come from countries other than Japan at each of our work locations, and continually provide support, such as Japanese language training. ■ Changes in New Hires Who Come from Countries Other than Japan (New Graduates) Year Hired Technical Staff Clerical Staff Total 2012 3 6 9 2013 1 2 3 2014 4 2 6 2015 2 2 4 2016 5 2 7 Employment of Persons with Disabilities Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ The employment rate for persons with disabilities in fiscal 2015 reached 2.06%, achieving the legally mandated employment rate (2.0%). We will continue to actively employ persons with disabilities and support employment efforts by our group companies by expanding the range of occupational opportunities and creating a welcoming workplace. ■ Changes in Rate of Employment of Persons with Disabilities Fiscal Year Company Employment Rate Legally Mandated Employment Rate 2011 1.67% 1.80% 2012 1.86% 1.80% 2013 1.90% 2.00% 2014 1.83% 2.00% 2015 2.06% 2.00% Employment of Senior Citizens Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In light of the Amended Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons, which took effect in April 2013, we revised our system for senior contract employees to accommodate those who wish to continue their employment up to age 65. In order for our senior employees to enjoy working while maintaining high levels of productivity, we offer opportunities for them to well prepare possible required skills in an early stage. In fiscal 2015, we initiated new career design trainings for 50and 55-year-old employees, to encourage them to see their retirement from the company at age 60 as a turning point where they can take up new work with enthusiasm. 119 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Work-Life Balance We enhance our flexible and self-managed work styles and promote balance between work and personal life, so that employees can be motivated and confident in their jobs. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Flexible Working Programs Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ We offer our employees various options for flexible and self-managed work arrangements, including flextime, discretionary work, and variable working hour programs. In fiscal 2015, we also expanded employee eligibility for the telecommuting program̶from childcare only to also include family care, and currently, eight employees are using this program. Going forward, we will promote greater use and enhancements of our flexible work programs, to increase the options for diverse and self-managed work styles. ■ Discretionary Work Program Users Childcare and Family Care Leave Programs Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In fiscal 2009, Kaneka acquired Kurumin Mark certification, which is awarded to companies that support employees' childcare. We have formulated action plans based on the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising NextGeneration Children, and continue efforts to achieve our targets. Also twenty-two employees have used our newly-created child-raising subsidy program, while one employee has used the leave program when a spouse is transferred abroad. In fiscal 2015, we made some revisions to our work-life balance support programs, including making employees eligible to use the shorter work-hours program for up to three years in the case of family care. In the future, we will be paying special attention not only to improving the programs, but also providing more information and establishing a consultation desk about family care. 120 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ Number of Users Fiscal 2015 Females Males Shorter work-hours program 50 1 Childcare leave program 42 2 The Kurumin Mark is awarded to companies that are certified for supporting childcare by their employees Employee Feedback Balancing Work and Childcare with the Telecommuting Program Thanks to the telecommuting program, instead of spending three hours commuting to and from work each day, I am able to allocate this time for childcare and household tasks. My children are in the last year of daycare and second grade of elementary school, and both of them are happy that I can pick them up earlier than in the past. As for working at home, I am finding ways to organize myself for tasks that are practical to do at home, such as report writing and data analysis. I am also very grateful to have the understanding and support of my boss and workplace colleagues. Internal Control Department, CSR Division Makiko Kazemoto 121 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Occupational Safety and Health Kaneka Group promotes various occupational safety and health measures aiming for zero occupational accidents, based on risk assessments at each business site, with consideration of factors relating to personnel, facilities, raw materials, and systems. Ｋ ＫＡＮＥＫＡ Ｊ ＪＡＰＡＮ Ｗ ＷＯＲＬＤＷＩＤＥ Occupational Safety and Health Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In 2015, a total of 13 occupational accidents occurred in the Kaneka Group, of which seven resulted in lost work time, and six did not. As many of these were due to being caught in machinery or falling, we provide a sensory learning program of a hand getting caught and safety-related activities to reduce the number of occupational accidents, in order to boost personal awareness of safety and safety management. ■ Zero Accident Principles We ensure everyone is working ◆ All people, you and me, are indispensable Pledge of safety safely. We do not miss sparing the time Participation in ◆ Safety is everyoneʼs responsibility to seek safety. safety We always value a fundamental Adherence to safety ◆ There is no trick to safety approach to it. basics We endeavor to eliminate safety ◆ Be aware of potential danger Safety in advance risks. ◆ Where there is carelessness, there is the We do not allow even a small 99%, yet 0% possibility of an accident chance of negligence. Enhancing Our Occupational Safety and Health Management System Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Our all four parent plants acquired Occupational Safety and Health Management System (OSHMS) certification from the Japan Industrial Safety & Health Association (JISHA) in fiscal 2007, and have continued our efforts to enhance these systems. We are checking the effectiveness of activities and working to make steady improvements. A summary was written of best practices for CSR safety and quality inspections, and the practices are being encouraged among group companies in Japan in order to further improve safety levels. 122 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 ■ OSHMS Certifications Plant Location Certification Date Certification No. Takasago Plant Hyogo March 10, 2008 08-28-13 Osaka Plant Osaka August 21, 2007 07-27-10 Shiga Plant Shiga January 15, 2008 08-25-6 Kashima Plant Ibaraki December 13, 2010 10-8-26 ■ Number of Group Employee Accidents Resulting/Not Resulting in Lost Time ■ Accident Severity Rate and Accident Frequency Rate All Kaneka Group Companies in Japan Area Kaneka Group and Overseas Year 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 Frequency Rate 0.84 0.61 0.38 0.18 1.12 0.74 Employees of Kaneka and Accident Severity Group Companies 0.02 0.01 0.01 0.008 0.03 0.01 Rate Kaneka Medix Corporation Awarded for Five Years Accident Free Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ Kaneka Medix Corporation is a manufacturer of catheters and other medical equipment, based in Ashigarakami District, Kanagawa Prefecture. It has about 130 employees, and pays careful attention to safety rules, having published a booklet on the basics of health and safety at the workplace. It was recently certified by the Japan Chemical Industry Association as an excellent workplace for being continuously accident-free for five years. Kaneka Medix is continuing its safety efforts to maintain an accident-free record. 123 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Mental Health Care Ｋ Ｊ Ｗ In order to promote mental health, Kaneka Group conducted self-care trainings at workplaces in fiscal 2015. Their purpose was to make employees̶especially those in their thirties when stress levels can increase due to changes in their public and personal environment̶more aware of the stress due to the gaps between expectations and reality, and to develop techniques to manage it. We also prepared a manual to assist employees who are returning to work deal smoothly after time off work for mental health issues. Going forward, the entire Kaneka Group is committed to promoting not only physical but also mental health. Self Care Training Check & Act Although we have implemented health and safety activities, accidents did not decline significantly over the past five years despite our target of a zero-accident record, as well as efforts to boost safety awareness and promote adherence to safety guidelines. To continue making progress toward our zero-accident target, we will maintain our efforts, with special attention to stronger leadership by managers, as well as risk assessments with an emphasis on major risks. 124 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Stakeholder Communication Kaneka Group prioritizes communication with its stakeholders. We will continue to improve our activities on social responsibility by reviewing the feedbacks we receive from the readers of our CSR report. Third Party Comment/ Response to Third Party Third Party Verification Stakeholder Feedback Comment 125 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 Third Party Comment/ Response to Third Party Comment Third Party Comment on the 2016 CSR Report Chieko Minami Professor of Marketing, Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University. Graduated from the Faculty of Letters, Kobe University. Completed a Master's Degree in Communication from Michigan State University. Completed a Master's Degree at the Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University. Withdrew from the Doctoral Course.

Specializes in the field of marketing. “I look forward to a more accessible CSR Report to provide full disclosure to stakeholders.” Ten years have passed since Japanese businesses formally adopted corporate social responsibility (CSR). As a concept that originated overseas, CSR is still experiencing difficulties in taking root in corporate Japan as few companies can fully visualize its ideal implementation. The report clearly directs the Kaneka Groupʼs CSR activities toward social contribution through its business operations, and explicitly shows this by focusing on key strategic domains where the Group can exhibit its strength. This is particularly evident in the accessibility and readability of the digest version, the CSR Communication Book. Special Features that Go Straight to the Heart The special feature on food production support in particular, presents the familiar topic of food, which is also of great concern to society. Obscure scientific technology, such as how the new fertilizer promotes higher crop yield, or how antifreeze ingredients retain the quality of frozen foods, are explained with illustrations and combined with feedback from employees, all of which clearly convey Kaneka's contributions to the food industry. In the special feature on Kanekalon business, which has valued local community ties in Africa for more than 30 years, the Group's support and dialogue on the WFP school meal project for local children demonstrates a regional community engagement that goes beyond mere donation and is grounded in local needs. The positive effects on the wig culture there and women's self worth are also visually and concretely expressed through the Miss Kanekalon contest and other initiatives. All of these create a favorable impression of the Kaneka Groupʼs CSR activities. I would also like to give special mention to Kaneka's environmental data (the full report is available on the website). Manufacturing industries inevitably have an impact on the environment at every step of the production process, from raw material procurement to production and distribution. Kaneka is to be commended for continually disclosing activities that reduce its environmental impact using well-organized data through the Materials Balance in Production Activities. Going forward, I hope to see Kaneka continue to present to stakeholders its sustained efforts on CSR initiatives together with precise evidence based on data. Improvements to Enhance Communication The discussion on regenerative medicine and cell therapy on the first section is somewhat lacking. Given that this is a very high-profile social issue, there will certainly be more interest on the topic from stakeholders. This article would have 126 KANEKA CSR REPORT 2016 benefited from a more comprehensive approach to addressing the topic. In KANEKA at a glance there is an emphasis on data relating to the year's CSR activities. However, the implication and corresponding evaluation of these figures was not evident in the article. It was an interesting way of expressing data visually but there is room for improvement in terms of the presentation. Although CSR reports from various corporations can be obtained, people refrain from reading reports that are too voluminous or contain too much information. Whatever the medium, these reports will not be effective if they are not read. Addressing stakeholder interests and making more accessible reports are crucial in information disclosure. Along with more substantial content, I look forward to Kaneka's ongoing efforts to improve its CSR report from this perspective. From the Editorial Team: Response to Third Party Comment In the 2016 CSR Report, the structure of the digest version was modified to strengthen communication with stakeholders. In particular, near the beginning of the report, we highlighted special features on food production support and health care as our social contribution through business activities from among our various key strategic domains. These articles contain the concept for and significance of each initiative, together with messages from stakeholders. Through dialogues and discussions, we drew out people's wishes and needs, and made an effort to present them in the section Fulfilling dreams. In addition to commending some of our initiatives, Professor Minami also provided advice on several areas for improvement, such as including additional content on high-profile social issues, and providing the implication and corresponding evaluation of numerical data presented for our CSR activities.

The full report discloses all of our CSR information. It covers information contained in the Communication Book, the detailed report of stakeholder dialogues, and stakeholder-specific sections. The stakeholder-specific sections of the full report have Check & Act columns, an overview of activities for the year under review, and our Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) goals on highlighted issues for the coming term. The Communication Book was prepared to communicate to our stakeholders around the world the highlights of Kanekaʼs CSR activities. The opening section describes how we strive to respond to our stakeholders' expectations based on communication with them, and our unique approach to offer new value. Many of our employees appear in the Special Features and Topics sections to highlight each key role they play in communication. The Two Special Features present how we at the Kaneka Group are working on food production support and health care―two of our four key strategic domains―in our core businesses. The section on Our Initiatives for Social Responsibility shows how we have implemented our CSR activities focusing on the businesses in the Groupʼs key strategic domains as well as the history of our CSR efforts. ● Organizations Covered in This Report This report covers Kaneka Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries both in Japan and other countries.
