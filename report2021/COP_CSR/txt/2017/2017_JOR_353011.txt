COP July, 2017 Consulting Engineering Center (CEC Sajdi & Partners) COP 2017 Page | 1 COP July, 2017 Human Rights Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: CEC has always been committed to excellence by following the universal standards of operation at all levels. This is seen in our Core Values which is represented in the following statement:” We are Committed to our clients -through Excellenceto provide our services with Integrity and Respect.” In addition, our up-to-date ISO, EFQM, FCIC and the KAIIAE are certifications and awards attesting to our commitment to the Human Rights Principles, which is one of the components of these certificates’ methodologies. Moreover, our latest commitment to join, contribute and attend the UN Leaders’ Summit in NY, 2016 also is evidence to our commitment to the issue. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labor principles to our stakeholders. Here is a brief of what each accreditation is: EFQM: Recognized for excellence Certificate (R4E) (3 Star-2012) from the European foundation for Quality Management FCIC: Federation of Consultants from Islamic Countries (FCIC) KAIIAE: King Abdullah II Award for Excellence (the highest award at the local Level) Implementation: CEC’s implementation of the Human Rights issue is seen in the following: • CEC has a Quality Procedure Manual which every employee is familiar with, have access to and is required to follow at all times. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis in various formats from emails, presentations to surveys. These prompts keep our employees aligned which is one of our strategic objectives. One of the awareness promotes that was conducted this year was presented by the Global Compact Network Jordan by Eng. Aya Mansour (the contact person for the UNGC in Jordan) after a request from the CIM unit at CEC.A presentation about the UNGC 10 principles and the 17 SDGs was presented to CEC employees. • CEC participated in the CGNJ activities and events. One such event was entitled “Our Renaissance in Our Partnership”; a session about the 10th principle of the UNGC (Anti-corruption) and its relevance to the MENA region. • Implementing the CSR’s Action Plan for the year. Page | 3 COP July, 2017 • Our Social and Cultural Committee was formed in 2006. The members are elected on an annual basis aiming to provide a platform of synergy between the employees and management. The Corporate Image Management unit was formed in 2009. This unit’s duties and responsibilities are to demonstrate CEC’s corporate image and the added value of our services, as well as, to enhance the culture of Self Responsibility and Corporate Social Responsibility. Moreover, the CIM unit has specific procedures (CSR Manual) and develops a yearly action plan. The manual is annually reviewed and the action plan’s outcomes are measured and communicated with our stockholders. Since 2014, and for each year thereafter, we have supported an NGO which aims to bridge the gap between formal education and the labor market’s needs. We contribute with our volunteers in the designated schools of their choice. Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are now in our third 5-year strategy cycle. From our Balanced Scorecard then, we have objectives, initiatives, measures and/or targets. Following is what is relevant to the Human Rights issue: • Quarterly review meetings are held to review the Balance Scorecard Strategy measures of outcomes or KPI’s. • Each of our employee has a job description and procedures specific to his/her job and are audited internally and externally every year. • We require our business partners and our staff to abide by the safety requirements: from enforcing safety gear on construction sites, to the safety measures to the public in the area. This is followed up by the Quality Department at project sites. • We abide and require our business partners to work on an “Environment Assessment” for each project. This is part of our Project Quality Plan (PQP) which is also included in our Procedure Manual. • Our Environment Policy has objectives, initiatives, measures and is reviewed on a yearly basis. The outcome of the review is a new action plan for the following year. • The “Core Values Commitment Questionnaire has been conducted on a quarterly basis for several years now. The results are measured against their target and compared to the previous year. Preventive measures are taken for falling short of the target. Page | 4 COP July, 2017 • While we give equal opportunity to candidates, we use the standard procedure for recruitment to ensure that we hire the most competent employee irrespective to gender, religion, or race. Our equality for hiring is seen in the fact that our male to female ratio is at 54 % and our hiring is posted on our website, social media and local newspapers. • Neighborhood Questionnaires are made on a yearly basis to make sure that none of our staff have violated their parking spaces, privacy or have committed any other misconduct. • Ergonomics Survey is conducted every two years to look into the needs and complaints of our staff. Recommendations are made and sent to the management for approval. It was noticed that the results of the survey that was conducted in 2017 was at 82.2 % compared to the result of 2015 which was at 76.1%. • Employee Satisfaction Survey is conducted on an annual basis covering issues such as: general working conditions, pay and promotion potential, use of skill & abilities. Actions are taken by our management to insure a high level of employe satisfaction. • Reviewing CSR’s KPI’s at the end of each year brings about the new changes that need to be done in our next CSR action plan. • The Social and Cultural Committee end of year evaluation by the staff through independent survey. • See Appendix for our:  Environment Policy-Action Plan  Strategy Map  Core Values  Commitment to Core Values Questionnaire sample.  Employee Satisfaction Survey  CSR Manual  Social and cultural committee survey Labor Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our Manual Procedure covers not only the duties and responsibilities of each job at the company, but provides the employees’ labor rights as well. We have a dedicated resource that monitors and mandates labor laws. Our Strategic Objective of “Enhance Knowledge Management” under the learning and growth perspective engages the employees while providing them with a platform for freedom of Page | 5 COP July, 2017 association and collective bargaining. This goes hand in hand with the Social and Cultural Committee discussed earlier. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labour principles to our stakeholders and to maintain our compliance with labor laws and other official holidays. Implementation: • Our Procedure Manual, as well as, the New Employee Handbook provide the knowledge of labor rightsamong other informationregarding the employee. • Medical Insurance Coverage • Social Security. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis to inform employees regarding new labor laws or health issues. One such presentation was “Ergonomics” presentation. • Continuous Human Resources and the Finance departments’ training and upto date knowledge on the local labor laws. They are the dedicated resource for labor rights. • Based on our management’s belief of the importance of work-life balance, the working hours have been reduced one hour a day in 2011. The number of weekly working hours at CEC became 41.25 h versus 48h by labor law. • CEC is committed to the official holidays announced by the government due to religious, national and other occasions. • The Social and Cultural Committee provides a platform for employees to voice their opinions and thoughts. There are many activities made by SCC during the year. For an example, arranging outdoor lunches, celebrating national and religious occasions, arranging for the yearly picnic and many other activities. SCC members are elected each year by CEC employees. • Our Incentive Program Fast Track is disclosed to our employees and is reviewed periodically. • Our Information Management System is an open domain to our employees. It includes the official manuals on labor laws and the updated social security benefits. • Tuesday Talk: A weekly meeting where an employee picks a random topic to talk about for 3 minutes in front of the attendees, giving the speaker the opportunity to train and experience public speaking. Page | 6 COP July, 2017 Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are currently in our third 5-year strategy cycle.

Page | 7 COP July, 2017 Environment Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: We have an Environment Policy since 2006 which is also part of our Quality Management system. we have identified “Operational Excellence” as our customer value prospection in our Strategy. Increase Utilization of Staff and Resources, and Enhance Project Quality Plan implementation are two strategic objectives, among others, that enable us to achieve Operational Excellence. Our goal is to decrease our recyclable waste and to shift to renewable energy whenever possible. Implementation: • We do and require our business partners to do an Environment Impact Assessment as part of our procedures within each Project Quality Plan to insure that the projects are in alignment with our Environment policy. • The energy saving installations from LED’s light bulbs to motion sensors in sinks and automatic air dryers’ equipment in toilettes have decreased consumption of both energy and paper. • Energy saving by installing reflective tinted sheets on windows. • The “Go Green” initiative by the Corporate Image Management Unit in 2014 has led to: Paper recycling in association with Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute. Provided awareness prompts on energy saving. Planted trees by CEC employees wherever they were in the world on 1/2017 CEC has supported an Environmental initiative related to waste recycling and reduction of plastic usage to preserve the environment by a group of 12 yearold students. They aimed at spreading awareness and to deliver their message to the decision-makers. • The Creativity and Development Committee has embarked on installing solar panels at CEC’s HQ in Jordan as a renewable energy while substituting diesel consumption and CO2 emissions. • We develop an Environment Policy Action Plan on a yearly basis. • CEC is a member at the JES (Jordan Environment Society) and always contribute to its activities related to the Environment. Page | 8 COP July, 2017 Measurement of Outcomes: • Yearly external audits by the ISO insuring the implementation of our Environment Policy action plan. • Yearly review of the Environment Policy results or KPI’s by upper management. • Yearly reporting by Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute re our recycled paper. Outcomes of our achievement in recycling paper for the year is shared with our employees by giving the CO2 emissions and mature trees saved. • See Appendix for our:  Environment Policy Action KPI’s for the last 3 years.  Sample of the Recycled Poster which we have shared on the board.  Figures regarding the Solar Panels. Anti-Corruption principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our core values in a statement is: “We are committed to our clients-through excellenceto provide our services with Integrity and Respect.” Integrity is where we state that we do our services without favoritism. Implementation: • We ensure that our engineering services are provided to clients following our Quality Management System (QMS) which, in turn, is regularly audited by internal auditors. This system insures that every employee is doing his/her duties according to the QMS standards without bias or favoritism. This system ensures verification and validation by staff in independent departments to prove that all decisions are correctly taken. • One of our initiatives within the Corporate Social Responsibility action plan-under the Clients & Business Partners beneficiary is to “Emphasize CEC’s Governance, Credibility and Transparency.” • We have participated in the CGNJ activities and events of 2016-2017. One such event was entitled, “Our Renaissance in Our Partnership”: a session about the 10th principle of the UNGC (Anti-corruption) and how it relates in the MENA region Page | 9 COP July, 2017 Measurement of Outcomes The measures of the initiative “Emphasize CEC’s Governance, Credibility and Transparency” are: • Measuring the number of non-compliance to CEC's Quality Management System (QMS) during the internal audits. • Measuring the employees’ commitment to core values with a target of 80%. • Implementation of CEC’s Governance Compliance Procedures with a target of 100%. • Disclosure of CEC’s COP, or Sustainable Report on the UN Global Compact Website. • See Appendix for our:  CSR Action Plan for 2015  Core Values Note: CEC has Joined the Global Compact Local Network in Jordan in 1/2016 and renewed the membership in 2/2017.
