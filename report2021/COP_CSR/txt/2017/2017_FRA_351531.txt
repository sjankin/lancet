The Group is at the heart of a virtuous ecosystem that benefits more than 43 million people worldwide every day. Edenred has been a pioneering group for more than 50 years, with 7,232 committed employees in 42 countries. Our sustainable development approach, with our “Ideal” program, combined with our corporate culture and Human Resources policies are key drivers of this sustainable growth. Our CSR policy, a federating approach consistent with our activities Edenred’s solutions have long been built around an employee-led social responsibility commitment. Our Ticket Restaurant® meal voucher was invented to address a social issue by encouraging employees to take a lunch break, thereby improving sanitary conditions and limiting the use of lunchboxes in the workplace. Today, our “Ideal” program is demonstrating this commitment in three areas: healthy eating habits, environmental stewardship and local community development. Ideal acts as a driver of growth, performance and team mobilization. A corporate culture positioning our stakeholders at the heart of our actions Our quality management approach is designed to place our Customers at the centre of all our actions and decisions, in support of the Group’s development strategy. By our Customers we mean our client companies, their employees and our affiliated merchants, but also our employees, shareholders, public authorities and the Community. Listening and answering the needs of these stakeholders at the centre of our philosophy. Our employees, first ambassadors of our values As our most valuable asset, people have been a core component of Edenred’s growth strategy over the past 50 years. They embody the pioneering spirit that has driven our success, demonstrating every day their ability to take action and deliver superior performance. In today’s changing environment, we rely more than ever on our employees to achieve our goal in the spirit of our values. With these solid strengths and a clear strategic plan for the future, I am very confident that we will meet conditions to keep and accelerate our development.
