New frameworks were launched in order to achieve a more sustainable world, like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, aiming at aligning emissions reduction targets on scientific scenario, which entered into force at the end of the year, and much more. Standards were also updated or developed, such as ISO 20400 on Sustainable Procurement which will be released in 2017, or ISO 37001 on anti-bribery; GRI G4 Guidelines transitioned to the GRI Standards, and the EU Directive on non-financial reporting will be translated to law in 2017. DFGE considers such movements very positive, as they show strong signals towards that various players are striving for a more sustainable world. The reinforcement of CSR standards shows a will to structure and universalize such principles, as when participating to UNGC. DFGE wants to support such positive trends. In this sense, we have always aligned and partnered with international recognized organizations. For example, we renewed this year our partnership agreement with the CDP, and we were chosen as the only EcoVadis consulting partner in the German-speaking region. We strongly want to support our customers in being more sustainable, by setting a sustainability strategy and targets, taking part in external standards, implementing actions such as emissions reduction initiatives, and measuring and reporting related metrics in a proper way. We actively promote sustainable topics to our customers, including UNGC. As a sustainability solutions provider, it is important for us to apply such principles ourselves, and show our stakeholders that we commit to them. We strongly believe in sustainability standards and frameworks; this is why we commit to the UNGC and are happy to report our activities and improvement in this Communication On Progress. We hope that you will find valuable information in this report. Greifenberg/Munich, January 2017 Dr.-Ing.

Definition: In the UNGC principles, labor refers to the right to collective bargaining, as well as the prohibition of forced labor and child labor and the principle of non-discrimination. Level of risk: Even if these risks are not likely to manifest for DFGE due to location, size and sector, DFGE commits to prevent any form of forced and child labor, recognizes the right to collective bargaining and wants to prevent any form of discrimination in hiring, promoting, training, paying or dismissing employees. Statement: As far as DFGE is concerned, the following principles apply:  Discrimination, e.g. any distinction, exclusion or preference that has the effect of nullifying equality of treatment or opportunity based on illegitimate grounds (like gender, marital status etc.), is prohibited. DFGE promotes diversity and equal opportunities.  Violation of fundamentals human rights is prohibited  Any form of violence and harassment is forbidden. Workplace violence is defined by the ILO as homicide, assault, threats, mobbing and bullying on the job as forms of violence at work DFGE UNGC COP 2017 – CY16 Page 6 of 14 © DFGE, Greifenberg/Munich, 2017 3.2 Description of actions  Compliance with law  Collective bargaining: Mechanism of yearly assessment interviews and quarterly discussion.

New action:  Dedicated job offer to make sure to recruit employees on objective criteria 3.3 Measurement of outcomes We are happy to announce that our targets were reached:  No breach of labor right is to be reported.  Among new employees hired, 66% were women, showing that diversity is important for DFGE. DFGE UNGC COP 2017 – CY16 Page 7 of 14 © DFGE, Greifenberg/Munich, 2017 4 Environment 4.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 7 Principle 8 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental environmental challenges; responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Definition: According to the UNGC, environmental challenges refer to climate change, water, energy, biodiversity and agriculture. Corporate efforts should focus on meeting environmental responsibilities, valuing natural capital, and better understanding the linkages between resources. Level of risk: Being a service company, DFGE’s environment-related risk can be considered moderate. Nevertheless, there is a certain impact and responsibility which DFGE will assume, e.g. in the areas of procurement, resource consumption or employee commuting. Statement: DFGE commits to lower its resource consumption, to reduce the company-wide carbon footprint and to forgo all practices which have a negative environmental impact through the release of harmful substances. Furthermore, DFGE commits to actively promote UNGC principles to its customers, and to explicitly procure products whose environmental impact is certified to be low. DFGE UNGC COP 2017 – CY16 Page 8 of 14 © DFGE, Greifenberg/Munich, 2017 4.2 Description of actions  Consequent waste separation  Compensation of emissions from heating oil  Cooperation with the local supermarket regarding the use of re-usable plastic bowls  Car sharing scheme for employees, home working scheme New actions:  Office-wide installation of multi-pole sockets which can be switched off during the night  Emissions compensation from letter mailing by making use of the GoGreen program by Deutsche Post  Process description for employees regarding the reduction of energy and resource consumption and regarding environment-friendly commuting / traveling. 4.3 Measurement of outcomes  No reported incidents of violation against any legal obligations in the environmental field  DFGE’s total carbon footprint decreased by 5% to about 20t CO2e in the reporting year  Relative carbon emissions per FTE decreased even stronger  Several hundreds of kilogram CO2e could be saved by our car sharing scheme  About 56% of emissions can be categorized as direct emissions (Scope 1), about 42% of emissions belong to upstream and downstream indirect emissions (Scope 3). Indirect emissions from use of energy can be considered low (about 2%, Scope 2) (see figure 4-1). Figure 4-1: CO2e emissions categorized in Scopes DFGE UNGC COP 2017 – CY16 Page 9 of 14 © DFGE, Greifenberg/Munich, 2017 5 Anti-corruption 5.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Definition: Anti-corruption is “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”2. It can take many forms: moneylaundering, fraud, conflict of interest, … It can also be linked to fair competition. Risk: quite low. According to Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, Germany scores 79, and ranks 12 on 175 countries3, meaning that the corruption risk is low in Germany. However, we identify some risks from tendering and linked to our carbon footprint activities.  According to the European commission, when dealing with German public procurement, companies can face “collusive biding, conflicts of interest in the evaluation of bids, the involvement of bidders in the design of specifications, unclear selection or evaluation criteria, and tailor-made specifications for particular companies4”. This can be extended to private sector also.  In the field of climate protection, or more precisely in the field of emission permits there have been reported incidents of tax fraud as well as other irregularities. DFGE never was nor is involved in the trade with emission permits, green electricity or similar products. Statement: DFGE commits to prohibit and prevent embezzlement, money-laundering, fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, extortion among others. DFGE commits to comply with competition framework. DFGE complies with all applicable laws in this sense. 2 Source : Transparency International 3 Source: http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results 4 Source: European Commission, Feb. 2014 (http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-centralasia/germany/public-procurement.aspx) DFGE UNGC COP 2017 – CY16 Page 10 of 14 © DFGE, Greifenberg/Munich, 2017 5.2 Description of actions To prevent corruption:  Compliance with law  Implementation of accountability principles following the German (tax) law via a tax attorney.  Robust and science-based methodology that prevents false carbon certificates New action:  Reinforcement of IT policies, with dedicated server control, companies phone, new access roles, in order to protect the data 5.3 Measurement of outcomes As a matter of course our methods and actions were compliant with the above mentioned regulations and recommendations.
