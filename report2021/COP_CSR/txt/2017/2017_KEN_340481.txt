In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Company at 31 December 2016 and of the financial performance and cash flows of the Group and the Company for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Kenya, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Consolidated financial statements which are: i. Power over the investee; ii. Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and iii. The ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. The assessment of these indicators involves interpretation of the structure and operations of the structured entities. As this was our first year as auditor of the Group, a review of this complex determination was a key audit matter for the audit team. Other information The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. 30 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED (Continued) Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the financial statements The directors are responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act 2015, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The directors are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and Company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. www.nse.co.ke 31 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED (Continued) Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (Continued) From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements As required by the Kenyan Companies Act 2015 we report to you, based on our audit, that: • we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit; • in our opinion proper books of account have been kept by the Company, so far as appears from our examination of those books; and • the Company’s statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss and comprehensive income are in agreement with the books of account.

The NSE is licensed as an exchange by the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) of Kenya and obtained a license on 19 October 2015 to operate a derivatives exchange. The NSE currently has the primary market services as a main line of business. The consolidated financial statements of the Group at and for the year ended 31 December 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiary and controlled structured entities (collectively referred to as the “Group”) and reflect the Company’s interest in an associate company. For the Kenyan Companies Act reporting purposes, in these financial statements, the balance sheet is represented by the statement of financial position and the profit and loss account is presented in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. 2 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AFFECTING THE REPORTED RESULTS OR FINANCIAL POSITION The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated. a) Statement of compliance The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and the Companies Act (Cap. 486). b) Basis of preparation i. Basis of measurement The measurement basis used is the historical cost basis except where otherwise stated in the accounting policies below. For those assets and liabilities measured at fair value, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. If the fair value of an asset or a liability is not directly observable, it is estimated by the Group using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs (e.g. by use of the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar items or discounted cash flow analysis). Inputs used are consistent with the characteristics of the asset/liability that market participants would take into account. Fair values are categorised into three levels of fair value hierarchy based on the degree to which the inputs to the measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety: Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognised by the Group at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred 38 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AFFECTING THE REPORTED RESULTS OR FINANCIAL POSITION (Continued) b) Basis of preparation (continued) ii. Use of estimates and judgment The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the directors to exercise their judgment in the process of applying the Group’s and Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4. iii. Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) New and amended standards adopted by the Group All new and revised standards and interpretations that have become effective for the first time in the financial year beginning 1 January 2016 merely clarify the existing requirements, thus do not affect the Group’s accounting policies or any of the disclosures. These include: Amendments to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’: The amendments provide clarifications on a number of issues, including: • Materiality: An entity should not aggregate or disaggregate information in a manner that obscures useful information. Where items are material, sufficient information must be provided to explain the impact on the financial position or performance. • Disaggregation and subtotals: Line items specified in IAS 1 may need to be disaggregated where this is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position or performance. • Notes: Confirmation that the notes do not need to be presented in a particular order. • OCI arising from investments accounted for under the equity method: The share of OCI arising from equity-accounted investments is grouped based on whether the items will or will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss. Each group should then be presented as a single line item in the statement of other comprehensive income. According to the transitional provisions, the disclosures in IAS 8 regarding the adoption of new standards/ accounting policies are not required for these amendments. Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle: The latest annual improvements, clarify: • IFRS 5: when an asset (or disposal group) is reclassified from ‘held for sale’ to ‘held for distribution’ or vice versa, this does not constitute a change to a plan of sale or distribution and does not have to be accounted for as such. • IFRS 7: Gives specific guidance for transferred financial assets to help management determine whether the terms of a servicing arrangement constitute ‘continuing involvement’ and, therefore, whether the asset qualifies for derecognition. • IFRS 7: Improvements clarified that the additional disclosures relating to the offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities only need to be included in interim reports if required by IAS 34. • IAS 19: Improvements clarified that when determining the discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations, it is the currency that the liabilities are denominated in that is important and not the country where they arise. • IAS 34: Improvements clarified what is meant by the reference in the standard to ‘information disclosed elsewhere in the interim financial report’ and adds a requirement to cross-reference from the interim financial statements to the location of that information and make the information available to users on the same terms and at the same time as the interim financial statements. www.nse.co.ke 39 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AFFECTING THE REPORTED RESULTS OR FINANCIAL POSITION (Continued) b) Basis of preparation (continued) iii. Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (continued) New and amended standards adopted by the Group (continued) Amendment to IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’: The amendments allow entities to use the equity method in their separate financial statements to measure investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. IAS 27 currently allows entities to measure their investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates either at cost or as a financial asset in their separate financial statements. The amendments introduce the equity method as a third option. The election can be made independently for each category of investment (subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates). Entities wishing to change to the equity method must do so retrospectively. Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’: These amendments clarifies the accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation where the activities of the operation constitute a business. They require an investor to apply the principles of business combination accounting when it acquires an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business. This includes measuring identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value; expensing acquisition-related costs; recognising deferred tax, and; recognising the residual as goodwill, and testing this for impairment annually. Existing interests in the joint operation are not re-measured on acquisition of an additional interest, provided joint control is maintained. The amendments also apply when a joint operation is formed and an existing business is contributed. Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: The IASB has amended IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment to clarify that a revenue-based method should not be used to calculate the depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment. IAS 38 Intangible Assets now includes a rebuttable presumption that the amortisation of intangible assets based on revenue is inappropriate. This presumption can be overcome if either: the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue (i.e. where a measure of revenue is the limiting factor on the value that can be derived from the asset), or it can be shown that revenue and the consumption of economic benefits generated by the asset are highly correlated. Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures: Clarifies that: • The exception from preparing consolidated financial statements is also available to intermediate parent entities which are subsidiaries of investment entities. • An investment entity should consolidate a subsidiary which is not an investment entity and whose main purpose and activity is to provide services in support of the investment entity’s investment activities. • Entities which are not investment entities but have an interest in an associate or joint venture which is an investment entity have a policy choice when applying the equity method of accounting. The fair value measurement applied by the investment entity associate or joint venture can either be retained, or a consolidation may be performed at the level of the associate or joint venture, which would then unwind the fair value measurement. New and revised standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet effective The Group has not applied the following revised standards and interpretations that have been published but are not yet effective for the year beginning after 1 January 2016. IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through OCI and fair value through P&L. 40 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AFFECTING THE REPORTED RESULTS OR FINANCIAL POSITION (Continued) b) Basis of preparation (continued) iii. Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (continued) New and revised standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet effective (continued) The basis of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early adoption is permitted. IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted. IFRS 16,’Leases’: This standard requires that lessees should be required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from all leases (with limited exceptions) on the balance sheet. Lessor accounting has not substantially changed in the new standard. The model reflects that, at the start of a lease, the lessee obtains the right to use an asset for a period of time and has an obligation to pay for that right. In response to concerns expressed about the cost and complexity to apply the requirements to large volumes of small assets, the IASB decided not to require a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for short-term leases (less than 12 months), and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value (such as laptops and office furniture). The standard is effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2019. Early adoption is permitted only if IFRS 15 is adopted at the same time. Recognition of Deferred Tax Asset for Unrealised Losses: IAS 12 has been amended to clarify the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Specifically, the amendments confirm that: • A temporary difference exists whenever the carrying amount of an asset is less than its tax base at the end of the reporting period. • An entity can assume that it will recover an amount higher than the carrying amount of an asset to estimate its future taxable profit. • Where the tax law restricts the source of taxable profits against which particular types of deferred tax assets can be recovered, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets can only be assessed in combination with other deferred tax assets of the same type. • Tax deductions resulting from the reversal of deferred tax assets are excluded from the estimated future taxable profit that is used to evaluate the recoverability of those assets. The amendment to IAS 12 is effective 1 January 2017. www.nse.co.ke 41 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 2 STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS AFFECTING THE REPORTED RESULTS OR FINANCIAL POSITION (Continued) b) Basis of preparation (continued) iii. Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (continued) New and revised standards and interpretations which have been issued but are not yet effective (continued) Disclosure Initiative – Amendments to IAS 7: Effective 1 January 2017, entities will be required to explain changes in their liabilities arising from financing activities. This includes changes arising from cash flows (e.g. drawdowns and repayments of borrowings) and on cash changes such as acquisitions, disposals, accretion of interest and unrealized exchange differences. Changes in financial assets must be included in this disclosure if the cash flows were, or will be included in cash flows from financing activities. This could be the case, for example, for assets that hedge liabilities arising from financing liabilities. Entities may include changes in other items as part of this disclosure, for example, by providing a, net debt, reconciliation. However, in this case the changes in other items must be disclosed separately from the changes in liabilities arising from financing activities. The information may be disclosed in tabular format as reconciliation from opening and closing balances, but a specific format is not mandated. The Directors are assessing the impact of the standards and will subsequently choose the adoption date. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group. 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 3.1 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Nairobi Securities Exchange Limited and its subsidiary, controlled structured entities and interest in associate company made up to 31 December 2016. The subsidiary and structured entities undertakings have been fully consolidated. (i) Subsidiary Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The group controls an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change 42 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.1 Basis of consolidation (continued) (i) Subsidiary (continued) to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the profit or loss. The Group financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the operations of the NSE Clear Limited, a company formed to act as a central counterparty in all the derivative transactions. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Details of NSE’s subsidiary are set out in Note 16. The accounting policies of the subsidiary have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. (ii) Structured entities The NSE Derivatives Settlement Guarantee Fund and the NSE Derivatives Investor Protection Fund are trusts established under the Trustee Act (Cap. 167) pursuant to the statutory obligations imposed on the NSE, as a licensed exchange, by the provisions of the Capital Markets (Derivatives Markets) Regulations, 2015 and clause 1.90 and 1.10 of the NSE Derivatives Rules. Clause 1.90 requires that the NSE, shall by itself or through a clearing house, establish and maintain a Settlement Guarantee Fund to strengthen the financial integrity of the derivatives market and ensure settlement of transactions in derivatives securities in case of default by a clearing member (CM). Clause 1.10 requires that the NSE shall establish and maintain an Investor Protection Fund to satisfy specified claims by the investing public arising out of non-settlement of obligations owed to them by trading members or losses incurred by reason of the default of the trading members up to an amount specified in the rules. Management and administration of the assets and operations of these trusts is done by a management committee formed by the NSE Clear Board of Directors. The Trustees of the funds act as the custodians and trustees of the assets of these Funds as defined in the trust deeds and rules of these Funds. The Fund’s assets are segregated from the assets of the NSE and the NSE Clear Limited but are effectively controlled by NSE Clear Limited. The NSE, by virtue of its role as the parent company of the clearing house, NSE Clear Limited, has to consolidate the results of these funds in its annual financial statements. The subsidiary and structured entities are stated at cost in the separate financial statements of the Company. Separate financial statements are prepared for the subsidiary and the structured entities, and independent external audits performed. (iii) Investment in associate Associates are those entities which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% to 50% of the voting power of another entity. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate in excess of the Group’s interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. www.nse.co.ke 43 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.2 Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups’ interest in the investee. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment. 3.3 Foreign currencies i) Functional and presentation currency The financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “Functional Currency”). The financial statements are presented in Kenya Shillings, which is the Group’s and the Company’s Functional and Presentation Currency. Except as indicated, financial information presented in Kenya Shillings has been rounded to the nearest thousand. ii) Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions that are transactions denominated, or that require settlement, in a foreign currency are translated into the respective functional currencies of the operations using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial instruments, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial instruments, such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in other comprehensive income. 3.4 Revenue recognition Transaction levy income is based on a percentage of the value of shares traded and is recognised on the dates of the transactions. Initial listing income is recognized in the year in which the listing company makes the flotation. Additional listing income is recognized during the year in which the issuing company makes announcement of the bonus/rights issues. Annual listing fee is computed on the basis of the daily weighted average capitalisation value of the listed securities for the 11 months period between 1 January and 30 November. Interest income from a financial asset is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition. 44 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.4 Revenue recognition (continued) Rental income from investment property is recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Management services income is charged to the NSE Clear Limited based on direct and indirect costs incurred on staff assigned to the NSE Clear Limited and a proportion of office and administration overhead expenses. 3.5 Property and equipment The building is carried at valuation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the year. The frequency of valuation is at least every five years. Motor vehicles and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Professional valuations on buildings are carried out in accordance with the Group policy. The fair value is determined based on the market comparable approach that reflects recent transaction prices for similar properties. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. There has been no change to the valuation technique during the year. Increases in the carrying amounts of property resulting from revaluation is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognized in profit or loss, in which case the increase is credited to profit or loss to the extent of the decrease previously expensed. A decrease in carrying amount arising on the revaluation of buildings is recognized in profit or loss to the extent that it exceeds the balance, if any, held in the properties revaluation reserve relating to a previous revaluation of that asset. Each year the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of an asset (the depreciation charged to profit or loss) and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost is transferred from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings. Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: Motor vehicles 4 years Furniture, fittings and partitions 8 years Office equipment 4 years Computer equipment 4 years Buildings Over the remaining period of the lease An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its estimated recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of equipment are determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal and taken into account in determining operating profit. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the building are included in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise net of deferred taxes. www.nse.co.ke 45 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.6 Intangible assets Intangible assets represent computer software which is stated at cost less amortisation. Amortisation is calculated to write-off software on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 4 – 10 years. 3.7 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated and an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss whenever the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. 3.8 Investment property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals, is stated at its fair value, at the reporting date as determined through its revaluation by external valuers on the basis of the highest and best use. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the investment property are included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise net of deferred taxes. 3.9 Restricted cash and investments The Group classifies all cash, cash equivalents and investments that are not available for general use by the Group, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, as restricted in the accompanying statement of financial position. Short-term restricted cash and investments As required by the Capital Markets (Derivatives Markets) Regulations, 2015, the Group is required to maintain a minimum liquid net-worth capital requirement equal to one half of the total estimated operating costs for the next twelve (12) months period. At 31 December 2016, this amount was Sh 292.5 million (2015: Sh 333.5 million). The amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments (note 21). Long-term restricted cash and investments The NSE has contributed Sh 20 million, Sh 100 million and Sh 10 million as seed capital to the subsidiary, NSE Clear Limited, and the structured entities, NSE Derivatives Settlement Guarantee Fund and NSE Derivatives Investor Protection Fund respectively. These amounts could be used in the event of a clearing/ trading member’s default where the amount of the defaulting clearing/trading member’s initial, variation and additional margins and guarantee fund deposits are insufficient (note 19). These amounts together with related earned interest are held in bank deposits that have been classified as restricted. 3.10 Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; loans and receivables and held to maturity investments. Management determines appropriate classification for its investments at initial recognition. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) This category has two sub-categories: Financial assets classified as held for trading and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are those which were either acquired for generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealer’s margin, or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit-taking exists. Investments classified as fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at cost and subsequently re-measured to fair value based on quoted bid prices or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. 46 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.10 Financial instruments (continued) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) (continued) All related realised and unrealised gains and losses are included in the profit or loss. Interest earned whilst holding held for trading investments is reported as investment income. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement at cost, receivables are subsequently remeasured to amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees and costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Held to maturity investments Held to maturity financial investments are those which carry fixed or determinable payments and have fixed maturities and which the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity. After initial measurement, held to maturity financial investments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any allowances for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The amortisation and losses arising from impairment of such investments are recognised in the profit or loss. Derecognition of financial assets Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the financial assets has expired or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities (including borrowings and trade payables) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where applicable) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition. www.nse.co.ke 47 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.10 Financial instruments (continued) Classes of financial instruments The Group classifies the financial instruments into classes that reflect the nature of information and take into account the characteristics of those financial instruments. The classification made can be seen in the table as follows: Class and sub class Category (as defined by IAS 39) (as determined by the Group) Financial assets at Financial assets designated at fair value fair value through through profit or loss: Quoted shares profit or loss Long-term restricted investments Financial Trade and other receivables assets Loans and Due from related company Financial receivables Short-term restricted cash and investments assets and Cash and cash equivalents liabilities Fixed deposits Held-to-maturity Investment securities debt securities: investments Government securities Corporate bonds Financial Tenant deposits liabilities Financial liabilities Trade and other payables at amortised cost Dividends payable Due to structured entity Trading members’ contributions 3.11 Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash equivalents include short term liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which were within three months of maturity when acquired, less advances from banks repayable within three months from the dates of the advances. 3.12 Employee entitlements Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the date of reporting. 3.13 Segmental reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the chief operating decision maker (Group management). An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Costs in the NSE are managed holistically across the Exchange and variances against budget are closely monitored. Information technology and corporate overheads are not generally allocated to a particular segment. 48 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.14 Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the current income tax and deferred income tax. Current income tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Management establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences are utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from good will or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Current and deferred income tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income. 3.15 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution provident scheme for all its employees. The scheme is administered by Britam Life Assurance Company (Kenya) Limited and is funded by contributions from both the Group and employees. The Group also contributes to a statutory contribution pension scheme, the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). The Group’s obligations under the scheme are limited to specific contributions legislated from time to time. The Group’s contributions to these schemes are charged to the profit or loss in the year in which they relate. 3.16 Dividends payable Dividends payable on ordinary shares are charged to retained earnings in the period in which they are declared. Proposed dividends are not accrued for until ratified in an Annual General Meeting. 3.17 Earnings per share The Group presents earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shareholders in the financial statements. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the NSE by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding adjusted for the effects of all potentially dilutive shares. www.nse.co.ke 49 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 3.18 Shares reserves and share premium Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 3.19 Minimum liquid net worth requirement The Capital Markets (Derivatives Market) Regulations, 2015 clause 15 (1) and 15 (2) require that a futures exchange have and maintain a minimum liquid net-worth equal to one half of the estimated gross operating costs of the futures exchange for the next twelve (12) month period or such other liquid networth amount as may be prescribed by the Authority. The requirement is met as per Note 35. 3.20 Comparatives Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform to changes in the presentation in the current year. 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINITY In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key areas of judgment and estimation in applying the entities accounting policies are dealt with below: Taxes The Group is subjected to numerous taxes and levies by various government and quasigovernment regulatory bodies. As a rule of thumb, the Group recognises liabilities for the anticipated tax/levies payable with utmost care and diligence. However, significant judgment is usually required in the interpretation and applicability of those taxes/levies. Should it come to the attention of management, in one way or the other, that the initially recorded liability was erroneous, such differences will impact on the income and liabilities in the period in which such differences are determined. Property, equipment and software The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of equipment and software at the end of each reporting period. Impairment losses At each date of reporting, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Valuation of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments where no active market exists or where quoted prices are not otherwise available are determined by using valuation techniques. In these cases, the fair values are estimated from observable data in respect of similar financial instruments or using models. Where market observable inputs are not available, they are estimated based on appropriate assumptions. Where valuation techniques (for example, models) are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of those that sourced them. The directors believe that the chosen valuation techniques and assumptions used in the valuation of its investments are appropriate in determining the fair value of financial instruments. 50 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 5 OPERATING SEGMENTS The Group entities are all domiciled in Kenya.

The directors review and determine policies for managing these risks. (a) Market risk The Group and the Company maintains a conservative policy regarding currency and interest rate risks and does not engage in speculation in the markets. In addition, the Group and the Company do not speculate or trade in derivative financial instruments. 70 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2016 NAIROBI SECURITIES EXCHANGE LIMITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 33 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (Continued) (a) Market risk (continued) (i) Interest rate risk (Group and Company) The Group’s investment in interest earning investments are at fixed rate hence there is no interest rate risk. Further, interest earning investments are not fair valued and therefore, fair value interest rate risk does not arise. (ii) Foreign currency exchange risk (Group and Company) The Group and Company undertake certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Therefore, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Exchange rate exposures are however minimal as these only relate to income from data. At 31 December, the carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are as follows: 2016 2015 Sh’000 Sh’000 Assets Cash and bank balances 7,134 18,070 Trade receivables 747 287 _______ _______ 7,881 18,357 Liabilities Trade payables (8,424) (5,753) _______ _______ Net position (543) 12,604 ====== ====== At 31 December 2016, if the Shilling had weakened/strengthened by 10% against the US Dollar with all other variables held constant, the impact on pretax profit for the period would have been Sh 54,000 (2015: Sh 1,260,000) higher/lower mainly as a result of translation of US dollar denominated balances. (iii) Price risk (Group and Company) The Group and Company do not hold investments that would be subject to price risk; hence this risk is not relevant. (b) Credit risk (Group and Company) Credit risk refers to the risk that a counter party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group and the Company. Credit risk arises from deposits with banks, as well as trade receivables. Management assesses the credit quality of each customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by the banking regulatory authority. Bank balances and term deposits are fully performing. Balances under the fully performing category are expected to be recovered in full as the debtors are paying their debts as they continue trading. Balances in the past due category are partly impaired. Balances under the impaired category are long overdue debts that have been fully provided for.

This level includes Corporate bonds traded on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”). ii) Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Input data for this category is sourced mainly from the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The external valuation of buildings and investment property has been performed using a sales comparison approach. iii) Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
