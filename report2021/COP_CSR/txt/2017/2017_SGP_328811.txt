Implementation of the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact Over 9,200 businesses from 164 countries have pledged to uphold the ten principles relating to human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption efforts defined in the UN Global Compact. In 2000, Credit Suisse became one of the first companies to sign up to this leading international initiative on responsible business practices.
