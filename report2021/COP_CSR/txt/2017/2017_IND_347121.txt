This is an important report that summarises the slew of positive changes we made during the year, by following the tenets of financial prudence, operational excellence and enhancing capacity utilization for the company, thereby creating long-term value for all our stakeholders. In FY 2015-16, the steel and power sector in India faced multifarious external challenges. Yet in spite of tepid demand we reported a 26% increase in volume of steel sold – an all-time high turnover of plates, wire rods, and TMT. Our retail sales grew by over 42%, while our pellet sales witnessed a 59% growth. We also achieved the long cherished dream of exceeding a monthly delivery of 100,000MT for several product lines. We made a record amount of collections and reduced our inventories to the lowest level ever, enabling the company to achieve a substantial reduction in its working capital. We also won a large number of awards such as TPM Excellence Award from JIPM, the Sultan Qaboos Award for Industrial Excellence, Midrex Award of Excellence and Limca Book of Records for the longest rail. Despite severe constraints from a weak steel market, challenging external policy environment, and limited raw materials JSPL’s project teams in Angul, Raigarh, and Oman enhanced the progress of on-going projects to increase production capacity and capability. We are now strategically poised at the vanguard of emerging opportunities both in the domestic as well as Steel, power, and infrastructure are the building blocks for India’s growth. Equally overseas business, ready to capture the imminent upswing in the market in the future. important is the education of our youth, ensuring they have jobs, and that they are healthy.

This is why no matter what the We were truly able to flourish despite the challenges, due to a milestone year of introspection and recalibration. circumstance, we at JSPL have never deterred from our chosen path of developing JSPL reorganized itself into a federation of 18 independently managed businesses (SBUs) each led by its own India across various economic and social strata. CEO and Management Council. There was also an intensive year long exercise of aligning the company along the management philosophy of Theory of Constraints, via workshops and projects across our sites. Our entire human resource structure was overhauled to be more process oriented and efficient. Two new departments were created JSPL’s third Business Sustainability Report for FY 2015-16, for instance, explains the initiatives i.e. Energy Efficiency, and Compliance & Risk Management. These departments were staffed, the new teams were completed in a year fraught with extreme challenges. These initiatives ultimately strengthened the trained, and their work was integrated into JSPL’s overall work plan. You will read more about these initiatives in this organization as well as enhanced the lives of our stakeholders more than ever before. Business Sustainability Report. I invite you to read the report and welcome your comments and participation in our I thank you for your strong support and belief in us, and at JSPL we look forward to growing together with you.

Naveen Jindal Ravi Uppal 6 I Business Sustainability Report Jindal Steel and Power I 7 Chief Sustainability Officer’s Message Dear Stakeholders, This has been a very special year. By pivoting steadily on its intrinsic strength, JSPL was able to recalibrate itself organizationally. The business model was turned around to have a more solid front end. Our raw material procurement strategy is more robust. And in this past year there was more progress made than ever before to ensure JSPL’s holistic growth through extraordinary initiatives in our social commitment, energy efficiency, compliances, risk management, and talent development of employees. In FY 2015-16 JSPL’s business sustainability department worked across all functions and businesses of the company to take care of aspects that are important for the long term and not just the urgent ones. Remarkably, JSPL’s business sustainability department acted as an incubator to create important new departments at JSPL such as the Compliance & Risk Management department, the Energy Efficiency department that are crucial for the company’s business longevity. We continued to educate thousands of young students in our schools, vocational skills colleges, and universities. We invested in new technologies in our plants that would propel India’s economic growth while also protecting our planet. We provided livelihood to families living in cities and farms. Using new innovative approaches we ensured that these communities and our employees are in good health, and that they avail of the health services and hospitals that we have built and manage. We also indeed built bridges, ships, factories, buildings, and unrelentingly provide electricity to millions of homes. Our work also included a large number of important initiatives such as strengthening employee talent as well as JSPL’s authentic corporate brand identity, and also implementing our social commitment via self-sustaining models. We at JSPL have integrated business sustainability in everything we do. An important consequence of this has been that JSPL stands stronger and more united as an organization today as we work to overcome unprecedented challenges. And the 3rd edition of JSPL’s Business Sustainability Report tells this extraordinary story of resilience. I thank you for your support dear stakeholders, and truly hope that this report further enhances your understanding of JSPL. I look forward to building the India of our dreams, with you.

ToC focuses on identifying, focusing, and improving a few parts in the production process that are assessed as not adequately performing at the desired levels. The TOC is a thinking process that enables people to invent simple solutions to complex problems. It consists of five steps: 1. Identify the system’s constraint Identify the operation that Visiting faculty Management interacting brain stormingwith employees session at Sonepat at JSPL is limiting the productivity of the system. This may be a physical or policy constraint 66 I Business Sustainability Report Jindal Steel and Power I 67 search in 2015 for technological advancements of its production processes so as to improve energy efficiency and competitiveness of its products. Accordingly, for this purpose JSPL identified a technology called Flexi Modular Furnace in collaboration with Tenova Group, Italy. This technology is being developed especially for JSPL and will be used by JSPL for the first time in the world. The creation and implementation of this technology took 6 months to complete. The Flexi Modular Furnace technology (NOF) retrofits JSPL’s existing Electric Arc Furnace (EAF). It uses a charge mix of hot metal and sponge iron in the ratio of 85:15. It has hydraulically operated PLC controlled tilters for controlled but continuous hot metal feeding into the furnace along with 4 supersonic oxygen lances of capacity 3000 m3/hr mounted on the side walls of the furnace. Commissioning of the modification has helped JSPL in reducing its Energy foot print across the production chain by 0.151 Gcal/tcs as compared to the energy footprint without NOF. Also manufacturing cost of the product has been reduced by 6-7% (Approx.). In addition to these benefits, there are few other benefits which are related to lesser hazardous waste generation including SMS Slag, Refractory lining; lesser flux usage. Three of JSPL’s plants i.e. Raigarh, JPLTamnar, Nalwa Steel New oxygen furnace at Raigarh, Chhattisgarh have been classified as Designated Consumers by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (Government of India, Ministry of Power). In the last cycle of Perform, Achieve and Trade Scheme these 3 plants have been recommended by Bureau of Energy Efficiency for issuance of 62903 E-Certs for achieving better energy efficiency in our production process as compared to notified target for us in The results of this yearlong exercise provided solutions for idle and set up time. than 30 days were monitored.
