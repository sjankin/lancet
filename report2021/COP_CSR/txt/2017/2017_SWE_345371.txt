We actively integrate respect for human rights, labour and the environment into our business operations and take an absolute stand against corruption and unethical business conduct. Leading our business in a responsible manner gives us a social licence to operate which builds trust and relationships with our stakeholders. Responsibility strengthens both our brand and profitability. For this communication on progress, the reporting period covers June 2016 until June 2017. Management approach As of June 4th 2017, Goodpoint has 24 employees, and is headed by a managing director/owner. Employees have the opportunity to raise issues or concerns regarding their work situation in weekly group meetings as well as biweekly meetings with all staff and the managing director. Goodpoint has an elaborate management system, including policy documents and guidelines that guide us in our daily operations. The management system includes, inter alia, procedures for nonconformity reporting and follow-up. All employees have access to, and know how to use, the system. Internal and external audits are conducted on an annual basis and followed up through bi-annual management reviews. Goodpoint was one of the first companies in Sweden to be certified according to the new version of the ISO:14001 and ISO:9001 standards released in 2015. During the reporting period, Goodpoint has performed risk-analyses of the organisational and social work environment, in an effort to further improve as well as prevent health-risks associated with the work environment. Goals guiding these efforts will be formulated, in a process involving all employees, during June 2017. If any situation concerning violations of human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption occurs in our work with clients, we discuss it in our biweekly meetings and take action according to our code of conduct.

Assessment, policy and goals As outlined in our code of conduct, Goodpoint supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and adheres to the same principles as the Global Compact in this field.

Goodpoint has procedures for reporting any human rights violations directly to the Managing director. Violations of the law will be reported to the appropriate authorities. External operations Goodpoint’s most important contribution to the implementation of the human rights principles is through helping our clients manage human rights-related risks within their own operations. This often involves anticipating and counteracting risks and events that may occur related to social responsibility and human rights. We give our clients and organizations advise on how to manage and work with human rights within their supply chain. In this area, we assist our clients with a range of measures to minimize and manage risks, including education, evaluations, analyses and audits. Goodpoint actively works to advance human rights within our clients' business. We also help our clients to communicate their work related to human rights in their sustainability reports. Our operations have resulted in raised awareness about human rights with our clients.

In these anonymous surveys, employees can openly comment on their job satisfaction and work environment. Desired changes and improvements that surface in the employee survey are discussed and implemented if required. Meetings are held every two weeks with the entire staff, where ongoing matters are commented on and discussed openly. Salary negotiations are held yearly between management and labour union representatives. Employees are also invited to an individual salary negotiation with management. All permanent employees are covered by a health insurance. Outcomes The 2017 anonymous employee survey had not been completed at the time of submission of the Communication on progress. The issues expressed in the survey conducted in 2016 concerning high stress levels at times due to variations in workload and work-life balance are still a concern within the company. Management takes this issue seriously and monitors the workload of the consultants. Stress and work-life balance is discussed regularly both with individual consultants who suffer from stress and at weekly and biweekly meetings.

Assessment, policy and goals Goodpoint supports and respects the principles set by the Global Compact. Since 1998, Goodpoint has an environmental management system and the organisation is certified according to ISO 14001. Our environmental policy states that we shall make a positive impact on the environment through increasing our clients’ awareness about environmental and climate issues. We also consider the negative impact of our activities, from purchased goods and services to travel, and act to minimize this. Goodpoint’s environmental goal states that 10% of our revenue should derive from projects classified as environmental projects. Environmental projects are defined as projects resulting in (real) environmental benefits (by improving our clients’ environmental performance). External Goodpoint has extensive experience and knowledge in the fields of chemistry and environment. Our main contribution in this field is helping our clients create more sustainable and environmentally sound operations. We help our clients increase their knowledge within these areas through training, internal audits, legal compliance and by implementing environmental management systems. We contribute to a better understanding of the subject matters and help set requirements for chemicals in products and goods. Internal Goodpoint’s environmental work is guided by our environmental management system. We apply environmental criteria as well as quality criteria when purchasing goods and services. We recycle as much waste as possible. We work to reduce our environmental impact by actively selecting modes of travel and equipment that will lower our impact on the environment. We compensate for the CO2 emissions that cannot be avoided, through funding the offsetting of CO2. This is done by compiling and reporting the company’s travel data throughout the year, and financing the offsetting of the calculated equivalent CO2. Outcomes We try to measure our impact on our clients’ environmental performance through external and internal surveys after project closure. However, it has proven difficult to derive the performance to our specific project when a lot of parameters influence client environmental performance and the results often show several years after project closure. Due to the difficulties in evaluating our impact in our clients´ environmental performance no environmental goal was developed during 2016. However, for 2017, a novel goal was set that 10% of the company’s revenue must derive from so called environmental projects (measured in terms of hours worked in such projects).

Our electricity comes from renewable energy and Goodpoint’s landlord has a green electricity contract. Heating and cooling and electricity are included in the lease. During 2016 (January-January) Goodpoint emitted 5,7 ton CO2 due to travel (air and rail). CO2 emissions per employee halved during the year (from 617 kg/employee in 2015 to 285 kg/employee in 2016), both due to a reduction in overall emissions and an increase in number of employees. The reduction of overall emissions is a result of the decrease in amount of air travel.
