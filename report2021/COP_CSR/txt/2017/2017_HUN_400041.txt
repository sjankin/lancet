2016 / Review EXECUTIVE MESSAGE Since 2005, every year CIB Group has prepared its sustainability report in line with the GRI international reporting guidelines. The first report has been followed by a new one every year since then, each containing new information related to our operation; but one thing never changes: the CIB Group has organically integrated the fundamental principles of sustainability into its basic operation and corporate culture, and it is along these lines that we carry out our various tasks, because just like our parent company, the Intesa Sanpaolo Group, we believe that the best practice is for these to be reflected in the processes and day-to-day operation of an organisation. Following the CIB Group's overhaul of its strategy in 2013, we continued our operations and the development of our business processes in 2016 based on the targets defined therein. We took a firm decision to concentrate on expanding our lending activity, improving the range and quality of services, and growing our customer base. With solid support from our parent bank, the main points of focus continue to include our efforts to be a bank that provides our highly discerning retail and corporate customers with services that always stand out from the crowd. We believe that long-term sustainable growth can only be achieved through the fulfilment of these objectives. In the course of our operation last year, we continued our projects aimed at retaining our staff and supporting the professional development of exceptionally skilled employees, and aligned our corporate culture with our business objectives. We made significant efforts to strengthen our staff’s commitment and motivation and we sought to involve them not only in the implementation of strategy, but also in the social and environmental protection programs and energy saving initiatives of the Bank Group. Through a variety of direct and indirect initiatives, which have been running for many years, we have assisted approximately 65,000,000 people in need by holding numerous volunteering programs and as a result of projects organised with the help of our civil-sector partners. As in previous years, we have prepared our report in compliance with the international guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), once again in accordance with the G4 reporting system. The report, which is now shorter and more focused, contains the essential topics, examining them primarily from the point of view of our main stakeholder and our report’s target group, the customers. For the eighth year running, our report also describes the fulfilment of the principles set out in the UN Global Compact. Please take the time to read carefully through our report and share your thoughts and comments with us, so that by taking them into consideration we can perform even better than before to the satisfaction of all our stakeholders. Yours sincerely, Dr. Pál Simák Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors 1 Sustainability Report 2016 / Review ABOUT THIS REPORT The report contains information regarding the CIB Group’s organisational units and subsidiaries in Hungary. In all cases the data is group-level data, except where specifically stated otherwise. When determining the content of the report, we drew heavily on the results of various consultations held with external and internal stakeholders during the year, and determination of the material aspects was performed in compliance with the GRI G4 Guideline. The report primarily aims to give the CIB Group’s customers an overview of the organisation’s performance and operation, keeping sight of the issues and questions that interest and affect them the most. On this basis, in addition to the main results related to strategy and corporate governance, it examines four major themes in detail: 1 Customer focus . 2 Stability . 3 Product portfolio and digitalisation 4 Beyond business These four main themes are also what give our report its structure. The four main sections follow the same structure: starting with an explanation of how the given theme fits in with our strategy, then presenting our main results and challenges of 2016, the extent to which last year’s objectives were fulfilled, and our new undertakings. For our other stakeholders, we have chosen other channels via which to present our sustainability results. More information on our responsible operation can be found in the section of our website. Reporting period: calendar year 2016 Date of previous report: August 2016 (GRI G4 ‘in accordance core’) Reporting cycle: annual GRI application level: In accordance – core Data status: December 31., 2016, otherwise we highlight differently. Further details on the boundaries of the report, the material aspects and the process of determining them, as well as on the GRI index, can be found in the annexes. At the end of the individual sections dealing with the four main themes, we show the current status of our undertakings of last year with the following symbols: Fulfilled, project closed or extended Mostly fulfilled, but project not yet closed Partially implemented and in progress Implementation has begun Implementation has not yet begun 2 Sustainability Report 2016 / Review REVIEW More than 35 years of expertise in universal banking, CIB Bank Zrt. offers a full range of commercial banking and investment services, supplemented by products and solutions offered by its affiliates (CIB Leasing, CIB Factor* and CIB Insurance Broker).

For this it is essential for the Core Bank to operate profitably in a sustainable manner, and for us to gradually phase out the assets and activities that decrease value. The strategy rests on three main pillars: (1) Renewal of the business operations and market activity of the “Growth Bank”, (2) Continuing the wind-down of the bad portfolio elements, seeking to achieve the best possible recovery, (3) Simplification of the processes, more efficient operation. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE We wish to achieve our goals while observing, and ethical norms, we have put in place a number of putting into practice, the principles of sustainable mechanisms that reveal risks that have previously, development and responsible operation.

ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS In the course of our stable operation and the implementation of our trust-based growth strategy that offers real opportunities, maintaining a continuous dialogue with our stakeholders is essential. We regard as our stakeholders all those who may be affected by the activities and operations of the bank, and/or who may have an effect on our organisation. Of these, the following three groups are of critical importance from the perspective of our operation: employees, customers and the owner. Besides these three priority groups, we have identified further stakeholder groups, which are: suppliers, civic organisations, local communities and professional organisations. Our definition of community relations includes our relationships with professional organisations (associations, trade federations, chambers) and the third sector (non-profit organisations, foundations, local communities), and the members of the local communities themselves. We come into contact with our stakeholders using various communication tools and via many different channels. The most important of these are also highlighted in this report, while a more comprehensive overview is available on the website. FINANCIALLY AWARE CUSTOMERS AND SOCIETY Since the end of 2010, CIB Bank has participated in the “Financial Compass” program, sponsored by the National Bank of Hungary and the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, and overseen by the Financial Compass Foundation, with the aim of widely improving financial literacy, promoting education and raising the public’s level of financial awareness. In order to provide real opportunities for our customers, we need to have a mutual understanding of the opportunities and risks involved, so that we can recognise our responsibility for shaping the attitudes of those around us, and actively participate in raising awareness. 5 Sustainability Report 2016 / Customer focus CUSTOMER FOCUS At the centre of the strategy lie our customers: our objective is for the Bank to become the primary financial service provider of its customers through excellent customer relations. This is the main driving force behind our corporate governance, our day-to-day operation, and the changes that we undergo. THE GUARANTEES OF CUSTOMER FOCUS A high level of customer focus is ensured not only corporate governance system.

In response to these expectations, the CIB Group has developed procedures that reinforce the protection of consumers. A dedicated specialist has been assigned to oversee this task, ensuring that consumers’ interests are taken into consideration in the course of day-to-day operations, and that this attitude becomes an integral part of our corporate culture. CUSTOMER FOCUS 2016 – In brief Customer satisfaction and loyalty We celebrated the 9th anniversary indicators of our ‘100% Attention’ program.

This is reflected in the breakdown by age category, as well; moreover, looking at breakdown by gender, the male exit rate continues to be higher. After the group layoffs, we introduced our four-month “Shake It Up” program, aimed at strengthening the commitment of employees who remained employed by the Bank Group.

Through our CIB opportunities for our customers Debt Consolidation Loan II product, several loans unsecured by to bridge their payment property or credit card debts or overdraft debts can be consolidated and difficulties, for example: settled in a longer period of time with equal monthly instalments. In the case of loans secured with real estate, we recommend the CIB Optimal Payment Facility Program, in which, in addition to the extension of the loan term, there is a possibility of a 25% reduction of monthly repayment for 5 years. If this is not a solution of a sufficient level for our customer, there is a possibility to apply for a custom rescheduling plan, providing adequate proof of the cause of difficulties with the repayment. Reacting flexibly to changes that result in payment difficulties for customers is essential for our Bank. We have established a special unit within the bank, in the interest of preventing future risks and ensuring their timely management.

Focus on small and medium-sized enterprisesDistribution Testimonials For 5 years, we have been successfully running our initiative, under which the managers of CIB Bank’s SME Leasing partners are given the opportunity to present the secrets to their business success, for example: management structure, strategy building, or perhaps their planning and governance, in the pages of relevant business media organs. These articles are published in national and local newspapers, as well as in the online media. In every case the interviews are accompanied by educational articles relating to special financial products, such as leasing facilities or subsidised loans, for example. The articles are aimed at showcasing positive examples for Hungarian businesses to help them create business operation practices based on a conscious, long-term strategy. 10 Sustainability Report 2016 / Customer focus SME Research In September 2016, together with TNS Hoffmann we conducted our representative survey of the managers and owners of companies posting annual net revenue ranging from HUF 300 million to 10 billion, focusing on digitalisation. We have created a tradition of inviting our customers to national business events focusing on specific topics that we host every autumn and spring. The purpose of this initiative was to generate dialogue between the participants, and to help them take all the latest “best practices” on board. These events are an excellent opportunity for networking across the regions, between company managers and banking specialists, and they are also a superb platform for sharing valuable experience and exchanging tips, and for working together to find solutions to business challenges. 11 Sustainability Report 2016 / Stability STABILITY In order to achieve the objectives set out in the growth strategy, it is essential for customer service staff to offer sound proposals that make good business sense, taking customers’ interests into account. The wide range of products in the portfolio gives up-to-date solutions to the responsible decision-makers. Digitalised corporate governance systems, optimised for efficiency, help to ensure stable day-to-day operation. Our community engagement and our commitment to employees make it easier to achieve a healthy work-life balance. THE GUARANTEES OF STABILITY We have operated in the Hungarian financial Within our corporate governance framework, which market more than 35 years. Stable operation is also strongly influenced by the effective statutory requires a prudent, effective corporate governance provisions, the following elements are of key system that supports the employees in making the importance in the interest of ensuring stable right decisions. operation: Assessment and management of the risks of the operating environment, use of an advanced compliance system Corporate governance tools and processes that support responsible and ethical operation Continuous focus on efficiency and efforts to ensure profitable operation with sustainable solutions Stakeholder dialogue with the aim of mapping and shaping the expected risks and expectations Conscious efforts to develop financial skills in society Balanced pricing policy that optimises market effectiveness and responsible decision-making Strict lending principles: we don’t simply sell products, we provide proactive advisory services and product offers that are tailored to fit in with our customers’ business models, and which take into account the size, profile, current financial situation, resilience and long-term plans of each business. Our conservative lending policy and transparent, stringent lending principles ensure legal compliance and a balanced credit portfolio. We attribute great importance to providing comprehensive information to our partners, to allow them to make thoroughly informed decisions on whether our offer is valuable from a business point of view, and whether they can afford it. Almost all our staff have indefinite-term employment contracts, which for us is also reflective of a committed employment relationship that can be planned for in the long term. To meet our seasonal labour requirements, we also employ workers under a contract staffing arrangement. Although the proportion of part-time employees decreased slightly, we use other means of helping our staff to achieve a healthy work/life balance.

In the interest of ensuring that both our stability and our growth strategy are fully supported, we minimise social and environmental risks and aim to have a positive impact, for the good of our community and our environment. Our responsible operation also extends to our external relationships and the role that we fulfil in society.

After several years of pause, at the end of 2016 we resumed selective waste collection in the Petrezselyem headquarters. By 2019 we will achieve selective waste collection in the entire branch network. Every year, the volume of hazardous waste is reduced, and most of it is reused (restaurant fats are recycled). • In 15 bank branches we completed the withdrawal and replacement of air conditioning equipment operating with the obsolete R22 refrigerant. In these locations, we installed new equipment operating with the R410a refrigerant, which controls the CO2 equivalent emission level with the most effective and state-of-the-art efficiency and energy use according to the EU standard and the Kyoto Protocol on Climate undertaken by Hungary, by keeping and reducing carbon dioxide emissions at a steady level and thus at the assumed level. • An important step was propagating ISO 50001 awareness among the employees and the annual ISO 50001 examination for every employee. The ISO 50001 standard was introduced at the end of 2016 and was certified by an external audit company. In 2016 we again committed to turning off lights wherever it was technically feasible in our central buildings during Earth Hour, Highlighting the importance of climate and environmental protection. 23 Sustainability Report 2016 / Beyond business ANNEXES 24 Annexes / Boundaries of the report, material aspects ANNEXES BOUNDARIES OF THE REPORT, MATERIAL ASPECTS Entities included in the CIB Group’s consolidated financial statements: COUNTRY OF SUBSIDIARY SCOPE OF ACTIVITY REGISTRATION CIB Bank Zrt.

Hungary Real estate development and facility management This CIB Bank Group report focuses on the material aspects specified in the GRI G4 guidelines. We defined these in the course of making our earlier reports, and updated them every year, taking into account the opinions and expectations of external and internal stakeholders. For the purposes of the 2016 report we have reviewed, with an internal working group and the support of specialist advisers, the potential changes in the expectations and concerns of our key internal and external stakeholders, and the opportunities for improving the report. In the interests of effectiveness, simplicity and readability, we decided to narrow the target audience. Accordingly, we have chosen customers as the primary target audience for this report. Of the three target audiences defined in previous years, we are using other primary communication channels for the purpose of informing and engaging our employees and the media, so this report only serves as a supplementary source of information in the dialogue conducted with these two groups. The review identified the aspects that impact the Bank Group’s operation and strategy, and the relevant aspects that affect stakeholder groups, primarily our customers, in light of the local context as well as of international trends. In the course of the review we drew on our own research, sector-wide research, secondary sources of data, and benchmark analyses. 25 Annexes / Boundaries of the report, material aspects As a result of all this, the following material aspects have been identified for the purpose of this year’s report: High priority Economic dimension: Stability, predictability, financial profitability Intesa Sanpaolo and CIB Group strategy Corporate governance (compliance, ethics, fairness, anti-corruption, etc.) External social dimension: Portfolio of products and services, pricing Quality and speed of service, complaint handling Financial exclusion and inclusion, responsible lending Social and community engagement Internal social dimension: o Strengthening employee commitment, engaging employees Customer-focused corporate culture and performance incentives Medium priority: Economic dimension: Suppliers Subcontractors Internal social dimension: Responsible employment Environmental dimension: Climate change, environmentally friendly solutions Every material aspect identified relates to all units within the organisation. 26 Annexes / Boundaries of the report, material aspects Direct impact on Related GRI Material aspect Page number external indicator stakeholder Material aspects in terms of economic performance 1.

The bank’s executive body is the Management Board, the members of which are employed by CIB Bank. The Supervisory Committee is responsible for overseeing the bank's operations, and is chaired by Ezio Salvai. The names of the members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are published on the website. There were no personnel changes to the Management Board in 2016: Members of the Management Board in 2016: o Chairman & CEO (Pál Simák) o Retail Division (Dr. Tamás Ákos), o Corporate Division (István Attila Szabó) o Risk Management (CRO, Paolo Vivona), o Finance (CFO, Andrea de Michelis), o Operations (COO, Giorgio Gavioli), o Focused Customer Management, “FCM” (CWO, Zoltán Csordás). The Audit Committee, chaired by Christophe Welle, supports the work of the Supervisory Committee, primarily in relation to auditing, risk management, accounting and compliance-related tasks. Of the Supervisory Board members, Tünde Barabás resigned her position in December 2016. The Steering Committees are authorised to independently make decisions and launch initiatives affecting the entire CIB Group, within the scope of authority delegated to them by the bank’s Management Board: Credit Change Management Problem Assets Committee Committee Committee Operational Risk Committee Financial Risks Committee Asset Quality Session 32 Annexes / Decision-making bodies, organisational structure and professional organisations ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE 33 Annexes / Decision-making bodies, organisational structure and professional organisations PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS Our partnerships with professional organisations also represent an important aspect of our community relations. The interests of the various sectors of the economy, and society, are represented by the associations formed by stakeholders, each focusing on a clearly defined set of objectives. Our participation in these organisations is important for two fundamental reasons. Firstly, it creates an opportunity to engage in professional dialogue, and secondly, it provides Bank Group, and the bank sector as a whole, with a means of upholding and protecting its interests as part of a structured advocacy group. Last year we reviewed and rationalised our membership of organisations, and at the end of the year we participated in the professional work of a total of 16 organisations.
