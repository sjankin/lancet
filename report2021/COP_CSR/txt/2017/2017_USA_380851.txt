Our progress puts us on track to hit our 50 percent goal by 2020.2 We’ve also lowered our greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent , water usage by 21 percent , energy usage by 15 percent and waste-to-landfill by 41 percent since 2011. We continue to believe that vibrant and healthy communities play an important role in the health of our business. In fiscal year 2017, our total impact to support our communities came to more than $11 million in cash grants, product donations and cause marketing contributions. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we reaffirm our commitment to its Ten Principles by driving our corporate responsibility strategy, a comprehensive set of commitments across our company — from human rights, labor and product safety to transparency, environmental sustainability and contributions to our communities. We value being a signatory to the UNGC as it provides an opportunity to continue learning from and sharing ideas with key sustainability influencers and other companies. We’re proud that others are recognizing our corporate responsibility progress. Once again, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency named Clorox a Safer Choice Partner of the Year, and Corporate Responsibility magazine included us among the top 100 companies on its Best Corporate Citizens list. You — our employees — inspire our ongoing quest to make Clorox a dynamic workplace that attracts and develops the best and brightest people. Our 8,100-plus employees around the world drove our strong results above and beyond financial performance this fiscal year. With inclusion and diversity as a business imperative, we continued our focus on making sure Clorox benefits from the diverse minds, experiences and backgrounds of our employees, which mirror the diversity of our consumers around the world. It starts at the top. Notably, female leaders make up 36 percent of Clorox Executive Committee members . In addition, female and minority leaders each make up 33 percent of our board of directors . I’m very proud the company has been recognized for our strong inclusion and diversity programs. 4 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report G4-1, G4-15, G4-DMA, G4-EC2, G4-LA10 We earned another 100 percent score from the Human Rights Campaign for our LGBT workplace practices — a recognition we’ve achieved since 2006 — and Diversity MBA magazine ranked Clorox No. 7 on its list of the 50 best employers for women and diverse managers, among other recognitions. It’s especially gratifying that all this has led to Clorox achieving high levels of employee engagement. Our current engagement score is 88 percent , higher than both the fast-moving consumer goods industry norm and the global high-performance norm. 3 This matters a great deal to the Clorox management team since there’s a strong correlation between employee engagement and financial performance. We also continued our commitment to you, our shareholders. In fiscal year 2017, we returned $412 million in cash dividends to our shareholders. As we’ve done every year since 1977, we raised Returned $412M our annual cash dividend, announcing in the fourth quarter an increase of 5 percent. As of Aug. 15, 2017, Clorox’s dividend yield was 2.4 percent.

In fiscal year 2018, we’ll continue to be guided by our 2020 Strategy and draw on you, our stakeholders, for inspiration. For consumers, that’s focusing on superior value through our differentiated products and brands. For our communities, that’s maintaining our strong commitment to our values and corporate responsibility. And for Clorox employees, it’s fostering a workplace where they can thrive and grow professionally and personally. For all our stakeholders, we’ll remain steadfastly committed to our values.

Building our brands around you, the consumer, is nothing new for Clorox. Lately, we’ve looked to technology to help accelerate brand growth.

Health and wellness has been central to our mission since the founding of our company more than a hundred years ago. It all started with our namesake bleach, with disinfecting properties that kill germs that can 2. Billion cause infections and other health threats. Over time, our portfolio has expanded to include other products that support health and wellness, people worldwide such as our Brita® filters and pitchers, Burt’s Bees® personal care and don’t have access beauty lines, and RenewLife® digestive health aids. to safely managed drinking water* This legacy has made us a natural fit to support clean water and sanitation efforts — one of 17 global goals for sustainable development the United Nations is seeking to achieve by 2030.

Bleach dispensers provide safe drinking water in Peru About 16 million people in Peru don’t have access to safely managed drinking water*. Through the use of bleach dispensers — a low-cost, sustainable way to treat and disinfect water — our Clorox Safe Water Project, launched in 2012, is providing drinkable water to 21 rural communities in the Piura-Tambogrande region of northern Peru. The project also has supported education to help families understand the connection between invisible germs in their water and illness. 25,000+ 350,000 Peruvians served every year 100M+ liters of water liters of safe water purified every day every year 8 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report New well system brings water — and a better future for girls — to Kenya In many rural villages in Kenya, the only water source can be more than 6 miles away.

Clorox employees strive to create an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging — respecting, valuing, supporting and recognizing each other as much for their uniqueness as for those things they have in common. They know this enables everyone to do their best work and positions us for growth. 88% Employee Engagement (+8% vs. Peer Companies, +3% vs. High-Performing Companies) 10 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report 115,000 Employee Volunteer Hours in CY 2016 Seeking good ideas from everyone Regardless of position, role or background, employees are encouraged to share their points of view and insights. More importantly, their perspectives are heard. One measure of their satisfaction is our employee engagement score, which is higher than that of our peers and among the best of the highest-performing global companies. All in on innovation Initiatives spearheaded by employees have generated creative ideas from all corners. Innovent, our internal ideas contest, allows anyone to be an “intrapreneur.” An inaugural hackathon used technology tools to bring together a diverse group of employees to brainstorm new ways to expand direct-to-consumer sales. And employee resource groups — one of our original sources of business ideas grounded in cultural and multigenerational insights — continue to contribute to our innovation pipeline. The GIFT of giving Our people love to give back to our communities. In the 2016 calendar year, almost half of eligible employees participated in GIFT, the company’s charitable giving program, contributing nearly $5 million to more than 3,500 nonprofits — well above typical involvement at similar company programs.1 They also volunteered more than 115,000 hours of their time — demonstrating that they live our company value of “doing the right thing.” Through an inclusive approach to work, our employees inspire us, and each other, to draw on the contributions of individuals and teams to help achieve a higher collective purpose — both for our business and for society as a whole. 1 The median employee participation rate for matching gift programs is 7 percent. Source: CECP Giving in Numbers Report: 2016 Edition 11 INNOVATING ON INNOVATION A Conversation About How It Happens Innovation takes many forms at Clorox — from developing a product that becomes a household name to advertising that creates buzz to an in-store display that grabs attention. Here are perspectives on how we’ve been evolving to meet consumers’ changing needs from four senior leaders who help shepherd innovation throughout our organization: Chief Innovation Officer Denise Garner, Chief Customer Officer Matt Laszlo, Chief Marketing Officer Eric Reynolds and Chief Information Officer Manjit Singh. Q. How does the consumer inspire Clorox innovation? Denise Garner | In R&D the consumer is our muse. We pay attention to what consumers tell us they want in a product as well as observe their pain points to identify unarticulated needs that present opportunities to innovate and delight. Consider the new Brita® Stream™ pitcher. Millennials wanted a high-capacity pitcher that was streamlined enough to fit inside the refrigerator door, delivered fast filtration “on demand” and allowed them to add ice to the pitcher. Their feedback inspired us to reinvent our filtration technology and pitcher design. Manjit Singh | Consumers' embrace of technologies such as voice integration and in-home smart speakers has us asking how we can leverage them to make products even more practical, effective and easier to use. The Brita® Infinity pitcher, Clorox's first “internet of things” product, is an example of how IT partners with other groups inside Clorox to deliver a superior consumer experience, while we're using our voice integration skills to improve consumers' experiences with our products in their homes. Q. How has Clorox innovation made a difference for our retail customers? Matt Laszlo | It starts with putting the consumer first. Being able to meet consumer needs through innovation makes us an extremely valuable, effective partner to our retailers. We know that, for many consumers, scent can make a mundane experience more enjoyable. That approach has helped Clorox® Scentiva® cleaners get off to a good start with strong retailer support. 12 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report Left to right: Manjit Singh, Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer Eric Reynolds, Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Matt Laszlo, Senior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer Denise Garner, Senior Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer 13 Q. How has your approach to innovation changed? Matt Laszlo | We’re thinking about innovation more broadly than ever before. Not only are we developing new products, but we’re also expanding our existing products to new spaces, places and faces — for instance, by placing Clorox® disinfecting wipes in the pharmacy section. Why is this important? Because consumers don’t make all of their purchases in one place anymore — or even two or three places. So we need to always look beyond traditional roles and rules to continue growing our business. Denise Garner | We’ve enhanced our innovation processes from end to end so we can create bigger, more sustainable ideas while moving at a faster pace — and minimize needed resources and costs in the process. This positions us to meet ever-changing consumer and retailer needs much more effectively. And it gives us a much better chance of being first to market with an innovation. We’re already seeing results with a stronger innovation pipeline. Q. What does the next phase of innovation look like at Clorox? Eric Reynolds | It’s about creating a seamless consumer experience. That means unlocking what motivates someone to purchase our products and bring them home. Take the Brita® Infinity pitcher. It’s not just a pitcher. It connects to the internet and can reorder filters. For all our brands, we need to bring together the physical and digital experience — because people want an experience rather than just products. Matt Laszlo | We’ve got to be more and more digitally enabled. That could mean the product itself, the packaging or the online content, which educates, influences and tells the consumer a story. For example, do you get a push notification from Hidden Valley® ranch suggesting a recipe to try when you’re walking down the dressings aisle? Or can we create packaging with more information on it for shoppers to engage with via their smartphones? More and more, our retailers want to play in the online world, even for the in-store experience. Our innovation 14 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report needs to address the consumer desire for more education and interaction with our products. Manjit Singh | It’s going to be all about speed. With IT involved from the start, we’ll be able to embed technology into our processes as well as our products to meet consumers’ ever-evolving needs. Q. In a crowded media landscape, how does innovation strengthen your marketing efforts? Eric Reynolds | The challenge for us is not the media landscape; it’s all the information and noise the average person gets today. To penetrate through with clear product ideas and messages, we need to innovate everywhere, including media, because communication is a big piece of what we’re trying to do. One area where we’re doing this is media planning. What’s worked well for decades — TV, print, digital — has started to fall. As media consumption continues to shift and fragment across multiple channels and environments, gaining consumers’ attention is challenging. There are too many messages and channels, and we need to break through this clutter. So we’re changing the way we approach the question. We’re trying to slide into their day-to-day lives at just the right moment with a piece of information they’re open to receiving at that particular time. Q. How do you nurture the spirit of innovation? Denise Garner | We need to stay close to emerging trends with a laser focus on our consumer, our categories and our competition as well as on the retail environment and overall global trends. Then it is all about nurturing a sense of bold curiosity in our culture. Curiosity can help unlock insights about our consumers and technology, which can serve as the foundation for innovation breakthroughs, whether it’s adapting the technology or discovering a new consumer need that helps us focus our product development efforts. Manjit Singh | Our curiosity has led us to establish relationships with organizations such as research boards, venture capital groups and investment firms, which expose us to early-stage innovations that can inspire new ideas and further improve our speed to market. We encourage our employees to tap these relationships to learn more about technology advances that will allow us to discover innovative ways to solve consumer needs. 15 Hidden Valley Clorox Scentiva Simply Ranch The new Clorox® Scentiva® disinfecting To satisfy consumers’ appetites for wipes and sprays provide consumers better-for-you food products, we with experiential fragrances while they introduced Hidden Valley® Simply clean their homes and give us a new Ranch® dressing that delivers platform for growth that appeals to amazing ranch taste with no artificial millennials and Hispanics. preservatives, flavors or colors.

The more attuned we are to you, our consumers, and your changing world, the better we can provide you with products that make everyday life better, every day.

We instituted “Plus One” initiatives through which individuals with different thinking styles or experience could be added to teams to make them stronger. The company spent $140 million with diverse suppliers during the fiscal year, up from $20 million in 2008. Diverse suppliers include minority-, women-, service-disabledand veteran-owned business enterprises, as well as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender business owners in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. The company maintained a world-class recordable incident rate (<1.0) of 0.60, reflecting a slight reduction compared to the previous year. 1 The Willis Towers Watson global high-performance companies norm is based on responses from 142,506 employees at 26 companies.

G4-2, G4-DMA, G4-LA6 21 Strategy 2 Business Highlights Drive superior consumer value behind strong brand investment, innovation and technology transformation. We delivered 3 percent incremental sales growth from product innovation across our global portfolio during fiscal year 2017. Our businesses tapped 360-degree video technology to showcase the global problem of safe water access along with solutions supported by the Clorox® brand in Peru and Brita Canada in Kenya. We continued to lead the industry with 45 percent of our media spending focused on digital. To win with the digital shopper, Clorox tapped technology partnerships to help deliver consumer experiences extending beyond product usage. In Canada, we launched geofencing — a feature that uses GPS or radio DRIVE frequency identification technology to create a virtual geographical boundary — with Snapchat to target consumers in a specific neighborhood, inviting them to an experiential event for the launch of Burt’s Bees® SUPERIOR lipsticks, and used virtual reality to showcase the Brita® brand’s cleanwater initiatives. CONSUMER The Fresh Step® brand has returned to market share growth by accelerating momentum behind last year’s Fresh Step with the power of Febreze® VALUE launch. Some of this year’s innovations included a Hawaiian Aloha™ scent; new, easier-to-use four-packs; and improved shelf presence. Expansion was fueled further by a 75 percent improvement in advertising effectiveness and increased merchandising compared to the previous fiscal year. Our RenewLife® brand, acquired in May 2016, continues to grow, gaining distribution and market share in the food, drug and mass channels, in line with our expectations, while maintaining a strong presence in the natural channel. 22 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report G4-2 The Brita® brand launched The Filtered Life marketing campaign featuring basketball superstar Stephen Curry to inspire people to filter out the bad and get to the good, in water and in life, starting with negativity and bullying online. Corporate Responsibility Highlights Make responsible products responsibly. For its facial towelettes, the Burt’s Bees® brand replaced the hard plastic door with a sticker-like closure, eliminating approximately 108,000 pounds of hard plastic from production annually and keeping it out of waste streams. A redesigned cardboard display tray for the towelettes also uses 90,000 pounds less paperboard per year. Packaging for the Burt’s Bees® facial moisturizer was converted from mixed resin material, which is not recyclable curbside, to single-material tubes made of high-density polyethylene, or HDPE, making it easier for consumers to recycle. In support of our goal to eliminate all PVC packaging, we changed the material used for our Kingsford® charcoal lighter fluid packaging to more environmentally friendly PET.

We secured the No. 1 market position in key account channels, which represent 60 percent of the country’s oxygen bleach market, and also introduced a liquid line this year. 26 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report G4-2 In the wake of Hurricane Matthew, we donated nine truckloads of product — over 5,400 cases of Clorox® liquid bleach and nearly 17,000 cases of Glad® trash bags to support people in the Southeast U.S. and Haiti through partnerships with the American Red Cross and Americares. Corporate Responsibility Highlights Safeguard families with our Be Healthy, Be Smart and Be Safe initiatives. We continued to help communities around the world recover from natural disasters. Following historic flooding in Louisiana, we donated 10 truckloads of product, including over 8,600 cases of Clorox® liquid bleach and 18,700 cases of Glad® trash bags, through the American Red Cross Annual Disaster Responder Program. We also donated Clorox® bleach in Peru to aid survivors of floods there in early 2017. We awarded six grants to urban farms in Oakland, California; Northwest Arkansas; and the Atlanta, Georgia, metro area. This is a new focus area for The Clorox Company Foundation and also a geographical expansion geared at fighting food insecurity in a number of the communities where our employees live and work. Our brands continued to engage in cause marketing programs consistent with their purpose that are also meaningful to consumers.  The Peru business empowered Peruvians to support our Clorox Safe Water Project and provide more people in rural areas of the country with access to clean water.  Through the help of consumers with the purchase of specially marked products, Brita Canada helped provide cleaner drinking water for an entire community in Kenya — over 40,000 people this year — impacting not only their health, but also their education, since many young girls who had been responsible for retrieving water for their families are now able to attend school.  The Clorox® brand in the U.S. partnered with DonorsChoose.org to help teachers prepare for back-to-school.  The Burt’s Bees Bring Back the Bees campaign returned in 2017 to double its impact and plant 2 billion wildflowers.  The Fresh Step® Hot to Adopt™ program sent shelter cats down the catwalk at New York Fashion Week to help promote cat adoption.

Business Highlights Fund growth by reducing waste in our work, products and supply chain. Our Hidden Valley® Simply Ranch® dressing went from concept to shelf in just 10 months — more than 50 percent faster than our average development timeline of 24 months for large product innovation projects — thanks to adoption of agile, or more efficient, business practices. The company’s Research and Development division saved $400,000 by designing a lab testing process to deliver higher-quality data in a shorter amount of time. This initiative enables us to move faster in product development and create backup labs for product testing, while still providing necessary data and validation. Enterprisewide initiatives, including identification of alternative dedusting agents for our litter formula, improvements to our namesake bleach with polyelectrolyte complexes, or PECs — technology that makes it easier to clean hard surfaces and improves the whitening performance in laundry — and a number of other administrative improvements, contributed to $111.6 million in cost savings. Our European cat litter business developed a new, locally sourced base formula and consolidated manufacturing in a central location, increasing distribution efficiency and providing $640,000 in cost savings in less than a year, leading to a double-digit increase in margins for our Ever Clean® brand. Progress made in our Go Lean strategy in International yielded strong cost savings and productivity gains throughout the fiscal year, enabling us to invest selectively in higher-growth businesses. 30 The Clorox Company 2017 Integrated Annual Report G4-2 Corporate Responsibility Highlights Shrink our environmental footprint while we grow. Our Glad® brand’s Rogers, Arkansas, plant — our largest manufacturing facility by number of employees — reached zero-waste-to-landfill status, becoming our third site to achieve this designation. A partnership with a nonprofit is helping the Burt’s Bees® brand achieve its sustainability goals while also helping adults with disabilities gain self esteem through meaningful work. By separating unsellable product from its packaging — for example, squeezing all the lotion out of a tube or twisting a lip balm out of its stick — the brand’s nonprofit partner was able to turn product waste into compostable or recyclable material, As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible sourcing of palm oil, we targeted our top suppliers, reducing waste to energy by 90 percent compared tracing more than 70 percent of the palm ingredients with past practices. we source from them back to the mill. This figure is based on information collected by TFT, which is Based on a supplier survey that received a 100 percent conducting our palm oil mapping work. The suppliers response rate, more than 99 percent of the fiber we engaged represent 95 percent of our direct, domestically sourced palm-derivative ingredients. source directly was determined to be recycled or certified virgin fiber. Our Kingsford® brand’s Summer Shade, Kentucky, manufacturing facility installed a fabric superstructure — slightly larger than a football field and nine stories tall — over its woodpile to prevent the material from being exposed to the elements. With the woodpile protected, less energy is required to dry it before it’s used to make char, a key ingredient for manufacturing charcoal briquets. A superstructure designed to keep woodpiles dry is expected to reduce one Kingsford manufacturing facility’s annual energy consumption by 10 percent. G4-2 31 Corporate Responsibility Priorities: Operational Footprint Reduction Reduce the environmental impact of our operations and improve the sustainability of our upstream supply chain. As the fifth year of our footprint reduction goal period comes to a close, we have already exceeded our 2020 goals to reduce solid-waste-to-landfill and water use and remain on target to reach our 2020 goals to lower energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Our facilities are not energy-intensive or water-intensive, making ongoing progress challenging now that we have already reduced energy and water use by 23 percent and 33 percent, respectively, per case of product sold, since establishing our first sustainability strategy in 2008. Nevertheless, we continue to seek innovative ways to reduce our overall operational footprint.

Companies qualify for the norm by meeting two criteria: 1) superior financial performance, defined by a net profit margin and/or return on invested capital that exceeds industry averages; and 2) superior human resources practices, defined by employee opinion scores near the top among the most financially successful companies surveyed by Willis Towers Watson. 2 Based on corporate benchmarking by Clorox, we consider a recordable incident rate of 1.0 or less to be world-class. Our FY17 RIR of .60 means that for every 100 Clorox employees, we averaged less than one reportable incident during the past year. According to the latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average RIR for goods-producing manufacturing companies is 3.7. The criteria used to determine RIR follows the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and is applied globally. 3 Benchmarking of Clorox performance on U.S. minority managers and employees is calculated using data from the 2010 Census. 4 Past data on Clorox minority and female board members only counted independent board members.

In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2017 (presented on pages 46 through 50) is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Clorox Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated August 15, 2017 (not presented separately herein). San Francisco, CA August 15, 2017 G4-33 51 Report of Independent Accountants on Review of Nonfinancial Information THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF THE CLOROX COMPANY We have reviewed selected quantitative performance indicators (the “Subject Matter”) included in Exhibit A and as identified by the “ ” symbol presented in The Clorox Company’s (“Clorox” or “the Company”) Annual Report and Executive Summary (the “Reports”) for the year ended June 30, 2017 or otherwise noted, in accordance with the criteria also set forth in Exhibit A (the “Criteria”). We did not review all information included in the Reports. We did not review the narrative sections of the Reports, except where they incorporated the Subject Matter. Clorox’s management is responsible for the Subject Matter included in Exhibit A and as also presented in the Reports, in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter, is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion. As described in Exhibit A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the selected quantitative performance indicators for the year ended June 30, 2017 or otherwise noted, in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

Note 1: Nonfinancial information is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. 1 All percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number in the annual report. 2 For all locations where Clorox maintains operational control and for the calendar year ended Dec. 31, 2016. 3 Scope 1 emissions include direct energy used by Clorox in its operations, categorized by stationary combustion, mobile combustion, refrigerant use, direct VOC loss and direct wood pyrolysis. The last two sources relate mainly to Clorox’s Kingsford business unit, and wood pyrolysis is considered to be a mostly carbon neutral process; therefore, CO2 emissions from wood pyrolysis are not included in total tCO2e, but CO2 equivalent emissions from CH4 and N2O are included. Natural gas emissions, the largest Scope 1 emission source, are calculated using factors from EPA Mandatory GHG Reporting for Stationary Fuel Sources (June 2017) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. 4 Clorox’s natural gas, electricity and municipal water consumption data for U.S. sites are tracked by Clorox’s third-party utility management company. Other sources of energy and water consumption in the U.S. are tracked manually on a site-by-site basis and reported to Clorox’s corporate team on an annual basis. For international sites, all energy and water consumption data is tracked manually and reported annually to Clorox’s corporate team. 5 Scope 2 includes indirect emissions resulting from Clorox’s purchased electricity use. It is calculated following the GHG Protocol’s location-based method using the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2014 eGRID emission factors for U.S. locations and the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Foreign Electricity Emission Factors published in 2007 for international locations. Clorox applies GWPs from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report. 6 Scope 3 includes finished goods transportation in the U.S. only and global employee business travel. Employee business travel includes emissions from commercial air flights and rental car use by Clorox’s employees. Commercial air flights are limited to business travel booked in the United States, United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Chile, Mexico, Peru and Canada. Mobile emission sources are calculated using emission factors from the EPA Climate Leaders Greenhouse Gas Inventory Protocol Core Module Guidance, published in 2008. 7 A stat case is the number of cases sold or produced multiplied by a stat factor which normalizes case value between brands and provides a common denominator of the revenue generated by cases across various brands. 8 Once a product meets the sustainability improvement criteria, it is reported to the Clorox Eco Team by each business unit and the sustainability improvement percentage is calculated for that product using its fiscal year net customer sales as a percentage of Clorox’s total fiscal year net customer sales. The total sustainability improvements percentage represents the summation of all sustainability improvement percentages for products that met the criteria between Jan. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2016. 9 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. 10 For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. U.S. product donations include donations made by any U.S. business unit. 11 Recordable incident rate was determined as of July 20, 2017, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. The recordable incident rate includes all reportable incidents that occurred at Clorox facilities globally. It does not include labor hours associated with nine remote facilities that have fewer than 30 employees. 12 Clorox adopts Willis Towers Watson’s definition of employee engagement in terms of “sustainable” engagement. Employee engagement is measured by a survey administered March 13, 2017, through March 31, 2017. 6,219 Clorox employees responded to the survey. 53 Corporate Governance Guided by our core value of doing the right thing, Clorox maintains rigorous corporate governance practices and internal controls, with oversight from the company’s board of directors as well as the chairman and chief executive officer, general counsel, chief financial officer and other members of the Clorox Executive Committee. The Clorox Code of Conduct details the ethical and legal standards of behavior and business practices that are required of all our directors, executives and employees around the world. All 8,100+ individuals must complete training and/or certify compliance with the code. We expect any organization that works with Clorox to mirror our values and business practices regarding legal and regulatory compliance, product quality, safety, human rights and treatment of employees. Before contracting with new business partners, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of capabilities, quality and safety standards, ethics and alignment with our strategy and core values to ensure they meet the ideals we’ve established for ourselves as a company. On an ongoing basis, we also require key business partners to adhere to our Business Partner Code of Conduct. This code outlines expected practices of direct suppliers of goods, service providers, consultants, distributors, licensees, joint ventures, contractors and temporary workers in the areas of human rights and labor, health and safety, the environment, and business conduct and ethics. 33% 33% 36% Of Board Are Of Board Are Of Clorox Executive WOMEN MINORITIES Committee Are WOMEN All data as of June 30, 2017.

We are using the term “corporate responsibility priorities” instead of “materiality topics” to avoid confusion with the term as it relates to key information that can impact financial statements. The priorities and accompanying matrix were developed with support from a third party, capturing key inputs from the company’s 2020 Strategy, which includes corporate responsibility commitments, as well as feedback from employees and numerous external stakeholders.

Key corporate responsibility priorities may include, but are not limited to, topics that could have a significant financial impact on the organization. Review of Nonfinancial Information We believe voluntary assurance strengthens our reporting process and enhances the credibility of our nonfinancial information.
