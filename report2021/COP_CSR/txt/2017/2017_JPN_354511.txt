Thousands of flowers on the ground brilliant Big Dipper in the sky swear to Home Town Ina faith and trust, Oh! Rubycon advance together hand in hand 3 Overview of Rubycon Group Companies Japan Production Bases Overseas Production Bases Japan Sales Bases Overseas Sales Offices 4 CSR policy and System Consumer Safety and Protection Rubycon products contribution to society << Rubycon products contribute to society through power electronics technologies >> Urgent global themes such as energy issues are faced by societies. Core technologies to control energy with countermeasures to avoid escalation of global warming with power electronics are of primary importance. Rubycon is proposing capacitors to various power conversion devices to contribute higher efficiency, longer life and miniaturization. << Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Electrolytic Capacitor >> Conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors have a wider temperature range, are more compact, have lower ESR, and higher resistance to ripple current than other aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These features enable high-efficiency power supply design and can contribute to the reduced number of parts. The net result of this capacitor technology is energy savings improved efficiency. 5 << Example of parts reduction with conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor >> << Power Film Capacitor >> Voltage and current of main circuits have been increased to improve efficiency in power electronics. Most notably, in applications such as solar/wind power and automotive. Demand of large film capacitors (referred to as power film capacitors) is increasing. We are addressing deposition technology and low ESL (inductance) designs to improve efficiency and improve miniaturization. 6 << Screw Terminal Type Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor >> Screw Terminal Type Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors are used for main circuit of power electronics together with power film capacitors. We are downsizing dimensions and raising withstand voltage with our independent development of new electrolytes and adoption of high capacitance etched foil. Stud screw type capacitors have efficient heat radiation structure and high resistance to ripple current, so as to contribute to efficient packaging and downsizing of equipment. We are further addressing to develop new electrolyte and foil for higher voltage use, which is important to circuits for the next-generation power electronics semiconductor. 7 << Electric Double Layer Capacitor >> Electric double layer capacitors use electric double layer produced on the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte (as dielectric) for storing electric charges. This capacitor realizes quick charge-discharge cycles as well as long life since there aren't chemical reactions to store charges. This capacitor is ideal for applications requiring momentary large current such as power assist and energy regeneration. If the capacitor is used as the main power for rechargeable equipment, maintenance is reduced. 8 Fair Business Practices We are compliant regarding relevant statutes, internal regulations, social norms and ethics, and excluding relations with antisocial forces, so as to promote business activities through fair and good competition and to secure safe and ease of customers in consideration of views and positions of ordinary citizens. Compliance We are observing all statutes relating to business (labor, environment, public welfare, trade, industry, commerce, national tax and civil affairs), and as well as conducting fair business and transactions. On the basis of our internal regulations, we are developing such activities to our group companies through mutual improvement. We have published Rubycon Group Code of Conduct conforming to EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), and are providing it to all employees and group companies. If any compliance violation is found, we will seek accurate facts to determine the cause followed by strict action to prevent recurrence. Internal Audit We have a designated audit department under the president's direct supervision to audit fair and proper performance of internal activities in accordance with relevant statutes, operation policy and internal regulations. The department will further provide advice to improve and correct our business as well as the risks for compliance in organizational activities. This audit covers all organizations in each company group. Risk Management In addition to Risk Management Activities conducted since 2012, we are strengthening internal systems and reviewing relevant internal regulation since inquiries from customers on code of conduct and ethical risk management are increasing. We will also assess effectiveness of disaster contingency plan as well as reviewing BCP (Business Continuity Plan) for disaster and unexpected contingency. Protection of Intellectual Properties (Measures against Counterfeit Products) We, have participated in the IIPPF (International Intellectual Property Protection Forum) so as to cooperate with various entities and companies for eradicating counterfeits. Protection and Control of Information Misuse of information important to corporate management will have significant impact on relations of trust with partners and their management. We have established security policy and privacy policy recognizing importance of information assets. We give the first priority in risk management and BCP to the policies. We are protecting and controlling information assets through education of employees and various security measures and activities. 9 Organization Governance CSR Policy Rubycon's CSR System to accomplish corporate social responsibility is shown at the right.
