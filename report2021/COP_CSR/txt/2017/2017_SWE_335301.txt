Those systems use just over 2 tons of ODS coolants, with a leakage of 97 kg in 2016 Starting in 2016, Perstorp has used certified reference values** for determining our emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). This led to an apparent decrease in our total emissions from the values reported in prior years. In the interest of transparency, we have re-calculated our emissions of GHG for 2014 and 2015, using these same emissions factors. We believe that we have achieved a substantial decrease in actual GHG emissions per ton of product manufactured.
