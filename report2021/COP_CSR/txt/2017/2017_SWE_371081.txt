A total of 48 employees, of which 10 were men, went on parental leave in 2016, and 19 employees returned to their plants and were integrated back into work. Depending on country and plant, there are of course various part-time models with differing approaches. Benefits Benefits provided to full-time employees vary between the plants in the Group. Typical benefits offered are healthcare, disability, and invalidity or life insurances. Several other benefits are in place and have been established over many years.

These activities are mainly promoted by the plants themselves, often in cooperation with local organisations and authorities to keep maintain and increase our good relationship with them. Three examples of activities in 2016: support to children and the fire brigade support to local families in need Our plant in Krakow, Poland, focused in 2016 on kids As part of its social engagement, the plant in Graz, Austria, engagement and supported a local school (Stanislawice) supported the local charity organisation “Steirer helfen Steirern” with computers and a needed renovation of a sports ground, initiative with a donation of 3.000 EUR in 2016.

The financial support is used for basic needs such as utilities and food, but also to develop the school and motivate parents to send their children to school. Flextrus also supports the humanitarian organisation SOS Children’s Village by donating the remaining value of outdated and scrapped mobile phones. On local level, continuous support goes to the local Faktum organisation that helps former addicts to re-enter working life again as well as to Missing People – a voluntary organisation searching for lost people.

Consequently, the “near accident” reporting the target of “zero accidents” at all plants is reachable. One is part of the plant’s KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and recurrent example is the A&R Carton plant in Lund, Sweden, the target for 2017 is set at zero LTIs and one “near accident” where the safety of workers is a top priority and the record of report per day. 1.113 days without any work-related injuries leading to absence was reached in December 2016!

Although confronted and safety with 2 LTIs in 2016 (after zero accidents in 2015), Krakow has installed a very robust work safety system with continuous improvements, which in addition leads to willingness to invest in work safety. An example of this is the relocation of a rotogravure printing press at the plant. After thorough analysis of the machine by Krakow experts before installation, the printing press was adapted to legal requirements but also to local high safety standards. The investments was about 11.000 EUR. krakow fire protection Fire protection is also a focus area at our plants and part of ongoing upgrading of installed systems. frankfurt In 2016 our plant in Krakow, Poland, invested about 65.000 EUR in modernisation of the fire moscow detection and extinguishing system so as to have the newest model of main control unit and etc. modern smoke detectors. Another example is the plant in Frankfurt, Germany, which extended the fire protection system to a further office area in order to increase the early detection. The plant in Moscow, Russia, did a total survey with maintenance and control of the fire protection equipment in 2016. Several plants perform drills with professional and volunteer fire brigades at the plants. Fire brigades must know the organisation and structure of the plant to be able to react fast and efficiently. Moreover, employees are trained to extinguish fires and to cooperate with the fire brigade. augsburg new ways to With the help of external support, the plant in Augsburg, Germany, built a new e-learning tool train safety on work safety that covers questions on behaviour in the workplace, the handling of hazardous and awareness substances, behaviour in case of fire, and a final test for each employee.

The main advantage with all carton and paperbased packaging is the use of renewable sources as the main material. Pro Carton (the European Association of Carton and Cartonboard manufacturers) has published an explanation and background to the carbon cycle. The carbon cycle for cartonboard products is a closed loop, beginning and ending with the sustainably managed forest: • CO2 is absorbed and stored in trees – sustainable forestry Besides the great impact of raw material, the reduction of maintains or increases the amount of CO2 stored. carbon footprint for AR Packaging is closely connected to the • Thinnings and offcuts are processed into fibres and further reduction of energy usage and emissions thereof.

Neither have we have been used for several years. received any complaints regarding violations in our advertising. FOOD SAFETY AND HYGIENE MANAGEMENT 46 hygiene management In the context of food safety, work hygiene management is essential in the food industry and is therefore also demanded in the production of food packaging. Impurities, foreign bodies, quality defects or spread of diseases are only a few examples of risks for all stakeholders in the supply chain. These can result in costly recalls or damaged reputation and must be countered accordingly. hygiene management in continous unannounced auditing with personnel entering production areas without following development Together with one of our demanding customers, it has been the set hygiene rules. Overall compliance with hygiene rules Linked to customer structure, 17 plants are certified according agreed that six plants will submit to the new approach of “unclearly improved and will be followed up closely. Hand hygiene to a hygiene management systems, including the HACCP risk announced audit” within BRC/FSSC22000 certifications. Such an swab testing shows improved hygiene to a very high level, and analysis of processes. Due to changing customer requirements, unannounced audit will be performed 3-12 months before the new targets are fixed for 2018 to challenge the process. These four plants have in 2016 moved to the FSSC 22000 standard audit due date and at the latest 42 days before the certificate types of hygiene gates are common for food producers and a – also called the “Food safety management system” – with the expires. The certification grading will remain unchanged. This good example of how strict requirements are transferred to the latest example being the plant in St. Petersburg, Russia, where a approach will raise the involved plants to a higher level because packaging suppliers. Based on customer structure and strategy, cup production centre has been set up in addition to the existall employees have to expect an audit every day, even when the the plant in Cholet, France, plans to implement comparable high ing tobacco business. Nine plants are still on well-established experts of the plant are not available. levels of food safety and hygiene management in 2017. BRC standards (one plant holds both certifications), and five plants are certified with ISO 22000. increasing requirements Our plants supplying the infant nutrition industry need to meet higher requirements on hygiene. This is partly driven by special baby food limits in both EU and Chinese regulations and reflected in the requirements from our customers. These high demands cover hygiene, food protection, food fraud and migration – and also require high attentiveness and the ability to assist customers rapidly if any problems occur. Our main plant involved is A&R Carton Lund, Sweden, where food safety and hygiene standards have increased over the last few years. One example of this in 2016 is the newly installed modern system for inlet control, ensuring 100% compliance with hygiene rules for hand hygiene. Other entrance doors have been blocked with a strict limitation for entry to production areas through a hygiene entrance, resulting in no incidents FOOD SAFETY AND HYGIENE MANAGEMENT 47 RISK MANAGEMENT AR Packaging is exposed to a number of business-related risks that are continuously monitored by the Group.
