Conditions of employment at Dunamis are outlined by the company regulations document approved in 2003 by the Department of Manpower. The policy under Chapter 1, Article 3(e), states that all employees have the right to equal treatment in line with their Human Rights. It also outlines the company’s remuneration standards, working hours as well as employees’ rights to holidays and leaves and to practice their faith.

Dunamis provides well beyond the minimum standards of employment, One of the examples is the staﬀs at Dunamis are free to enjoy a healthy company-provided lunch on every work day, served at our indoor and outdoor lunchrooms.
