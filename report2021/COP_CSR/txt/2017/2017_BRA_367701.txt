In factories, it continued to improve its operation, always trying to produce more while using as little fuel, energy and water as possible and generating less waste. Each of these resources is managed as an indicator of the Company’s productivity, which allows its strict control. From a managerial point of view, Whirlpool started the Sustainable Processes Program, which seeks to bring maturity to the processes carried out within the Company. To do this, it works with routine management and it applies continuous improvements through quality tools, optimizing employee’s day-to-day activities. Industry 4.0 Whirlpool Corporation has a global initiative for Manufacturing 4.0 development, which encompasses innovative technologies for automation and data exchange during production. The goal is to create “intelligent factories” with systems that communicate and cooperate with one another, gaining in efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the production process. The project is still in the pilot phase and should begin to be deployed in the subsidiaries in the next years. WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 | 2016 OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE 38 ENERGY GRI G4-EN3 | G4-EN5 | G4-EN6 Continuous improvement in production processes has brought recurring gains in the Company’s energy savings. Among the main initiatives to reduce consumption is the installation of efficient lighting in the Units, with replacement of fluorescent lamps for LED lamps, the exchange of old engines for new high performance ones and other improvements in equipment. In addition, Whirlpool has expanded the level of sectorization that it accompanies energy consumption, identifying points where there are greater opportunities to reduce it and setting increasingly ambitious goals. As a result, the Company has achieved a significant reduction in energy intensity, in the last two years, an indicator that measures how much energy is consumed for each one million Brazilian reais sold: 36% less since 2014.

Aligned to the National Solid Waste Policy and stimulated by the result, in 2015, the Company achieved a new goal of eliminating non-industrial waste to landfills. The goal was achieved due to new destination alternatives, good practices for selective garbage collection, segregation monitoring in the waste centers and awareness campaigns with employees in the Units. This achievement made Whirlpool’s operations in Brazil a reference worldwide, since the expectation is for other regions to stop sending waste to landfills by 2022.

In Joinville, a renovation in the plant resulted in the change of roofing, generating 146 tons of Asbestos Tiles, which were sent to a landfill. As it is an extraordinary procedure, since asbestos is a liability with no available alternative of recycling, the volume was kept off the table.
