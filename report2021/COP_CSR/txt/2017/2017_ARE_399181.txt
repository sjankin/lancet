Following CTG’s #HeforShe Champions of Change initiative, our male Country Manger in Afghanistan was the first to lead on implementing the Female First platform in one of our field offices. We had just won a contract locally which needed new project management so we opened this up solely for female candidates. In order to recruit women into this workplace, CTG ran a capacity-building campaign with local families to encourage them to allow their daughters/wives to apply for the role. We then invited the families into our offices to meet the team and assess the suitability for them to work for CTG. CTG also worked with local universities to assist with our outreach efforts. Both Aliya and Zoya have volunteered to be part of our Champions of Change platform. In Afghanistan, we continue to work with our clients in encouraging them to expand their budgets, consider women for roles and permit family members (male and Zoya Hemat, Aliya Ghulami, female) to work side-by-side on projects.
