Back to Contents 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 5 Sustainable Development Goals Melbourne Water has committed to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative. Linked to this, we also signed a public CEO Statement of Support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) along with over 30 other leaders in the Australian business community. Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals The SDGs are a common set of goals to put the world on a sustainable path. The universal goals aim to mobilise efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change, while ensuring that no one is left behind. The vital role of water and related resources in creating and delivering sustainable communities puts Melbourne Water in a key position to contribute to this global effort. Melbourne Water aims to enhance our contribution across all goals, while demonstrating leadership for SDGs 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation, 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities and 15 – Life on Land. Given Melbourne Water’s approach, the Melbourne Water Annual Report 2016-17 provides information on how Melbourne Water is contributing across all the goals. Our strategic direction clearly outlines our commitment to the economy, environment and community across three pillars and organisational themes. Our three pillars are: Healthy People – strengthening the wellbeing of the community; Healthy Places – co-creating the world’s most desirable places to live; and Healthy Environment – enhancing the natural environment. Our organisational themes comprise Customer Focus, Inspired People, Continuous Improvement and Financial Sustainability. The SDGs align closely with Melbourne Water’s strategic direction, particularly goals 6, 11 and 15. Creating the world’s most liveable city is a collaborative effort. As such, the SDGs will provide us, as well as our stakeholders and customers, with a common framework to deliver ongoing community wellbeing and a sustainable, well-managed environment for future generations. How to navigate this report from a sustainable reporting context The interdependent nature of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) means that by delivering our strategic direction, Melbourne Water will contribute across all 17 goals. Relevant SDGs which link to our work are aligned in the footer of each section of this report. Melbourne Water demonstrates leadership in SDG 6, SDG 11 and SDG 15. These three goals are aligned to our strategic direction of Healthy People, Healthy Places, Healthy Environment (see pages 8 to 44). Further, goals which align strongly within our organisation are linked with case studies. To learn more about how we determined our material goal focus, see the Global Reporting Initiative index (Appendix H). 6 | 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report Back to Contents Case Study Main Content 24-26 64-70 26-27 42 10-15 16-17 18-19 13 24-26 52-58 59-63 19 43-44 52-58 56 52-58 Chapter: Healthy People (pp 8-19) 22-23 24-26 26-27 30-33 Clean water and sanitation 15 is at the core of our 34 35-36 46-48 75 business, and will remain important in the face of population growth and climate change. 17 16-17 38-40 41 50-51 52-58 27 59-63 64-72 10-15 16-17 18-19 22-23 44,61 24-26 43-44 59-63 51 24-26 50-51 52-58 Chapter: Healthy Places (pp 20-27) Water is at the heart 10-15 18-19 30-33 35-36 25 of cities.

More than 400 kilometres of pipes and pumps transfer waste from the networks of Melbourne’s retail water companies to our treatment facilities. Melbourne Water’s treatment plants process sewage, which can then be supplied as recycled water or safely released into Port Phillip Bay and Bass Strait. In 2016-17, these systems operated to customer and regulatory standards. Our ongoing investment in capital works, totalling more than $115.1 million in 2016-17, places us in a strong position to continue this service standard into the future.

The Yarra River and its environs underpin the liveability and economic prosperity of Melbourne. The river and its catchment provides 70 per cent of Melbourne’s drinking Andrew Kelly water, and is home to one-third of Victoria’s animal species. Yarra Riverkeeper Over 190 bird species also live within the Yarra River corridor. Yarra Riverkeeper’s Association Traversing 242 kilometres of urban and rural landscapes, the river provides farming irrigation and parklands for recreation. The river is also of great spiritual and cultural significance for Aboriginal communities. In February 2017, the Victorian Government released its Yarra River Action Plan which contains 30 actions to ensure the long-term protection of the river and its parklands. The plan has nominated Melbourne Water as the lead agency for seven of these actions, including the development of a 50year Community Vision for the Yarra. The Community Vision will become the foundation for an overarching Yarra Strategic Plan, which will ensure better coordination of activities and decision-making processes for the entire river. Particular attention will be given to issues such as waterway management, public land, infrastructure, management of cultural and heritage values, statutory planning and planning for whole of river amenity. The Community Vision and the Yarra Strategic Plan will embrace the Caring for Country wisdom of Traditional Owners by working in partnership with the Wurundjeri Council to Wilipgin Birrarung murron (keep the Yarra alive). Planning is already underway to ensure that Traditional Owners, relevant key stakeholder agencies and departments are actively involved in developing the Yarra Strategic Plan. One significant achievement in 2016-17 has been the implementation of stronger planning controls and an associated Advisory Note to protect the Yarra River corridor. This process was led by the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) in partnership with Melbourne Water and affected councils. 32 | 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report Back to Contents Delivering Environmental Water Releases Rivers and creeks have natural patterns of high and low flows which plants and animals rely on at different times to reproduce and survive. These patterns can be disrupted by human activity and climate change, with damaging effects for wildlife. Environmental water releases are designed to emulate natural river flows, and improve the health of waterways for native animals and plants. Melbourne Water, on behalf of the Victorian Environmental Water Holder, manages the environmental water reserve for the river systems of Port Phillip and Western Port catchments. Recent monitoring has revealed good fish migration and has detected Australian Grayling in the Werribee River system for the first time. Melbourne Water delivered over 25 billion litres of water in 2016-17, as shown in Table 2. Table 2: Environmental water delivered for 2016-17 River Volume Outcomes Yarra 21,361ML Five releases of environmental water were made into the Yarra system to allow the migration of Australian Grayling (Prototroctes maraena), improve water quality and improve access to breeding and feeding habitat by macroinvertebrates, platypus and fish. Movement opportunities for small native fish were also provided in the upper reaches or the river, and small rapids and pool habitats were refreshed in the middle reaches for improved macroinvertebrate, platypus and fish habitats. Tarago 1952ML Three releases were made into the Tarago system to maintain water quality, provide habitat for River Blackfish, platypus and macroinvertebrates and support spawning of Australian Grayling. Werribee 1850ML Six releases were made to provide and improve frog and macroinvertebrate habitat in Coimadai Creek near Bacchus Marsh. This also promoted fish migration and improved water quality in the lower reaches through Werribee. Maribyrnong 304ML Three environmental flow releases improved water quality and improved small rapids habitats in the upper reaches.

Melbourne Water is one of Australia’s major greenhouse gas emitters and climate change poses significant risks to our services over the long term. Melbourne Water’s land management, water supply, wastewater and urban development activities provide unique opportunities to support the natural environment and community wellbeing. Melbourne Water is developing a new Climate Change and Resilience Plan (CCRP) for our business to ensure we are prepared and capable to address future challenges. The CCRP will build on past progress, and respond in four key areas: • greenhouse gas emissions • environmental resilience • community resilience • adapting to climate change. Melbourne Water is working with the Victorian Government to help achieve zero net emissions from the metropolitan water sector by 2030 through the Take 2 Pledge program. We have extensive experience in improving energy efficiency and generating renewable energy, and we are researching and testing methods to reduce direct emissions from our activities. In 2016-17, we invested $690,000 into climate change research across a broad range of projects.

In 2016-17, we built on our Digital Strategy with the creation of three Continuous Value Stream (CVS) teams. These teams (Business Intelligence, Field Mobility and Business Process Optimisation) build and release software for our people to use and test in real-life working environments. Our CVS teams work quickly and efficiently and seek user feedback to ensure continual improvement. Our Pre-Work Safety Check app, which is now a critical Melbourne Water safety tool, was developed and built in just 12 weeks. Our CVS teams have also improved existing digital platforms such as the 2017 relaunch of the Melbourne Water app, which recorded nearly 4000 new users in its first month. As part of our Digital Strategy, the Digital Delivery Program was created delivering 11 new projects in the past year, including a new system to manage SMS and web notification to our Water Entitlement and Patterson Lakes customers. In addition, our newly developed DevConnect project created an online application management solution that has helped Melbourne Water become faster, smarter and easier to work with. Digital technologies have also played an important role in tightening our security processes. Throughout 2016-17 we implemented an e-lock trial at the Western Treatment Plant. Unlike traditional lock and key processes, the new e-lock system integrates with the site’s remote building management system and employee fobs. This has resulted in improved security and reduced administration, with access being remotely managed.

Fair value assessment is performed annually as a depreciation and impairment. Where an asset is acquired managerial valuation and formal independent valuations are for no or nominal cost, the cost is its fair value at the date of completed every five years. The Corporation also considers acquisition. The cost of constructed non-financial physical more frequent revaluations in regards to infrastructure assets includes the cost of all materials used in construction during price determination years as valuations are closely and direct labour on the project.

All non-financial physical assets are subsequently measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Non-financial physical assets are measured at fair value with regard to the asset’s highest and best use after due consideration is made for any legal or physical restrictions imposed on the asset, public announcements or commitments made in relation to the intended use of the asset. Theoretical opportunities that may be available in relation to the asset are not taken into account until it is virtually certain that the restrictions will no longer apply. Therefore, unless otherwise disclosed, the current use of these non-financial physical assets will be their highest and best use.

[2] The variance to prior year is unfavourable due to lower operating cash flows in relation to a reduction in customer receipts of $93.8 million resulting from lower revenue as per the 2016 pricing determination and higher cash payments of $73.0 million for capital expenditure. Also, a dividend of $28.3 million (zero for 2015-16) was paid during the period. The 201617 result is above the target range and in line with business expectations. It's anticipated that future year on year variances will fluctuate in line with expected revenue as per the 2016 pricing determination and capital expenditure profile. [3] The variance to prior year is unfavourable resulting from higher current borrowings of $89.7 million mainly to fund capital expenditure. This is in line with the Corporation's liquidity strategy which involves optimal utilisation of cash and borrowings. [4] The variance to prior year is unfavourable due to lower Earnings Before Net Interest and Tax as a result of a decrease in revenues by $80.3 million mainly from bulk water and bulk sewerage services following a priced reduction from the 2016 pricing determination. The 2016-17 result is above the target range and in line with business expectations. It is anticipated that future year on year variances will fluctuate in line with expected revenue as per the 2016 pricing determination. [5] The favourable variance to target is due to lower borrowing levels and interest rates which have resulted in lower finance charges and higher operating cash flows. [6] The favourable variance to target is due to an increase in operating cash flows that were used to fund the 2016-17 capital expenditure program. [7] The favourable variance to target is due to lower borrowings as a result of higher operating cash flows. [8] The favourable variance to target is due to higher Earnings Before Net Interest and Tax during the year driven by higher than anticipated revenue from developer charges and contributed assets. Average assets were also higher due to the 2015-16 asset revaluations not included in plan. [9] The favourable variance to target is due to higher Net Profit After Tax in 2016-17 compared to plan. Improved performance is due to higher than anticipated revenue from developer charges and contributed assets. An increase in the asset revaluation reserve resulting from the 2015-16 asset revaluations not included in plan contributed to an increase in the average equity. [10] The positive result is due to major storage reservoirs being well managed and there were no significant events impacting water turbidity. [11] The actual and variance results for the reduction in flood effects metric is N/A due to the timing of the 2016-17 Corporate Plan process and new targets established in the Waterways, Drainage Investment Plan (WDIP) which were based on best estimates at the time of the 2016-17 Corporate Plan publication. The flooding target of 3% was subsequently revised to 0% for 2016-17 once the WDIP was finalised. This is now in-line with WDIP and 2017-18 Corporate plan targets. The 2015-16 target “A further 10% of currently known intolerable (extreme) flood risks will be reduced” was completed in 2015-16 and new targets were set by the Flood Management Strategy – Port Phillip and Westernport. The 2015-16 result has been reported as N/A given the 2016-17 is a new target. [12] The Healthy Waterways Strategy achieved 16 out of 17 targets. The five-year target for stock exclusion fencing is behind plan having so far achieved 373 kilometres out of 545 kilometres. A change in government policy in the Yellingbo area has affected predicted uptake for stock exclusion fencing and as a result measures are being put in place to target fencing through our grants program in 2017-18. The variance compared to previous years was due to all targets being achieved in 2015-16. [13] ETP — Recycled Water (Reliability) metric is not applicable as the retailer has not specified any contractual service or regulatory obligation based on their customer requirements. Communication protocols have been established between the plant and retailer regarding any scheduled or unexpected outages.

Back to Contents 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 153 Appendix C – Bulk Entitlements The Victorian Government introduced bulk water reforms on the 1 July 2014. These reforms introduced a ‘source’ and ‘delivery’ bulk entitlement model for Melbourne with a seasonal determination process and rights to carry over unused water allocations from year to year. The four systems currently supplying Melbourne (Thomson River, Yarra River, Silver and Wallaby Creeks and Tarago and Bunyip Rivers) are collectively known as the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. Melbourne Water was assigned the Source Bulk Entitlements to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool. The Delivery Bulk Entitlements to the Greater Yarra System – Thomson River Pool were assigned to Barwon Water, City West Water, South East Water, South Gippsland Water, Western Water, Westernport Water and Yarra Valley Water (the ‘primary entitlement holders’). As the Resource Manager for the Melbourne headworks system, Melbourne Water allocates water to the primary entitlement holders by making seasonal determinations to them. Melbourne Water is also the Storage Manager (under section 171B of the Water Act 1989) for water sources in the Melbourne headworks system. The following table fulfils the reporting requirements in Melbourne Water’s bulk entitlements.

Contracts commenced to which the VIPP applied Melbourne Water commenced 10 metropolitan contracts to which the VIPP applied. These contracts totalled $90.5 million. The Industry Capability Network (ICN) deemed that there were no contestable items on 4 contracts and therefore a VIPP plan was not required. The commitments by contractors that required a VIPP plan included: • local content of 84% of the total value of the contracts • 389 full time equivalent jobs • 18 full time equivalent apprenticeships and traineeships. Contracts completed to which the VIPP applied The Corporation completed 11 metropolitan contracts to which the VIPP applied. These contracts totalled $111.7 million. The outcomes reported by contractors under the VIPP included: • local content of 95% of the total value of the contracts • 266 full time equivalent jobs • 12 full time equivalent apprenticeships and traineeships. Please Note: Outcomes for one contractor have not been included as the contractor did not provide the VIPP Monitoring Table and Statutory Declaration in the required timeframe. Grants and Design Contracts For design contracts where the project being designed is over the $3.0 million VIPP threshold, the successful contractor must involve the ICN in the design process. The ICN's involvement ensures that the design, where possible, does not disadvantage local suppliers. The issue of an interaction reference number (IRN) signifies that this has occurred. For the year ending 30 June 2017 the following design contracts over the $3M threshold will require an IRN number: • Murrumbeena Main Drain • RIS Penstocks Detailed Design • North Yarra Deviator Sewer Functional Design. Strategic Projects: One Strategic Project was commenced to which VIPP was applied. This contract was for the WTP Treatment Capacity Increase Project Phase 2. The commitment by the contractor that required a Local Industry Development Plan (LIDP) included: • local content of 85 per cent of the total value of the contracts • 85 full time equivalent jobs • 11 full time equivalent apprenticeships and traineeships. 164 | 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report Back to Contents Appendix H – Global Reporting Initiative Melbourne Water is signatory to the UN Global Compact and supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Part of our commitment to the SDGs is an annual report on progress in how we are advancing the goals. Melbourne Water’s approach to reporting against the SGDs is through our Strategic KPIs in our Corporate Plan and through a formal sustainability reporting mechanism, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). GRI and the UN Global Compact have established an initiative ‘Business Reporting on the SDGs’ which will produce a handbook in December 2017 for SDG business reporting in the meantime. This report adopts the GRI Sustainability Standards (conforming to Core level of reporting)² as they are the current global standard for sustainability reporting and represent best practice. They are designed to be used by organisations to report about their impacts on the economy, the environment and/or society. Sustainable Development and Materiality Sustainability reporting requires an organisation to report on their significant economic, environmental and social impacts or that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders. In order to determine the issues that are material to Melbourne Water, engagement was undertaken to establish the relative significance of the SDGs to Melbourne Water’s strategic activities and to understand our impact or influence on the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Melbourne Water stakeholders, customers, and staff contributed to an understanding of what SDGs are material to us and where opportunities for leadership lie. The following activities were undertaken to support this materiality assessment: • external stakeholder interviews • interviews with Melbourne Water Leadership Team and managers • all staff survey • mapping of Melbourne water strategies and activities against the SDGs and targets • review of industry priorities • review of peer reporting. The results showed that Melbourne Water impacts across all 17 goals, albeit to differing degrees. The goals that are most material to us, SDGs 6, 11 and 15, align with the three pillars of our strategic direction. SDGs 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 17 also featured as material with Melbourne Water having less direct impact on SDGs 1, 2, 4, 10 and 16. Melbourne Water’s approach to sustainable development and to supporting the SDGs is to enhance our contribution across all UN SDGs, while demonstrating leadership for SDGs 6, 11 and 15. Given this, our GRI reporting (Core) covers most topics. In the few cases where specific disclosures are not relevant to our organisation they have been noted in the table. We have also reported on issues as they relate to the UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (see Appendix I, The UN Global Compact). 2 Melbourne Water’s 2015-16 Annual Report used G4 Guidelines this year we have moved to the GRI Standards framework Back to Contents 2016-17 Melbourne Water Annual Report | 165 Appendix H – Global Reporting Initiative (continued) Reporting The Melbourne Water Annual Report 2016-17 content was defined through a combination of extensive, business wide consultation, including with senior management and executives.
