Supplementary to this, the Supervisory Board has reserved the right, in addition to the fixed annual salary and the variable compensation components, to grant at its own discretion a one-off payment for exceptional performance. The contracts also provide for normal fringe benefits (private use of company car, accident insurance, etc.). There is no cap on the amount of any one-off payment for exceptional performance or on the value of fringe benefits because it does not appear necessary for such amounts to be capped in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Code recommendation and, in our legal appraisal, the Code recommendation does not extend to this. For the same reason, such payments and benefits are not covered by any cap on the amount of overall compensation.

The provisional fair values of the identified assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows: Provisional fair value (EUR million) on acquisition Intangible assets 47.5 Property, plant and equipment 49.0 Equity-method investments and other financial assets 26.7 Income tax assets and deferred tax assets 180.6 Inventories 24.9 Trade receivables and other receivables 174.8 Cash and cash equivalents 102.8 Other current assets 19.1 Total assets 625.4 Trade payables and other liabilities 654.7 Provisions 55.7 Financial liabilities 212.3 Total liabilities 922.7 Net assets (identified) (297.3) Non-controlling interest 150.1 Goodwill 323.7 Net assets (acquired) 176.5 The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree were meas­ ured at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The purchase price transferred for obtaining the non-controlling interests was EUR 167.3 million as of December 31, 2016. An amount of EUR 19.7 million was recognized as a liability for outstanding shares. The acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill in the amount of EUR 323.7 million based on UGL’s future earning power and expertise as well as expected synergies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Consolidated Financial Statements From the acquisition date to the December 31, 2016 balance sheet date, UGL contributed EUR 137.5 million to sales and EUR 3.6 million to profit after tax. Had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2016, UGL would have contributed sales of EUR 1,335.4 million and negative profit before tax of EUR 70.2 million—including EUR 134.7 million in impairments on receivables for the Ichthys project—in the CIMIC Group as of the balance sheet date. and Notes Acquisition—Sedgman Pty Limited On January 13, 2016, the CIMIC Group, through its subsidiary CIMIC Group Investments Pty Limited, gave notice in a takeover bit that it wished to acquire the 63.01% ownership interest not yet held in publicly listed mining services group Sedgman Limited, New South Wales, Australia (“Sedgman”). CIMIC increased its holding and thereby gained 172 Group Report 2016 control of Sedgman on February 23, 2016. The acquisition of the remaining shares was completed on April 13, 2016, following which CIMIC holds 100% of the shares. The fair values of the identified assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date are as follows: Fair value (EUR million) on acquisition Intangible assets 8.9 Property, plant and equipment 11.0 Equity-method investments and other financial assets 4.5 Income tax assets and deferred tax assets 2.9 Trade receivables and other receivables 49.7 Cash and cash equivalents 61.7 Other current assets 2.7 Total assets 141.4 Trade payables and other liabilities 58.3 Provisions 16.0 Financial liabilities 3.0 Total liabilities 77.3 Net assets (identified) 64.1 Non-controlling interest (31.2) Goodwill 41.4 Net assets (acquired) 74.3 The acquisition is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3. The total purchase consideration comprises cash paid of EUR 3.8 million on the date of obtaining control and the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the amount of EUR 70.4 million. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured at the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. The acquisition resulted in recognition of goodwill in the amount of EUR 41.4 million based on Sedgman’s future earning power and expertise as well as expected synergies. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquisition as a whole resulted in a gain before tax of EUR 31.4 million comprising remeasurement of the equity interest (EUR 17.1 million) and recycling of the reserves of associated equity interests (EUR 14.3 million) previously held by the CIMIC Group. Sedgman contributed EUR 150.6 million to CIMIC Group sales from the acquisition date to the December 31, 2016 balance sheet date. Had the acquisition occurred as of January 1, 2016, Sedgman’s contribution to Group sales would have been EUR 172.2 million. It is not possible to assess the contribution of the business to profit for the year because of the full integration of Sedgman into the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidation policies The financial statements of domestic and international companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations (acquisitions) are and Notes accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any minority interest. In accordance with the optional treatment under IFRS 3, non-controlling interest is measured at the acquisition date at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if Group Report 2016 173 they are separable from the accounting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any goodwill then left is recognized as an asset. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. Negative goodwill arising on initial measurement is recognized immediately in income. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when measuring disposal proceeds. Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies in their separate financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are reported in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies. Non-current assets held for sale In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division) are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. An agreement for the sale of the assets was signed in January 2016 and largely put into effect during the year under review. The remaining assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet. The table below shows the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale. No amount is additionally recognized in other comprehensive income.

Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro area operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. Accounting policies Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions Consolidated Financial Statements and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straight-line and Notes basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over a maximum of ten years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Group Report 2016 175 Company names and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery, and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives: No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment 3–10 Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Items of property, plant and equipment on finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or over a shorter contract term if applicable. Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. They are assessed using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. As with property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an Consolidated Financial Statements asset or cash-generating unit is normally defined as fair value less costs to sell or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is and Notes determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. 176 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, together with its share of such items held or incurred jointly, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint venture plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and non-current securities, are classed as held for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivConsolidated Financial Statements ables, and other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when: • The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer • The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with and Notes ownership nor effective control over the goods sold • The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably • It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group. Group Report 2016 177 Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described in the following. *See glossary on page 258. Construction contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion* (POC) method. Cumulative work done to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the percentage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/ from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) on contracts in progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the contract plus any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized within one operating cycle at the HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are not expected to be realized in full within twelve months of the balance sheet date. The POC method is primarily used in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 178 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. Should the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increase, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense. All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose and investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial meas­ urement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only. Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from discontinued operations. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2016 179 Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Incentive Plans and Top Executive Retention Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. Varying from one country to another, the individual benefit obligations are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pensionlike nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and timing. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to Consolidated Financial Statements reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the amount set aside is calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities. and Notes 180 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a nonfinancial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are currently recognized. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied, and as call options. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liability as of the reporting date. Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following ­issues: • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Securities may be grouped in different categories. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in Consolidated Financial Statements the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. • It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18. and Notes The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. Group Report 2016 181 Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment. • Testing deferred tax assets for impairment. All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 182 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements New accounting pronouncements Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) of revised or new IFRS pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period January 1 to December 31, 2016. These changes relate to the following IFRS: • Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception • Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative • A mendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation • Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions • Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements • Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010–2012 Cycle • Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012–2014 Cycle The IFRS pronouncements applicable in the reporting year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and one interpretation that affect the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2016 year and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: The new standard on financial instruments is divided into several phases and was published by IASB in its final version in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business model as well as on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity. The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures. Consolidated Financial Statements The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective, although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. The standard was endorsed by the EU in November 2016. On current assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Group. The new rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF and Notes Group. Further quantitative and qualitative effects may result from the fundamental changes in the recognition of impairment losses and in hedge accounting. Group Report 2016 183 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various different standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following five steps: (1) Identify the contracts with a customer (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract (3) Determine the transaction price (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation This five-step model may give rise to separate performance obligations according to the contractual arrangements, such as in mining projects. Alongside this basic model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on contract costs and contract modifications, and additional notes disclosures. The revised IFRS 15 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; earlier application is permitted. The standard was endorsed by the EU in September 2016. The HOCHTIEF Group will not elect early application. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, it is assumed on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in revenue recognition. Accordingly, it is expected to affect the recognition of contractual assets and liabilities as, for example, incremental costs of obtaining a contract are required to be recognized as an asset if the costs are expected to be recovered and would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. The same applies with regard to contract modifications in the form of changes in the scope and/or price of a contract, including change orders. Such modifications may only be included in the transaction price if variable remuneration is highly probable, meaning that a significant reversal in the amount of the remuneration recognized will not occur. Based on analysis performed so far, it will be possible for revenue from construction contracts currently accounted for using the percentage of completion method to be recognized over time. Other changes relate to presentation changes and additional requirements for notes disclosures. IFRS 16 Leases: Issued by the IASB in January 2016, the standard mainly stipulates new rules for the classification of leases by the lessee. As part of this, the previous risk-and-rewards approach is abandoned in favor of recognizing a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases. The only exceptions are if the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. By contrast, lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance leases based on the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. The revised IFRS 16 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. In view of the existing volume of operating leases, it would result in a noticeable increase in assets Consolidated Financial Statements and liabilities in the balance sheet. Other potential implications for the HOCHTIEF Group are currently being assessed. As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard in December 2016 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2014–2016). This involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The omnibus and Notes standard amends IFRS 1, IFRS 12, and IAS 28; EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position or financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group. 184 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The remaining changes adopted by the IASB and the IFRS IC are not expected to have any material relevance for the HOCHTIEF Group. In some cases, potential implications for the Consolidated Financial Statements are still being examined and cannot be conclusively determined prior to EU endorsement. • Clarifications to IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers • Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts • Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions • Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property • Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses • Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements: Disclosure Initiative • IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration.

Development costs in the amount of EUR 313 thousand were capitalized in the year under review. 192 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 54,895 thousand (2015: EUR 59,867 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, comprising EUR 45,303 thousand (2015: EUR 43,756 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas division and EUR 9,592 thousand (2015: EUR 16,111 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The company names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. The changes relative to the prior year relate to exchange rate adjustments and to a EUR 6,733 thousand impairment on the Devine name in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of each year. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is applied on the basis of cash flow budgets derived as a rule from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital figures. Value in use is first measured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures. The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 9.44% and 9.66% before tax (2015: between 10.40% and 10.84%). The recoverable amount of the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on CIMIC’s stock market valuation. Consolidated Financial Statements As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts did not reveal any impairment of goodwill.

Share-based payment The following Group-wide share-based payment systems were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktien­ gesellschaft and its affiliates in 2016: Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 The Executive Board resolved in June 2008 to launch a Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 (TERP 2008) for selected managerial employees. This plan is based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July 2008, the second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010. The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche. The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain is capped for each year of the exercise period. The cap rises annually up to a maximum gain at the end of the term. The maximum gain is set to EUR 160 per stock award for the first tranche, EUR 81.65 for the second tranche, and EUR 166.27 for the third tranche. The first tranche was exercised in full in 2015 and the third tranche in 2016. Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards. The SARs can only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date, the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock is higher relative to the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (relative performance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated financial statements is at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold is waived if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeds the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period. Consolidated Financial Statements Provided that the targets are met, the SARs can be exercised at any time after a four-year waiting period except during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs are exercised, the issuing entity pays out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The gain is limited to EUR 27.28 per SAR. and Notes The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain was limited to EUR 81.83 per stock award. The plan for the stock awards ended in 2015. Group Report 2016 207 Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 (LTIP 2011) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2011 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­ ates. The conditions did not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2010. The gain was limited to EUR 32.67 per SAR and EUR 98.01 per stock award. The plan for the SARs was exercised in full in 2016 and the plan for the stock awards ended in 2016. Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­ ates. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2011 in two points: 1. Return on net assets (RONA) as per the most recently approved Consolidated Financial Statements must be at least 15%. 2. The waiting time for stock awards was extended from three to four years and the total term of the plan accordingly from five to six years. The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point: The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year. The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2013. Consolidated Financial Statements The gain is limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP 2015) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2015 and is and Notes open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2014. The gain is limited to EUR 31.68 per SAR and EUR 95.04 per stock award. 208 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-term Incentive Plan 2016 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2016 (LTIP 2016) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2016 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2015 solely in that the waiting period was shortened from four years to three and the timeframe commensurately to six years (SARs) and five years (stock awards). The gain is limited to EUR 41.54 per SAR and EUR 124.62 per stock award. Other information Return on net assets (RONA) Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBIT, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus interest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from which returns are to be generated. The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 15.9% in 2016 (2015: 13.2%). RONA thus ­increased by 2.7 percentage points compared with the prior year. The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is met by the affiliated company concerned. The quantities of SARs and stock awards granted, expired, and exercised under the plans are as follows: Originally Outstand­ Granted in Expired in Exercised/ Disposal/ Outstand­ granted ing at Dec. 2016 2016 settled in sale ing at 31, 2015 2016 Dec. 31, 2016 TERP 2008/Tranche 2 359,000 3,300 – – 400 – 2,900 TERP 2008/Tranche 3 174,100 9,200 – – 9,200 – 0 LTIP 2010 – SARs 353,200 4,100 – 600 1,500 – 2,000 LTIP 2011 – SARs 275,250 29,400 – – 29,400 – 0 LTIP 2011 – stock awards 124,850 2,100 – – 2,100 – 0 LTIP 2012 – SARs 457,406 276,906 – 14,000 – – 262,906 Consolidated Financial Statements LTIP 2012 – stock awards 82,991 44,294 – 1,700 41,044 – 1,550 LTIP 2013 – SARs 38,288 38,288 – – – – 38,288 LTIP 2013 – stock awards 9,297 9,297 – – – – 9,297 LTIP 2014 – SARs 86,907 86,907 – – – – 86,907 and Notes LTIP 2014 – stock awards 20,453 20,453 – – – – 20,453 LTIP 2015 – SARs 96,801 96,801 – – – – 96,801 LTIP 2015 – stock awards 20,262 20,262 – – – – 20,262 LTIP 2016 – SARs – – 93,235 – – – 93,235 LTIP 2016 – stock awards – – 17,850 – – – 17,850 Provisions recognized for the stated share-based payment arrangements totaled EUR 15,574 thousand as of the balance sheet date (2015: EUR 14,811 thousand). The total expense recognized for the stated arrangements in 2016 was EUR 5,537 thousand (2015: EUR 8,335 thousand). The intrinsic value of options exercisable at the end of the reporting period was EUR 7,052 thousand (2015: EUR 2,195 thousand). Group Report 2016 209 26. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Defined benefit plans Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity. Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF (UK) in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF (UK) has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2016 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 128,813 94,097 15,249 Final salary [17,861] – [15,249] Not final salary [110,952] [94,097] – Vested benefits 184,463 44,877 19,177 Consolidated Financial Statements Current benefit payments 505,168 109,053 14,849 Similar obligations 95 60,470 – Total 818,539 308,497 49,275 Duration in years (weighted) 14.6 8.7 19.0 and Notes Dec. 31, 2015 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 116,993 90,919 12,842 Final salary [15,964] – [12,842] Not final salary [101,029] [90,919] – Vested benefits 154,162 46,477 17,077 Current benefit payments 488,211 102,376 15,468 Similar obligations 93 54,350 – Total 759,459 294,122 45,387 Duration in years (weighted) 14.7 7.9 21.0 210 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Plan assets Germany There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets have been administered since January 1, 2015 by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are not made by the trustee but by an investment committee. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation offered up to December 31, 2013 were funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. as of December 31, 2016 is about 55% (2015: 61%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 60% (2015: 67%). It should be noted in this connection that the size of pension obligations has increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will significantly increase again when interest rates recover. USA The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk Consolidated Financial Statements investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December 31, 2016 and Notes is about 86% (2015: 87%); funding at Turner overall is about 69% (2015: 71%). Group Report 2016 211 UK Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF (UK) is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF (UK) is about 69% (2015: 81%). Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2015 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 61,858 – 55,705 – Partially covered by plan assets 1,046,057 667,669 977,080 679,337 Incompletely covered by plan assets 1,107,915 667,669 1,032,785 679,337 Fully covered by plan assets 68,396 70,971 66,183 72,397 Total 1,176,311 738,640 1,098,968 751,734 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2016 2015 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK *Weighted average Discount factor* 1.75 4.04 2.65 2.50 4.20 3.70 Salary increases 2.75 – 2.30 3.25 – 1.90 Pension increases* 1.75 – 4.42 1.75 – 4.45 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements.

The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to and Notes their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016 came to EUR 60,470 thousand (2015: EUR 54,350 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,532 thousand (2015: EUR 1,785 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,397 thousand (2015: EUR 2,223 thousand) of the interest expense. Group Report 2016 215 Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to the following material risks: Interest rate risk For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly strong impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. Inflation risk By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan is frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. Longevity risk The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pensioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally cancels out collectively across all pension plan members and only comes into play if general longevity is greater than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial ­assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

This is due to higher defined benefit obligations for members of the Executive Board and related pension liability insurance contributions as well as higher transfers to the CTAs as a result of rising service costs. Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accord­ ance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on most payments into the fund, although it is also possible to pay contributions from taxed income and receive the investment earnings free of tax; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are likewise 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. Since July 1, 2014, CIMIC in Australia has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions.

Undiluted and diluted earnings per share Undiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s stock by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have any dilutive effect on earnings. Diluted and undiluted earnings per share are consequently identical. 2016 2015 Profit after tax attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR thousand) 320,483 208,287 Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 64,294 66,953 Consolidated Financial Statements Earnings per share attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR) 4.98 3.11 Dividend per share (EUR) 2.00 Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 2.60 The number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was 64,248 thousand.

The difference relates to the stock buyback program. Group Report 2016 221 33. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, determined using accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for hedging existing transactions. Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with an impairment loss. Risk management All finance activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial directive. This is fleshed out by function-specific operating work instructions on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses largely centralized liquidity structures—notably cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid cash flow bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the securities and loans portfolios. The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are Consolidated Financial Statements taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guarantees given by the Group. and Notes 222 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst-case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables).

The following table shows the main liquidity instruments: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2016 2015 Cash in hand and on deposit 2,072,661 2,133,884 Marketable securities 1,086,632 1,119,420 Undrawn revolving credit facilities 2,089,282 2,191,196 5,248,575 5,444,500 Undrawn guarantee facilities 4,463,742 3,518,340 Some of the facilities are subject to creditors’ rights of termination in connection with a financial covenant, which is continuously monitored as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance and the successful extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, no refinancing risk is currently seen with regard to long-term guarantee and credit facilities. The authorized capital in the amount of up to EUR 54,000 thousand and conditional capital in the amount of up to EUR 46,080 thousand provide appropriate scope for raising Consolidated Financial Statements additional capital as needed. If use were to be made of both of these facilities, the capital stock of currently EUR 164,608 thousand could—if necessary—be increased by a total of up to approximately 60%. and Notes Group Report 2016 223 In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the amount of EUR 17,402 thousand (2015: EUR 856,688 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 17,334 thousand (2015: EUR 407,601 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of EUR 68 thousand (2015: EUR 449,087 thousand). Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (transaction risk) arising from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group company concerned in each instance. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk. Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide financial directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2016 2015 Assets Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounted) 1,168 3,092 for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) 3,807 213 4,975 3,305 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounted) 4,211 1,215 for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) 24 1,772 4,235 2,987 Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounted) – recognized in other comprehensive income (4,920) 2,167 Consolidated Financial Statements of derivatives held for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 5,342 (2,800) Maximum remaining maturity (months) and Notes for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounted) 31 19 for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) 18 11 224 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency. The analysis is based on holdings as of the balance sheet date.

Two approaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from non-derivative financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2016 2015 Assets Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) 165 149 165 149 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) – 47 – 47 Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounted) – recognized in other comprehensive income – 450 of derivatives held for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) – amounts reclassified to profit or loss – 595 of derivatives held for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 63 2,438 Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (not cash flow hedge accounted) 363 363 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 226 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and profit.

In addition, price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale, to the extent that they are ­measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital market at an early stage and take appropriate action. The changes relative to the prior year result from ongoing active portfolio management as part of Group-wide risk management. Derivatives are used to control price risk only in exceptional instances.

HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maxi­ mum risk exposure on financial guarantees given by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2016, the maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 97,509 thousand (2015: EUR 144,414 thousand). No recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF and, in light of the financial circumstances, none is currently anticipated for the future. HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract perform­ a­nce, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF work instruction. Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (such as rating agencies) to assess credit standings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they cannot be measured reliably as a rule. The following table shows unimpaired financial assets that are past due: Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2015 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 (EUR thousand) days days days days days days days days Trade receivables 112,396 14,301 8,724 98,710 129,379 28,753 10,662 56,043 Current financial ­receivables – – – – 1 – – 6,235 Other current receivables Consolidated Financial Statements and other current financial assets – – – – 228 31 – 461 112,396 14,301 8,724 98,710 129,608 28,784 10,662 62,739 and Notes Group Report 2016 229 The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings. Individually impaired financial assets are shown below: Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2015 Gross carryImpairment Net carrying Gross carryImpairment Net carrying (EUR thousand) ing amount amount ing amount amount Trade receivables 267,553 149,213 118,340 273,178 154,551 118,627 Financial receivables Non-current 47,807 42,557 5,250 59,974 42,223 17,751 Current 16,718 6,288 10,430 21,973 8,777 13,196 Other current receivables and other current financial assets 1,456 210 1,246 1,235 247 988 333,534 198,268 135,266 356,360 205,798 150,562 The impairments in trade receivables mostly consist of impaired contracting-related claims, as is typical for the industry.

Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 230 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Capital risk management The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder returns. The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Reporting Committee assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost of capital. The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in the year under review compared with the prior year.

Non-current securities in the available-for-sale category are measured at fair value through equity; as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value as set out below, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. A three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3. In Level 3, the fair value of investments in unlisted entities is measured using generally recognized valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis. The unobservable inputs used for this purpose are an internal rate of return of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3%, and required discount rates of between 10% and 15%. Call options 234 Group Report 2016 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements are measured using Monte Carlo simulation. Assumed inputs are an expected exercise period of one to ten years, an EBITDA multiplier of six to twelve times, and a 15% discount factor.

Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under cash flow from investing activities. The EUR 163,986 thousand increase in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes (2015: EUR 465,847 thousand decrease) comprised EUR 164,555 thousand (2015: EUR – thousand) in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions and EUR 569 thousand (2015: EUR 465,847 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents in disposals. The EUR 2,847,426 thousand (2015: EUR 2,808,707 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises EUR 728 thousand (2015: EUR 913 thousand) in cash in hand, EUR 2,209,678 thousand (2015: EUR 2,243,934 thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 637,020 thousand (2015: EUR 563,860 thousand) in marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the value of EUR 137,745 thousand are subject to restrictions (2015: EUR 110,963 thousand). Cash flow from operations was EUR 1,173,391 thousand in 2016. Cash flow changes as a result of capital expenditure and asset disposals resulted in a net cash outflow from investing activities of EUR 66,172 thousand. The EUR 1,135,574 negative cash flow from financing activities includes the stock buyback programs at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and CIMIC, additional share purchases at subsidiaries in the course of the acquisitions of UGL and Sedgman, dividend payments, and debt repayments. Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 38,719 thousand. All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations included: • Interest income of EUR 49,381 thousand (2015: EUR 61,736 thousand), • Interest expenses of EUR 161,793 thousand (2015: EUR 240,247 thousand), • Income tax paid amounting to EUR 83,995 thousand (2015: EUR 428,899 thousand). After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as dividends) from such interests was EUR 319,585 thousand (2015: EUR 116,703 thousand). Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by Consolidated Financial Statements EUR 23,981 thousand (2015: EUR 832 thousand) and current assets by EUR 24,853 thousand (2015: EUR 548,510 thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 21,765 thousand (2015: EUR 3 thousand) and current liabilities by EUR 12,633 thousand (2015: EUR 81,648 thousand).

Essen, February 24, 2017 HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft The Executive Board Marcelino Fernández Verdes Peter Sassenfeld José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 248 Group Report 2016 Independent Auditors’ Report We have audited the consolidated financial statements – comprising consolidated statement of earnings, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, prepared by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/ Germany, as well as the combined management report for the financial year from January 1, to December 31, 2016.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements, together with the bookkeeping system and the Group management report, based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Sec. 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) in compliance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, financial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable accounting regulations and in the Report on the position of the Company and the Group are detected with reasonable assurance.

The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the books and records, the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under Consolidated Financial Statements German commercial law as complementarily applicable under Sec. 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and convey a true and fair view of the Group‘s net assets, financial position and results of operations in accordance with these regulations.

It was not part of our engagement to review any product or service related statements, any links to external sources, future-looking statements or statements from external experts. Management’s Responsibility The Company’s Executive Board is responsible for the accurate preparation of the report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the report as well as the usage of reasonable assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures. Furthermore, the responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the prepara­ tion of the report in a way that it is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements. Our Independence and Quality Control We have met the requirements regarding independence along with the additional requirements relating to profes­ sional conduct of the IESBA “Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants”, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional conduct worthy of the profession. The quality assurance system of Deloitte GmbH is based on the International Standard on Quality Control 1 “Qual­ ity Control for Audit, Assurance and Related Service Practices” (ISQC 1) and, in addition on national statutory re­ quirements and professional standards, especially the Professional Code for Certified Accountants as well as the joint statement of WPK (Chamber of Public Accountants) and IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany): Require­ ments for quality assurance in the auditing practice (VO 1/2006). Practitioner‘s responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed and the evidences obtained on the above mentioned information of the report. Procedures and extent of the assurance engagement We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This standard requires that we comply with our professional duties and give an attestation, based on the results of our work, as to whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information as stated in the report 2016 does not comply, in all material respects, with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement. Hence, the scope of a limited review is less comprehensive and may not reasonably assure all material facts that a reasonable assurance could. The selection of audit activities is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. This includes the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the report under consideration of the GRI reporting criteria. Further Information 254 Group Report 2016 Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures when conducting the limited assurance engagement: • Interviewing employees at group level in order to gain an understanding of the process for determining material sustainability topics and the stakeholder engagement process of HOCHTIEF • Interviews with relevant staff at group level responsible for providing the data and information, carrying out internal control procedures and consolidating the data and information, including the explanatory notes • Analytical procedures on relevant data • Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the HOCHTIEF consolidated financial statements and management report • Evaluation of information on selected sustainability performance measurements Our Conclusion Based on our limited review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information of the materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative sustainability information as stated in the report for the business year starting January 1st to December 31st, 2016 of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, does not comply with the criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. Recommendations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the company‘s sustainability management and sustainability reporting: • Development of strategy process with particular focus on stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis • Further harmonization of reporting processes and structures among divisions • Implementation of a centralized IT-system to increase automation of sustainability data collection, validation, consolidation processes and documentation This assurance report is issued based on an assurance engagement agreed upon with HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. The assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance is issued for the purposes of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and the report is intended solely to inform HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft of the results of the assurance engage­ ment. This assurance report is not intended as a basis for (financial) decision-making by third parties of any kind. We have responsibility only towards HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. We do not assume any responsibilities for third parties.
