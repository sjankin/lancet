However, In Japan Overseas Global target at 325,000 t-CO2, total emissions in fiscal 2016 were still lower than the target of 335,000 t-CO2, an accomplishment owed to initiatives including implementing top level energy-saving building management practices, upgrading air-conditioning equipment and LED lighting, and consolidating clean rooms. Looking ahead, Fuji Electric will advance further energy conservation activities to move toward the achievement of its 2020 targets. Furthermore, third-party verification was received for CO2 emissions data from six major factories in Japan and overseas with the aim of increasing the reliability of this data. Adding to the two domestic factories (Tokyo and Fukiage) already requiring third-party verification under emissions trading systems, we now receive verification for 75% of the Company’s total CO2 emissions (based on fiscal 2015 figures). Case Example: Energy Savings through the Smart Factory Initiative (Mie Factory) Fuji Electric is advancing the Smart Factory Initiative at the Mie Factory, a principal factory in the Food and Beverage Distribution segment. This initiative involves pursuing “smarter” operation through the improvement of efficiency of inverter-equipped production and drive facilities, the supply of clean energy via solar power generation and fuel cell systems, and the utilization of a factory energy management system that ensures optimal energy usage throughout the entire factory. In fiscal 2016, these efforts contributed to a 28% reduction in energy consumption from fiscal 2010 levels. In addition, given the recent increase in energy used in lighting Energy data tracking monitor (energy consumption by area) and air-conditioning equipment, we have installed a system for collecting data via internal LAN networks through points established to measure factory lighting and temperature. Utilizing this system, we are monitoring the environment within factory buildings while controlling energy. The collected data is made available for viewing by employees on a specialized website to facilitate educational activities. In the future, recorded data will be used to realize automated control in order to create systems that improve workplace environments while conserving energy.
