Reduce the number of Megajoules (MJ) of electricity required to produce a liter of beverage by 11% compared to 2010 grCO2e PER LITER OF BEVERAGE 3. Obtain at least 30% of the company’s electricity from renewable PRODUCED sources Mexico 20.58 Since 2014, the organization’s general strategy for lowering its Argentina 25.71 greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change has Ecuador 38.15 been reported to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), and to the Peru 39.34 GEI Program Mexico of the Mexican Environmental Protection Agency (SEMARNAT) and CESPEDES. In 2016, for the first time, we sent a report to CDP Water and CDP Value Chain with very positive feedback from our investors. Greenhouse Gas Emissions Thanks to our Emissions Reduction Program, which we first Manufacturing Index implemented in 2010, Arca Continental’s greenhouse gas emissions fell significantly in 2016. Through this program, we keep a detailed record of our energy consumption and of the 30.41 fuel used in our operations, enabling us to monitor the results of our different emissions reduction initiatives and find areas of 2020 goal 17.5% reduction opportunity for continuous improvement. These initiatives include multiple programs to optimize our operations, renewable energy 26.44 sourcing and the substitution of inputs with more environmentally 25.81 friendly options. As a result of all these efforts, during 2016 our beverage operations reached an emissions indicator of 23.75 grCO2e per liter of beverage, placing us less than 6% short of our 2020 goal. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 grCO2e In 2016, Mexico Beverages surpassed the 2020 goal, reducing emissions per liter of beverage by 17.5% to 20.58 grCO2e/lt. of beverage.

The results were very useful for identifying best practices in efficiency and environmentally friendly manufacturing practices. They also allowed us to verify that, thanks to our efforts to ensure a circular economy, our PET containers are more environmentally friendly than aluminum and glass equivalents. 56 S O C I A L R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 6 ENERGY USE INDEX (MJ/LT BEVERAGE) RENEWABLE ENERGY USE [302-3] Since 2011, we have been increasing our use of renewable energy, in order to reach our 2020 goal of obtaining at least 30% of our electricity from renewable sources. As a result, today, 41% of Energy use index (Mj/Lt Beverage) the electricity used by our Mexican operations comes from such sources, with 45% from biomass co-generation and 55% from wind sources. To reach our company-wide goal, we will redouble our 0.265 efforts through the implementation of two strategies: 2020 goal • We will invest heavily in PIASA to increase electricity production 11% reduction through cogeneration with biomass. Through this project, our Mexican operations will obtain more than half of their electricity 0.240 from renewable sources. 0.231 • We will explore options to generate electricity from this kind of source in South America. STRATEGY FOR ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 [201-2] As well as having various goals that contribute to climate change INTERNAL USE OF ENERGY IN MANUFACTURING mitigation, our Human Capital and Sustainability Committee has (GIGAJOULES) designed a strategy to adapt our operations to the changes we [302-1] are already experiencing. For example, we have identified regions where the effects of climate change represent a significant risk COMPLEMENTARY from water shortage, and have begun to prepare scenarios for BEVERAGES BUSINESSES adapting our operations in those regions, taking into consideration Electricity 1,270,163 256,553 not only production activities but also the local communities.

We will continue to work to raise this percentage to 100%. 12 Beverage operations. 58 S O C I A L R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 6 PACKAGING [301-3, 302-5] Since 2012, our ongoing efforts to lighten our PET bottles have given excellent results, bringing multiple environmental benefits, not only because of the reduction in the amount of plastic and energy required to produce the containers, but also because of the positive impact on our logistics and final disposal. Thanks to this initiative, in 2016 we saved 2,000 tons of resin, equivalent to more than six thousand tons of CO2e not emitted into the environment. The alliance that we have made with our suppliers of recycled food-grade PET, such as PetStar in Mexico, and Bio PET have allowed us to incorporate a considerable percentage of such materials in our plastic containers. In 2016, we consumed more than 64 thousand tons of these two products, or 26.73% of our PET consumption. The actual percentage varies according to country, largely as a reflection of the availability of the materials. ECOCE, A.C. Economia y Compromiso Empresarial (ECOCE), a non-profit organization, is one of our allies in reducing our waste footprint [301-2] and disseminating the importance of recycling in the communities MEXICO ECUADOR ARGENTINA around our operating centers in Mexico. During the 2015-2016 school year, ECOCE implemented the Eco Challenge Program Percentage of in 1,774 schools in 15 different cities in our territories.

IPASA recycles HDPE to produce soft-drink cases for containers Coca-Cola, thus contributing to our strategy of a circular economy. Over the coming years, we will be working with our value chain in RECYCLING CULTURE Peru to incorporate these good practices in their operations. To support our efforts to create a culture of proper waste disposal and recycling, ECOCE has installed containers in our offices and main operating centers so that our associates and visitors can dispose of their bottles correctly and expand the recycling culture inside and outside the organization. Waste containers were also donated to Universidad Catolica de Salta (UCASAL) in Argentina, in order to facilitate and promote solid waste separation. The PET containers of Sprite, Fresca and Topo Chico Sangria in Mexico are made with 100% recycled resin. A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L 59 PetStar PetStar operates with a philosophy of excellence for which it has been awarded the following certifications: ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO22000, ISO50001, OSHAS18001, Clean Industry, Socially Responsible Company, Super Company and Operation Clean Sweep. It also complies with the U.N. Global Compact and Earth Charter. The company has become an industry benchmark in Circular Economy, integrating into its processes activities ranging from bottle collection to their incorporation into new containers as recycled resin. Through social responsibility schemes and alliances with other institutions, PetStar seeks to dignify the work of Mexico’s garbage pickers and collectors by providing them with a stable, fair income, offering them training, and helping them through It is important to note that, just like PetStar, Arca Continental and inclusion initiatives.

A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L 65 HUMAN RIGHTS SURVEILLANCE Our Code of Ethics stipulates that all company associates are obliged to consistently and comprehensively respect the Human Rights of those with whom they come into contact. It makes it quite clear that we must never discriminate on the basis of age, gender, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, or religious beliefs and traditions. ANTI-CORRUPTION EFFORTS As part of our fight against corruption, our new Code of Ethics clearly stipulates that “associates, directors and shareholders are strictly forbidden to carry out acts of corruption, bribery, collusion and, in general, any illicit activity during the performance of their duties, and will abstain from participating directly or indirectly in any bids or tenders in which there are signs of corruption. These guidelines extend to our business partners (suppliers and intermediaries) and their activities.” In 2014, we set up our Supplier Portal, where suppliers wishing to register in our system in order to offer their services must read and agree to comply with and respect our Code of Ethics. As a result, 100% of our suppliers are aware of, and committed to supporting, our efforts to act against corruption and bribery. 66 S O C I A L R E S P O N S I B I L I T Y A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT 2 0 1 6 SOCIETY ALLIANCES [102-13] Arca Continental supports and participates in various initiatives that aim at developing our sector.
