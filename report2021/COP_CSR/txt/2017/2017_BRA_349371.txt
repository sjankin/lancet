Considering that the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais were universalized for having completed the number of connections contracted between the Ministry of the Environment and their respective distributors, the following states remained in 2016: São Paulo, with 94 connections made by Elektro, Rio de Janeiro, with 372 connections made by Ampla, and Goiás, with 547 connections made by Celg, totaling 1,013 home connections. The estimate is that the service beneﬁted 5,065 people. The PLpT Program was launched by the Federal Government in November 2003, coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and operationalized with the participation of Eletrobras companies. Through Decree No. 8,387, of December 30, 2014, the Program was extended until 2018. Energy Development Program for States and Municipalities (Prodeem) (GRI G4-DMA EX-EU7) Prodeem is a Ministry of the Environment program that aims to provide solar energy (solar cells) to rural populations not served by a conventional electricity network. Since 2004, under the 012/2004-MME Agreement, Furnas has been in charge of executing the Prodeem Revitalization and Training Plan (PRC) in the states of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Goiás. In 2016, a total of 898 solar panels remaining from Prodeem were donated to Centrais Elétricas de Rondônia S.A. (Ceron), given the disposal of the government's assets under Furnas's custody. The other solar systems are being maintained under operational conditions, aiming at transferring assets to various public entities at the federal, state, and municipal levels, in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment and current legislation.

Since the beginning of the program, 1,640 tons of recyclable materials (paper, plastic, metal, and glass) have been sent to partner collector cooperatives from several Company units, contributing to income generation. In 2016 alone, nearly 186 tons of waste were collected. Reusing Cooking Oil From 2008 to 2016, Furnas sent 21,572 liters of cooking oil to the Rio de Janeiro State Cooking Oil Reuse Program, which reduces contamination of the Guanabara Bay and generates employment and income for recyclable waste collectors. In 2016, a total of 2,531 liters of oil were collected in Ecopontos (collection units installed in some Company units) and in the restaurant at the headquarters.

In 2016, two Furnas projects featured in the 6th A3P Award: ﬁrst place in the Innovation in Public Management category, with the project to develop and test electric urban buses, in partnership with COPPE/UFRJ; second place in the Waste Management category, with the project to apply Stationary Lithium-Ion Batteries in its information and communication systems. This initiative represented a reduction in the use of approximately ten tons of lead which, although recycled, would generate waste. 61 About the Report and Materiality (GRI G4-17; G4-18; G4-28;
