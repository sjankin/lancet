OF THE BOARD We leveraged the experience and abilities of our great team to strengthen our presence in sectors where we are currently leaders. We also successfully participated AND CHIEF for the first time in new businesses. EXECUTIVE We invested USD$1.9 billion: a figure that represents almost one-third of the USD$7 billion we have invested over our 20-year history. OFFICER [102-14, 102-15, 102-1, 102-5] We secured partial financing of our investments by carrying out a successful equity follow-on offering for USD$1.6 billion. In terms of our growth, in 2016 we acquired 50% of Gasoductos de Chihuahua, for USD$1.1 billion, plus existing debt. With this transaction, we obtained full ownership of six assets that we formerly operated in a joint venture with Pemex, making us the largest private natural gas transporter in Mexico. We also strengthened our commitment to renewable energies by winning the auction to build and operate two solar parks: Rumorosa Solar, in the state of Baja California, and Tepezalá II Solar, in Aguascalientes. For the first time, we will be participants in the generation of solar energy. Also in the renewable energies segment, we purchased the Ventika wind farm, located in the state of Nuevo León, for USD$435 million plus existing debt. With a 252 MW capacity, Ventika is currently considered to be one of the largest wind farms in Mexico and Latin America. Sustainability Report + Financial Report 14 15 In addition, in a joint venture with TransCanada, we won a bid to build the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan marine pipeline, one of the most important energy infrastructure projects awarded in recent years in our country and the first private marine gas pipeline in Mexico.

OPERATING EFFICIENCY To identify the needs of the communities in which we operate or where we are currently building a new asset, we carried out the following activities: • Drafted the Baseline Social Analysis, Stakeholders Plan, and Social Investment Plan for Energía Sierra Juárez. Additionally, we implemented the grievance mechanism, (Mecanismo de Atención a la Comunidad, MAC) which is available at: http://www.energiasj. com/ comunicacion.html • A MAC is currently being drafted for Termoeléctrica de Mexicali and Energía Costa Azul, and will be implemented during 2017. • In addition, in 2016 we surveyed 89 key suppliers on their practices related to sustainability, environment, health and safety, human capital, ethics and corruption, as well as on their understanding of IEnova’s sustainability-related practices. Sustainability Report + Financial Report Compression station at the San Isidro-Samalayuca Pipeline 38 39 MATERIALITY MATERIALITY [102-42, 102-46, 102-47, 102-48, 102-49, 102-51, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3] MATRIX [102-47] 100% As part of the process for updating our materiality assessment, in 2016 we interviewed twelve top IEnova executives who are involved with our sustainability strategy and with managing the company. We performed a qualitative and quantitative analysis of all divisions in the business—corporate, storage, pipelines, natural gas distribution, and power generation facilities—reviewing internal processes from the economic, environmental, and social perspective. RELEVANCE FOR STAKEHOLDERS In order to include the point of view of our stakeholders in this assessment, for the third consecutive year we performed surveys to measure satisfaction levels among our natural gas Distribution and Pipelines customers. We also applied the questionnaire provided by the Great Place to Work Institute (GPTW) in Mexico, which measures work environment satisfaction. The results for both efforts were positive. In the customer survey, satisfaction levels were above the prior year, with a score of 9.2 points for Distribution customers and 9.7 in Pipelines. In the GPTW questionnaire, employee satisfaction levels were also above last year’s measurement, allowing us to maintain our certification and to be included in the list of the top 100 companies to work for in Mexico, ranking 52nd. We also analyzed press coverage of our company, to identify which are the most relevant topics for the media. During the year there were almost double the number 50% of stories published as compared to the previous year, with the vast majority being positive. IEnova’s achievements reflected well in the media. At the end of this process, we confirmed that the material issues identified in our materiality assessment remain valid, although with some variations in the level of relevance. These variations are shown in our updated materiality matrix. The analysis helped us identify the most relevant issues for IEnova and our stakeholders. These were classified in one of the three levels identified in our Materiality Matrix. 0% 100% 50% Each of these material aspects has been classified under its corresponding Economic, POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR IENOVA Social, Environmental, or Governance pillar. With this we strive to ensure that our sustainability model is aligned with IEnova’s strategy. 1 Customer experience and satisfaction 15 Environmental data systems ENVIRONMENTAL 2 Product and service quality 16 Climate change strategy ECONOMIC 3 Business diversification 17 Strategy for natural resources management 4 Integration of the operations of new businesses 18 Operations and environment 5 Developing the value chain 19 Certifications 6 Brand value and recognition 20 Biodiversity (flora and fauna) 7 Managing safety at operations GOVERNANCE 8 Training and development 21 Strategy 9 Media communications and presence 22 Laws and regulations SOCIAL 10 Grievance mechanisms 23 Corporate ethics and corporate governance 11 Labor standards (Human Capital) 24 Risk management 12 Standardization of the work culture Sustainability Report 13 Society and community 14 Healthcare + Financial Report Topics that are a priority for stakeholders, with ≥ 70% relevance.

In collaboration with the Human Capital team, IEnova leaders are firmly committed to motivating their team members to follow through on their career plans. As part of this commitment, we determine specific growth plans for each employee and we promote cross-training (employees who receive training for other positions in their division to acquire new knowledge and continue to grow professionally). We also have succession plans in place for Vice President and Director positions, based on a methodology that analyzes the ideal competencies and leadership styles needed to ensure that both the IEnova culture and values endure, and even strengthen. On the other hand, for upcoming generations we offer a Professionals in Development plan that seeks to create a pool of young employees eager to develop a deeper understanding of the energy industry and to gain from the experience of a management team with an exemplary track record. These students participate in a standard recruiting process. At the end of the training period, participants in the program are evaluated as potential IEnova employees. In order to contribute to the professional growth of our employees, we designed a corporate communications plan known as IEnova Somos Todos (We Are All IEnova) to foster a sense of unity among all our subsidiaries. The campaign includes periodic meetings during which area leaders share with their collaborators the status of projects they are working on, operating results, and assignment of responsibilities. In 2016, the IEnova Somos Todos program was also in charge of drafting the IEnova al Día (IEnova Up To Date) newsletter on the most relevant company information.

These systems comply with the parameters established by the ISO 14001:2004 environmental management standard. To this end, we have designed formats and procedures to identify and control environmental aspects, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, compliance with the law, and the protection of flora and fauna, among others.

We respect the terms and conditions established by the Mexican Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) and by the National Safety, Energy, and Environmental Agency (ASEA) for our environmental permits and authorizations. To improve our management practices, in 2016 we designed an Environmental Information System to collect and process data on waste, emissions, the use and discharge of water, and energy consumption of all our assets. With this new system, we will be able to establish the baseline we require to set our future efficiency goals, standardize methodologies for calculating and recording data at all our subsidiaries, and to generate, verify, and update information throughout the year. It will also allow us to comply more expeditiously with all applicable corporate and legal requirements. We will implement the system gradually starting in 2017.

The Aguaprieta Pipeline and ECOGAS, our natural gas distribution company, were both recertified as Clean Industry in 2016. In addition, we have taken the necessary measures to have the authorized organisms certify our operating units in ISO 14001:2004. Energía Sierra Juárez and Termoeléctrica de Mexicali are both in the process of implementing a comprehensive ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001 system. The Rosarito and Aguaprieta pipelines, and the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora project—which is currently under construction—have already been ISO 14001:2004 certified for environmental management. We employ procedures in our operations that are aimed at protecting the environment. In the Gas segment, we mostly store, transport, and distribute natural gas, an environmentally-friendly hydrocarbon, which is neither toxic nor corrosive, is 40% lighter than air, and whose combustion generates low IENOVA’S emissions of NOx, SOx y CO. By developing the natural gas infrastructure, which grants access to this low-carbon fuel to more users, we help Mexico comply with ENVIRONMENTAL its global mitigation commitments. ADVANTAGE We generate electricity at Termoeléctrica de Mexicali, a combined-cycle naturalgas-fired plant that surpasses emissions standards applicable in both Mexico and the US. We also generate clean energy at our joint venture with InterGen, Energía Sierra Juárez, the first cross-border wind farm between Mexico and the US that started operating in 2015 and, during this first phase, has a capacity to produce 155 MW.

With some variations dependent on the applicable environmental regulation, the characteristics of the project, and the affected ecosystem, these programs prioritize those issues to which each business unit can make the largest contribution, and are divided into two types of efforts: FLORA RESTORATION, CONSERVATION PROTECTION AND RESCUE AND COMPENSATION OF WILDLIFE We use those programs centered on conserving biodiversity to strictly comply with the guidelines of the authorizations issued in favor of IEnova. As a good practice within our company, we have voluntarily continued to implement some of the programs with which we contribute to preserving natural resources. In 2016 we designed our Strategy for the Conservation of Natural Resources. It describes the general principles needed to foster a culture of environmental stewardship and the correct way to handle natural resources so that, when carrying out our activities, the allocated investments contribute to maximizing the expected results. Sustainability Report + Financial Report 138 139 Energía Sierra Juárez FLORA RESTORATION AND COMPENSATION The nurseries we have installed in areas neighboring our construction sites and The ECA Rescue, Protection, and Conservation Program is a good example of that we have maintained, on occasions for more than 10 years, are among the our best practices.

We expect that by 2017 we will be able to adapt the programs to the best practices we implement at all our IEnova assets. Sustainability Report + Financial Report Energía Costa Azul 142 143 PROTECTION AND RESCUE OF WILDLIFE Before we start developing any project, we perform the necessary assessments to measure its potential impact on the ecosystem during the construction, operation, and maintenance phases. Prior to beginning to build a project, we determine and suggest to the authorities the measures we need to implement to protect the habitat and species of wildlife found in the area. We do this in order to fulfill our commitment to conserving the environment based on our practices, which are often stricter than what the environmental legislation stipulates. Among these efforts, our Marine Mammals Monitoring Program (MMMP) is particularly relevant. We established this program in 2003, before we started building our liquefied natural gas terminal, Energía Costa Azul, in collaboration with the Ensenada Center for Scientific Investigation and University Studies (CICESE), the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC), and other experts. ECA is located in an area adjacent to the migratory route of the gray whale, where there is also an important presence of other species of marine mammals. We continue to operate the Marine Mammals Monitoring Program, which renders the data required to protect species in the region, particularly the gray whale, and to study their migration patterns, and ensure their free path. The MMMP’s activities include taking periodic measurements of several environmental indicators to confirm that we have not affected the behavior of marine mammals in the area. In 2016, we registered the presence of ten species, with the majority of sightings reporting gray whales, sea lions, and humpback whales. We have historic records for 15 species of mammals, and sightings vary from year to year. In addition, surrounding our natural gas pipelines we implement fauna rescue and relocation programs to identify the species living along the right of way. We also establish programs to protect and relocate the identified fauna to a safe place. We train the staff who will be in charge of caring for the rescued wildlife.

We carry out this program in collaboration with local fishermen and scientists of the Autonomous University of Baja California. With this program, the organisms have continued to register the same sequence of changes to their population structure that they would have had if ECA had not been built on that location. Further, by introducing new young specimens, we contribute to conserving the species and to offsetting natural mortality rates. When construction of this plant began, we rescued more than 900,000 relevant marine organisms, including different species of sea urchins, and sea cucumbers and snails. Since then, twice a year we monitor the protected organisms. We ‘14 ‘15 ‘16 have found that survival rates for the transplanted populations, in particular the red sea urchin (S. franciscanus) and the purple sea urchin (S. purpuratus), are higher than 99%. The training on sustainable harvesting techniques that we offered local fishermen is a strong driver behind this program’s success.

At year-end 2016, we started monitoring the survival rates, health, and strength of the rescued flora in an effort to corroborate that survival rates continue to be around 80%. In the Ethane Pipeline, whose three segments cross the states of Veracruz, Chiapas, and Tabasco, we identified 71 species of fauna and rescued 517 specimens, particularly during the weeding phase. 23 of the species identified are under some degree of protection, in accordance to the NOM-059SEMARNAT-2010 norm. In 2016, we maintained and relocated 375 specimens of flora belonging to the 12 species we rescued during 2015, of which four are under some degree of protection. The relocation areas were selected based on the conditions and specifications they offer for their growth and survival. Orchids, for example, were relocated to trees that home species akin to the flora that grows in the mid semi-evergreen forests. At the Ramones Norte Pipeline, in 2016 we operated a program in collaboration with the School of Forest Sciences of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL). Flora rescued during the construction phase, is currently being kept at seven storage facilities set up for the project in the states of Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, and San Luis Potosí through which the pipeline runs. We are holding 180,709 specimens of 43 species of flora, out of which 17 are under some degree of protection, and we have maintained survival rates at the 80% mark established by the General Law for Sustainable Forest Development.
