Business Framework 1.1. Macroeconomic Context In 2016, the slowdown trend of the global economy has deepened, with global GDP growing by 3.1%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate, compared to a 3.2% growth in 2015 and 3.4% in 2014. This trend reflects, however, divergent behavior among the main economic blocs. If among the advanced economies, there has been less dynamism, especially in the United States of America (US), where GDP growth has been the weakest since 2011, in the emerging economies the pace of growth has not changed in aggregate terms, supported by China, which benefited from stimulus policies to activity. By contrast, countries like Russia and Brazil remained in recession. Monetary policy followed different directions in the main geographies, although it remained globally accomodated. In the US, despite the modest growth, the improvement in the labor market and the resurgence of inflationary pressures, fueled by the recovery of the oil price, prompted the Federal Reserve to continue the strategy of slowly normalizing interest rates. By contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) has tightened its monetary policy countering internal deflationary risks. This difference in position between the monetary authorities on both sides of the Atlantic along with the expectation that Economic Activity President-elect Donald Trump's economic policy could catalyze the US (real GDP) economy, exerted upward pressure on the dollar, US interest rates and 6 the prices of industrial raw materials.

This range of risks adds to the possibility of correction in the international financial markets, in a context where the generous valuations of the main asset classes are vulnerable to a possible deterioration of the prospects for the world economy. Global inflation conditional on oil price developments Inflation Evolution In 2016, world inflation remained below 3.0%, according to the IMF 9 estimate, influenced by the evolution of oil price, which remained, for 6 much of the year, at low levels.

In 2017, the main risks on a potential progression of the global financial markets are related to the inability of the new US administration to boost the US economy in a context of generous valuations in most asset classes. The US’ monetary policy normalization and the persistence of important sources of geopolitical tension may also affect the performance of financial markets.

By contrast, 2 16 private consumption is expected to have remained robust and net 14 2 12 external demand may have had a less negative contribution than in 10 8 2015, benefiting from the strong dynamism of tourism.

The EC expects economic activity in Portugal to accelerate to 1.6% in 2017, supported by the resumption of investment, as well as by the continuation of the expansion of private consumption. This projection, however, is subject to a number of risks. Internally, the process of consolidation of the banking sector may have adverse effects on the financial stability and perception of the country's level of risk and, therefore, aggravate the financing costs of the state and private issuers, with adverse consequences on the Domestic demand. At the external level, political risks inside and outside Europe could have a negative impact on external demand and on global financial markets evolution, with detrimental effects on Portugal’s economic environment. In 2016, the average annual inflation rate in Portugal was 0.6%, 0.4 pp above the euro area average and the highest in the past four years. The evolution of aggregate prices was affected, downwardly, by the fall in oil prices in international markets. In the opposite direction, by the worsening of indirect taxation and by the rise in the prices of tourism-related activities. In 2017, the reversal of the downward trend in oil price and the increased indirect taxation on some goods foreseen in the State Budget should contribute to the rise in the inflation rate, which the EC estimates to be 1.3%.

This last effect should also affect the evolution of the inflation rate, which the EC estimates will increase from -0.3% in 2016 to 1.9% in 2017. Despite the strength of economic activity, the budget deficit is still above 3%, which requires the implementation of additional measures to consolidate public finances.

In 2017, the IMF predicts that Brazil's political and financial improvement will allow the country to close the recessive cycle, although not to provide a rapid rebound in GDP, which is expected to grow at a still very moderate pace (0.2 %). US economic expansion cycle is already the third longest since the post-war period, but the pace of growth has been narrowing In 2016, the US economy registered the weakest pace of expansion since the economic and financial crisis of the last decade. GDP growth of 1.6%, well below the 2.6% observed in the previous year, was driven by private consumption, a category that benefited from the increase in employment and the acceleration of wages, as well as the maintenance of interest rates at historically low levels. On the other hand, increased political and economic uncertainty hampered investment, while the slowdown in global demand and the gradual appreciation of the dollar negatively affected net exports. The seven year cycle of good economic performance, the improvement in labor market conditions and the reduction of deflationary risks, due to the increase in oil price, have motivated the US Federal Reserve to raise, for the second time within the current cycle, its interest rate by 25 basis points. In 2017, the stated increase of expansionist fiscal policy, should fuel public and private investment and contribute to the maintenance of robust labor market, with a favorable impact on the evolution of disposable income and, consequently, private consumption. This scenario, coupled with the likely resurgence of inflation, should result in the Fed's intention to raise interest rates again. 34 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The expectation of activity expansion in the course of 2017 may be reviewed in the event of US’ administration having difficulties in implementing its economic policy or in case of significant correction of the financial markets.

Harmonized Inflation Rate (%) (right axis) Source: Bloomberg Notwithstanding the moderation of domestic inflationary pressures following the fall in unit labor costs and the appreciation of the dollar, the inflation rate has traced an upward trend throughout 2016, reflecting the strong recovery in energy prices and in the residential property rentals along with the acceleration of the cost of most services. By 2017, a reversal of the fall in commodity prices is expected whichshould lead to a gradual rise in inflation. 35 1.2.

One of the results of this pressure was the development of greenhouse gas emissions pricing mechanisms in countries like nues to drive the China, South Africa, Chile and Canada. Another consequence was another rise in the energy sector‘s evosupply of renewable energies and a slight decrease in global coal consumption. lution. Technological innovation also continues to facilitate the energy sector’s evolution. In 2016, new historical minimum tariff levels were reached for the implementation of solar photovoltaic (PV) technology in very diverse countries such as India, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Chile, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa. In September, the UAE actually reached the value of 24 USD/MWh in a solar PV auction. Another technological development is linked to the steady reduction of battery costs, which increasingly feeds the global trend to adopt electric vehicles. Energy Demand Global energy demand continues to increase. The International Energy Agency (IEA) states that demand increased by 1% from 2013 to 2014 and estimates that it will rise 31% until 2040. This increase until 2040 is equivalent to an annual increase of 1%. The fact that the global economy is expected to grow by 3.4%/year shows that a significant reduction in energy intensity is likely to happen across the globe. At the same time, energy sector related CO2 emissions are expected to increase by only 0.5%/year, highlighting the expected improvements of global carbon intensity in the future. The increase in energy demand continues to raise environmental concerns. The Paris Agreement sets the ambition to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5º C in relation to the pre-industrial era. However, even the goal of limiting the rise to 2º C is at risk, even taking into account the ongoing improvements in the global economy’s carbon intensity. At a geographical level, the forecast increase in demand is mainly due to non-OECD countries (emerging economies). India and China are expected to account for nearly half of this demand increase. OECD countries should follow an opposite trend of reduction of demand with a 4% decrease until 2040. 36 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In terms of final energy, electricity is the form of energy that will register the greatest growth (almost 70% until 2040) as a result of urban development and increasing penetration of electricity in new sectors, such as transport. Natural gas is the fossil fuel that will register the greatest growth, with an increase of almost 60% until 2040. Energy Supply On the supply side, growth is expected for all forms of energy in the medium and long term. Renewables will be the form of energy that will have the greatest growth in absolute value until 2040 (an increase of 78% in respect to 2014), followed by natural gas (an increase of 49%). The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is expected to decrease progressively with the three types of fossil fuel (oil, coal and natural gas) representing in 2040 about 1/4 of supply. Renewables and nuclear will complete the rest of the supply contributing with 19% and 7%, respectively. The growth of the supply of renewable energies will be supported on traditional bioenergy, hydro, wind and solar, among others. In spite of the strong growth of bioenergy, resulting from the population increase in developing countries, its share of renewable energies is expected to decrease from 73% to 54% until 2040. The growth in hydro should also take place in developing countries where there is still significant hydro potential to be developed. In this context, other renewable technologies (wind, solar, etc.) are expected to increase their share of the renewables mix, eventually overtaking hydro, as a result of technological evolution that has strongly reduced the costs of these technologies. The evolution of supply of different forms of energy is not homogenous at a global level. For example, until 2040, oil demand is expected to fall nearly 30% in OECD countries. Conversely, in China and India it is expected to rise 40% and 150%, respectively. Coal behaves in a different way, registering a decrease of 42% in OECD countries until 2040 and of 13% in China, while in India it should grow 148%. The only forms of energy that will grow in all these geographies are renewables and natural gas. The US, China and Europe are expected to be leaders in renewable energies growth until 2040. The power sector will be the main driver of renewables growth and the share of all of these sources in the power generation mix is expected to increase from the current 23% to 37% in 2040. Electric Sector In line with a tendency that has become increasingly clear, electricity is expected to be the form of final energy that will register the greatest growth over the next decades. Electricity demand should increase in all sectors and regions across the world, with the exception of Asia where natural gas is expected to have a slightly higher growth. Currently, electricity represents only 18% of final energy consumption but it should reach 23% in 2040. Nearly half of the growth in electricity consumption will take place in China and India. In terms of sectors, the global increase in electricity demand will be mainly due to heating and cooling for buildings and to industries. Other forms of energy that are traditionally used for heating and cooling and transport will progressively be replaced by more efficient and less polluting technologies, in particular heat pumps and electric mobility solutions. The substitution of traditional fuels by electricity – mainly based on more efficient, competitive and environmentally-friendly technological developments – contributes to the increase in electricity demand in exchange for an even larger decrease of demand for other fuels. The decarbonization of the power sector continues to be a global trend. Low-carbon generation is expected to overtake coal generation before 2020. The share of coal in electricity generation is expected to decrease from the current 40% to 28% in 2040. During the same period, wind, solar and biomass generation should increase their total share from 6% to 20%. Technological developments and the ensuing decrease in renewable costs will drive the growth of these technologies (especially wind and solar PV), which will also benefit from a set of policies directed at mitigating climate change and reducing energy dependence (in particular in Europe). The large penetration of renewables in the power generation mix has implications at many levels. The intermittent nature of most of these technologies poses additional challenges to the operation of power systems and raises the need for backup capacity that guarantees security of supply. Installed capacity is expected to increase from 6,400 GW in 2015 to 11,200 GW in 2040 which implies gross additions of 7,200 GW throughout the same period, of which around 2,400 GW will be needed to replace plants that will be decommissioned in the meantime. This need to replace the generation fleet is more pronounced in developed countries, in particular in Europe. Globally, the IEA estimates that in the period 2016-2040, investments of $19 trillion will be 37 needed in the power sector, of which about 58% will refer to generation, with the rest going to transmission and distribution infrastructure. At network level, the combination of information technology developments and energy is outlining a new, disruptive, smart grids world that enables active customer participation in electricity markets. Until 2040, 75% of global network investment will be applied in distribution grids. At retail level, topics like demand side management, real-time pricing and customer relationship management will enable a better management of energy systems. 1.3. EDP Market’s Energetic and Regulatory Framework European Framework Electricity Demand and Supply Electricity demand fell by 6% between the pre-recession consumption peak of 2008 (nearly 3,000 TWh) and 2014. The first slight recovery of demand occurred in 2015. However, demand is only expected to recover to 2008 levels after 2020. A 13% decrease of industrial demand between 2007 and 2014 and the increase of energy efficiency dampen the recovery to pre-2008 consumption levels. On the supply side, renewable penetration in the generation mix is expected to continue to increase. The share of renewables in the mix should increase from the current 29% to at least 45% in 2030. In 2040, the European Union should have three times the current wind and solar generation, by then reaching nearly one third of total generation. The share of coal should continue on a decreasing trend, reaching around 7% of generation in 2040 (about one third of its current share). This decline of coal should be partially compensated with the increase of the share of natural gas, along with the aforementioned growth of renewable energies. The share of nuclear energy is also expected to decrease from the current 28% to 21% in 2040. European Energetic Policy At policy level, the European Commission’s publication of the “Clean Energy for All Europeans” package headlines 2016. This package encompasses a large set of proposals from the European Commission that aim at accelerating Europe’s energy transition. It translates the climate and energy policy objectives established by the European Council in October 2014 into concrete legislative proposals. The Council had set for 2030: (1) a European target for reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 40% from 1990 levels; (2) a European binding target of at least 27% share for renewable energy; (3) an indicative target of at least 27% improvement in energy efficiency; (4) an indicative target of 10%/15% for interconnections to be achieved in 2020/2030. The revision of the directive and regulation for the internal electricity markets are two crucial elements that compose the package. These legislative texts aim at adapting market functioning rules and defining the scope of action of the different sector stakeholders in order to facilitate the European electricity sector’s decarbonization process. The European Commission’s intention is also to place European consumers as the focal point of its proposals. The package also proposes the revision of the European renewables directive. The document aims at guaranteeing a more efficient integration of renewable energy in electricity markets and defining rules that place renewable support mechanisms at a more European level. Energy efficiency is another important element of the package published by the European Commission. Among other proposals, the energy efficiency directive proposes to increase the energy efficiency target to 30% in 2030, create ways to increase buildings’ energy efficiency, new eco-design measures and improve the access to financing for energy efficiency measures. Finally, the European Commission also proposes a governance model to coordinate the implementation of measures that enable the achievement of the 2030 targets at European level. 38 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In 2016, important steps were also taken in the process to reinforce the European CO2 market known as ETS (Emission Trading System). At the end of the year, the European Parliament reinforced the proposals made by the European Commission in 2015 that look to breathe new life into the ETS. The main measures relate to decreasing the annual volume of auctioned allowances and increasing the outtake of excess allowances to the market’s stability reserve. These measures will be discussed in 2017 between the European Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament. In case they are approved, they are expected to provoke an increase of ETS prices that would be desirable to decarbonize the European economy in the most cost-efficient way. Fuel and CO2 Oil prices recovered slightly in 2016. The year opened with a minimum oil price of 30 USD/bbl but the price recovered and closed the year above 50 USD/bbl. Oil prices remain lower than in the previous decade due to the slow growth of demand and the persisting excess of supply. The deceleration of China’s and other emerging markets’ economic growth continues to penalize the growth of demand. The excess of supply results from the United States’ production of unconventional oil and the lack of a firm agreement between the OPEC countries (namely Saudi Arabia) to decrease production. Contrary to oil prices that result from a truly global market, natural gas prices continue to be defined in regional markets. Thus, although Europe registered a decrease of natural gas prices and prices in the US stabilized, European prices (NBP, European index) remain nearly double those of the US (Henry hub, American index). On the other hand, the price of natural gas in Asian markets was very similar to the European price, leading to few volume displacements from Europe to Asia. On average terms, Europe’s coal price increased slightly in 2016 in relation to 2015, registering a value of 60 USD/ton. At the end of the year there was actually a doubling of price in regard to January. This sudden increase is linked to supply constraints in China, where the government intends to limit the number of days on mining operating in an attempt to reduce the Chinese industries’ coal dependence. The European CO2 price decreased significantly from 2015 to 2016. This decrease was verified even after the Paris agreement to reduce emissions that was signed at the end of 2015, revealing a mistrust of the market in regard to the implementation of the agreement. 39 1.3.1. Iberian Electricity and Gas Market Electricity A slight economic recovery took place in 2016 and electricity consumption rose in both Portugal and Spain in comparison with 2015. • +0.6%: consumption increase in Portugal • +0.7%: consumption increase in Spain After temperature and working days correction, the consumption in Iberia did not increase as much in relation to 2015 (0.4% increase in Portugal and no variation in Spain). Opposite to 2015, which was a dry year (the hydro capability factor in Portugal was 0.74 and 0.70 in Spain), 2016 was a wet year (the hydro capability factor in Portugal was 1.33 and 1.10 in Spain). The wind capability factor held almost constant in Portugal (1.01 in 2015 and 1.00 in 2016). The increase of renewable generation (mostly hydro) was quite higher than the increase of consumption, which led to a decrease of residual thermal demand in Iberia from 95 TWh in 2015 to 80 TWh in 2016. The load factor of coal plants suffered the greatest impact (-14% of equivalent working hours in Portugal and -27% in Spain). However, coal plants remained more competitive than natural gas plants. This dynamic reflects the combination of both fuels’ prices and low CO2 price, much against the goal of decarbonizing the sector. The reduction of residual thermal demand led to the decrease of electricity wholesale prices the Iberia to about 40 EUR/MWh, in line with the values registered in France and Italy. Markets with higher penetration of renewables, namely Scandinavia and Germany, continue to register Europe’s lowest wholesale prices. At retail level, the sector’s liberalization continues. In 2015, the liberalized market represented nearly 92% of the total volume of commercialized electricity in Portugal and 88% in Spain. The final price for households continue to be above the European average both in Portugal and Spain. In Portugal this holds true since the increase in VAT from 6% to 23% in October 2011. For industrial customers, prices in Portugal have remained below the EU average. 40 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Electricity prices for Domestic Electricity Prices for Industrial Customers (EUR/MWh) 330 Customers (EUR/MWh) 150 130 110 90 130 70 EU28 Spain Portugal PT wo VAT increase PT with average EU28 VAT Natural Gas Natural gas consumption can be broken down into two main uses: conventional consumption (household and industrial consumption, including for cogeneration units) and power sector consumption. In 2016, Iberia consumption increased nearly 3%, boosted by Portugal’s power sector consumption (+39% in relation to 2015) and by conventional consumption in Spain (+3% in relation to 2015). As a result, total natural gas demand in Iberia Peninsula varied by: • +7.0%: demand increase in Portugal • +2.1%: demand increase in Spain Although demand increased, contracted volumes continue to exceed demand, raising the need to deviate high volumes of natural gas to international markets. However, the spreads on gas prices do not enable the deviation of Iberian gas to Europe and Asia, leading to gas-fired power generation to become the most profitable use of natural gas. Regulation Portugal A new government took office in November 2015, and its program includes relevant goals in terms of energy, such as a renewed interest in promoting renewables, boosting energy efficiency, expanding electric mobility and developing an energy technology cluster. A set of regulatory developments linked to the government’s political action should be highlighted: Change in the legal regime for the social tariff and extraordinary social support to consumers (ASECE) Law n. 7-A/2016, of March 30, which approved the State Budget for 2016, changed the legal regime for social support to energy consumption, looking to create a single model and an automatic entitlement to gas and electricity social tariffs. In parallel, the same Law revoked the existing extraordinary social support to consumers, with the corresponding discount being integrated in the social tariff and, therefore, leading to the financing of the measure by ordinary regime producers, in case of electricity, and by all consumers, in the case of natural gas. As a result of these changes, which came into effect on July 1, 2016, the number of economically vulnerable customers that benefited from a 33.8% discount in the electricity bill rose to about 800,000. Reevaluation of the National Plan for Dams As mentioned in the government’s program, the government reevaluated the National Plan for Dams and in April it announced the decision to cancel the construction of the Alvito (EDP) and Girabolhos (Endesa) dams, to suspend the construction of the Fridão (EDP) dam for three years and to maintain the construction of the Tâmega (Iberdrola) dam. 41 Rehabilitation of Electric Mobility In the program for its mandate, the government committed to providing a new impulse to electric mobility, foreseeing the expansion of the charging network in 2016 and 2017. Consequently, in 2016, the government concluded the first phase of the pilot network MOBI.E, installing 124 normal charging stations and 50 fast charging stations. It also launched the second phase of the pilot composed by 404 normal charging stations to be installed until 2018. The growth of the MOBI.E network will be financed by the PO SEUR incentive program under the Portugal 2020 funds, using European community funds, with the national component funded by the Environmental Fund. Re-allocation of the Low Voltage (LV) electricity distribution concessions The municipal concessions for the exploration of LV electricity networks, granted by mainland Portugal’s 278 municipalities, end between 2016 and 2026. Due to this fact, the government submitted a Law Proposal to the Parliament relative to the organization of public tenders to be launched to reallocate the concessions. The model chosen by the Government has an undelying logic of aggregating municipalities and concentrating the tenders in a pre-established common date. Rationalization of National Electricity System (NES) Costs In October’s tariff exercise for 2017, a set of diplomas which aim at mitigating costs of the NES were published: • Retroactive reimbursement of public support to renewable energy benefiting from Feed-in Tariffs On October 13, Ordinance n. 268-B/2016 was published, determining the reimbursement of 140 M€ to the NES relative to values received in an allegedly wrongful way by special regime generators who accumulated guaranteed remuneration under the form of Feed-in-Tariffs and public support for the promotion and development of renewable energy. The mechanism to reimburse the excess amounts will be defined in a separate Ordinance to be issued by the government. • Revision of the interruptibility service model Ordinance n. 268-A/2016, of October 13, establishes that, during 2017, the current interruptibility service model of the NES will be reviewed and replaced by a competitive mechanism. • Revision of the Capacity Payment mechanism Dispatch n. 12378-A/2016, of October 13 launches the revision process of the capacity payment remuneration model to create a market mechanism that exclusively remunerates the availability services provided by electricity producers, in line with the guidance provided by the European Commission in 2016 for capacity remuneration mechanisms. Spain In 2016, the regulatory measures taken by the Spanish Government between 2012 and 2014 continued to impact the sector. The measures were mainly intended to guarantee the economic stability of the power and natural gas sectors, with the main legislative piece being Law 24/2013 of the Power Sector. As a consequence, after a decade of tariff deficit creation, since 2014 there have only been surpluses in the power sector (550 M€ in 2014 and 469 M€ in 2015). The final deficit value for 2016 will be known in December 2017 as soon as all settlements are completed. However, a small surplus is once again expected in the power sector. The stability that was created resulted in the absence of the need to increase access tariffs in the power system. As to the equilibrium of the natural gas sector, during 2016 the final deficit values for 2014 (1,025 M€, a high value due to imbalances created in previous years) and 2015 (27 M€) were made known. An economic equilibrium of the system is expected for the next years. 42 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In 2016, the reform of electricity distribution remuneration, started by the new Power Sector law, was concluded. Ordinance IET 980/2016 established the remuneration of the different distribution companies in accordance with the new legal framework, thus closing the transitory period in place between 2013 and 2015. The reform of the remuneration of the electricity reference retail activity was also concluded with Royal Decree 469/2016. Since 2014, reference retailers are in charge of supplying electricity at the Voluntary Price for the Small Consumer to consumers that have up to 10 kW of contracted power and other consumers that do not have an electricity supply contract in the liberalized market. The new regulatory framework also established the remuneration of electricity transmission companies. In regard to protection of vulnerable consumers, Royal Decree 7/2016 was published at the end of 2016, regulating the new financing mechanism of the cost of the social tariff and other protection measures for electricity vulnerable consumers. The new mechanism allocates social tariff costs to sector companies on the basis of the number of customers their retail subsidiaries and opens the possibility for highly vulnerable consumers to not have their electricity supply interrupted. In regard to sustainable mobility, Royal Decree 639/2016 was published, through which a set of measures for the implementation of alternative fuel infrastructure is established. The decree transposes Directive 2014/94/EU of October 22, 2014 to Spain and aims at positively contributing to the efficient development of electric charging station and natural gas refueling networks. In the area of renewable energy, the 2013 to 2016 period was concluded under the new regulatory regime set by Royal Decree 413/2014. The remuneration values that will be set for the period 2017-2019 are expected to take into account the new electricity market conditions. In January, the first auctions for remuneration of new capacity were held under the new regulatory framework, which have awarded 200 MW of biomass technology and 500 MW of wind technology. At the end of the year, the process for a new 3,000 MW auction was started. The development of measures taken in 2014 and 2015 to increase competition and transparency in the natural gas sector also continued. After the reform of the Hydrocarbons Sector Law of 2014 and Royal Decree 984/2015, with which the system of contracting access to the natural gas system was reformed and an organized market was created (MIBGAS), in 2016 different detailed norms were published, such as standard contracts for access to gas system installations or gas system management guarantee norms. Finally, in what relates to energy efficiency, in February, Royal Decree 56/2016 was published, transposing Directive 2012/27/EU. This directive refers to energy efficiency and, specifically, to energy audits, service provider accreditation and promotion of efficiency in energy supply. The Spanish decree fosters energy efficiency according to the scope established by the European directive. 1.3.2. EDP Renováveis’ Markets Wind 2016 was marked by the installation of 54.7 GW of wind capacity, according to Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC), bringing total global installed capacity to approximately 487 GW. China was in the lead of power installations with 23.3 GW of new capacity but below the 2015’s spectacular results of 30 GW and rose its installed capacity to 169 GW. 43 The US came second in terms of wind market with an increase of 8.2 GW, Wind energy savings, bringing the cumulative capacity to 82.2 GW. On a state basis, Texas installed energetic policies and 2.6 GW in 2016, followed by Oklahoma (1.5 GW) and Iowa (0.7 GW). Texas environment continue remains the largest market in terms of cumulative capacity, overcoming the 20 to fuel wind energy on a GW milestone, followed by Iowa (6.9 GW) and California (5.7 GW). global scale. In Europe, renewable energy made up approximately 90% of capacity additions and for the first time wind overtook coal to became the second largest source. In 2016, wind facilities represented more than half of Europe's new power capacity and met more than 10% of total consumption. In the EU it was installed 12.5 GW of wind during 2016, of which 1.6 GW were offshore, therefore contributing to increase total wind capacity in Europe to 153.7 GW (12.6 GW offshore). Capacity additions were supported mainly by Germany (5.4 GW), France (1.6 GW), Turkey (1.4 GW) and the Netherlands (0.9 GW). With these results, Germany remains as the main market with 50.0 GW, followed by Spain (23.1 GW), UK (14.5 GW), France (12.1 GW) and Italy (9.3 GW). In Latin America, Brazil installed 2.0 GW, surpassing the 10 GW mark while Chile added 0.5 GW reaching 1.4 GW of capacity and Mexico connected 0.5 GW closing the year with 3.5 GW. Regarding emerging markets, India put into place 3.6 GW, consolidating its position as fourth largest player while South Africa added 0.4 GW and Pakistan 0.3 GW. Solar During 2016, solar PV capacity additions increased from 51.2 GW in 2015 to 76.1 GW in 2016, where China contributed with 34.2 GW (+125% YOY) and US came second with 14 GW, while Japan and India added 8.6 and 4.5 GW respectively. Europe added 6.9 GW which means a decrease of 20% versus 2015, having as main players the UK, Germany, Turkey and France. Regulation In Spain, on January 2016, the first auction of renewables’ capacity was held, designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme to the one that applies to current installations. Tender participants were requested to bid discounts on the “initial investment” parameter that determines the “investment premium” that would eventually be awarded. The auction was very competitive and EDP Renováveis was awarded 93 MW of wind energy. On October 2016, the Portaria 268-B/2016 on the clawback of non-refundable subsidies received from public development programs was published in Portugal. In what regards France, a new Contract-for-difference (CfD) scheme was released in December 2016 for wind farms having requested a PPA in 2016. The strike price will be equal to the value of the current feed-in tariff (similar tenure, indexation and adjustment after year 10), plus a management fee to compensate balancing costs (2.8€/MWh). As for Italy, the Energy Agency of Italy, released in December 2016 a list of projects that won offtake contracts in a 2016 tender. EDP Renováveis won PPAs for 6 wind farms totaling 127 MW with an awarded price of 66€/MWh and in case the realized market price is lower than the awarded price, the difference will be paid by GSE. On June 2016 Poland approved the “Wind Turbine Investment Act”, introducing, among other measures, new minimum distance restrictions for new wind farms and increased real estate burden. On November 2016, the government disclosed a draft ordinance detailing the amount and value of energy planned to be auctioned in 2017 defining that baseload renewables (dedicated biomass and biogas) will have a share of around 50% of the total 2017’s auction budget and new onshore wind could also compete for an amount up to 150 MW. 44 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In 2016, the government in Romania approved the draft ordinance setting a quota of 8.3% for 2017 and in October the Ministry of Energy published for consultation a draft amendment to the current RES Law, releasing afterwards a new draft in November, incorporating some improvements over the previous version. Among other amendments, an extension of the GC scheme until 2031, a removal of the indexation of the GC parameters and the extension of the GC recovery for wind energy from 2018 to 2025. Regarding PV projects, the draft amendments propose an extension of the GC postponement until end of 2024, fixing the recovery from 2025 to 2030. In November 2016 in the United Kingdom, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy released details on the next CfD round: second allocation round is expected to begin in April 2017 with projects to compete for GBP 290 million of annual support for the delivery years 2021/22 and 2022/23 (although offshore projects might be phased up to two years subsequent to 2022/23) and it will only include less established technologies, as offshore wind. In the United States, on December 2015, the Congress approved the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 that included an extension of the PTC for wind, as well as the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Developers now have until the end of 2016 to start construction of new wind farms to qualify for 10 years of production tax credits at the full level. The Congress introduced a phase out for projects that start construction after 2016 and before 2020. These projects will still qualify for production tax credits, but at reduced levels: 80% for projects starting construction in 2017, 60% in 2018, and 40% in 2019. Developers of projects that start construction before 2020 may elect to claim 30% investment tax credits instead of production tax credits, subject to a similar phase out, reducing the value of the 30% investment tax credit to 24% in 2017, 18% in 2018, and 12% in 2019. Neither production tax credits nor investment tax credits are allowed for wind projects that start construction in 2020 or later. Additionally, on May 2016, the US Internal Revenue Service issued guidance that wind farms have 4 years from their start of construction to be placed in service and qualify for the PTC. As a result, projects that start construction prior to year-end 2019 and are placed in service prior to year-end 2023 will be eligible for the PTC. The IRS ruling also includes a provision that allows developers to secure the PTC if 5% of a project's capital components by dollar value are safe harbored in a given year and construction is complete within 4 years. Thus, if a developer safe harbors 5% of project Capex in 2016 for a given project, the project will qualify for 100% PTC if construction is completed by year-end 2020. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects. Solar projects under construction by the end of 2019 will now qualify for the 30% ITC. The credit is reduced to 26% for projects starting construction in 2020 and to 22% for projects starting construction in 2021. Finally the credit drops to a permanent 10% level for projects that begin construction in 2022 or later or that begin construction before 2022, but are placed in service in 2024 or later. Projects must be placed in service by the end of 2023 to qualify for a credit above 10%. 1.3.3. Electricity Market in Brazil In Brazil, the year of 2016 presented an extremely adverse economic scenario marked by: continuity of the economic recession; political crisis that culminating in the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff; crisis in government accounts with fall in revenue and increase in the forecast of primary deficit; high interest rates; growing unemployment; and widespread decline in investor confidence. The worsening of the Brazilian economic crisis led to the fall in industrial production and, consequently, to the reduction of energy consumption. In addition, the increase in tariffs, justified by the increase in thermoelectric production costs between 2014 and 2015, led to the migration of customers to the free market in 2015 and 2016, leaving the distributors in a scenario of energy contracted higher than necessary to meet the demand of its market and above the limit of 105% foreseen by ANEEL (National Agency of Electric Energy), a situation that is known as overcontracting of energy or simply overcontracting . In addition, the average PLD (pool price) decrease compared to the value recorded in 2015 had a negative impact on the distributors. In view of this scenario, ANEEL adopted some mitigating measures, in particular the following regulatory resolutions (REN): (i) REN 711/2016, which allowed distributors, in agreement with production agents, to reduce, postpone or cancel contracts Of energy commercialization in the Regulated Contracting Environment (ACR) (CCEARs); (Ii) REN 726/2016, which allowed the return of contracts when migrating customers who purchase energy from small hydroelectric plants (PCHs), wind power plants etc., in addition to large customers, to new CCEARs; And (iii) REN 727/2016, which improved the use of the New Energy Saving and Deficit Compensation Mechanism (MCSD), with the possibility of contractual reduction by the agents of production. 45 Although they have shown a positive impact, the mitigating measures adopted have not been sufficient to eliminate over contracting. As for the hydrological scenario, 2016 had a favorable start, with the recovery of part of the reservoirs, especially the sub-market of the Southeast, which closed the year with the average ENA (Natural Energy Affluent) in 95% of the MLT (Long Term Average). In the Northeast, the drought that has been plaguing the region presented its second worst year (in a historical 86 years), closing at 44% of the MLT. Despite the favorable start, the reduction in consumption, affected by the economic downturn associated with the increase in outflows at the beginning of the year, contributed to the reduction of the PLD (Settlement Price of Differences), which ended 2016 at R $ 94 / MWh, against R $ 288 / MWh in 2015 in SE / CO, and improvement of GSF (Generation Scaling Factor), which ended the year at 86.8%. In the NE submarket, the critical hydrological situation kept the thermoelectric plants running, closing the year with the PLD higher than the other submarkets (R $ 174/MWh). Regulation From the regulatory point of view, in 2016, the energy sector has undergone several changes, with highlight for the following: Tariff Flags Established in 2015, Tariff Flags aim to signal the real costs of electricity production. The green flag indicates that the cost of producing energy is lower, and no change in tariffs is applied. The yellow and red flags represent the increase in cost of energy production, at which time an additional value is applied to the tariff. In 2016, the values of the yellow and red flags changed: the red flag had two levels, the additional ones being R $ 3.00 and R $ 4.50, applied to every 100 kWh consumed, and the yellow flag passed from R $ 2.50 to R $ 1.50, applied to every 100 kWh. Management of the Sectorial Fund Law No. 13.360 Law No. 13.360, published in 2016, restructured the management of the Energy Development Account (CDE) sector fund. The fund, formerly managed by Eletrobrás, was transferred to the management of the Electric Energy Trading Chamber (CCEE), with a deadline established until May 1, 2017. This Law also introduced significant changes in the regulatory scenario, such as the creation of New Energy Auctions with start of the supply in up to 7 years (A-7); allowing consumers with voltage up to 69 kW, existing prior to 1995, to become free; the possibility for distributors to sell their surplus energy in the free market; the increase of the Financial Contribution for the Use of Water Resources CFURH (water royalties); the allocation of costs of Itaipu, referring to secondary energy, for MRE (Reallocation Mechanism of Energy); and the creation of uninterruptible loads. Ordinary Physical Guarantee Review The Physical Guarantee is assigned to each hydroelectric plant and corresponds to the maximum limit defined for the commercialization of energy in contracts. Decree No. 2.655 / 1998 established that this amount will be reviewed every five years (ordinary review) or in the occurrence of relevant facts (extraordinary review). The last revision, made in 2004 by the MME (Ministry of Mines and Energy) Ordinance No. 303, determined the physical energy guarantees of the hydroelectric plants and the validity until December 2014. Since then, the studies have had continuity, with wide participation of bodies and entities related to the MME to analyze and discuss the data, configuration, methodology and models required for the regular review. At the end of 2016, Ordinance No. 714 extended once again, until 31 December 2017, the current values of physical energy guarantees from centrally-dispatched hydroelectric plants. White Tariff Created in 2016, the White Tariff aims to signal to consumers, who opt for this tariff modality, the variation of the energy value according to the day and time of consumption. 46 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The tariff is offered for consumer units in low voltage, which will be able to pay different values depending on the time and day of the week. On weekdays, the White Tariff has three rates: peak (being standard from 17h30 to 20h30); Intermediary (one hour immediately prior and another immediately after the peak tariff); And off-peak (composed of 21 hours a day complementary to peak hours, in addition to Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays). At peak and at intermediary, the energy is more expensive than at the off-peak. Consumers can adhere from January 1, 2018, and will have the alternative to request, at any time, the return to the conventional tariff modality. 47 2. Strategic Agenda Strategic Agenda 2016-2020 The strategic architecture adopted by EDP in 2006 is based on three pillars – controlled risk, superior efficiency and focused growth – and has proven adequate, in essence, given the changing environment, especially with regard to the European Utilities sector. In the last “Investor Day” realized in May 2016, EDP presented its new Business Plan until 2020 (BP 2016-20), reinforcing the latter strategic pillars with its commitment of balancing growth and financial deleveraging maintaining an attractive shareholder return as structural pillars. EDP presented then the following strategic priorities for 2016-2020: • Growth-oriented to value creation, giving priority to investment in long-term contracted renewable assets in core markets; • Continue financial deleveraging effort, ensuring the increase of medium term cash-flow generation; • Preserve low risk business profile through optimization of invested capital allocation; • Reinforce efficiency; • Maintenance of a stable and attractive dividend policy. EDP’s growth-oriented commitment is embodied in an expected increase of EBITDA of about 3% per year by 20201 driven by the creation of growth opportunities focused on renewables, predominantly comprising wind but also hydro and solar. Therefore, the BP 2016-20 foresees an average net investment of 1.4 billion euros per year in the period 2016-20, of which 84% relates to regulated and long-term contracted activities, with about 55% visibility, at that date, of the renewables growth target up to 2020. The financial deleveraging effort aims to reinforce the visibility in free cash flow generation in the medium term, establishing the target of a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of ~3.0x in 2020, supported by a rigorous control over the investment together with EDP Renováveis’ asset rotation strategy and the execution of the strategic partnership with CTG. EDP’s preservation of its low risk business profile remains a priority, namely in what concerns the recognition as one of the most integrated and regulated European utilities, set on the commitment of maintenance of the weight of its regulated activities around 75% of total EBITDA in 2020. To this end, EDP will aim to ensure, wherever possible, longterm contracts for the sale of energy as well as to diversify its business portfolio. The maintenance of a leading position and global recognition of EDP’s sustainability practices also contributes to this profile, an objective also assumed in EDP’s strategic agenda, which integrates the several targets around the three pillars of sustainable development – environmental dimension, economic dimension and social dimension. The commitment towards efficiency is even more relevant in the current challenging context of the sector. In this regard, EDP intends to keep its leading position achieved through the development of a culture of continuous improvement, based on programmes spread across the Group, as well as on the execution of a new efficiency programme, OPEX IV, targeting annual cost savings of 200 million euros per year by 2020 and an accumulated savings amount of 700 million euros in the 2016-2020 period. 1 Based on recurrent and weather adjusted EBITDA in 2015 48 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Regarding the shareholders return, EDP is committed to increase the dividend floor by 3%, to €0.19 per share, from 2016 fiscal year. This commitment is based on the expectation of a Net Profit annual increase of about 4% per year by 20202, intending to achieve a payout ratio that is in a range between 65% and 75% of recurrent Net Profit. Achievement of Strategic Priorities In terms of growth-oriented to value creation, the net investments over the last three years (2014-16) reached an annual average amount of 1.2 billion euros, in line with the committed goal for the three-year period and for 2016. In terms of gross Capex3, the annual average amount in the same period was 2.1 billion euros, of which 65% in expansion assets, resulting in an increase of 10% in installed capacity4. Renewables took the highest share of this increase, leading to the rise of the weight of renewable installed capacity over total installed capacity from 69% in 2013 to 73% in 2016. At EDP Renováveis level, during 2016 were installed 820MW of wind capacity5, occurring the largest amount of this growth in North America (629MW, of which 200MW related to “Eólica de Coahuila”, the first project of EDP Renováveis in Mexico). Another 2016 highlight is the conclusion of “Baixa do Feijão” wind farm in Brazil (120MW). Also during 2016, in pursuing the objective of creating growth opportunities, EDP Renováveis entered into long-term contracts for the sale of energy corresponding to 502MW in future wind projects (of which 275MW in the US, 100MW in Canada and 127MW in Italy), thus ensuring the development of competitive projects with long-term visibility. By the end of 2016, EDP Renováveis have already secured long-term contracts for 1.1GW of projects to be installed in the US until 2018 and for more than 0.5GW of projects to be added in Europe. 2 Based on recurrent and weather adjusted Net Profit in 2015 3 Including Financial Investments 4 Including equity method consolidated capacity 5 In net terms EDP Renováveis capacity increased 770MW due to a 50MW deconsolidation at Poland’s operating level 49 Regarding the hydro plan in Portugal, in 2016 Salamonde II (207MW) and Baixo Sabor upstream (151MW) hydro power plants have entered into service. The construction works in Venda Nova III repowering and in Foz Tua dam (together representing 1,019MW) are still ongoing, with completion expected during 2017. In Brazil, 2016 was marked by the anticipation of the entry into service of Cachoeira Caldeirão hydro power plant (219MW, 50% EDP) eight months ahead of schedule, and the ongoing of the construction works of São Manoel (700MW, 33% EDP), with operation scheduled for 2018. In addition, EDP further points out its participation in a Public Power Transmission Auction held in October, being awarded the concession to operate a transmission line with 113 km of extension in the state of Espírito Santo. EBITDA increased by 2% per year in the 2014-16 period, overcoming the 2016 target established in BP 2016-20, benefitting from high hidraulicity levels in the year in Iberia. With respect to financial deleveraging, decisive steps were taken, namely through the balancing of its investment with asset rotation operations at EDP Renováveis level. In 2016, these operations represented approximately 1.0 billion euros, of which 0.6 billion euros regarding the sale of a minority stake in a portfolio of wind assets with 664MW in Spain, Portugal, Belgium and France; 0.3 billion euros related to the sale of a minority stake in 340MW of wind assets in the US; and 0.1 billion euros related to the sale of a minority stake in 100MW of wind assets in Italy. Since 2014, the total amount of EDP Renováveis asset rotation proceeds reached 1.6 billion euros. Regarding the implementation of the strategic partnership with CTG, from the 2 billion euros initially agreed, 1.4 billion euros were already concluded, of which 0.4 billion euros closed in 2016 with the sale of 49% equity shareholding and shareholder loans in a portfolio of wind assets in Italy and Poland. In addition, EDP concluded in 2016 the sale, for 91 million euros, of Pantanal mini-hydros in Brazil. This operation was foreseen in BP 2016-20. In 2016, EDP also concluded monetizations of tariff deficit in Portugal of 2.2 billion euros, an amount above the 0.8 billion euros per year planned in BP 2016-20, reinforcing the efforts evidenced in 2014 and 2015 with total accumulated sales over 2.1 billion euros. The deleveraging effort has resulted in a gradual reduction of the financial cost of debt6. In 2016, the average cost of debt reduced 0.3 p.p. to 4.4%. This reduction in the financial cost of debt has been reinforced with an active debt management through the early payment of loans bearing high interest rates. In 2016, these operations represented about 1.0 billion euros, highlighting in November the buyback of Note Entitlements, in the amount of 250 million euros of the “EUR 300,000,000 Floating Rate Notes due 2018” issued in 2008, and in December of 500 million dollars of notes due in 2018 and 2019. EDP has kept a clearly distinctive low risk business profile, expressed by the weight of its regulated business EBITDA of 87% in 2016, above target, which has allowed it to mitigate the negative impacts resulting from a very challenging market context. This performance was also secured through the management of the legal and regulatory agenda, which remains as one of the main priorities for EDP, as the Group continues to take a proactive stance in providing solutions that lead to the consolidation of sustainable energy systems where it operates. In a period of great uncertainty, focus in efficiency in terms of Opex has been constant. After the 2 years anticipation of the target for OPEX III efficiency programme in 2015, in 2016 EDP launched a new efficiency programme, OPEX IV, targeting annual cost savings of 200 million euros per year by 2020. In 2016, the programme reached savings of 105 million euros, above target, with highlight to the improvement of the Opex/Gross Profit ratio in 1 p.p., to 27%, and the stagnation of operating costs in Iberia. 6 (Interest expense on financial debt +/Income and Expenses with Interest from derivative financial instruments) / Average Financial Debt in the period (Total debt and borrowings Accrued Interest Fair value of the issued debt hedged risk), considering 50% of the interest expense and of the financial debt related to the hybrid. 50 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In 2016, as far as shareholders return is concerned, EDP kept its dividend distribution policy with a dividend distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20. The following chapter summarizes the status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. 51 3.

Risk Management EDP Group periodically performs exercises for the identification and quantitative7 assessment of the materiality of the key risks at the Group level, in close cooperation with all relevant Business Units. These exercises lead to the development and update of the risk taxonomy, currently structured around 4 major families of risk (strategic, business, financial and operational), aggregating all risk mapping exercises at Business Unit level, using an integrated perspective and common language. EDP Group’s taxonomy of risks • STRATEGIC RISKS typically incorporate risks with medium-long term prospects, usually with reduced likelihood, although if they occur they may have a material impact. In terms of environmental risks (external), EDP Group recognizes and monitors closely exogenous events and developments with a potential to materially impact the Group. For example, regarding the risk of technological disruptions, EDP Group has sought to position itself at the forefront of technological development in the sector, seeing this issue not as a threat but as a central vehicle for promoting growth in the future both through investment and research into new technologies (in particular, but not limited to, activities performed by EDP Inovação). In terms of strategy risks (internal), EDP Group identifies and actively follows the main issues associated with major corporate decisions (e.g. investment decisions, relations with partners, internal governance and corporate planning in its various forms). For example, a rigorous process is established for investment decisions, consistent with the Group strategy and with pre-established criteria (in particular regarding the definition of minimum return levels and up to date, geographic, business-specific discounting rates, as well as the strategy’s resilience under multiple adverse scenarios of delays, cost overruns, fluctuations in key business variables, 7 The quantification includes the analysis of expected and maximum loss (at a confidence level of 95%), regarding the expected probabilities of materilization and impacts over multiple horizons (short, medium and mediumlong term). The quantitative assessment of risks is agreggated by risk category, taking into consideration correlations and diversification effects 53 etc.). This process is led by the Business Analysis Department and discussed in formal forums (Investment Committees) for the analysis, decision making and monitoring of projects. • BUSINESS RISKS aggregate all risk factors intrinsically linked to the remuneration of the EDP Group’s core activities, in production, distribution and commercialization of energy, both in terms of energy markets and regulatory risks. In terms of energy market risks, there are significant uncertainties associated with fluctuations in pool and other commodities’ prices, volatility of renewable energy production volumes (particularly at hydro and wind level), volatility in energy consumption and narrowing of sales margins. As most plants are covered by medium and long term energy sale contracts, mainly in EDP Renewables and EDP Brasil as well as plants still covered by CMECs8 (mechanisms that will have its final revision, depending on the specific power plant, until 2017), the risk is largely mitigated. Additionally, the Group also adopted the mechanism of repactuation of hydrologic risk (with retroactive effects at January 2015), which limits a great part of the risk associated with the volatility of Brazil’s hydro generation. The risks associated with power plants that are subject to market changes (pool and commodities prices) are monitored and managed by the EDP’s Business Unit for Energy Management (UNGE), who is responsible for negotiating contracts for coal, gas and CO2 allowances and for hedging the fuel price risk (in cooperation with the Corporate Financial Management Department). Fluctuations in energy consumption (in addition to impacts of the pool price, cited above) are reflected as an impact on thermal power plants demand and a small impact on the permitted revenues of the distribution business (to the extent that this variable is one component, amongst others, of the variable remuneration indices). The Group manages its exposure to the various energy market risks through an active strategy of diversification across multiple technologies, geographies and business lines In terms of regulatory change risks, EDP Group is subject to legislative and regulatory changes (e.g., sectorial packages, regulatory models, environmental rules, taxes and fees). The EDP Group manages this risk through continuous monitoring and preparation of several dossiers, which are discussed in a constructive and cooperative atmosphere, allowing the anticipation and minimization of unfavourable and/or inadequate outcomes that can materialize in the various market environments where the Group operates. • FINANCIAL RISKS aggregate the market risk factors that complement the (non-operational) energy business risks in the various geographies and markets where the EDP Group operates in terms of i) financial market variables, ii) credit and counterparty (financial, energy and customers), iii) liquidity/solvency (treasury management, difficulties in accessing funds, cost of capital and ratings) and iv) other responsibilities (including the Defined Benefit Pension Fund). The current macroeconomic environment has somewhat stressed the level of risk for the several categories of financial risks, however, initiatives have been developed at European and national level to support and promote economic growth as well as strengthen the resilience of financial system, combined with the fact that EDP Group is decreasing its level of leverage. These actions are believed to reduce the materiality of the financial risks in the medium-term. In terms of financial market variables, the EDP Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates (impacting on debt subject to floating rates and on costs derived from refinancing at a fixed rate), exchange rates (namely fluctuations of the buy and sell prices of electricity and other sources of energy, on foreign currency investments, as well as physical assets value, financing and revenues denominated in foreign currencies), inflation and valuation of financial assets held by the Group. All these risks are managed and mitigated by the Corporate Financial Management Department, together with the Business Unit for Energy Management (UNGE), EDP Renewables and EDP Brasil, who ensure compliance with the Group's risk policies and periodically report on the evolution of the main variables and sources of risk. In terms of credit and counterparty, the EDP Group recognizes risks associated with its financial and energy counterparties, as well as with credit defaults of clients in the various operating geographies. The financial counterparties risk management is ensured by the Financial Management Departments through i) a careful selection of counterparties, ii) an adequate diversification, iii) an exposure only to financial instruments of 8 Costs of Maintenance of Contractual Balance, a remuneration system not impacted by energy market price or hydro volume fluctuations 54 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 reduced complexity, high liquidity with no speculative nature, and iv) a regular monitoring of the respective positions. The Business Unit for Energy Management (UNGE)9 manages the energy counterparties’ risk by applying exposure limits previously established and approved in accordance with the individual rating of each counterparty. Finally, the commercial risk is managed by the commercial areas of the Group (in Portugal, Spain and Brazil), who carry out adequate provisioning against default expectations. In terms of liquidity and solvency risks, the risk of possible cash shortfalls is mitigated through i) centralization (cash-pooling) of the Group's liquidity (except in Brazil), ii) maintenance of adequate liquidity levels (cash and credit lines with firm commitments) based on a detailed forecast of cash needs (enough for about two years of cover, equal or superior to main peers level), iii) an appropriate strategy for diversifying funding sources, and iv) the diversification of debt profiles in terms of type and maturity. As the rating risk leads to potential adverse impacts on funding access and costs, the Group seeks to ensure appropriate levels of leverage with a low risk profile and to maintain stable contractual standards, which ensure no dependence of its liquidity position to mechanisms such as financial covenants or rating triggers. In terms of other responsibilities, the EDP Group recognizes and closely monitors risks associated with the capitalization of the Group’s Defined Benefit Pension Fund in Portugal (associated with the market value of the respective assets), with additional costs associated with current and early retirement, as well as with medical expenses. Employee benefits liabilities are calculated annually by an Independent Actuary, using assumptions set out in IFRS-IAS (taking into account aspects such as, among others, interest rates, demographic factors, economic variables and applicable requirements). The Pension Plan and Fund Committee regularly monitors the Defined Benefit Pension Fund in terms of the value of the assets that comprise the Fund as well as changes to the liabilities. • OPERATIONAL RISKS aggregate risk factors that are additional to the energy business and financial risks in the various geographies and markets where the EDP Group operates. They contain risks associated with the planning, construction and operation of physical assets, execution of processes, personnel, information systems and legal. Many of these risks, particularly those with lower uncertainty and/ or more frequent, are already accounted for in Business Units budgets, through specific rubrics, budget margins or adequate provisioning. In terms of incidents on physical assets, these risks can occur during the phase of development, construction or operation of assets and can be derived from external (for instance, seismic or atmospheric phenomena) or internal causes (for instance, damage caused by defects of origin and/or installation). It can result in, amongst others, threats to the physical integrity of the Group's employees or third parties, costs on the repair or replacement of equipment, the unavailability of assets and subsequent loss of profit or in compensations to third parties. These risks are, firstly, managed and mitigated by the various operational areas of the Group's Business Units, who propose and implement best practices in terms of operational policies, regular inspections and preventive maintenance, as well as in plans for catastrophic events’ crisis management and business continuity. Secondly, a significant part of the remaining risks is mitigated through a comprehensive range of insurance policies (in particular property damage and civil and environmental responsibility), managed by the Insurable Risks’ Unit at EDP Valor. In terms of information systems, (both in terms of availability, data integrity and security) we highlight the establishment, in close coordination with the various Group Business Units (end users), of maximum unavailability periods that are acceptable for each of the main families of applications (which serve as the basis for the sizing and implementation of redundant systems for disaster recovery, particularly for critical systems such as execution of financial transactions, grid operation and energy trading). In terms of legal issues, there are recognisable risks associated with losses resulting from the failure to comply with current legislation (tax, labour, administrative, civil or other), with impacts at the economic level (penalties, compensations and agreements) as well as damage to reputation. The EDP Group analyses, monitors and reports material developments to all relevant bodies, whether at the level of the Executive Board of Directors or at the General and Supervisory Board (through global and geography-specific exposure levels) and, based 9 Complemented by the Energy Planning Departmente in EDP Brasil e and by the Markets and Risks Department in EDP Renováveis 55 on the information provided by legal advisors and on the analysis of pending law suits, recognises provisions to cover the losses estimated as probable, related with litigations in progress. Regarding reputational risk, the Group is in line with the best positioned international peers (and above the sector average position) according to the Reputational Risk Index (RRI) from RepRisk10. In terms of its definition, EDP Group considers the reputational risk not as a risk in itself, but as one of the dimensions of impact of each of the taxonomy risk factors (being it strategic, business, financial or operational). Given the diverse nature and multiplicity of causes that can generate reputational impacts, each of EDP Group’s employees has the responsibility to manage and mitigate this same risk. Finally, the Group monitors carefully and continuously all internal and external developments and consequent emerging risks that may have impact, both as threat and opportunity, namely regarding geopolitical and macroeconomic risks, the evolution of generation technology costs as well as emerging business models (such as the shared economy). 2.4.2. Risk Appetite The EDP Group is exposed to a number of risks due to its dimension and diversity of businesses and geographies in which it operates, hence it recognizes risks is an integral and unavoidable component of its activity, both as threats as opportunities. Acknowledging this fact, the Group establishes explicitly and implicitly its risk appetite for all internal and external stakeholders, both at corporate and Business Units level, as well as for the various categories of risks, through a set of mechanisms: • The periodical development and approval of the Group’s Business Plan by the Executive Board of Directors, which is communicated to all stakeholders, and where key strategic orientations are set for the upcoming 3 to 5 years; • The rigorous evaluation of risk related to investment and divestment opportunities proposed by the Business Units and approved by the Executive Board of Directors, including the estimation of returns adjusted to risks vs. established hurdles. This evaluation is supported by the opinion of the Investments Committee, which includes specialists from relevant areas of expertise; • The development of a wide set of risk management policies, both at corporate and Business Unit level, which establish guidelines, methodologies of evaluation and exposure limits for key risks11; • The periodical development of risk mapping exercises, based on objective, quantitative and comparable criteria, allowing an analysis of the exposure to key risks, as well as the adoption of preventive treatment actions for excessive exposure to risks (regarding the established tolerance of risk); • The establishment of a wide set of mechanisms for periodical reporting of key risks, at Group and Business Unit level, thus allowing a regular monitoring of the evolution of actual and emerging risks and comparison of the exposure to different risk profiles within the established limits; • The adoption of a risk governance model based on 3 independent lines of defence (business, risk/ compliance and internal audit), which guarantees the implementation of the established strategies and alignment with risk appetite, namely: o A formally established risk-officers network in all Business Units with material risks; 10 Organization specialized in reputational risks mapping, regarding environment social and governance spheres.

In terms of positioning, the Group establishes the maintenance of a controlled risk profile as a fundamental pillar for its strategy, expressed transversally along 3 natures of risk: • Risks for which the Group has zero tolerance (e.g., health/ safety and ethics); • Risks for which the Group is constrained externally and are managed proactively within the established tolerances (e.g., counterparties); • Risks inherent to markets in which the Group operates, and are managed proactively around the established risk appetite to optimize the trade-off risk-return (e.g., energy markets). The risk appetite of the Group and key risk indicators (KRIs)/ objectives are reviewed and approved regularly by the Executive Board of Directors. 12 Corporate and at Business Units level, when justified 57 St rat eg i c Risk appetit e (aspirational) KRI (target ) A ct i vi t y f o cused mainl y i n reg ul at ed o r l o ng t er m co nt r act ed o p er at i o ns , guarant eeing a higher level of stability and predict ability of cash75%of EBITDA in regulated or long f lows. t erm cont ract ed act ivit ies by 2020 R i skret urn p ro f i l e G ro wt h f o cused o n g ri d s and r enewab l e g ener at i o n wi t h d emo nst rat ed med i uml o ng t erm vi ab i l it y , complemented by select ive bet s on +50%of net invest ment in renewables innovat ive high pot ent ial generation t echnologies.

Performance 1. Material Issues in the Year The materiality analysis assesses and prioritises the relevance of an issue shared by EDP and its stakeholders, supporting the organisation's decision-making and strategy development process. Material Issues are thus obtained from this process, i.e. those that affect the creation of value for the company in the short, medium and long term, and simultaneously have a positive or negative impact on the different segments of the company's stakeholders. These issues are reviewed and adjusted annually in the Group’s different companies, according to a common methodology (page 430), which can be consulted in greater detail at www.edp.pt> sustainability> publications> 2016> Sustainability Management Approach. In 2016, as a result of the analysis conducted, 22 material issues were identified for the Group, which have evolved in relation to the previous year according to the matrix below: All the issues identified in the matrix are the subject of detailed internal management plans under the chapter Performance, except for Corporate Governance, which is dealt with in Chapter 04 (page 146). On page 52 the Objectives and Goals are organised by material issues. 63 A more broken down approach identifies the main relevant issues in the year by geography: PORTUGAL SPAIN BRAZIL EDP RENOVÁVEIS Climate Change Electricity and Gas Supply Climate Change Climate Change Responsible Communication and Climante Change Energy Efficienty Supply Chain Transparency Energy Efficiency Corporate Ethics Working Conditions Energy Efficiency Customer Management Water Management Risk Management Customer Management New Business Opportunities New Business Opportunitis Promoting Renewable Energies New business opportunities R&D+i Occupational Health and Safety Health and Safety Promoting Renewable Energies Financial Sustainability Financial Sustainability The identification of the materiality of the different sustainability issues in the Supply Chain was made through a study available online: www.edp.pt > suppliers> EDP's Impact in the Supply Chain. 64 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 2. Financial Sustainability 2016 was once again defying for the utilities sector. Concerns with commodities prices and its impact in power prices for the European markets early in the year and expectations regarding a potential increase in the overall level of interest rates led capital markets to register a mountable level of volatility. In this challenging environment, the defined strategic agenda of EDP, reviewed in the Capital Markets Day of May 5th, 2016, proved itself adequate by investing in renewable technologies, long-term contracts and a low risk profile. In this difficult context, EDP was able to achieve consistent results, with net profit attributable to shareholders of EUR 961 million, supported on its low risk profile which allowed a consistent EBITDA and a strong focus on efficiency and cost control. EDP continues to show a resilient business model with a strong performance based on the delivery of our commitments, high quality asset mix, stable returns, adequate risk management and diversification of markets. Business Financial Analysis EDP Group In 2016, the net profit attributable to EDP shareholders reached EUR 961 million, compared with EUR 913 million in 2015. Net profit increased 5%, impacted by better operational performance in Iberia, whilst 2015 had been impacted by events at EDP Brasil and EDP Renováveis level, which led to a part of results staying with non-controlling interests. 65 Income Statement – EDP Group EUR Million 2 0 16 2 0 15 ∆ % ∆ Abs.

Excluding these items, EBITDA would have risen by 6%, to EUR 3,698m in 2016, reflecting the portfolio expansion (installed capacity and client base in Iberia), efficiency improvements and better weather conditions in Iberia and Brazil, particularly in the first half of 2016. In Iberia, EBITDA was propelled by new capacity on stream, strong hydro resources, price volatility (particularly when compared to 2015’s poor hydro and price context) and improving regulatory terms in electricity distribution in Spain. EDP Renováveis’ 3% rise in EBITDA was mainly prompted by higher average capacity on stream (+11% year-on-year), partially offset by a fall in the average selling price. EDP Brasil’s contribution to EBITDA was 31% lower year-on-year in euro terms, dragged by the adverse ForEx impact (-4%), lower demand and costs related to overcontracting in distribution, but mostly by the abovementioned effects.

By business areas, it is worth to highlight: i) in Iberia costs were flat year-on-year despite portfolio expansion (assets and clients), supported by tight cost control and a 1% reduction in avg. headcount; ii) at EDP Renováveis level, operational costs increased although at a lower pace than the capacity installed, thus improving the core Opex/average MW; iii) at EDP Brasil level, cost performance reflected BRL depreciation vs. Euro and full consolidation of Pecém since May-15; excluding for these, OPEX grew 4% in Brazil, short of inflation. Other cost/(income) rose from a EUR 43 million revenue in 2015 to EUR 370 million cost in 2016, mainly driven by the abovementioned year-on-year effects. EBIT fell by 7%, to EUR 2,264 million in 2016, reflecting EBITDA evolution and higher depreciation costs, in the wake of wider expansion. 66 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Net financial results and results with joint-ventures and associates amounted to -EUR 914 million in 2016, EUR 57 million lower year-on-year, essentially impacted by (i) early payment and optimisation of some projects finance, as well as the repurchase of some bonds with higher interest rates than current market rates (-EUR 76 million), which will translate into lower costs in the future; ii) lower financial revenues related to interest on tariff deviation and deficit, as well as partial sales of the tariff adjustment in Portugal; and iii) capitalised expenses fell by EUR 26 million year-on-year backed by the completion of some new hydro power generation assets’ in Portugal. It is noteworthy that: i) interest costs fell, supported by a 30 basis points year-on-year decline in the average financial cost of debt1 (from 4.7% in 2015 to 4.4% in 2016) and by a lower average net debt. The abovementioned effects at financial results level are offset by tax savings in 2016, reaching EUR 89 million in 2016 (-EUR 189 million year-on-year), impacted by the tax revaluation of some assets. Non-controlling interests fell by EUR 95 million year-on-year, to EUR 239 million in 2016, driven by lower results at EDP Brasil and by the impact of liberalised activities in Iberia. In 2015, results were positively impacted by gains with Pecém at EDP Brasil’s level, partly imputable to non-controlling interests, by the capital gain booked with the disposal of the gas assets at 5% minority stake of Naturgas, and by the net profits’ increase at EDP Brasil and EDP Renováveis.

Maintenance capex amounted to EUR 697 million in the 2016, mostly absorbed by regulated networks in Iberia and Brazil. Note that maintenance capex includes several pluri-annual works at hydro, CCGT and coal plants in Iberia. Expansion capex dedicated to new hydro capacity in Portugal amounted to EUR 193m, largely impacted by the commissioning of new capacity. During 2016, 2 hydro plants started operations: Salamonde 2 (223MW) and Baixo Sabor (fully commissioned following +151MW year-on-year). As of Dec-16, EDP had 2 hydro projects with pumping under construction: i) Venda Nova 3 (756MW expected to be commissioned in the first quarter of 2017); and ii) Foz-Tua new hydro reservoir (263MW expected to be commissioned in the next summer). Capex in new wind capacity (EDP Renováveis) amounted to EUR 1,026 million in 2016 (of which ~80% in North America). Wind capacity additions totalled 820MW (in net terms capacity increased 770MW due to a 50MW deconsolidation at Poland’s operating level), of which 629MW in North America, 120MW in Brazil and 71MW in Europe. Wind capacity under construction by Dec-16 totals 248MW: 51% in Brazil, 40% in US, 9% in Europe. 1 (Interest expense on financial debt +/Income and Expenses with Interest from derivative financial instruments) / Average Financial Debt in the period (Total debt and borrowings Accrued Interest Fair value of the issued debt hedged risk), considering 50% of the interest expense and of the financial debt related to the hybrid 2 Includes additions in non-current assets, except for financial instruments, deferred tax assets and post-employment benefit assets. Therefore, in each business segment, the Operating Investment caption includes increases in Property, Plant and Equipment and in Intangible Assets, excluding CO2 licenses and Green certificates, net of increases in Government grants, Customers contributions for investment and Sales of properties in the period. 67 3 Net Debt EDP Group’s consolidated net debt as at December 2016 amounted to EUR 15.9 billion, decreasing EUR 1.5 billion with the contribution of EDP’s operational activity and with the impact of the regulatory receivables’ reduction by EUR 1.6 billion, following the sale of tariff deificit. In terms of maturity, EDP Group’s consolidated nominal gross debt breaks down into 13% in short-term and 87% in medium and long-term, with an average maturity of 5 years. EDP maintained its policy of centralizing funding at EDP, S.A. and EDP Finance BV, representing 86% of the Group’s consolidated gross debt as at December 2016. The remainder consists essentially of debt contracted by the Brazilian subsidiaries (9%) and project finance debt contracted by subsidiaries of the EDP Renováveis Group (4%). In March, EDP Finance B.V. issued a EUR 600 million bond with 7 year maturity and a coupon of 2.375%. In August issued a EUR 1,000 million bond with maturity in February 2024 and a coupon of 1.125%. These issues allowed EDP Group to reach different markets and investors, extending the average life of its debt portfolio at competitive costs and reinforcing its liquidity position ahead of refinancing needs for the following years. In November 2016, EDP agreed to purchase Note Entitlements in the amount of 250 million euros and 2,500 Makewhole Entitlements issued in 2008 in the EUR 300,000,000 Floating Rate Notes due 2018”, having such titles been cancelled. In December 2016, EDP SA concluded a Tender Offer over the issues 6.000% Notes due February 2, 2018 and 4.900% Notes due October 1, 2019 , limited to a total value of 500 million US dollars. As a result of the offer, EDP S.A. acquired 469,462 thousand US dollars of the 6.000% Notes due February 2, 2018 and 30,538 thousand US dollars of the 4.900% Notes due October 1, 2019. During 2016, EDP monetized a total of approximately EUR 2,237 million of Portuguese tariff deficit related with 2014, 2015 and 2016 overcosts of the special regime generation. Maintaining a prudent financial management policy, by the end of 2016 EDP had access to EUR 3,721 million of available credit lines, including EUR 40 million of commercial paper with underwriting commitment, fully available. Additionally, EDP has a EUR 1,000 million Euro Commercial Paper programme (ECP Programme) without a firm underwriting commitment which is used for the Group short term treasury management. As at 31 December 2016, the total amount issued under the ECP Programme amounted to EUR 496 million. During 2016, the average cost of financial debt 4of the EDP Group was 4.4% per year and approximately 48% of its debt and borrowings had a fixed rate. In terms of currencies, Euro continues to be the main funding currency (69%). The USD financing contracted to fund the operating investments of the Group’s subsidiaries in the United States of America justifies the exposure to USD (20%). EDP Group funding in Real represents 9% of the total gross debt as at 31 December 2016. In February 2016, Moody’s affirmed EDP’s credit rating at “Baa3” with Stable outlook. This rating affirmation follows a review of EDP’s and other European utility companies’ exposure to the power price environment, reflecting EDP’s low exposure to lower power prices, as well as its financial flexibility. In October 2016, “Fitch” affirmed EDP’s long-term rating at “BBB-” and its outlook as stable. In November 2016, “S&P” affirmed the “BB+” long-term and “B” short-term corporate ratings on EDP. The outlook remained positive. 3 Includes Financial Debt, Cash and Equivalents, Short-term financial assets at fair-value, net investment and fair value hedge and collateral deposits associated to financial debt. 4 (Interest expense on financial debt +/Income and Expenses with Interest from derivative financial instruments) / Average Financial Debt in the period (Total debt and borrowings Accrued Interest Fair value of the issued debt hedged risk), considering 50% of the interest expense and of the financial debt related to the hybrid 68 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Long-term contracted generation in Iberia EBITDA from long-term contracted generation fell by 9% (-EUR 54 million year-on-year), to EUR 529 million in 2016, mainly reflecting the transfer of 8 hydro plants to our merchant portfolio following the termination of respective PPAs (2015 gross profit: EUR 75 million). These plants have a total installed capacity of 627MW and an annual production 1.7TWh (on an average hydro year). Gross profit from PPA/CMEC was 13% lower year-on-year, at EUR 579 million in 2016, driven by the aforementioned end of PPA contracts in Dec-15 and the natural depreciation of the asset base in a context of very low inflation. Results with fuel procurement, stemming from market price volatility between the moment of procurement and the moment of consumption, had a positive impact on gross profit. Note that, as a result of EDP’s strategy to hedge these changes through derivative financial instruments, this impact is ultimately compensated at the level of financial results. Gross profit from special regime was EUR 10 million higher year-on-year, at EUR 61 million in 2016, fully driven by a 57% increase in mini-hydro production backed by strong hydro conditions in 1H16. Liberalised activities in Iberia EBITDA from liberalised activities increased 47%, to EUR 536 million in 2016, propelled by: i) a cheaper generation mix derived from the hydro capacity additions and stronger hydro resources in the period (43% weight in generation mix in 2016 vs. 25% in 2015); ii) higher results with energy management in the wake of low-price context and high price volatility during 1H16; and iii) higher contribution from supply business resulting from the combined impact of this year’s smoother potfolio growth (vs. previous years) and higher average margin per client, prompted by higher product (dual offer) and services penetration and higher digitalisation rate. Note that, as a result of the end of PPAs at 8 hydro plants in Dec-15, 627MW of hydro capacity was transferred from the LT Contracted portfolio to liberalised generation portfolio. Output from our generation plants was 13% higher in 2016, propelled by higher contribution from hydro plants (+98% year-on-year) and CCGTs (+43% year-on-year). In turn, coal output fell by 42% in the period, reflecting its displacement by hydro and programmed outages for DeNOx upgrades. The surge in hydro output was prompted by the contribution from ‘Ex-PPA plants’ and new capacity on stream; and by stronger hydro resources year-on-year (particularly in 1H16, as 4Q16 was marked by a hydro factor 50% short of the long term average). Avg. production cost was 30% lower yearon-year, at EUR 22/MWh in 2016, reflecting the contribution from hydro’s cheaper technology, hydro: 43% of total output in 2016 vs. 25% in 2015. Additionally, lower average generation cost reflects cheaper coal and gas-based production in the wake of the cost decrease of consumed coal/gas and CO2 licenses. Gross profit at our supply activities in Spain remained stable, at EUR 136 million in 2016, reflecting the mixed impact from a higher volume of electricity sold, a more selective criteria in the gas supply business and some opportunistic deals in the wholesale market. Gross profit at our supply activities in Portugal rose by 32% (+EUR 45 million year-on-year), to EUR 186 million in 2016, driven by customer portfolio expansion and higher revenues per customer. Regulated Networks in Iberia Regulated networks in Iberia include our activities of distribution of electricity and gas, in Portugal and Spain. EBITDA from regulated networks fell by 4% year-on-year (-EUR 41 million), to EUR 990 million in 2016, mainly impacted by the EUR 89 million gain booked on the gas distribution assets sale in Spain to Redexis in the first half of 2015. Excluding this effect, EBITDA advanced by 5% year-on-year (+EUR 48 million), mainly impacted by the new regulatory terms applicable to electricity distribution in Spain as from 1-Jan-16 and tight cost control. 69 Gross profit rose by 3% year-on-year (+EUR 52 million) in 2016, reflecting mostly the impact in Spain from higher regulated revenues in electricity distribution in Spain. In turn, in Portugal, lower return on regulated asset base in gas distribution in the wake of the regulatory review applicable as from Jul-16 and lower revenues in electricity last resort supply (following the contraction of activity); compensated by higher revenues in electricity distribution, which benefited from a higher return on the regulated asset base (from 6.34% in 2015 to 6.48% in 2016, prompted by higher Portugal bond yields) and higher activity. EDP Renováveis EDP Renováveis owns, operates and develops EDP Group’s wind and solar capacity. As of Dec-16, EDP Renováveis operated 10,408 MW, +770MW in 2016: of which 356MW equity-method accounted. EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA derives mainly from PPA-contracted and regulated tariff schemes and is geographically widespread: 56% in Europe, 42% in North America, and 2% in Brazil. EDP Renováveis’ EBITDA went up by 3% year-on-year (+EUR 29 million) to EUR 1,171 million in 2016. Excluding the previously mentioned items in 2015, EBITDA’s contribution to EDP Group increased 8% reflecting: i) higher average capacity on stream (+11%) and ii) higher load factor (+1p.p.), partially compensated by a lower average selling price and higher operating costs (+6%) (S&S and personnel costs). Electricity output advanced +14% year-on-year to 24.5TWh in 2016, supported by an increase of avg. capacity in operation, and higher avg. wind resources, especially in Iberia and in the US. Average selling price decreased 5% yearon-year to EUR 60.5/MWh, driven by new PPAs in the US. EDP Brasil EDP Brasil contribution to EDP Group’s EBITDA decreased 31% (-EUR 264 million) to €593 million in 2016, penalized by the impact of the BRL depreciation versus EUR, as well as the impact of Pecém’s acquisition already mentioned. In local currency, EDP Brasil EBITDA decreased 24% year-on-year (-BRL 732 million) to BRL2,334 million in 2016, impacted, in 2016, by the capital gain of BRL 278 million booked in the first quarter of 2016 with the sale of Pantanal mini-hydro; and, in 2015, by the capital gain of BRL 885 million with the purchase of Pecém in the second quarter of 2015, both at ‘other income’ level. Adjusted by the abovementioned effects, EBITDA would have decreased 6% yearon-year to BRL 2,056m. Generation and Supply EBITDA went up by BRL 110 million to BRL 1,400m, reflecting the full consolidation of Pecém since May-15 (+BRL 47 million) and better performance at our hydro plants (+BRL95 million year-on-year) due to a less significant impact of the hydro deficit in 2016 vs. a stronger impact in 2015 (GSF at 87% in 2016 vs. 85% in 2015 and lower PLD in 2016). EBITDA in distribution fell by BRL 170 million to BRL 767 million in 2016, impacted by losses with overcontracted volumes at Bandeirante and lower demand. At the level of EDP, S.A. financial statements, the result of operations of 2016 derives essentially of the income from equity holdings. Value Creation to Shareholders The creation of shareholder value is sustained in the ability of the company to increase its net income, dividends and share prices, i.e., it is supported by the sum of strategic decisions affecting the sustainability of the Group's business activities assuming strategic importance the low risk profile assumed by EDP. In this context, EDP stock priced closed the year with a 13% decrease. Based on the payment of dividends to shareholders held on April 18th, 2016 (EUR 0.185 per share), which implied a dividend yield of 6.4% (considering end of 2016’s closing price), EDP generated a total shareholder return for 2016 of -7%. EDP has followed a sustained policy of dividend distribution that seeks to reconcile strict compliance with the relevant provisions of the law and Articles of Association and division among all its shareholders of a significant portion of the 70 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 value created by the Group, in keeping with the specific conditions of the company and market. This policy is designed to enable shareholders to obtain an adequate return on their investment without compromising the company's value. Pursuant to these rules, the table below shows the dividends distributed by EDP in the last 10 years: Year Approval date Payment date Gross dividend 2006 12/04/2007 04/05/2007 0.110 2007 10/04/2008 08/05/2008 0.125 2008 15/04/2009 14/05/2009 0.140 2009 16/04/2010 13/05/2010 0.155 2010 14/04/2011 13/05/2011 0.170 2011 17/04/2012 16/05/2012 0.185 2012 06/05/2013 23/05/2013 0.185 2013 12/05/2014 29/05/2014 0.185 2014 21/04/2015 14/05/2015 0.185 2015 19/04/2016 18/05/2016 0.185 For the 2016 financial year, the Executive Board of Directors of EDP submitted to the approval of the General Meeting of Shareholders of 19 April 2016 a proposal for the appropriation of the net profit of 676.5 million euros to be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. The proposal was approved by a majority of votes (99.9995%) at the General Meeting and a gross dividend of EUR 0.185 per share was paid on 18 April 2016. EDP believes that a transparent relationship with investors and the market involves the definition of clear criteria and reasonable objectives for the dividend distribution policy, as the growing demands of the investor community, faced with the instability of the capital markets in recent years, have made clear. Accordingly, on the Capital Markets Day held on 5 May 2016 with Portuguese and foreign investors and analysts, the goal of proposing to the General Meeting of Shareholders an annual dividend within a defined payout was revised upwards to 65%-75% of the recurring net profit. Additionally, EDP advanced the intention of proposing the General Meeting of Shareholders an increase in the dividend of 2016 to be paid in 2017. The new dividend to be proposed should therefore be EUR 0.19 per share, a threshold that is to become the new floor going forward and which should grow in tandem with recurring net profit per share. 71 Factors Influencing Change in EDP’s Share Price In this section some of the economic and financial factors influencing positively and negatively the stock price of EDP are presented. On the chart below, we may observe the evolution of the total shareholder return of EDP during 2016, as well as the performance of three major indexes: PSI20, EUROSTOXX Utilities and EUROSTOXX 600. 2016 started off on a quite negative tone with oil prices and interest rates tumbling, while concerns with the health of the Chinese economy took the Chinese market to derail. In this context, equities markets worldwide took a dive in the first weeks of 2016. Yet, as oil prices started recovering and fears of a significant slowdown in China begun to subside, markets staged an overall comeback. Later in the summer, Brexit took markets by surprise and some volatility ensued, with some sectors and shares being more hurt than others. Another surprise hit when the Presidential race in the USA came to an end. The victory of Donald Trump first led to volatility but the following days made investors put things into perspective, namely in terms of considering potential expansionary fiscal policy in the US market, thus leading to an increase in inflation expectations and consequently to an overall increase in yields. Meanwhile, the most important central banks in the world kept somewhat accommodative policies. The Federal Reserve in the USA increased interest rates bv a quarter point to 0.75% only in December, when it had foreseen a year before four rate increases during 2016. The European Central Bank maintained its bond buying program. The Bank of Japan kept negative interest rates and introduced a 0% target for the the benchmark 10-year government bond yield. Finally, the Bank of England slashed interest rates in August, following some economic concerns brought up after the Brexit vote. In this context, Eurostoxx 600 still managed to have a positive total shareholder return of 2%, though shy of the 12% reached by S&P 500 in 2016, buoyed by better perspectives for the North-American economy. In terms of the utilities sector in Europe, the total shareholder return for the Eurostoxx Utitlities index was down 3%, mostly impacted by the de-rating of the most defensive sectors following the increase in yields expectation grounded on the foreseeable expansionist impact of Donald Trump’s program for the US economy. Earlier in the year, the index gained some upward traction when oil price recovered from the bottom it reached at the beginning of the year. 72 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The Portuguese market, in turn, was severely hit by concerns with the weakness of the economy, as well as with the sustainability of the overall banking system, having yielded a -9% total shareholder return in 2016. The weakness of the Portuguese market and the fears regarding its peripheral position in Europe explain part of the underperformance of EDP in relation to the Eurostoxx Utilities index. EDP’s total shareholder return of -4% was thus mostly grounded on the concerns with regulatory risk in Portugal, given some political instability, as well with some discussion on the future of the renewable energy landscape in the USA, following Donald Trump’s election. In terms of shareholder structure changes, it is worth noting that Capital Group decreased its shareholdings slightly, and Norges Bank acquired a 2% share capital. 73 3. Activities 3.1. Electricity Generation The Generation Activity Power Generation is the first activity of the Electricity value chain. Electricity is generated through different technologies and primary energy sources that can be renewable or nonrenewable. Energy produced from traditional sources comes mainly from coal, natural gas, nuclear and cogeneration. Water, wind and sun are the more common renewable generation sources. As a result of climate changes and global protocols signed to fight them, energy produced from renewable sources has increased in the last decades. Hydro Plant Salamonde Electricity generation can also be classified as ordinary or special regime. Ordinary regime generation comes from thermal sources or big hydro plants whilst special regime generation is based essentially in mini-hydro, cogeneration and other renewable sources. Once it is produced, electricity is sold in the market or through power purchase agreements. For some technologies and in certain countries this activity’s remuneration is established by the regulator through the definition of tariffs or other remuneration mechanisms (for example green certificates, tax incentives and premiums). EDP is the largest electricity producer in Portugal, the fourth in Spain and the fifth largest private group in Brazil. In the wind energy market, EDP Renováveis is one of the leading global players. EDP is present in the generation activity in 12 countries. At the end of 2016, EDP had 25GW of installed capacity, of which 50% in Iberia (excluding EDP Renováveis’ installed capacity), 40% in EDP Renováveis and 10% in Brazil. The generation of electricity was made mainly through renewable energy sources (65%). The strategy defined by EDP for the generation activity Strategic priorities goes through the execution of the hydro investment plan currently in progress in Portugal and to seek for growth opportunities either in EDP Renováveis or in other • 28.5GW of installed capacity until international expansion opportunities. As so, additions in 2020, of which 75% of renewable installed capacity over the next years will be primarily energy focused on renewable sources. By 2020, EDP Renováveis estimates that 65% of their growth will be carried out in • In Portugal, conclusion of hydro the North American market where, due to existing tax investment plan incentives and long-term contracts, the associated risk is • Low Risk Profile reduced. In addition, EDP Renováveis plans to invest in European market (15%), Brazil (10%) with long-term • High Operational Performance contracts associated, and solar projects (10%). Following Portugal’s hydro investment plan, in 2016, the repowering project of Salamonde II (223MW in Jan-16) and Baixo Sabor’s upstream dam (151MW in Apr-16) came online. The remaining 2 plants under construction are Venda Nova III and Foz-Tua. They are expected to start up operations in 1Q17 and 2Q17 respectively. 74 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP Renováveis added in 2016 770MW to its installed Highlights capacity, of which 429MW in the US and 200MW in Mexico. The remaining 142MW were installed in Brazil (120MW) and in Europe (22MW). At the end of 2016, • Baixo Sabor (151MW) and Salamonde EDP Renováveis had 248MW under construction all II (223MW) started up operations in related to projects to be delivered in 2017, including Portugal 127MW in Brazil (JAU & Aventura) and 100MW in US (Meadow Lake V). It should be noted that all projects • More than 770MW of installed have long-term contracts already secured. capacity in EDPR, including 200MW in Mexico In Brazil, in September 2016, EDP concluded the investment in Cachoeira-Caldeirão (219MW, 50% EDP), • Start of operations of Cachoeirapartnership with CTG. The construction works in São Caldeirão (219MW) in Brazil Manoel (700MW, 33% EDP), partnership with Furnas and CTG, continued throught 2016 being expected to start up operations in May-18. In Jan-16, EDP concretized the sale of Pantanal through two mini-hydros – Mimosa (29MW) and Paraiso I (22MW). In Portugal, EDP decommissioned four thermal production facilities: Carregado, Setúbal, Tunes and Energin, respecting the plan submitted to the Portuguese Environmental Agency. During 2016, stands out the works of dismantling Carregado, Setúbal and Tunes power plants, performing cleaning in fuel infrastructures (tanks and pipes) and removal of transformers and other materials. Additionally, started of decommissioning of Energin. In 2016 EDP continued the environmental investments (denitrification) that are being carried out since 2014 in the thermal power plants of Aboño 2 and Soto 3. 75 Main Electricity Generation Indicators

Electricity and Gas Distribution The Distribution Activity The energy generated is delivered to transmission grid, and then is transported to the distribution network. This grid provides energy to the supply points. This stage of the value chain is called distribution activity. Electricity distribution networks are composed by high, medium and low voltage lines and cables. Also part of this networks are substations, transformation stations, public lighting, as well as the necessary connections to consuming facilities and power plants. Gas distribution activity operates from local distribution networks or through high pressure pipelines which provide the energy required to the supply points. Gas regulating and meter stations are also part of these grids. Distribution activity is under specific rules established by national regulatory authorities. Quality of service and efficiency are key drivers of this activity and distribution network operators, under the specific rules they are subject, have to ensure higher quality standards and service continuity defined by the regulator entity. This indicators are monitored through metrics such as Installed Capacity Equivalent Interruption Time and can be achieved through an appropriate level of investment and maintenance in the grid. The management of grid losses is also essential for the efficiency of this activity. EDP is present in the electricity distribution activity in three geographies: Portugal, Spain and Brazil, distributing in 2016 78TWh, through a network with more than 337 thousands km. In Portugal, EDP’s presence in the electricity distribution market spreads across the mainland. In Spain, EDP operates in some autonomous communities, especially in Asturias region. In Brazil, EDP is present in the State of Espírito Santo and in the State of São Paulo, through EDP Escelsa and EDP Bandeirante, respectively. In the gas distribution activity EDP’s operates in Iberia, where EDP distributed 34TWh in 2016, through 13 thousands km of grid. In Portugal, EDP is present in some northern coast region, through EDP Gás Distribuição, and its concession area covers approximately 25% of the country’s population. In Spain, EDP operates in the gas distribution business through Naturgas Energia, whose operations are located in 3 autonomous regions: Asturias, Cantábria and Pais Basco. In the beginning of 2016, EDP has reached an agreement with Repsol Butano, S.A. for the purchase of LPG assets in the regions of Asturias, Cantábria and Pais Basco. This transaction comprises the acquisition of the distribution network and 82 thousand supply points. 78 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The electricity distribution business strategy of the EDP Strategic Priorities Group is also focused on the implementation of smart grids and related services, in order to meet the challenges of the future and become a benchmark in • Implementation of smart grids electricity distribution. Therefore, maintains focus in efficiency and quality of service, keeping appropriate • Higher quality of service and efficiency investment levels and registering historically high levels of quality of service. Over the past few years, expansion and improvement of grid in all three geographies – Portugal, Spain and Brazil -, as well as the expansion of telemeters in all transformation stations, have been a key factor in the way of EDP. At the end of 2016, the company had more than 1.49 million smart meters installed in the three geographies, particularly Portugal where we have a coverage by telemetry of 63% of distributed energy. In 2016, for the second consecutive year, levels of Highlights electricity distribution registered an increase in Iberia. Despite penalized by milder weather conditions than usual, electricity distributed increased 1%, resulting in a total of • Quality of service in Portugal reached 54TWh. historical amounts and efficiency The Installed Capacity Equivalent Interruption Time improved compared to last year (ICEIT) scored, in Portugal, the best mark ever, with 52 minutes. In Spain EDP continues to be a leader in quality • EDP continues to be a leader in quality of of service of the Spanish electricity sector, with an ICEIT service of the Spanish electricity sector of 24 minutes. System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) in Portugal also improved its performance • In Brazil, in 2016 EDP won an auction for compared to 2015, and registered 1.52 interruptions for concession of transmission grid in the domestic customers and small businesses and 1.75 interruptions for business customers. State of Espírito Santo Regarding electricity grid losses in Portugal, highlight for a new reduction compared to 2015, reaching 9.5%, but remaining above the regulatory target 9.25%. ICEIT in Portugal In Brazil, the distribution business was negatively impacted by the macroeconomic reached best mark ever, context. The economic downturn and the milder weather conditions than usual led to a achieving 52 min. decrease in the electricity distributed to 24TWh (-5% compared to 2015). In Brazil, quality of technical service is based in two indicators: Average Interruption Duration per Consumer Unit (DEC) and Frequency Interruption Duration per Consumer Unit (FEC). In 2016, EDP Bandeirante achieved a DEC of 9.0 hours and a FEC of 5.7 times, which implies a reduction of 7% and 12%, respectively when compared to 2015. EDP Escelsa presented in 2016 a DEC of 9.3 hours, which correspond to an increase of 2% and a FEC of 5.6 times, corresponding to an 11% increase compared to 2015. Following its participation in an ANEEL auction, EDP Brazil added to its network portfolio the concession to operate a 113km of transmission grid in the State of Espírito Santo. In gas distribution, in 2016 has continued to increase the supply points (4% in Portugal and 11% in Spain). Nevertheless, the volumes of gas distributed decreased 1% to 34TWh. 79 Main Electricity Distribution Indicators ELECTRICITY DISTRIB UTION UN 2 016 2015 2014 20 13 Elec tric ity Distributed per ELECTRICITY DISTRIB UTED GW h 78,214 79,159 79,42 8 78,886 Employee (MWh/#) Port ugal GW h 44,59 9 44 ,2 77 43,80 8 4 3,858 Spain GW h 9,19 0 9 ,168 9,177 9 ,147 30,189 31,214 30,869 30,430 B razil GW h 24,42 5 25,713 26,44 3 2 5,880 ELECTRICITY SUPPLY POINTS '000 10 ,121 10,024 9,89 4 9,780 12,650 13,144 13,353 13,791 Port ugal '000 6,14 2 6,107 6,08 3 6,076 Spain '000 66 3 660 659 659 B razil '000 3,316 3 ,2 57 3,152 3,045 11,764 12,124 11,635 11,256 TELEM ETERING '000 1,419 8 16 54 2 346 Port ugal '000 80 9 346 18 6 95 2013 2014 2015 2016 Spain '000 50 8 402 30 6 227 Portugal Spain Brazil B razil '000 10 3 68 50 24 GRID EX TENSION Km 3 37,49 2 335,804 3 33,313 334 ,169 Port ugal Km 22 5,39 7 22 4,849 2 23,52 3 22 2,476 Overhead lines Km 176,89 0 176,622 175,615 n.a.

Portugal Spain 81 3.3. Electricity and Gas Supply The Supply Activity Once the energy gets to the supply point, it is sold by the supplier. In all the electricity and gas value chain, the supply is the activity closer to the customer, being responsible for the relationship with the final consumers. In most European countries, the electricity and gas markets’ liberalisation processes were carried out in stages, starting by higher consumption and voltage level customers. In regulated markets, energy supply is attributed to the distributors. With the market liberalisation, these activities are separated, allowing new agents to enter. In Iberia, electricity and gas supply is liberalised and consumers have the right to freely choose their supplier. Although the energy market is fully liberalised in both countries, there are last resort suppliers. Currently, in Portugal, these suppliers provide customers whom have not moved to the liberalised suppliers and in the future the aim will be to ensure energy supply to consumers, mainly vulnerable ones. In Brazil, the electricity supply is divided in regulated and liberalised markets. The customers with consumption from 3,000 kW onwards are considered liberalised and the remaining customers are covered by the regulated market. EDP is present in the electricity supply activity in Portugal, Spain and Brazil, having more than 9.8 million customers in those geographies. In the gas sector, this presence is only in Iberia, where EDP has 1.5 million customers. The customer relationship management is crucial for EDP, which Strategic Priorities has given strong relevance to the focus on clients and to improve the quality of services provided. EDP has been building up a position of brand awareness in the energy market, aiming • Focus on customer retention to be an engaging company with which customers relate to. • Maintenance of high levels of The energy service segment, focused on energy efficiency and clients’ satisfaction microgeneration (photovoltaic panels), has also been contributing to built strong customer relations. In Iberia, EDP • High penetration rate of Dual continues to construct its position based on a wide range of offer in Iberia products and integrated electricity and gas services for both B2B and B2C customers. • Increase in penetration of other services in Iberia • Wide range of energy services in all geographies 82 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Currently, the supply of energy services in Brazil is largely targeted to B2B customers, where there is a considerable upside to be reached. Highlights The number of EDP’s liberalised electricity customers in Iberia reached • EDP Comercial reached 4 4.9 million in 2016, growing 8% year on year. million electricity customers and 590 In Portugal, a new milestone was surpassed, reaching 4 million customers (+ 8% vs 2015). This resulted from the strong level of thousand gas customers in customer acquisition following the switching of customers from the the liberalized market regulated market. The electricity sold by EDP in the liberalised market increased by 7%, which was not enough to offset the decrease in sales • Uniformization of EDP in the regulated market. brand of all suppliers in all geographies In Spain, the volume of electricity sold rose by 8% in 2016, supported by the growth of the B2B segment. In Brazil, the decrease in the number of contracts with liberalized customers was more than offset by the increase in customers in the regulated market. Despite the increase in the number of customers, the amount of electricity sales did not follow this trend penalized by the migration of customers from the regulated market to the free market, the milder weather conditions, the maintenance of the levels of retraction of the economy and the tariff increases of electric energy. In the gas segment, the number of EDP’s gas customers in Iberia reached 1.5 million. In Portugal, EDP has seen its liberalised costumers’ portfolio grow by 18% because of the successful of dual offering (electricity + gas). This growth reinforces EDP’s leadership in the B2C liberalized gas sector in Portugal. In Spain, the amount of gas sold decreased by 28%, reflecting lower opportunities in the wholesale market.

Ethics The world today is characterised by enormous volatility, complexity and uncertainty, arising from an unprecedented Annual Report of the Ethics rate of change. For companies, this means particularly Ombudsman challenging market contexts where the resilience of the organisation and the consistency of the values on which it bases its culture are continually put to the test. In these The different initiatives, results and contexts, the company's reputation, an intangible asset commitments within the remit of EDP's supported by the trust that its stakeholders place in it, ethical performance management are assumes a value like never before. detailed in the Annual Report of the Ethics Ombudsman, available at At EDP, ensuring high levels of ethical awareness and www.edp.pt> about edp> corporate demand, minimising the risk of malpractice and maintaining governance> ethics> ethics ombudsman. a consistent, trustworthy culture are the established ethical management objectives. Responsibility, compliance, integrity, respect and transparency are the principles that shape the ethical nature of our corporate culture, which we strive to strengthen and continually improve. Since we understand that our responsibility is not confined to the organisational limits of the Group, we include our suppliers and service providers in the ethical performance management objectives, particularly with regard to compliance, the fight against corruption and the promotion of Human Rights, and within the broader framework of sustainable management of the EDP Group supply chain. Furthermore, the Group's maturity in this area of management makes it possible to foster cooperation partnerships and networks and the co-creation of knowledge in the field of business ethics, fostering innovation and sharing with society. These were the main guidelines for the initiatives developed in the EDP Group in this field in 2016. 4.1. Ethical Complaint Management Complaints registered and analysed 406 complaints were registered during 2016 in the various channels available for this purpose within the EDP Group. Of these, 52 gave rise to complaint procedures before the Ethics Committee, and the others were quickly and efficiently processed with the Business Units involved. In addition to the analysis of their origin, the complaints received are classified according to the different topics in the Code of Ethics, according to the table: Classification of complaints according to the Code of Ethics Fairness of solutions 2.2. Conflicts of interest | 3. Commitment to stakeholders Negligence and disrespect 2.1. Legislation | 2.3. Human and labour rights | 3. Commitment to stakeholders Transparency 2.4. Transparency | 3.

Community society Fraud, corruption and bribery 2.2. Financial issues | 2.2. Corruption and bribery 85 Compared with the previous year, a reduction of 4% is apparent in the total number of new complaints submitted to the Ethics Committee. In an analysis by subject, a significant reduction stands out under the heading Negligence or Disrespect on the one hand, and on the other, a certain increase under the headings Transparency and Use of Information or Assets . This increase may be justified by a greater degree of demand from stakeholders, but also by the training and awareness-raising actions carried out in the course of 2016. Claims before the Ethics Committee, by subject (#) 29 26 21 10 3 2 5 7 0 0 2 1 Fairness of solutions Neglect or disrespect Transparency Use of information or Environment and Fraud, corruption and assets responsability towards bribery society 2015 2016 As for the analysis by origin, it is found that the complaint channels were used by all stakeholder groups, but particularly by the Client and Employee groups, which together represent about 44% of the total complaints assessed. There is a significant number of anonymous complaints, most of which originated from EDP Brasil, where this practice is generally more common.

Of the complaints examined, 50 were closed and 18 are under investigation and carried over to 2017. Of the claims closed, 36% were considered to be justified and 64% were unfounded. Following the opinions of the Ethics Committee, more than forty follow-up actions were determined. Like in 2015, these actions mostly focused on the review and improvement of procedures, thus promoting better management and control systems in order to prevent the recurrence of unethical practices. Actions classified as others included, for example, the monitoring of performance processes, the assessment of the effectiveness of initiatives, and the reporting of events to criminal investigation authorities. 86 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Complainant Satisfaction With regard to control of the management process of ethical complaints, complainant satisfaction is evaluated annually for complaints submitted to the Ethics Committee that originated in Portugal or Spain. This evaluation focuses on such aspects as courtesy of treatment and response time to contacts. 18 questionnaires were sent out in 2016, which had a response rate of 44%. The results of the evaluation remain positive, with 75% of complainants declaring themselves satisfied or very satisfied in both areas analysed. Complainant's satisfaction (#) 4 3 3 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 Very dissatisfied Dissatisfied Not dissatisfied, not Satisfied Very satisfied satisfied Treatment courtesy Response time to the first contact with Ombudsman 4.2. Strengthening the ethical culture Code of Conduct for Senior Management and Senior Financial Officers The Code of Conduct for Senior Management and Senior Financial Officers has been approved, whose aim is to promote synchrony and to explain, internally and externally, the current conduct matrix, shared by those who, in the different geographies and businesses of the Group, hold authority and assume top management responsibilities. While it does not replace the EDP Code of Ethics, this document reinforces and complements it, recognising that the example of the leader's performance is the best and most powerful code of conduct the organisation can have and the best safeguard of the Company's reputation. Commitment to Timely Payment In 2016, as part of the supply chain sustainability development plan, EDP adhered to the Timely Payment Commitment initiative promoted by ACEGE Christian Association of Entrepreneurs and Managers (page 126). Ethics Training and Awareness Throughout the year, under the Smallest Film Cycle in the World initiative, a series of short films was shown via the internal communication channels on subjects related to corporate ethics (Human Rights in the supply chain, gender diversity, individual responsibility, moral fortitude, etc.). Each session was complemented by brief questionnaires on the topics covered and their relationship with the reality within EDP. The results of these questionnaires served as a theme for debates promoted on corporate radio and television. Continuing the extensive awareness and training programme that has been undertaken in previous years, the Tone at the Middle initiative was designed and implemented in the business units in Portugal. This involved the entire middle management segment, and its aim was to strengthen the alignment of this segment of employees around ethics issues. In this reflection and debate exercise on ethics, and in addition to addressing the circumstances that lead to unethical practices in EDP, the importance of integrating day-to-day ethics in work teams and in decision-making was highlighted. For 2017, it is planned to extend this initiative to the other geographies where the Group operates. 87 The “ethicsedp | suppliers training course has been developed to consolidate the knowledge of the principles of action and of the commitments to stakeholders undertaken by EDP in its Code of Ethics within the Group's supply chain. As a first step, this training is aimed at the employees of companies that provide external services (ESP) that represent or act on behalf of EDP, or that work in our facilities. The initiative began in 2016 and will be extended to 2018, and the aim is to cover more than 6,000 ESP employees in Portugal and Spain. In 2016, EDP Brasil and EDP Renováveis also carried out the online training programme ethicsedp , covering a total of 2,535 employees in the two Business Units. This programme began in 2014 and was designed for all Group's employees. It has now been completed. Also at EDP Brasil, several training sessions have been held by the Compliance area, disseminating information on legislation and corporate policies on competition and the fight against corruption, highlighting issues such as: “the most common forms and agents of corruption ; money laundering ; insider information ; and gifts and presents . These sessions covered more than 1,900 employees. In Portugal, the face-to-face module on ethics that complements the online ethicsedp training has been retained for the induction period. This training covered 85% of the employees admitted during the year in this geography. Expansion to all other business units is planned for 2017. 4.3. Evaluation of ethical performance ETHICIS Corporate Ethical Performance Index The EDP Group uses the Ethicis index as a performance monitoring tool. This index, which has been in use since 2013, provides an integrated, balanced view of the Group's ethical performance, which enables the consistency of management practices with ethical commitments to be evaluated, and is also an effective support for external reporting. In order to increase its robustness, clarity and coherence, Ethicis was given a thorough review in 2016; as a result, a greater diversification of the sources used for certain indicators was achieved, and the quality of indicators relating to suppliers improved. Two major areas of analysis Consistency and Culture were given greater weight, and recognised as structuring factors in ethical performance management, in line with the Ethics Management objectives at EDP. In 2016 the Ethicis index showed a consolidated result of 78.7, which represents an increase of 2.9 points over 2015, which has been recalculated according to a more demanding methodology now adopted. External evaluations EDP has been recognised for the fifth consecutive year by the Ethisphere Institute USA in the list of 2016 World's Most Ethical Companies . In assessing the maturity of its ethical performance management system, EDP saw the overall value of its Corporate Ethics Quotient improved by 0.2 points and extended its lead over the average points obtained by companies on the 2016 list to 9 points. Note that this result was achieved in the context of a higher level of demand and detail of the information requested in each of the five areas under analysis. 88 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP Brasil was awarded the 2016 Pro-Ethics Seal, given by Brazil's Federal Ministry of Transparency, Supervision and Control. Other external evaluations of ethical performance, such as EDP's positioning on different ESG indices, are explained in the Annual Report of the Ethics Ombudsman. 4.4. Combating corruption Pro-Ethics Seal The Pro-Ethics Seal is an initiative that promotes the public recognition of companies committed to preventing and combating corruption and striving to promote greater integrity and a more ethical and transparent corporate environment. This recognition was obtained by EDP Brasil for the third consecutive time, and the company was one of the first four Brazilian companies to obtain it (page 27). The target for EDP in the coming years is to achieve the maximum score. Online Training on Corruption In 2016, market research was completed with the aim of providing online training on corruption and bribery. The chosen solution uses a gamification approach and is being adapted to the needs of EDP. It will be launched in the first quarter of 2017, and cover all senior managers and the heads of all the Group's Business Units. Gestão Transparente.org As a founding member of the collaborative initiative Gestão Transparente.Org A practical guide to the management of the risk of corruption in organisations , EDP continues to promote this community-based platform by carrying out activities to prevent corruption, promote transparency, and widen its dissemination and base of adherents and users. In essence, a web-based, free-access tool is made available with an organisation characterisation simulator and a corruption risk indicator. A set of measures and information aimed at enhancing prevention is also available, including the sharing of good practices amongst the founding companies and the public commitments of the member organisations. The Gestão Transparente.Org Project also focused on the protection of personal data in 2016 and in 2017, in the context of promoting and sharing values of integrity, accountability and transparency, it has also expanded the availability of its contents in Spanish, English, and European and South American Portuguese. Compliance In May 2016, EDP formally adopted a Corporate Compliance Management System to monitor the main risks inherent in legal and regulatory compliance and to strengthen and systematise its compliance management practices. The Internal Audit and Compliance Department is responsible for promoting and coordinating the EDP Group's (Global and Specific) Compliance Programmes, through the provision of tools, methodological support and monitoring of the activities carried out. Throughout the year, certain initiatives were carried out aimed at implementing various Specific Compliance Programmes. In particular, in the EDP Group companies in Spain and in EDP Renováveis, in view of the recent changes in the Spanish Criminal Code regarding Legal Corporate Liability a legal framework in which the responsibility for a range of potential offences (corruption, fraud, money laundering, influence peddling, crimes against the environment, crimes against public health, amongst others) may also be attributable in certain circumstances to companies a review of the models of crime prevention already implemented has been carried out in order to defining a control benchmark that can reinforce a set of policies, guidelines and internal procedures, systematising a Compliance Programme required by the current legislation. This work also aims to promote the identification of best practices that can be adopted in the short term, across the EDP Group. 89 At EDP Brasil, during 2016, several Compliance training sessions were held in order to transmit values, principles and rules to the main organisational structures, reinforcing internal topics such as the Code of Ethics, EDP Culture, risk tolerance, norms and internal procedures, and also addressing issues related to the legislation in force, such as the fight against corruption, the defence of competition and Human Rights, and others. System of Internal Control and Financial Reporting With a view to enhancing the effectiveness of the control and reporting systems and reducing the risk of legal noncompliance, in particular the occurrence of corruption and bribery practices in the context of the evolution, quality and maintenance of the system, topics related to the analysis of financial risks and fraud in financial reporting were reinforced, bearing in mind the continuous improvement and robustness of the system (page 214). 4.5. Championing Human Rights The Human and Labour Rights Monitoring Programme (HLRP), extended in 2016 to all EDP Group Business Units, covers, among other things, companies, facilities, new projects, mergers and acquisitions, as well as operations with a potential impact on Human Rights or materially significant turnover in Portugal, Spain, Brazil and the United States. This Programme enables us to assess compliance with EDP principles and objectives with regard to the respect for Human and Labour Rights, our practices and the impact of decisions and operations. EDP's public principles and commitments regarding respect for human rights are reaffirmed and made publicly available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt> sustainability> approach to sustainability> ruggie principles) and other media such as the Code of Ethics and the EDP Group's Principles of Sustainable Development. HLRP monitoring also contributes to the systematic practice of ethical risk assessment and compliance with applicable legal, regulatory and ethical standards. EDP has adopted the principles and values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international conventions, treaties and initiatives such as the International Labour Organisation Conventions, the United Nations Global Compact and the Guiding Principles for Business of the Human Rights Council Ruggie Framework. EDP is committed to respecting and promoting Human Rights and decent work practices, particularly in the supply chain. The Group's Principles of Sustainable Development assert its commitments to integrate social aspects into its planning and decision-making, to respect and promote respect for human rights within its sphere of influence, to reject abusive and discriminatory practices and to ensure equal opportunities. In 2016, the self-diagnosis carried out identified no significant risks of adverse impacts on Human Rights, but a set of actions and improvement plans are nevertheless recommended, as well as their expansion throughout our supply chain, particularly in the entities who act on behalf of EDP. It should be noted that compliance with the prohibition of recourse to illegal workers and child labour is an explicit requirement for the qualification of suppliers, is contractually established and is subject to verification and operational inspections, and is also addressed under the Compliance function by the Supply Chain Sustainability Programme, the HLRP and self-diagnosis. Relevant HLRP procedures and documents Commitments, UN Guiding Principles for Business, Monitoring Guide, Reports are published at www.edp.pt> sustainability> approach to sustainability> ruggie principles. The channel for complaints, reporting and queries to the EDP Group Ethics Ombudsman is the preferred means of contact on matters of Human and Labour Rights, including the supply chain. 90 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 5.

For each of these areas, an Innovation Working Group has been set up, directly sponsored by a member of the EDP Group's Executive Board. In the particular case of Brazil, R&D initiatives are promoted based on the guidelines of the regulatory authority, focusing on improvements in power generation and distribution processes. The multi-year R&D strategic investment plan covers a five-year period and was designed to achieve objectives such as operational efficiency, risk reduction and revenue improvement. In 2016, the EDP Group's estimated total investment in R&D+i was 14.8 million euros. The most significant initiatives developed by the business units in the five strategic areas are described below. 5.2. Innovation Initiatives Clean energy This area focuses on identifying and promoting the development of new energy generation methods through renewable sources or through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and new technologies to improve the operations and efficiency of existing energy production assets.

Performance Development and experimental validation of an architecture methodology for the design phase of buildings to architecture for achieve high levels of energy efficiency in buildings exposed to the particular environmental climate constraints Brazil Energy Efficiency in of Bioclimatic Zone 8 in Brazil. Buildings. Energy storage This area seeks to understand the rapid changes in energy storage technologies and their application to energy systems. The challenges of intermittent power, microgeneration, electric mobility and increased customer training require technological solutions that increase the flexibility of electrical systems in which supply and demand must be constantly balanced. Storage is therefore a key tool in addressing these areas throughout the energy value chain. The following projects are of note: PROJECT DESCRIPTION COUNTRY Technical storage Solution testing with commercial batteries in residential settings to identify performance deviations against those Portugal pilots reported by manufacturers and implement control strategies for batteries linked to photovoltaic panels. Development of a demonstrator to test the V2G solution, acquire technological knowledge and assess the V2G – Vehicle to Grid Portugal challenges and opportunities offered by VsG technologies.

Demonstration pilot project to define and specify a storage system with a battery connected to the grid, STOCARE incorporated in a wind farm. The project aims to identify critical aspects related to real-time system maintenance Romania operations and to evaluate the technical capacities for increasing the flexibility of the plant's operations. 93 Data leap This is a cross-cutting area which seeks to leverage the latest developments in Information and Communication Technologies (IT) to accelerate innovation in all business areas. Its main focus is the use of new ICTs, such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, Advanced Analytics and the Internet of Things and the identification of opportunities for operational optimization and business development through digital innovation and data use. The following projects are of note: PROJECT DESCRIPTION COUNTRY Real-time dashboards A pilot project to evaluate big data architectures for processing and displaying data currently held in Osi-Pi and optimization of databases. The goal is to improve the performance and flexibility of real-time operational dashboards and Portugal OSI-PI Reports reports with wind farm data.

Promotion of a hackathon, in partnership with Microsoft, challenging participants to collect data from EDP smart EDP IoT Hackathon meters and then transmit it the cloud. The final solution involves the visualization and processing of received Portugal data in an effective, innovative and appealing way. Other innovation initiatives In addition to the above initiatives in its five strategic Innovation areas, EDP has a venture capital fund for investment in cleantech (EDP Ventures) and promotes internal and external initiatives to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship, particularly through EDP Starter. EDP Ventures: By the end of 2016, it had already invested 22 million euros in innovative cleantech companies and funds. The following investments are of note: • Arquiled LED lighting solutions; • Feedzai real time big data solutions; • Zypho drain water heat recovery solution for showers and baths; • Principle Power floating platform for offshore wind energy; • Egg – single multi-socket; • Eggy – device for power consumption monitoring; • Vertequip – system for lifting and transferring people in conventional production plants and wind towers; • Pro-drone – integrated solution for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) inspection; • International cleantech funds (USA and UK); • Support for the implementation of pilots among Portuguese start-ups and EDP Group Business Units (EDP Comercial, EDP Renováveis). EDP Starter: support programme for energy projects, from initial idea to venture capital investment, thereby contributing to the development of innovative technologies and new business models for the energy industry (www.edpstarter.com). By the end of 2016, EDP had supported 30 start-ups and made 12 venture capital investments worth a total of 22 million euros. EDP Open Innovation: in partnership with the Expresso newspaper, this programme is the result of the fusion of the Energia de Portugal and EDP Inovação prizes, formerly awarded in Portugal and Brazil. The programme promotes the development of new business projects, with an emphasis on technological innovation or business models in the area of 94 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 clean energy technologies. It can offer a gateway to the EDP Starter project. In 2016, applications were received for 125 projects from Portugal, Brasil and Spain, with the 50,000 euros prize awarded to the Brazilian start-up Delfos Predictive Maintenance for the development of a wind power equipment failure prediction system (https://edpopeninnovation.edp .pt). ClickIdea Platform: ClickIdea is a collaborative platform, open to all employees in all geographical areas, which challenges them to contribute innovative ideas that could have a positive impact on the Group's operations and business. Employees can contribute to the evaluation and improvement of ideas submitted by their colleagues and those with most votes will later be assessed by an evaluation committee. Innovability Mentors (iMentors): training programme for employees in Brazil, based on innovation methodologies and tools, building their capacity for the creation of business opportunities aligned with sustainable development principles and the development of value proposals related to the challenges faced by EDP Brasil. Launched in 2013, the programme already has 88 employees acting as iMentors. 6. Environment 6.1. Climate Change Climate Change, together with mitigation measures, such as the promotions of renewable energies and energy efficiency, are material themes for EDP, recognised as highly relevant for all stakeholder segments consulted. EDP aims at providing competitive low carbon EDP’s climate change strategy places the company within the response to energy, capable of ensuring the deep change in the electric sector, aimed at its decarbonisation in the sustainable economic growth. long run. EDP Commitments Undertaken in 2015 95 At the end of 2016, against the objectives defined, EDP achieved: EDP has also undertaken a number of commitments promoted by the organisation CDP – Driving Sustainable Economies and the coalition We Mean Business, as follows: • To adopt an internal price of carbon: In its decision making, EDP adopts internal carbon prices. These prices are used to assess the impact of current and future carbon regulations e.g. in emission trading systems and carbon taxes on energy prices and volumes, the value of existing assets and the evaluation of capital investments in new power generation assets (from fossil fuels or renewable energies), bearing in mind market specifics (geography and regulation). The price range (currently between EUR 5 and EUR 60/tCO2) is based on various reference sources, depending on the scenario adopted, the year and the geography; • To define an emission reduction target consistent with the level of decarbonisation required for restricting the increase in global temperature to 2ºC (Science Based Target). In early 2017, EDP saw its emission reduction goal approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi); • To disclose information on climate change as a fiduciary duty, including in its accounting documents content that meets the Climate Change Reporting Framework (CCRF) requirements: • EDP annually reports to the CDP Climate Change and Water programmes, providing detailed information on climate change and water risks and opportunities in the business and their management. EDP’s response is publicly available (www.edp.pt). In 2016, it obtained the highest rating (A Leadership) in the CDP-Climate index, and the B rating (Management) in the CDP-Water index; • The information provided on climate change complies with the CCRF requirements, and is included both in this report and in the documents mentioned therein: • Strategic Agenda (page 48); Risks, Opportunities and Governance (CDP); • Management (page 48); Objectives and Goals (page 52); • Global Energy Macro-Trends (page 36); • GHG Emissions (page 97), fully aligned with the financial consolidation method. • In this context, EDP complies with the CDP, GHG Protocol, EU ETS (European Union Emission Trading Scheme and GRI-G4 benchmarks. The SBTi* recognised the alignment of EDP's targets with the development and decarbonisation scenarios for the electric sector, based on the projections by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), compatible with an increase in global temperature of less than 2ºC, the base scenario of the Paris Agreement. In this context, EDP undertook to reduce scope 1 and 2 specific emissions by 55% by 2030, as compared to 2015, as well as scope 3 absolute indirect emissions by 25% over the same period. * Collaboration between the organisations CDP, World Resources Institute (WRI), World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) 96 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Business Decarbonisation Promotion of Renewable Energies and Generation Portfolio Management The renewable energy capacity installed increased by 7.4% over the previous year, as a result of capacity additions in wind (+770 MW) and hydro (+487 MW net), reaching 18.3 GW, i.e. 72.6% of the EDP Group’s total capacity, and converging towards the target set for 2020. Generation from these sources increased significantly over 2015 (+24%; +8.74 TWh), supported by higher water availability in Portugal, IPH= 1.33 as against 0.74 in 2015, and increased wind generation. These facts, coupled with decreased thermal power generation in the Iberian Peninsula, led to a significant increase in the contribution of renewable energies to the EDP Group’s total production, from 58% to 66%. The use of renewable energies to replace fossil fuels for electricity generation resulted in a total avoided emissions of 32.7 MtCO2 (14% up on 2015). This indicator reflects the amount of CO2 that would have been emitted if the energy from renewable sources had been generated at conventional thermal power plants. With regard to greenhouse gas emissions, as compared with the previous year, the following was recorded in 2016: • A reduction of 12% in direct emissions (scope 1), as a result of a decreased generation from fossil fuels, which accounts for 99.8% of this indicator; • A strong reduction (-43%) in indirect emissions associated with electric power consumption (scope 2), due to the lower volume of distributed electricity generated by third parties, which influenced emissions associated with losses in distribution networks, and to the almost general reduction in emission factors in the different geographies in which EDP operates. EDP follows the GHG Protocol recommendation as regards the determination of scope 2 emissions, according to two methodologies: based on global emission factors (location-based) and on suppliers’ emission factors (market-based). However, the calculation of scope 2 emissions using both methodologies does not result in significant differences because their impact is only felt in the electricity consumption of office buildings and self-supply of wind farms with guarantee of origin for renewable energy, the contribution of these two categories to this indicator being just 4.5%; • A 15% reduction in indirect emissions induced upstream and downstream of the value chain (scope 3), due to lower activity related to fuels and energy (category C03) and the decrease by 25% in the volume of gas supplied (category C11), especially in the wholesale market. 3 CO2 equivalent EMISSIONS (kt) 2016 2015 SCOPE 1 18,931.4 21,550.3 Stationary combustion 18,900.4 21,518.1 SF6 Emissions 7.8 7.8 Company fleet 17.7 18.0 Natural gas consumption 0.5 0.5 Natural gas losses 5.0 6.0 1 SCOPE 2 (Location-based and Market-based 2) 564.9 981.8 Electricity consumption in office buildings 1.6 2.0 Electricity losses 539.6 956.5 Renewable plants self-consumption 23.7 23.2 SCOPE 3 12,469.1 14,622.8 Purchased goods and services (C01) 54.5 53.0 Capital Goods (C02) 286.9 250.8 Fuel and energy related activities (C03) 7,091.2 7,636.3 Upstream transportation and distribution (C04) 303.7 384.7 Business Travels (C06) 10.5 9.5 Use of sold products (C11) 4,722.2 6,288,4 1 Based on global emissions factors of each geography. | 2 Based on suppliers emissions factors. | 3 Scopes were all revised: Scope 1 to exclude Arcelor-Mittal emissions and Scopes 2 and 3 to avoid double counting. 97 The conditions favourable to decarbonisation observed in 2016, strongly influenced by increased hydro resources in Portugal, led to a value of specific emissions of 0.271 tCO2/MWh, which corresponds to a 20% decrease from 2015 and a reduction of 57% from 2005, approaching the public commitment undertaken. Specific overall CO2 emissions (tCO2/MWh) 0.63 0.48 0.46 0.39 0.36 0.34 0.29 0.32 0.28 0.28 0.24 0.27 0.16 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Goal 2030 Internal Energy Efficiency The business decarbonisation also depends on improved internal energy efficiency (efficiency of thermal power plants; losses in the distribution networks; smarter grids) and on the preservation of natural resources, notably fossil fuels. As regards the total consumption of primary energy, which amounted to 220,588 TJ, there was a decrease of about 31,763 TJ (13% down on 2015) as a result of the lower use of coal in the Iberian Peninsula, including the shut-down of group 2 of the Soto de Ribera power plant and the lower availability at Aboño 2 (improvement of the denitrification system) despite the increase of about 10 thousand TJ in the consumption of natural gas (page 135 and 136). The most favourable operation regime in thermal power plants, particularly the combined-cycle gas plants (CCGT) led to an increase in the the overall weighted efficiency of these plants, excluding cogeneration, from 37.1% in 2015 to 38.7% (page 135 and 136). The energy consumed in operations to provide the final product (electricity and gas), e.g. in power plant selfconsumption, networks (losses) and office buildings, was 54.2 TJ, 3% down on the previous year. This variation was supported by the widespread reduction in distribution grid losses (255 GWh or 0.9 TJ down on 2015) and gas leaks (169 GWh or 0.6 TJ down on 2015). As regards the development of infrastructure and smart grid applications, focused on the customer and the operations, EDP continued to install smart meters, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, which cover already more than 1.3 million clients. In late 2016, EDP had 18% delivery points equipped with smart meters (pages 80 and 120), practically doubling the number of smart meters installed until 2015. Solutions for the Client Energy Efficiency Services EDP continued to promote energy efficiency services focused on its clients, providing replacement solutions for conventional primary energy sources with others that are more efficient (fuel switching), equipment replacement (lighting, compressed air systems, high performance motors, electronic variable speed drives, heat pumps, etc.) and the optimisation and more efficient load management (page 123). In 2016, the additional energy efficiency services led to acummulated savings, since 2015, of 194 GWh, avoiding the emissions of 32.8 ktCO2. Micro-generation services Antecipating the future where generation will be increasingly decentralised, EDP offers its clients microgeneration solutions from renewable sources, tailored to the customer’s profile and the characteristics of the sites and the electrical 98 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 installations, essentially based onphotovoltaic systems for self-consumption. The systems instaled in Portugal, Spain and Brazil, totalled 9.3 MW, avoiding the emissions of 3.9 ktCO2, calculated on the basis of each country’s global emission factor. Sustainable Mobility The transport sector and the massive use of traditional liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel oil, etc.) are important sources of emissions, with a negative impact on the environment, not to mention the economic component related to external energy dependency. Sustainable mobility depends on behavioural change in terms of how people displace themselves, as well the use of alternative, more efficient and less pollutant energy sources, such as electricity and natural gas, and their supply infrastructure, which translates into new business opportunities for EDP. To this end, EDP has developed: • internal solutions with the progressive introduction of electrical vehicles and vehicles powered by natural gas into its vehicle fleet, energy certification for the Portuguese fleet, car-sharing schemes, training in eco-driving, its own filling stations and an important contribution to the installation of public supply infrastructure; • external solutions, offering its clients b2b and b2c sustainable mobility products: charging stations, mobility plans, discounts in the electricity and gas bill, consumption management, support and advice. 6.2. Management of Environmental Impacts Management Policies and Systems EDP’s continuous improvement of its environmental performance is part of its Environmental Policy, including the prevention of pollution and the mitigation of its impact, in compliance with the requirements of the environmental legislation applicable to the company’s various activities, as well as with other voluntary commitments (www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment> environmental policy). Environmental certifications are a way of demonstrating externally the minimisation of environmental risks and the search for environmental performance excellence. Since 2008, EDP has maintained a Corporate Management System (SIGAC) certified to ISO 14001, which covers “the corporate management of environmental policies, environmental strategic plans, environmental reporting and environmental performance of the organisations within the EDP Group”. In 2016, ISO 14001 certification was obtained for 93% of the net installed generation capacity and 41% of the installed capacity in distribution substations. In Brazil, Pecém Power Plant obtained its certification according to ISO 14.001, which turns to 87% the amount of certified installed capacity. Furthermore, the EDP Group is registered in the EcoManagement and Audit Scheme (EMAS) for 93% of the net installed capacity in Portugal and 51% in Spain. With a continuous investment in practices and technologies that minimise the environmental impact of its activities, in 2016 environmental investments amounted to about 72 million Euros and environmental cost to about 62 million Euros. More than 64% of the investment was allocated for the protection of the air and the environment, with investment in minimising air emissions being particularly important. Note 51 of the financial statements provides a detailed description (page 406). During 2016, the EDP Group incurred costs for fines and other penalties for uncomplying environment regulations and indemnities to third parties for losses and damages caused by past pollution in the amount of 29 thousand euros. Water Resources Water is a key resource for EDP’s activity, particularly for hydro and thermal power plants that depend on its quantity and quality. The importance of this resource for the EDP Group is reflected in the materiality matrix, which also identifies the high importance of the Water Management for society (page 63). 99 Within its Water Management Policy, EDP monitors the potential shortage, controls the water quality and sediment, and the impact of water management on biodiversity, for which it ensures a number of minimisation activities, such as the release of ecological flows, the transfer and transport of fish and the support of scientific research on these topics (www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment> water> water management policy). In 2016, the monitoring of water quality in reservoirs was extended to the new hydropower plants in Portugal: monitoring of the operation conditions at Baixo Sabor and filling conditions in Foz Tua. Also in Portugal, EDP has continued the installation of ecological flow release devices, expected in 26 hydropower plants. On the advice of the Portuguese Environmental Association, the installation is done according to an experimental methodology which considers the specificities of each dam and the rivers where they implanted. AMBER Project Through its assets in operation in Tanes-Rioseco, EDP is establishing a partnership with the University of Oviedo for the AMBER Project (Adaptative Management of Barriers in European Rivers), funded by the European Union and under the Water Framework Directive. The aim of the project is to more efficiently manage the impact of river fragmentation, by mapping dams and other existing barriers and designing an adaptative management strategy for them (http://amber.international). The high hydrologic index in Portugal (36% of hydropower generation up on 2015; page 136 and 137) Water Usage and Waste Production and the shut-down of group 2 of the Soto de Ribera Thermal Power Plant in Spain contributed to lower 10,14 volumes of water collected for the refrigeration circuits 9,22 (14% down on 2015), offsetting the entire first year of 6,19 6,04 generation at the Pecém Thermal Power Plant in Brazil. 0,89 0,48 0,34 0,36 The water used in the refrigeration circuits amounts to 99.6% (page 136) of the total volume of water used for thermoelectric generation. The refrigeration water is 2013 2014 2015 2016 subsequently returned to the environment with increased Waste Production (t/MWh) Specific Fresh Water Usage (10 x m /GWh) temperature, complying with the limits set in the respective environmental licences. All effluents are treated and discharged. In 2016 there was a decrease in the volume of discharged effluents, both into the marine environment (-13%) due to the reduction in thermoelectric generation in the Iberian Peninsula, and into inland and estuarine waters (-61%), due to the shut-down of group 2 of the Soto de Ribera Thermal Power Plant which, with semi-open circuit, collected and discharged large quantities of river water. The specificities of these plants can be consulted at www.edp.pt > sustainability > Publications > Sustainability Management Approach. The Pecém Power Plant in Brazil, in the State of Ceará, is located in an area of water stress. Aware of this situation, EDP has sought to implement circuit optimisation initiatives to reduce the collection of this resource. A project undertaken in 2016 resulted in a decrease of about 12% in water consumption, enhancing the cooling of boilers through chemical stabilisation applied in cooling towers. Responsible consumption and efficient management measures are ongoing practices guaranteed under the Environmental Management Systems in place at the various Group companies. 100 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 With regard to office buildings, in addition to the fitting of automatic taps with motion sensors and dual toilet flush systems, online telemetering was implemented in 2016 for buildings in Portugal, which helps avoid losses and optimise consumption. In Brazil, systems to collect rainwater entered into operation on the roofs of the Peixe Angical Hydropower Plant buildings, and in the EDP Bandeirante office building in Mogi das Cruzes increasing the volume of water collected from the existing system. Under the generation activity in Portugal, a number of initiatives were undertaken in 2016 to promote the efficient management of resources, among them the decrease of water consumption, leading to a decrease in costs estimated at more than 52,000 Euros per annum. The CDP Water report has been published annually since 2008, describing in greater detail the ongoing initiatives. This report is available at www.edp.pt> sustainability> environment> water> water disclosure project. Biodiversity EDP has a clear Policy on Biodiversity that seeks to achieve a global positive balance as a result of the impact of its activity. Our action focuses on four main areas: • Ecosystemic and adaptive management approach to impact minimisation; • Long term vision; • Promotion of knowledge production; • Reporting transparency. The long-term and adaptive management assumptions, based on the active engagement of stakeholders and the aim of achieving a No Net Loss (NNL) and/or Net Positive Impact (NPI) in biodiversity, are enshrined in the management of the new hydropower plants. Here, the minimisation of impact is managed on the assumption of the life cycle of the projects (between 75 and 80 years) and the close engagement of local stakeholders (including universities, environmental NGOs, landowners, etc.). This management approach of the impact on biodiversity is particularly relevant for hydropower plants located in areas of conservation interest, given their level of endemism and the existence of endangered species. An example of some of these areas affected by EDP developments is the Natura 2000 Network in Europe and the biomes of the Amazon, the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado in Brazil. In all instances where impacts might be significant, EDP promotes a set of mitigation measures (minimisation, offsetting) and monitoring programmes. During the operation of generation plants, this approach is integrated into the environmental management systems, largely certified to Standard 14001:2004 (page 17). 101 In 2016, the following management and offsetting initiatives of relevance in terms of impacts on biodiversity in the production activity are worth mentioning: New hydropower plants In Portugal, in the Baixo Sabor plant, the implementation of the compensatory measures programme of targeting impacts on Peixe Angical HPP Brazil biodiversity was completed across a wide number of actions distributed over 17 integrated management territorial units The environmental and behavioural covering a total of 27,163 ha. Currently under operation, an monitoring studies of the Boto (Inia Integrated Environmental Monitoring Plan (IEMP) is underway geoffrensis) contribute to increasing assessing the effectiveness of the CMs in place and all the knowledge on the ecology of this environmental descriptors required by the Environmental Impact species. In 2016, the scientific team Statement (EIS). In the Foz Tua plant, the implementation of the responsible for the study was programme of compensatory measures targeting biodiversity is recognised with the publication of a underway in accordance with the planned actions. scientific paper (Water Spouting by Botos (Inia geoffrensis): A Risky The “Junto à Terra” project, as a school community awarenessBehaviour? / Araújo-Wang, Claryana; raising and engagement initiative for the municipalities covered Wang, John Y. Aquatic Mammals; by the reservoirs of these two adjacent territories, started the first Moline 42.4 (2016): 542-544.), of three consecutive academic years (from 2016/2017 to available from 2018/2019) to implement the project in the Baixo Sabor https://doi.org/10.1578/AM.42.4.2016 municipalities. In 2016, the work focused essentially on the .542 planning and designing of pedagogical and teaching tools together with local stakeholders. EDP Produção, through the Faculty of Science at Lisbon University (FCUL), continued the pilot project to minimise the impact and control the erosive effects at the land and water level variation band of the Salamonde and Caniçada reservoirs, since they are subject to daily water level variations. This R&D project was inspired by the physiology and ecology of the biological crusts, under a Natural Infrastructure approach for the search/use of solutions based on nature to address issues related to the use and availability of the water natural resource. In Brazil, although EDP has no control over the management of the Santo António do Jari or Cachoeira Caldeirão hydropower plants in the state of Amapá, or the São Manuel plant, it is actively involved in mitigation and monitoring their impact on biodiversity. In Spain, EDP Renováveis and Fundación EDP continued the red kite (Milvus milvus) radiolabelling work and conservation programme at the Community of Castilla y León (www.edpr.com> sustainability at EDPR> environmental commitment> environmental initiatives). In Portugal, in the area of forest fire protection, fuel management actions are being undertaken until 2018 in sections of Power Lines and Wind Farms, covering an approximate area of 900ha, distributed over some 60 EDP Renováveis infrastructure facilities located from North to South of the mainland. In order to protect their priority habitats, through a partnership with the Portuguese authority for biodiversity and forests (ICNF), similar actions are being undertaken in forest perimeters located in Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) of the Natura 2000 Network (www.edpr.com> sustainability at EDPR> environmental commitment> environmental initiatives). EDP Spain, through the Fundación EDP, and in cooperation with the Fundación Oso de Asturias and others, as well as the involvement of the communities, continued habitat improvement actions for bears, namely tree plantations and the release of alevins into Asturian rivers (see Report of the EDP Foundation, www.fundacionedp.es> institutional publications). Under the AMBER (Adaptative Management of Barriers in European Rivers) Project, EDP is establishing a partnership with the University of Oviedo to help mitigate the impact on biodiversity resulting from the fragmentation of European rivers (page 100). 102 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Within the distribution activity in Portugal, the protection of wild birds kept its main focus on the correction of power lines considered by the Technical Assessment Commission for Power Lines and Birds (CTALEA) as having a potential impact on these species (see Biodiversity Report 2013-2014 available from www.edp.pt> sustainability> publications), under the: • National Specific Programme for Wild Birds (PENAS), over a length of 39km; • LIFE Initiative of the European Commission; Life Imperial (http://lifeimperial.lpn.pt), over a length of about 17km of lines, and LIFE Rupis (www.rupis.pt), over a length of about 5.5km. EDP Distribuição collaborated with EDP Produção in the matter of the compensatory measures for the Foz Tua (FTHPP) Hydropower Plant which provides for the correction of MV/HV power lines located near Bonelli’s eagle nests in the Tua Valley Nature Park. The VII Protocol on Wild Birds was defined and approved focusing on validation actions of the electrocution risk maps of critically endangered species (e.g. The golden eagle -Aquila chrysaetos) and the bustard collision maps, as well as the preparation of the risk maps for species not included in previous protocols on wild birds, such as the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). EDP Biodiversity Chair – 2012-2016 EDP has supported the EDP Biodiversity Chair since 2009, in partnership with the Foundation for Science and Technology and the University of Porto, with the aim of promoting scientific knowledge to help manage impacts on biodiversity resulting from the activity of electric power generation. In the 2012-2016 period, intensive applied research, advanced training and knowledge dissemination activity was undertaken, based on the following research lines: (i) conservation biology; (ii) fragmentation ecology; (iii) long-term ecological research; and (iv) evaluation, mitigation and monitoring of impacts. To date, the Chair has contributed to science in the following ways: • the creation of a research group devoted to applied ecology (ApplEcol), with 12 PhD researchers, 15 PhD students, and 10 research assistants and technicians; • the production of 59 scientific papers in relevant fields for assessment, offsetting and monitoring of environmental impacts; • the wide dissemination of scientific outcomes through 69 presentations at national and international events, including guest addresses on the Chair itself; • the consolidation of the LTER Sabor site as an exemplary global case of the involvement of a large company in a long-term ecological research; • the advanced training of 6 researchers in initial post-doctoral phases, 16 PhD students and 5 masters’ students. Air Emissions One of the most significant aspects of the EDP Group’s activity is the emission of air pollutants resulting from the combustion process. The main pollutant emissions are NOx, SO2 and Particles. These are regularly monitored so as to check compliance with the values established in current law. The increase in the generation portfolio based on renewable sources and the use of gas treatment systems contributes significantly to the reduction of the specific emissions of these gases. EDP continues to invest in the continuous 103 improvement of gas treatment systems in order to ensure compliance with the best European standards in terms of air emissions, notably: • EDP's first de-nitrification facility in Spain, built in Group 2 of the Aboño Thermal Power Plant, and the start of the installation works of a gas de-nitrification plant in Group 3 of Soto de Ribera; • In Portugal, in what concerns the catalytic de-nitrification facilities (SCR) at the Sines Thermal Power Station, the periodical replacement of the catalysers (coming to the end of their service life) has been started, being carried out during the major overhaul of the power generation groups. Works in the de-sulphurisation systems at this same plant have also been done during the overhaul of two of its power generation groups (groups 1 and 2). These improvements total 42 million Euros in investments and costs. In 2016, there was a significant reduction in the total emissions of NOx, SO2 and Particles (page 135) as a result of a lower use of electricity generation from coal-fired power stations, and, concerning NOx, the installation of de-nitrification in group 2 of the Aboño Thermal Power Plant.

This study found that some 90% of waste and by-products generated by operations in Portugal are re-used. In the figures below, the main materials used in EDP Produção and EDP Distribuição, based on 2014 data, may be observed. Characterization of the main Characterization of the main materials used in EDP Distribuição materials used in EDP Produção Stone (5,7 Mt) Stone (21 Mt) Sand (2 Mt) Sand (6 Mt) Ferrous metals (2 Mt) Clay (1 Mt) Non-ferrous metals Cement (1 Mt) (0,04 Mt) Cement (0,4 Mt) Other minerals (1 Mt) Light metals (0,12 Mt) Ferrous metals (0,7 Mt) 104 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Waste materials management at EDP follows the procedures of the Environmental Management Systems whereby the the aim is to reduce its generation and its harmfulness at source, as well as increase the percentage of waste for recovery. Under this management, EDP regularly raises its employees’ and contractors’ awareness, enhancing their knowledge about applicable Portuguese legislation, and internal procedures. Electricity generation activities account for most of EDP’s total waste generation. A notable case is coal-fired power plants since they generate large amounts of fly ash and slag, resulting from combustion, and gypsum from the desulphurisation process. In Spain, EDP continued to develop the process in 2016, to achieve the status of by-product for coal fly ash and slag. The total amount of waste transported to its final destination totalled 456,000 tonnes, meaning a reduction of 29% over 2015, which was mainly due to a lower use of thermal coal electricity generation (page 136 and 137). The activities of electricity and gas distribution service provision and the new production plants generate waste. Since these are the responsibility of the service provider, they are also accounted for by EDP. In the building sites of the new hydropower plants more than 62 thousand tonnes were transported to their final destination, 99.8% of which was for recovery. Waste that deserves a particular mention includes equipment contaminated by PCBs, at concentrations of less than 500 ppm. Under the current regulations, PCB equipment may remain in operation until the end of its service life. EDP, however, has been anticipating its disposal, giving priority to this type of equipment under its replacement plans. In 2016, 86 tonnes of waste containing PCBs were transported to their final destination (page 136). Prevention and Emergency Response EDP’s premises have emergency plans listing possible risks, and outlining how to act and the means available on site. Employees and service providers are made aware of these practices and the scenarios are regularly tested by emergency drills (page 118). Several minor spills have occurred, mainly within distribution, which mostly resulted from vandalism. When detected, the sites were properly confined, and spill containment procedures were carried out until the arrival of the cleaning team, with no environmental damage having been observed. As prevention, EDP also has near-accident identification and handling procedures in place aimed at preventing and minimising any negative impact. In 2016, 82 environmental near misses were recorded. 105 7. Stakeholders Stakeholder management is an exercise in demand, sharing and transparency of businesses in their relationship with society and in particular with all those that have an impact on, or are impacted by business activities. The involvement of stakeholders in the EDP Group is a strategic priority for maintaining an open, transparent dialogue with all those to whom the business is related. Building and strengthening relationships of trust, sharing knowledge and relevant information, anticipating challenges and identifying new opportunities for cooperation are the main goals of the EDP Group's Stakeholder Relationship Policy. EDP invests in frank relations with its stakeholders, believing that it improves its performance, anticipates and manages risks, and creates value for the various stakeholders in all the geographies in which it operates. To this end, the commitment of the EDP Group's business units, which seek to know their stakeholders and the relevant, critical issues for them, has been fundamental, guaranteeing relationship channels and drawing up action plans that address identified risks and that meet the expectations of the relationship. EDP's Executive Board of Directors approved the EDP Group's Stakeholder Management Methodology, entrusting the Boards of Directors of its subsidiaries with the establishment of the internal rules that formalise the adoption of this methodology and the appointment of a department responsible for the core function of Stakeholder Management. Currently, all the Group's business units have assigned the responsibility for the management of stakeholders to a specific department, which liaises with the Corporate Department responsible for the relationship with stakeholders at Group level. EDP's aim is to achieve excellence in its relationship with its stakeholders, and it has been working on a strategy based on, and noted for, proactive listening to what interests and concerns all those to whom it relates. In this sense, consulting processes of external stakeholders are regularly encouraged to allow those with whom companies interact to be heard, both at the level of the business unit activities and at the institutional level. This listening, that is dynamic and complementary with other channels, allows us to evaluate, among other things, the existing relationship model and propose possible improvements. 106 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 2016 was marked by the development and roll-out of the first EDP Group Integrated Stakeholder Management Plan, which consolidated the stakeholder plans developed by all the Group's business units, and represents an important tool in the strategic management of the Company's Stakeholders. The proactive disclosure of information on relevant, critical issues was one of the great designs of the macro stakeholder engagement initiatives undertaken in 2016. It was also in 2016 that the full implementation of the stakeholder management methodology was completed in all geographies, marked by the conduct of stakeholder consultation processes by EDP Renováveis, EDP Brasil and EDP Spain, the results of which were shared with the Boards of Directors of the respective business units, as well as with the Group's Stakeholder Management Committee, chaired by the CEO of EDP. EDP has also been strengthening its internal procedures through the implementation of cross-cutting methodologies, particularly where they affect the involvement with local communities within EDP projects. The challenges for the EDP Group for 2017 include carrying out a new proactive consultation campaign, aimed at deepening the knowledge about the main expectations of the relationships with the most strategic EDP stakeholders, anticipating critical issues in the relationship, and giving feedback to the business and to the Company through the publication of the 3rd Stakeholders Report. The following pages present the results for the segments that have a central role in the business. Also notable are certain operational initiatives aimed at strengthening the relationship with some of the different segments of EDP Group stakeholders. 7.1. Employees EDP Group's Human Resources strategy consists of fostering the continuous development and improvement of all its employees and their alignment with corporate values and culture, contributing to the sustainability of the business across all Group companies. It is implemented through the culture, the senior managers and the employees themselves, and through the creation of a unique experience throughout the employee's life focusing on the critical moments of their professional career: • Attracting and recruiting; • Developing and creating mobility opportunities; • Managing performance and reward; • Fostering diversity and inclusion and the employees’ engagement. In terms of the strategic agenda, 2016 was marked by the successful closure of the deployment of the Human Resources Strategic Plan the Corporate People Plan 2014-2016, the design of a new plan – the Corporate People Plan 2016-2020 -, in line with EDP’s Business Plan. The implementation of the projects and initiatives under the Corporate People Plan 2014-2016 provided an opportunity to work on key hard components which today place the Human Resources practices of the EDP Group amongst the best in the market. Progress was made in people management technologies and systems, the globalisation of programmes, practices and procedures and the construction of a people management philosophy shared by all Group businesses and geographies. Looking forward, the Corporate People Plan 2016-2020 addresses contemporary and transformational challenges in people management, envisioning the support of global evolution of the business by transforming leadership and performance and development models, within an increasingly digital workplace. This strategic plan comprises three core 107 axes – (1) generational renewal, (2) leadership transformation, and (3) talent growth -, and two supporting axes – (4) the ongoing search for efficient processes and decisions, and (5) the development of the job profiles of the Human Resources team. The return on investment of the strategic initiatives defined under this plan will be measured by means of 3 key tools – the people scorecard (specific indicators and metrics), the study of engagement and external recognition and assessments. EDP publishes an annual Social Report detailing its strategic plan, management model and the different implementation initiatives, which is available at www.edp.pt> about EDP> human resources> EDP's social reports. In 2016, the EDP Group had 11,992 employees, 1% down on 2015 (12,084). This decrease reflects staff inflows (722) and outflows (814), with different impacts according to the businesses and geographies in which EDP operates. By and large, the number of employees in Portugal, Spain and Brazil remained stable or decreased slightly, and the number of employees in those geographies where the EDP Renováveis business is more active predominantly the United States increased visibly. In Portugal, the balance was -146 employees, driven by the decline in recruitment needs for the energy distribution and generation businesses, caused by the technological changes in the sector, the implementation of initiatives focused on operational efficiency, and the high number of natural reforms. In Brazil, the annual variation in the number of employees is residual (-11), despite a high turnover rate (10%) arising from the country’s cultural and legal specifics. Most recruitment activity had to do with staff replacements, the set-up of the solar business and the acquisition of the company APS Soluções em Energia (+46). In Spain, the headcount increased by 1% (23 employees), for which recruitment for EDP Renováveis and the companies related to the trading activity (EDP Comercializadora SA and EDP Soluciones Comerciales SA) contributed. In the United States of America, EDP increased its staff by 39 employees with the growth of the renewable energy business which involved the acquisition of new wind farms. Of the total 11,992 Group employees, 11,874 (99%) are permanent staff, 65 are on fixed-term contracts and 53 are executive directors. In 2016, EDP’s workforce was composed of employees from 40 nationalities with an average age of 45 years and is distributed geographically as follows: Employees distribution by Employees distribution by age geography (#11,992) group (#) Portugal (54%) 1.527 907 Spain (16%) Brazil (25%) 4,074 4.003 North America (3%) 396 1.085 Rest of Europe (2%) < 30 [30-49] > 50 Male Female 108 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 2016 continued to mark an outflow due to retirement/early retirement. Of the total 814 employees who left the company, 41% was due to early retirement (253) or to natural old age or invalidity retirement (83). With regard to early retirement, the high number is explained by the fact that the employees had reached eligibility, this being a right that combines age and seniority, resulting from the generational renewal which occurred in 1976-1983. Reasons for leaving (%) Eligible emplyees for retirement End of fixed-term (#) contracts (3%) Terminated by mutual agreement (3%) Terminated by employee 2.947 (17%) Dismissals (28%) Early retirement (31%) 222 174 1.999 703 149 106 409 Age / invalidity retirement (10%) Senior Supervisors Specialists Technicians Management Other reasons for 0 to 5 years 5 to 10 years leaving (8%) Over the next 10 years, approximately 4,000 employees could leave the company due to retirement and early retirement. In order to help these employees prepare for the transition to retirement, EDP has been improving the design of a programme focused on such aspects as physical and mental health, active life in retirement and how to manage this stage of life financially. In 2016, the concept was subject proof of concept, which began in 2015 with a pilot programme, and this will enable us to consolidate the broad application of the programme in 2017. EDP also maintains a constructive, collaborative attitude towards the official authorities and the workers’ representatives Workers’ Councils and Trade Unions. There are local teams in all geographies to ensure contact and engagement with the various bodies. In the EDP universe, 45.3% of employees are unionised (page 139 and 141). Attracting and recruiting In 2016, EDP continued to focus on its position as a global employer brand within a dynamic and outreach approach to students who have the profile the Group wishes to attract. Below are some of the initiatives undertaken in this field: Promotion E-networking partnerships Competition Development Dissemination of initiatives and Bringing candidates closer opportunities within the EDP Group, Stimulating the development of skills to the labour market Dissemination and sharing of experience increasingly through a digital focus; amongst the university, technical and through traineeships; and knowledge with the academic community; professional populations for the Presence in 27 jobshops; development of energy-related projects; 971 traineeships allocated; 40% of new hires for the permanent 43 EDP Group partner universities; 1,458 students involved in university Launch of the 3rd edition of staff via LinkedIn. 12 Open Days. competitions. the EDP Trainee Programme. 109 3rd Edition of the EDP Trainee Programme The EDP Trainee Programme is a challenge for young people of high potential based on 3 key pillars: Job rotation on a global scale, continuous learning and development of challenging projects. In the 2016 edition, 40 trainees were recruited, 60% more than in the previous edition, from 12 different nationalities and with a gender balance (45% female) and diverse backgrounds. Developing At EDP, employee development is understood as an integrated cycle, which starts on their first working day at the company and is fostered over time, leveraged by a transparent and constructive evaluation model. In this context, in the 2016 training and capacity building and knowledge management initiatives, the skill assessment model and the Group’s internal mobility project were of particular interest. Training and capacity building For EDP, pursuing a permanent individual and collective learning culture focusing on the personal and professional qualification and development of its employees is a mechanism to achieve the Human Resource strategy, highlighting its position on the importance of investing in the Development of its Human Capital. As such, the company seeks, through the 7 schools in its Corporate University (EDP University UEDP), to develop its employees’ skills, enable the sharing of knowledge generated within the Group, and ensure the advancement of the skills that guarantee the sustainability of its business in the 14 geographies in which it operates. SCHOOL INITIATIVES The “Global Leadership Program”, whose aim is to develop middle managers within the EDP Group, was promoted in partnership with an internationally renowned business school. The participants were given the opportunity to deepen their knowledge and skills in business, finance, strategy and leadership, as well as in people management. “Meaningful Conversations” is a programme started in 2016 which will run into 2017, whose aim is to encourage a Management Development meritocratic and transparent culture, and ongoing feedback. Participants had the opportunity to develop the appropriate School attitudes and skills for conducting and managing meaningful conversations that enhance performance differentiation and development opportunities. The “Lead Now Program” was designed to develop new leaders at the EDP Group, who were undertaking the responsibility for managing people for the first time. It is a leadership and management skill development programme, in line with the Amplify model. In 2016, workshops were organised for all graduate staff on innovative and disruptive topics, e.g. the workshops “OTGEN – The role of solar power in Portugal” and “Data Analytics to support the generation business”, together with specialisation courses focusing on the specific needs of the Business Unit, such as the “Implementation of Generation Projects” course. Production School For technical staff, in addition to completing the design of the training offered to the “junior” segment, a pilot training was held for the “Senior” segment, called “Maintenance of Hydro and Thermal Power Plants”. With regard to non-O&M technical staff, a cross-cutting training offer was developed for the first time in a workshop format on the topic “Sustainability and Energy Business”. The development of a structured training offer for technical staff continued, focusing on core areas of EDP Distribuição (distribution networks, asset management and dispatch and driving), whereby safety and sustainability remained as critical contents, transversal to the various courses. Bearing in mind that, in managing the national street lighting network, EDP performs an enabling role for all players concerned, the Street Lighting Workshop was organised to provide knowledge on the new technologies in this field and Distribution School strengthen motivation to undertake these responsibilities. Training was delivered in Spain in asset management, focusing on ISO 55000. The focus on e-Learning was reinforced: new courses on Cyber-Security of the Distribution Network Critical Information Structure (rapid learning) and Asset Management. A Teacher Training project for CEM was developed, in partnership with EDP Internacional, more specifically the action “Training for Trainers Low Voltage Live Works”, delivered in Macau and implemented by the Distribution School. 110 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 SCHOOL INITIATIVES The following courses were organised for the Renewables School: • Launch of the online “Strategic Workshop on Climate Change” course, based on videos taken during the workshop for managers, made available on demand to all employees under the same title. Renewables School • The “Business Overview” course was introduced as part of the induction programme for new recruits during the “Welcome Day”. • Delivery of the workshop for European managers under the topic: “Strategic Workshop on EDPR competing companies: strategies in onshore, offshore, solar, funding sources” and the workshop for North American managers based on the topic: “EDPR Over the Next 5 Years – What Should Senior Management be Doing in Order to be Ready to Meet Our Business Goals” A complementary offer was developed for senior managers with “Environment and Safety”, “Gas Contract Negotiation” and “Innovation in Natural Gas Provision” courses, together with the preparation of an advanced “Infrastructure” course. Gas School The final session of the Basic Offer for Senior Managers was held, ending a training cycle for all experts and senior experts in the Gas Business. An Offer for Technicians was launched, comprising four key courses on the value chain, regulations and procedures, infrastructure and environment/safety. An in-depth review of the training offered in the Commercial School was conducted, in line with the current strategy and the critical competences of the EDP Group’s commercial area. The new training offer covers five programmes: “Commercial Business Integration and Specialisation Programme”, “Commercial Capacity Building Programme”, “Marketing Programme”, Comercial School “Commercial Processes and Systems Programme” and “Workshop/Seminar Programme targeting current challenges in the Commercial Area”. Under this review, the pilot course “Digital Transformation” was held, focusing on one of the themes with the most impact on society today, giving the participants the opportunity to get acquainted with the main concepts of the digital universe from a corporate/business perspective and a client/user perspective. Launch of the Ulectures, whose first speaker was António Mexia. This is a new format in the EDP University for delivering 1.5h sessions with internal or external guest tutors, on current topics or other topics of interest to the EDP population. The “Strategic Innovation” workshop was organised with John Litman, the author of “Ten Faces of Innovation”, as the main speaker. The “Mindfulness” component was introduced into the “Management of Stress and Well-Being” courses, aimed at helping EDP School develop mindfulness and full attention skills, enabling better management of ideas, emotions and attention. The training on the Behavioural Area was stepped up. The School’s training offer was reviewed through its structuring by programmes and having in mind the employee’s entire life cycle. In 2016, UEDP, as a Corporate University of the EDP Group, obtained International Certification by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), under the Corporate Learning Improvement Process Accreditation (CLIP). It should be noted that there are only 20 accredited Corporate Universities and the EDP University thus becomes the first Corporate University in Portugal to be certified nationally (UEDP has DGERT certification since 2015 for 16 educational and training areas) and internationally, positioning itself as a reference Corporate University worldwide. In 2016, an Advisory Board was also created, comprising prestigious Portuguese and foreign personalities, whose mission is to keep EDP University abreast of the best practices, bringing in an external perspective on training, knowledge management, and the main trends in these fields. In 2016, 390,000 hours of training were delivered at the EDP group, corresponding to a total of about 78,000 participants in more than 5,000 training actions. Acknowledging Knowledge as an intangible asset of the utmost importance for EDP, EDP University, in collaboration with the Group's various companies, launched the Corporate Knowledge Management Project in 2016. The aim of this initiative is to define a cross-cutting Knowledge Management Model for the Group and to adopt systemic critical knowledge retention and transfer practices within the organisation. 111 EDP Sustainability course The EDP School promoted an e-learning training session for all employees in Portugal in the scope of Sustainable Development, resulting in a participation rate of 73%. Over 80% of students evaluated positively the training program, considering it very useful in terms of acquisition of knowledge and awareness of employees for Sustainability, as an essential pillar in the growth of the company in an increasingly globalized and strongly competitive market. In 2017, the course will be adapted to EDP Brasil, EDP Spain and EDP Renováveis. Knowledge Management EDP invests in initiatives to enhance and recognise the knowledge and experience of its most experienced employees, leveraging critical knowledge retention and transfer mechanisms. In this context, the company promoted the Experience Enhancement Programme to identify and disseminate the knowledge and know-how of its employees with over 30 years’ seniority. There were 75 participants in this programme in 2016. The knowledge retention and transfer topic is particularly critical for the sustainability of the traditional generation business, and for this reason EDP has been developing knowledge management initiatives, including the set-up of an online corporate platform for knowledge sharing, managed by EDP University and called LINK – Login to Knowledge; its aim is: • To boost the cycle of acquisition, systematisation and sharing of critical knowledge about the business; • To promote access to, and transfer of tacit knowledge through specialist networks, making it clearer; • To facilitate the employees’ access to critical knowledge through navigation in business settings and transversal searches; • To enhance collaborative knowledge that provides greater adherence by employees to knowledge management initiatives through the recognition of their active input. The first phase of implementation of this pilot was completed and covers the traditional generation business area. The platform can be accessed by all EDP employees, and already includes more than 1,600 contents. Additionally and in a transversal manner, EDP continued to invest in the improvement of core knowledge management tools and their internal communication, an important component of which is the Online Library which had, in 2016, its own document repository with more than 180,000 documents, and over 25 million records that can be consulted by all employees from libraries across the world. 112 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Amplify: EDP Group's Skill Model “Amplify”, the EDP Group's skill model, seeks to align the Sustainability performance indicators development of its employees with the Group’s strategic challenges, in order to contribute to the creation of a global In order to ensure the achievement of the culture and endow the company with the skills that will allow it strategic sustainability goals and to to achieve results in a highly competitive global environment. deepen the EDP culture, taking it to all departments and employees, the “Amplify” is a development cycle which includes an analysis of Executive Board of Directors approved, in skills, feedback and the building of an Individual Development Plan (IDP), processes based on a new global inter-geography 2016, the generalization of Key platform for Human resource management – about.me.

By 2017, sustainability indicators will be As global results, the skills with the highest ratings in the various developed in order to extend the geographies, under the Employee segment, are Excellence in assignment of specific goals to individual Performance, Openness and Transparency and Collaboration and employees. Networking. The skills in need of development are Curiosity and Self-Development, Initiative and Proactivity and ProblemSolving. Under the leadership segment, the highest ratings were given to Openness and Transparency, Executive Maturity and Building of Partnerships. The skills with more scope for enhancement are Management of Innovation, People Development and Organisational Change. In order to strengthen these skills, the EDP Group’s employees drafted 5,069 Individual Development Plans, subsequently validated by senior managers. This means that about 47% of the structure prepared an IDP in its first year of implementation. Switch – Mobility as a Development Instrument The presence of the EDP Group in different business units of the sector’s value chain and in various geographies poses challenges and opportunities for its employees. In this context, professional mobility is one of the main on-the-job development tools offered by the EDP Group to its employees, promoting the development of new skills and synergies between the Group’s teams and businesses. The Switch Programme provides employees with a more transversal vision of the business, exposing them to new situations and different realities, and preparing them to meet new challenges. On the one hand, it strengthens a technical and work experience component with new learning in different business units and on the other it enhances the development of the formal and informal contact network and the networking process. In 2016, there were 823 long-term mobilities (permanent mobilities) under the Switch Programme, which represented a job/activity change for 7% of the EDP group’s universe of employees. Additionally, there were 31 short-term mobilities of 3 to 6 months (18 in Portugal; 4 in Spain; and 9 in Brazil). Managing Performance and Rewarding Employees The reward and benefit policy of the Group reflects EDP’s values and culture and seeks to continually fine-tune the systems to ensure the principles of internal equity and external competitiveness, respecting the agreements made at all levels of the relationship with employees and/or their representative bodies. 113 Salary ratio F/M by professional category Ratio EDP minimum / national miminum wage 1,13 1,09 1,09 2,34 1,03 1,04 0,96 0,99 1,01 2,24 0,90 0,91 0,90 0,88 0,93 0,89 2,03 0,87 1,87 0,81 0,78 0,79 0,78 0,73 1,95 1,60 1,54 1,54 1,40 1,58 1,42 1,49 1,42 1,40 1,31 1,31 Portugal Spain Brazil USA Rest of Europe 2013 2014 2015 2016 Technicians Specialists Portugal Spain Brazil USA Supervisors Senior Management Fostering Diversity and Inclusion In 2016, EDP strengthened its culture of diversity and inclusion by implementing various measures approved in the 2015 3-year Action Plan. Under this topic there were initiatives on the four dimensions to be addressed: Gender, Disabilities, Generations and Nationalities, as follows: • Training on Unconscious Bias for the team of HR professionals in Portugal, mainly those with a direct impact on the recruitment and selection of candidates; • Ensuring gender equality in the Trainee Programme, as well as the incorporation of candidates from 12 different nationalities; • Evaluation of the accessibility and mobility conditions of EDP buildings (starting with the headquarters building in Porto), which had a very positive result; • Mapping positions with the possibility of being assigned to a disabled employee in Portugal and Brazil and active search by EDP Brasil for disabled candidates for job vacancies; • Workshops conducted in Portugal and Spain (EDP Renováveis) to encourage young women to choose STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses, with a particular emphas is on engineering, with close mentoring by various female employees in the company; • New Parent Kit, intended to structure and consolidate relevant information for this stage in the employees’ lives, including information on benefits, rights and duties of future and new parents. Employees distribution by professional category (#) 1.100 1.351 5.350 155 223 2,644 0 8 578 583 Executive Senior Supervisors Specialists Technicians Board of Management Directors Male Female 114 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Globally, the number of women increased by 1% over 2015, representing in 2016 24% of the Group’s total staff. The presence of women in managerial posts increased to 24%, a growth from 25% to 28% in the management segment. In generational terms, there was a significant increase in the Y generation, which already accounts for 30% of the organisation; this was partly due to the recruitment effort made, particularly in Portugal, and also to employees retiring, with the Baby Boomers generation now accounting for 36% of the organisation. The average age of the Group’s employees is 45 years (page 108). With regard to the commitments undertaken, EDP joined the group of 79 companies in 2016 that adopted diversity as an ethical imperative, by signing the Portuguese Charter on Diversity, and renewing its commitment to IGEN, which strives for the development of internal measures and policies that foster Gender Equality within Companies. EDP Spain has also undertaken the commitment to sign the Charter de la Diversidad, following the example of the 802 companies that have also done so. Conciliar Conciliar is a multi-geography programme (in place in Portugal, Spain and Brazil) of an operational nature, which is part of the Diversity and Inclusion area. The programme’s mission is to promote the development and improvement of the quality of employees' lives, fostering a balance and reconciliation between the various plans in their lives (professional, family and social) so as to contribute to a culture of diversity and inclusion within the EDP Group. The aims of the programme are the promotion of measures covering the different employee segments and generations, ensuring that measures are applied in a decentralised manner and encouraging the active engagement of employees in their development and use (including senior managers). In 2016, these measures included: • Global Meetings in all geographies, resulting in 27 measures, 18 good practices and 6 challenges shared by the teams managing the programme locally; • Dissemination sessions of the Programme in Portugal (21 sessions in 16 localities for over 900 employees) and in Brazil; • The launch of the programme newsletter in Portugal, to reach out to employees all over the country and provide monthly updates; • Initiatives for more than 450 descendants of employees in Portugal (children and grandchildren) to put them in touch with the business and the company’s activities; • The extension of the Workplace Gymnastics measure to the 15 largest buildings in Lisbon, Porto and Coimbra (Portugal) impacting more than 3,000 employees; • The support for more than 170 new parents for birth and adoption in Portugal; • The implementation of a new discount/protocol platform for Portugal and Spain; • The launch of the “edp es saludable” Programme at EDP Spain to promote healthy habits in nutrition, sports and health; • The reinforcement/structuring of the assistance services programme for employees in Spain and Brazil; • The introduction of the “Sport Aid” measure at EDP Renováveis to promote a healthy lifestyle through financial allowances for employees to attend gyms. In Portugal and Spain, this programme has contributed since 2011 to the certification as a “Family Responsible Company” granted by the Fundación Másfamilia. In 2016, EDP followed up on and monitored the measures that lead to this certification, and also sought to incorporate suggestions for improvement that arose from the 2015 audit. 115 Organisational Climate Following the changes introduced in 2015 in the study of the organisational Climate, diversifying the range of dimensions assessed and improving alignment with best practices in the market, it was possible for each team to structure action plans based on their results, and for corporate plans to be drawn up covering the entire Group. In this way, the main aim of the Follow-up: Climate Study 2016 was to provide data that enabled a review and reassessment of Satisfaction study result (%) established plans, therefore focusing on the two most global dimensions: the level of involvement of employees in the company (engagement) and their perception about organisational support 73 74 74 74 (enablement). In 2016, the study involved 89% of EDP Group 72 employees, and found that 74% felt engaged in the company, and 70% had a strong perception about organisational support. 70 70 Additionally, the EDP Group presents results that are virtually aligned with (in the case of enablement) or even exceed (in the case of 67 engagement) the results of high performance companies which set a benchmark in the reference market. This data continues to reflect our employees' strong level of satisfaction, so in order to continue improving, specific plans across the entire Group are needed, as is Engagement Enablement the case of the three corporate action strands which are being implemented. Female Male Global Reference level CORPORATE ACTION PLANS Well-Being, Health and Safety EDP evaluates every year its performance in the light of the strategic goal: “Zero accidents”. To ensure compliance with this commitment, EDP has built EDP Comercial a culture of prevention and safety, promoting safety practices as stated in its Occupational Health and Safety Policy, applicable to employees and Certified the integrated service providers. management of the environment and safety, EDP has a Corporate Occupational Health and Safety Management System covering all employees and in place (SGSC), based on the OHSAS 18001 standard, which abides by the activities. International Labour Organisation’s guidelines expressed in internal rules of procedure. EDP is also certified for generation activities (94% of net capacity installed), the power distribution activity (29% of transformation power) and the gas sector (100% of the activity), which covers 33% of employees. The more relevant activities and the company’s commitments are detailed at www.edp.pt> sustainability> occupational health and safety. 116 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Reduction in accidents The implementation of EDP's annual occupational health and safety programme was based on a set of actions aimed at reinforcing the positive safety culture and preventing occupational accidents, reflected by a reduction in the frequency indices and the seriousness of accidents (pages 139 and 141). This programme included training for EDP employees and service providers, the ongoing evaluation and control of labour risks and the implementation of an internal and external inspection and audit programme of EDP facilities and works. Despite the efforts made, there were still 334 work accidents, 185 of which required one or more days of absence from work, among the total EDP employees and service providers. Unfortunately, 3 deadly accidents occurred in Portugal with service providers, which is not compatible with EDP policies and with the efforts made. In this regard, every accident and near-accident is systematically studied aiming to achieve the “zero accidents, no personal harm” objective.

The proactive management of safety at EDP includes an analysis of near-accidents so as to anticipate the occurrence of more serious accidents. In 2016, there were 384 near-accidents whose causes were analysed, and preventive and corrective measures were defined for their control. Outside the company’s scope of activity, there were also 7 deadly accidents of an electrical origin at EDP facilities or with EDP equipment, which involved people unrelated to the activity. These accidents were caused by contact with work equipment on live power lines (5) and access to locations with live electrical equipment that were restricted to authorised workers only (2), for the purpose of theft or vandalism. 117 Training and Awareness-Raising EDP promotes regular awareness-raising and training actions for employees and service providers, so that they can fulfil their tasks under safe conditions. In 2016, a total of 16,735 training actions were delivered, corresponding to 397,132 hours, and involving 61,925 employees and service providers. Preparedness for Emergency Response In the management of emergency situations, 431 drills were carried out (72 in Portugal, 93 in Spain, 66 in Brazil, 95 in the USA and 105 in the rest of Europe), in various industrial and administrative facilities and ongoing works, whose aim was to test the effectiveness of the respective emergency plans. These drills involved external agencies, such as civil protection, fire fighters and police and public security forces. Sustainability Performance Indicators In 2016, in order to ensure compliance with the strategic sustainability goals and deepen EDP’s culture, extending it to all departments and employees, the Executive Board of Directors approved the application of the Key Sustainability Performance Indicators to the entire EDP Group and to each business unit and respective areas. For 2017, the sustainability indicators will be developed so as to extend the allocation of specific targets to individual employees. 7.2. Customers The supply of energy and services increasingly require greater customer orientation, with special focus on the continuous improvement of the customer experience to ensure their maximum satisfaction. The EDP Group closed the year with 9.8 million electricity and 1.5 million gas customers (page 84). Customer Satisfaction In collaboration with certified external entities, customers are consulted about the quality of the services provided and their experience during the service through surveys based on a set of satisfaction macro-indicators: with Energy Supply (electricity and/or gas), with the Service and Overall Satisfaction.

In 2016, the overall satisfaction reached 76.3%, above the 75.8% annual target. An Iberian-wide programme was implemented in 2016, Voice of Customer (VoC), which collects immediate feedback from customers after they contact the company via any of the telephone, personal, digital and technical channels. This information helps to gauge the levels of satisfaction and how likely they are to recommend the company, and to measure the performance of EDP channel operators, so that improvements can be made to internal procedures. 119 Customer Relationship The diversity of customer segments and market offerings implies the existence of a range of streamlined and focused communication channels, so that the company can respond with quality and efficiency to customers’ requests. Throughout 2016, Cliente edp 365, an internal programme whose aim is to strengthen EDP’s position in the commercial area in Portugal, continued to promote the development of initiatives in the following axes: development of a broad portfolio of competitive and innovative offers, continuous improvement of the customer experience, reinforcement of the integrated communication channel and partnership strategy to improve service quality, focus on an excellent organisational performance and promotion of greater efficiency and controlled risk. Over the last few years, there has been a strong focus on the diversification of contact channels and the promotion of digitalisation. EDP provides a portfolio of digital platforms, which have seen continuous improvement in 2016 in terms of features and usability, leading to higher levels of subscription, use and satisfaction. A new Comunidade EDP website (comunidade.edp.pt) was launched, enhanced with new content, campaigns, pastimes, partners and benefits for customers in Portugal. The platform enables customers to enjoy exclusive advantages in a simple way and free of charge. In 2016 it had around 582,000 subscribers in Portugal. In Portugal and Spain, EDP has focused on improving the websites of energy suppliers and the digital edpOnline selfservicing platforms. In addition to the improvement in usability/browsing of the two websites, in Portugal EDP invested in increased contract, servicing and customer information features. It is worth noting the entry into operation of a Helpcentre (organised, interactive information search area), and new offers, campaigns, simulator and form areas. The website was distinguished, among others, with the best site.pt award by ACEPI (page 25). The digital edpOnline Self-Servicing platform in Portugal, in its browser version (edponline.pt), improved and diversified its registration, membership, consultation and transaction features. In addition to the consultation of bills and current accounts, consumption history, contract management and communication of readings, users also have access to other features, such as simplified registration, social login and consultation of documents. The App version of edpOnline has grown rapidly both in the number of subscribers and usage. In Spain, the adoption of the Agile Scrum methodology has also reduced time-to-market and enhanced the customer digital experience. In 2016, invoices in Portugal were reformulated, for both residential and business customers, with a new design and clearer information. The e-voicing service reached 2,770 thousand customers, corresponding to an increase of 53% over the previous year. This increase was mainly due to the investment made by the distribution companies of EDP Brasil in promotion campaings of this service, within the scope of a intermunicipal competition. For each 10 electronic bills, EDP will donate a tree, in order to reach 1,030 until the end of 2017. The installation of smart meters increased strongly in 2016, especially in Portugal and Spain, where roughly doubled when compared to the previous year: about 1.2 million units, which corresponds to 18% of Low Voltage delivery points. In Brazil, a number of initiatives have been launched focusing on better access to services and new service channels. The scope of the project includes improvements to the services of Helpdesks, Call centre, Virtual Agency (web), SAP system and mobile service (creation of new channels: application and SMS). In 2016, the Group incurred fines amounting to 3.8 million euros for non-compliance with laws and regulations in its relationship with customers. The highest amount, 3.7 million euros, related to energy supply and the use of products and services. This was mainly due to non-compliance by EDP Brasil with the deadlines set by the regulator (energy cutoff frequency and reconnection). In Spain, EDP paid 3 fines for violation of privacy and loss of customers’ data amounting to 81,000 euros. 120 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 In Portugal, it is pending before the Court of Competition, Regulation and Supervision a feature of judicial review of ERSE’s decision (Energy Services Regulator), applying a fine of 7,500,000 euros to EDP Comercial, for alleged infringement of legal information obligations relating to economically vulnerable customers, particularly in the context of social tariffs and electricity and natural gas ASECE’s benefits (Extraordinary Social Support to Electricity Consumers). During 2016, several developments occurred in the judicial procedure, now waiting the decision by the Court of Competition, Regulation and Supervision. Customer Ombudsman In Portugal, there is an entity, independent from the EDP Group, called the Customer Ombudsman, which assesses Ombudsman's answer orientation cases submitted by customers when the responses to (%) complaints made to the services do not meet their expectations. The Customer Ombudsman has the authority to issue an Concordant (38%) opinion on matters related to energy supply and the provision of services by the EDP companies, including: the Discordant (4%) fulfilment of supply contracts, consumption estimates, billing Partial concordant and claims for damages arising directly from the service (23%) provided. Resolved issues (35%) In 2016, the Customer Ombudsman received 1,982 complaints, 66% of which were related to electricity complaints and 23% to dual contracts. Most complaints (70%) related to Contracts and Reading/Billing/Collection. In terms of the Ombudsman’s procedure and the website (www.provedordocliente.edp.pt), a shorter response time to the customer of 3 working days was achieved in 2016, an improvement for this indicator of more than 23%. Innovating in the customer’s service The energy solutions provided by EDP are intended to meet the specific needs of the various customer segments through a diversified offer of products and services. In 2016, about 93 million euros in revenue was generated, representing an increase of 19% over 2015 (page 142). The following points show some examples of the solutions provided to customer. Products and Services In addition to the offer of energy in Portugal and Spain, EDP has a broad range of other energy solutions and services, most importantly insurance and support, maintenance contracts, audits and energy certifications (www.energia.edp.pt and www.edpenergia.es). 121 A list follows of the latest products and services and/or those that stand out for contributing to a more sustainable use of resources: Portugal EDP Smart Home Heat pumps Energy Bundle + Funciona Integrated solutions for SMEs Solution that incorporates an Energy and energy efficiency solution, Integrated service solution for an Solution for more efficient water installation overhaul and including specific offerings for each efficient use of energy: solar power, heating, including water saving equipment maintenance activity sector: Agriculture, Hospitality electric mobility, batteries and edp devices to reduce consumption. component into the energy and Restaurants, Commerce and re:dy. service.

It should be noted that, Distribution of electricity customers in Spain, electricity supplied to residential customers and by type (%) small businesses has is associated with an assurance of origin from 100% renewable energy. Business customers only have the certificate of origin after applying for it. Under sustainable mobility, in Portugal, EDP launched the Residential (88%) Electrical and Gas Mobility Plan which offers customers who Industrial (1%) acquire an electric vehicle discounts in their energy bills from electric mobility partner brands. Also, the first “Ecostation” for Commercial (7%) alternative energy-based vehicles in Asturias was opened in Agriculture (3%) Gijón (Roces). The facility combines a compressed natural gas filling area (CNG) and a rapid recharging point (50kW) for Others (1%) electric vehicles. In 2016, 70,265kg of CNG were supplied, corresponding to an estimated reduction of 73 tonnes of CO2. In Spain, in the Business and Large Account segments, the focus on fairly mature products and services, such as Integra, Distribution of gas customers by type corrective maintenance, efficient lighting and power factor (%) correction continued in 2016. Additionally, more recent services, such as “Óptima+”, launched in 2015 and showing 75% growth in 2016, have Residential (98%) been consolidated. This service helps companies manage their energy, since they have a real-time consumption evolution Industrial (0%) control and supervision system at their disposal, and it also Commercial (1%) allows the customer to configure active and reactive energy consumption alerts. Agriculture (0%) Others (1%) In Brazil, the integration of APS Soluções em Energia, now EDP Soluções em Energia was completed. The company carries out energy efficiency projects and provides technical and commercial services (www.edp.com.br> Comercialização e Soluções de Energia> Portfólio). 122 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP has also entered the photovoltaic distributed generation market through EDP Solar. In 2016, EDP entered into sales contracts for solar projects amounting to 226kWp of installed capacity. In the different customer segments and geographies, regarding the area of photovoltaic generation services, EDP already installed about 9.3 MW, avoiding the emission of about 3.9 kton of CO2. Promotion of Energy Efficiency In addition to the abovementioned products and services that make up the business portfolio, EDP also supports other energy saving measures, programmes and projects. In Portugal, its participation in the Plan for Promoting Efficiency in Electricity Consumption (PPEC), promoted by the Energy Services Regulator (ERSE), is worth noting. This encourages the implementation of measures for the adoption of consumption habits and more efficient equipment by consumers in the different market segments – residential, Commercial and Services, Industry and Agriculture. In 2016, a new competition was launched to be implemented in 2017-2018. The EDP Group had 19 measures (3 more than in the previous competition) approved, representing 67% of the funding available. It is estimated that the implementation of these measures will allow for savings of roughly 1,157 GWh and a reduction of 428,105 tonnes of CO2, taking into account the service life of the equipment. In the residential segment, measures for promoting efficient lighting, such as the replacement of halogen bulbs with LED technology (about 250,000 units) should be noted, as well as support for the purchase of efficient storage water heaters, heat pumps and flow rate regulators. In the B2B segments those measures that were highly successful under the 20132014 programme were continued, and their funding amount was quickly spent and exceeded by the applications received, including the promotion of improved compressed air supply systems in industrial installations, the replacement of low efficiency motors with high performance motors and the installation of electronic variable speed drives. In the business sector in the Iberian Peninsula, in particular, EDP supports the implementation of energy efficiency projects through the Save to Compete programme, whereby energy consumption reduction measures are identified and their implementation and costing are promoted through the savings generated. Since its launch in Portugal (2012) and Spain (2013), 387 applications have been received. It is estimated that the programme had generated acummulated savings of about 143 GWh by the end of 2016, corresponding to 15.9 million euros of invoice savings, and a reduction of approximately 60,000 tonnes of CO2. The results are accounted for online and can be consulted at the Save to Compete website at (energia.edp.pt> corporate> serviços> save-to-compete). With the transposition of the Energy Efficiency Directive, suppliers in Spain are obliged to achieve annual energy savings equivalent to 1.5% of sales to end customers between 2014 and 2020. In 2016, the companies in the sectors covered contributed financially to the National Energy Efficiency Fund, exceeding the 100 million euros required to finance energy efficiency initiatives. EDP Spain contributed approximately 8 million euros. In Brazil, EDP offers bespoke energy efficiency solutions for businesses on the free market (www.edp.com.br> Comercialização e Soluções de Energia> Portfólio). The following should be noted: B.O.T (Building Operations Transfer) Energy Management System Efficient Lighting Construction, operation and maintenance of final Continuous control of the full consumption of Upgrade of the lighting system, with the energy uses in order to reduce losses and ensure the energy (electricity, gas, water and others) in order installation of more efficient and durable sustainability of the Energy Efficiency actions for to reduce waste. equipment, such as LED or high output contractually defined periods. fluorescent lamps. 123 In 2016, through EDP Soluções em Energia, there were developed 15 energy efficiency projects, corresponding to 45 GWh energy savingsand a reduction of 3,677 tonnes of CO2. Among the new contracts, a project with the Makro supermarket chain was defined in order to implement energy efficiency measures. A number of initiatives were also undertaken, under the Energy Efficiency Programme, in a total investment of R$ 22.78 million, which led to a reduction of 5.7MW in demand at peak times and energy savings of 18.5 GWh, avoiding approximately 1,510 tonnes of CO2. Funds for the programme are used in accordance with the legislation for the Brazilian electricity sector which stipulates that distributors apply 0.4% of their net operating income annually to energy efficiency programmes (0.5% until May 2016). The “Boa Energia nas Escolas” (Good Energy in Schools) initiative, for example, promotes the training of the teaching staff and raises awareness within the school community of the efficient use of energy, through on-site activities and recreational and interactive experiences and visits to the Good Energy Truck which travels to cities where EDP Brasil distribution concessions are located. In 2016, the initiative was the recipient of investments of about R$ 2.09 million. When considering both the Energy Efficiency Programme and the projects of EDP Soluções em Energia, there was energy savings of more than 63 GWh, avoiding about 5 thousand tCO2. Vulnerable Customers One of EDP’s objectives is to ensure a quality service to every customer, with particular focus on the most vulnerable segments. In Portugal, in line with the Group’s Sustainable Development Principles and in compliance with existing legislation, EDP has promoted the adherence of eligible customers to the social tariff and the ASECE (Extraordinary Social Support to Electricity Consumers), through various communication campaigns and initiatives addressed to Private Charities. In 2016, the cross-checking between the Tax Authority and the Social Security data allowed 663 thousand customers (vs. 93 thousand in 2015) to have social tariff. This social support allows a discount of over 30% in the energy bill, mostly supported by EDP. In Spain, in addition to the special tariff created in 2009, EDP entered into agreements with the Local Authorities in some areas to avoid the interruption of energy supply on the grounds of non-compliance and provide advice on energy efficiency, maximising customers’ savings. With the “Energía Solidaria” initiative, Fundación EDP has promoted the well-being and energy efficiency of the most disadvantaged families in the Asturias, Basque Country and Cantabria areas. This project consists of identifying initiatives that could lead to reductions in customers' energy bills by changing consumption habits and implementing energy efficiency measures. In 2016, 77 households and 5 Social Centres were targeted, with a total reduction of 137,210 kWh in annual gas consumption and 57,380 kWh in electricity, and expected savings of EUR 13,745. In Brazil, the electricity social tariff allows for discounts varying in accordance with the conventional tariff established for each company. Since 2010, EDP’s two distributors have partnered with local authorities to encourage the community to formally register for the social tariff. In 2016, 143,502 customers benefited from the the social tariff. Also through its Energy Efficiency Programme, EDP supports low-income customers, while raising their awareness of the efficient consumption of energy. The initiatives “Boa Energia na Comunidade” (Good Energy in the Community), within the EDP Bandeirante, and “Agentes da Boa Energia” (Good Energy Agents) within the EDP Escelsa, are good examples of this. Both target vulnerable customers and encompass guidance on the proper, safe use of electrical power, and the replacement of inefficient equipment. In 2016, they accounted between them for the delivery of 180,272 compact fluorescent lamps, 74 fridges and 1,668 showers with a power controlling system. 124 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 7.3. Suppliers The EDP Group’s sustainable supply chain management plan saw important developments in 2016. The new structures and methodologies addressing the extension of the risk and sustainability analysis to the whole supply chain led to more in-depth procedures and initiatives, notably: • The publication of a new sustainable purchasing area at www.edp.pt > suppliers > sustainable Procurement; • The prototyping of new risk assessment and supplier segmentation methodologies; • The expansion of training, consultation and dialogue activities with suppliers; • The development of new training programmes in sustainability for EDP suppliers and employees; • The drafting of a corporate internal procedure Protocol. The EDP Group leads sustainability management in the supply chain driven by five strategic goals defined in 2016, whose implementation should be fully achieved by 2020: • To reduce, in a systematic manner, the contractors’ and service providers’ accidents; • To protect the Human Rights in the supply chain, according to Ruggie’s methodology – Global Compact; • To audit contractors and service providers with Sustainability risks (Environment, Social and Governance); • To evaluate critical suppliers by Sustainability criteria (ESG); • To assure environmental, security and occupational health certification of suppliers exposed to high risks. EDPartners In 2016, the EDPartners concept was strengthened through workshops promoting regular meetings with suppliers and fostering the sharing of various initiatives within the EDP Self-Billing in the EDP Group universe, associated with the Group’s values of Excellence, The self-billing program, currently covers Innovation and Sustainability with a relevant impact on its supply chain. 800 suppliers, distributed across the various EDP Group companies, accounts for more The presentations addressed topics conducive to the than 200,000 annual invoices.

Learn more at www.edpartners.edp.pt. 125 The business units strengthen the relationship with their critical suppliers by developing various initiatives on Sustainability. A case in point was the II Meeting with EDP Gás Partners, which discussed the themes of Sustainability, Environment and Safety. The partners engaged directly with the meeting and made joint presentations. Specialist meetings with partners are also held, either by segment of activity, as was the case of the meeting on new technologies, or by critical topic, such as the safety meetings and awards in all geographies. EDP strongly invests in Prevention and Safety with its service providers, an example of which is the doubling of the budget for this purpose in Brazil, which rose from R$ 4 million to R$ 8 million, disseminating the EDP Culture among suppliers. The aim of the meeting in São Paulo with suppliers was to extend the 12 principles of action of EDP Brasil to its partners. Audits In 2016 an on-site auditing campaign was launched in partnership with LABELEC and APCER—Associação Portuguesa de Certificação, involving more than 70 critical suppliers to the EDP Group. This activity, which involved Portugal and Spain, essentially seeks to analyse sustainability management information and procedures within EDP’s supply chain, mutually benefiting EDP’s and its suppliers’ risk management. The success of this programme, which focuses on matters such as the environment, occupational health, safety and hygiene, labour issues, strategic alignment and others, shows and develops the commitment of the Global Procurement Unit to its strategic role regarding the Supply Chain Sustainable Management within the EDP Group. Ethics for Suppliers A training programme on EDP Ethics for suppliers began in 2016, aimed at extending EDP’s vision and strategy on Business Ethics to its supply chain. In its initial version, this programme covers more than 6,000 employees of Service Providers who operate on behalf of EDP, provide services within EDP facilities and have access to confidential information on people and the business (page 87). Suppliers and Global Acquisitions In 2016, the acquisition of fuels, the construction of power facilities, the acquisition and maintenance of equipment and the sourcing of services connected to energy distribution and commercial activities were the acquisition categories that continued to define the key profile of the EDP Group’s supply chain. In overall terms, except for the supply of fuels, the EDP Group entered into contracts amounting to 3.2 billion euros with 17,078 suppliers, 2,260 of which made sales in excess of 75,000 euros. Of these, 1,406 were scrutinised regarding their sustainability practices, through the RePro global platform, developed by Achilles, which EDP uses to characterise its suppliers in terms of their environmental, labour, human rights and impact on society practices.

Community EDP voluntarily promotes and supports social, cultural and environmental initiatives with the purpose of contributing to the sustainable development of societies and upholding its strategic vision. EDP explicitly specifies the results that it intends to achieve and the projects in which it is involved using the LBG international methodology (Measuring Community Investment), in which it participates actively through a role on its Steering Group. Using this model, EDP promotes the structured dissemination of its decisions and enables discussion of the results and benefits for communities. All of the Group's business units and foundations use this methodology. The community investment policy is based on three priorities: • Promotion of the EDP Group's engagement in the surrounding environment for improved quality of life of the respective communities. • Support for initiatives that contribute to strengthening each of the dimensions of sustainable development: • Contributing to the recognition and prestige of the Group and to its brand reputation and value. Social innovation EDP's global voluntary investment has contributed to the implementation of 591 projects, 137 fewer than the previous year but with a greater concentration of contributions, which rose from an average of 35,549 euros to 45,366 euros per project. The thin spread of contributions in 2015 has therefore been addressed, in line with the preference for greater concentration of contributions in projects of greater worth in terms of outcomes and effects. To this end, in 2016, EDP undertook an in-depth study of its contribution history, with the projects characterized based on a methodology developed by the Institute for Social Entrepreneurship to identify those with most transformative potential. The analysis facilitated the construction of a decision-making methodology that forecasts the replicating effects of the investment. In recent years, assessment of the positive social impact of voluntary corporate contributions has become a prevalent theme, fed by intense international debate. However, although the debate is ongoing and there is a wide range of approaches, the discussions increasingly point towards three key ideas. On the one hand, companies must set clear priorities by demonstrating the link between their voluntary investments and business priorities. Second, companies must decide which projects to fund, in accordance with quantitative targets relating to expected outcomes and effects. 128 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Finally, volunteering must be more oriented towards initiatives that add value, in the areas of expertise of company employees, with direct and simultaneous returns for the company and society. In parallel with this debate, in 2016, EDP worked within the BCSD Portugal and WBCSD framework on the development of the Social Capital Protocol. This methodology will be launched in the first half of 2017 to establish the common international logical body for the identification and valuation of projects and themes in the social sphere, based on the Logical Model concept, with prioritization of the subjects of employment, training and the development of skills and security of people. The EDP Group’s total Voluntary Investment was 26.8 million euros (see table), thus maintaining roughly the same average contribution amount since 2013. Close to 87% of the entire investment was in the form of direct monetary contributions, with 8% coming from donations in kind and time contributions, including corporate volunteering during working hours, in accordance with EDP’s “Conciliar” (Reconcile) programme. Direct project development and management costs accounted for 5% of the total investment. The distribution of voluntary investment by types shows an increase in contributions for Arts and Culture, Economic Development and Social Welfare with a reduction in the areas of Education and Environment. These reductions do not entail an actual reduction in total investment because, in the case of compulsory programmes linked to the new producing centres, the dominant themes are actually Education and the Environment. Distribution of investment by business area changed compared to 2015, most notably the increase in Brazil from 8% to 16% and with Portugal now 69%, EDP in Spain 13% and EDP Renováveis 3%.

A museum that crosses three areas in a venue for debate, discovery, critical thought and international dialogue. An innovative project that connects a new building, designed by the Amanda Levete Architects firm, to the Tejo Plant, an example of national industrial architecture of the first half of the twentieth century and MAAT Portugal one of the most visited museums in the country. MAAT reflects the ambition to present national and international exhibitions with the contributions of contemporary artists, architects and thinkers. Reflecting on major themes and current trends, the programme will also present a range of curator perspectives on Fundação EDP's Art Collection. The Museum of the Portuguese Language was inaugurated in São Paulo in 2006 and recorded four million Museum of the Portuguese visitors before being destroyed by fire in late 2015. Recognized by Unesco as the best communication and Brazil Language information project, EDP Brasil, through the EDP Institute, is investing R$ 20 million in its refurbishment and reopening to the public. The Fundação EDP Holiday Camps have been taking place at the Palmela EDP Camp since 2014. In 2016 the Holidays for children with Holiday Camp for children and young people with chronic illnesses benefited 48 children supported in five Portugal chronic illnesses National Health System hospitals and was organized by the Fundação EDP in partnership with EDP Valor and Sãvida, with the support and approval of the General Directorate of Health. Fundação EDP's Public Art Programme involves populations in new cultural experiences and stimulates local development through art initiatives in public spaces in low-density areas nationwide. In 2016, programmes were developed in Trás-os-Montes, (Alfândega da Fé, Torre de Moncorvo, Miranda do Douro and Mogadouro), Public Art Ribatejo (Vila da Marmeleira, Assentiz, São João da Ribeira and Ribeira de São João), Alentejo (Campo Maior, Portugal Ouguela and Degolados), Algarve (Vila do Bispo, Barão de S.

For the second year, Fundación EDP launched the EDP Solidária programme in Spain and this year extended the successes of the previous year it received 49 applications and selected 15 projects, in a total investment of 400 thousand euros. In Brazil, EDP Solidária has been developed by the EDP Institute since 2010 and supported three new projects EDP Solidária programme Global taking its total support to over 75 projects. In Portugal, in 2016, 30 new projects were supported in the area of Social Inclusion and 17 in Health, with a total amount of €1,882,634. In Education, two more universities were included for the award of scholarships to 22 students. For the third time Fundación EDP celebrated the spring festival with the swap a drawing to plant a tree A drawing for a tree. project. The programme took place in Oviedo, Santander, Bilbao and Gijón, with 4,000 cherry trees planted in Spain 2016. In total 80,000 trees have been replanted in these initiatives. Run in partnership with the Ministry of Education, the programme develops initiatives in citizenship and improvement in the school environment to enhance the quality of life of students in local state schools. EDP's work in schools provides tools for student learning, promotes a fusion of art and energy, encourages EDP in schools programme Brazil community participation in schools, fosters student health and mobilizes partnerships for educational causes. In 2016, the programme was present in 31 schools in eight Brazilian states, reaching 5,564 students with eight different initiatives. With more than 11,000 participants, the annual Houston to Austin bicycle ride is one of the largest fundraising events in support of research and services for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis. More than Fundraising $32,000 was collected through EDP Renováveis. USA Volunteering EDP Volunteering is a fundamental priority of the Group's relationship with communities and, at the same time, of the development and motivation of EDP employees. Through its Volunteer Programme, EDP gives its employees in Portugal, Spain and Brazil four hours' work a month to be used in volunteering and promotes volunteering programmes of skills and awareness-raising and mobilization campaigns in all geographical areas.

For example, Parte de Nós Natal and Parte de Nós Ambiente (Christmas and Environment, respectively), held in the Group's various geographical areas and bringing employees and their families, suppliers and stakeholders together in joint campaigns with vulnerable people or environmental protection initiatives. Skills volunteering programmes put the professional and personal skills of each employee at the service of the community it is specialized and continuous volunteering. PROJECT INITIATIVES COUNTRY 85 EDP volunteers, 852 hours and 1,769 students in 80 schools. Based on their professional experience and in the Aprender a context of the Junior Achievement Portugal Aprender a Empreender Association, EDP employees promote the Empreender (Learning Portugal training of students in management, economics and entrepreneurship in dozens of schools in Portugal, to develop to Endeavour) skills in teamwork, problem solving, project development, leadership and guidance for success. Consisting of volunteer electricians working in social economy organizations to correct faults, replace and upgrade Electricians’ Pool Portugal systems and perform safety checks. Pool of Energy 40 EDP electricians, in a total of 310 hours' volunteering in working hours, support social institutions to use energy Portugal Efficiency Assessors more efficiently and reduce their bills. EDP employees provide training and support in the LEAN methodology, which identifies ways to increase process efficiency and reduce consumption and waste. In 2016, 64 volunteers invested 377 hours' volunteering during LEAN Portugal working hours, thus enabling the implementation of more than 10 LEAN initiatives in schools, public bodies and social sector institutions. Desafio do Bem This project is moving into its 6th year and involves healthy competition between work teams for the practice of Brazil (Challenge for Good) volunteering. In 6 years 76 social organizations have taken part, with 843 volunteers and investment of R$ 97,000. Cidadãos Pró-Mundo In skills volunteering on the Pro-Mundo Cidadãos programme, 14 volunteers give English classes at the João XXIII Brazil (Pro-World Citizens) School, near to EDP's facilities, in a highly vulnerable community, a total of 800 hours' volunteering on Sundays. Local communities As part of its work, through the construction and installation of the necessary infrastructure for the production and distribution of energy, EDP produces different environmental and socioeconomic impacts in the areas in which it operates. The company addresses this through a policy of active and transparent engagement with local stakeholders in order to enhance the positive impacts of the business and to prevent and minimize negative outcomes. Constant dialogue, the promotion and encouragement of communication channels and the creation of continuous and lasting relationships guarantee transparency, trust and closeness between the parties and help prevent obstacles and conflicts resulting from the non-inclusion of communities in project planning. These programmes, which include compulsory compensatory measures, also call for considerable voluntary investment by EDP, guided by priority for actions promoting local development. The inclusion and dialogue policy is developed by all business units and stimulated through the Edp + Perto training programme, through which EDP employees are made aware of community expectations and trained in analytical tools and dialogue methodologies. This preparation of EDP employees is especially significant in the construction of new dams and wind farms, due to both the disruption to the property of the populations and impacts on ecosystems. The dynamics of construction operations require major mobilization of technical resources and seasonal over-population of workers whose impacts have to be included in planning. However, once the construction phase is completed, the presence of the infrastructure still requires an active policy of dialogue and engagement with communities. This is now part of the EDP's operational management Business Plan. 131 In the context of hydroelectric power plant construction projects in 2016, the following developments related to compensation measures are of note: Portugal PROJECTS INITIATIVES In 2016, a Partnering Agreement was signed between EDP and the Baixo Sabor Municipalities Association, with the delivery to the Baixo Sabor municipalities of the management of the Environmental Interpretation and Animal Recovery Centre, with the support of the University of Trás-os-Montes and Alto Douro and the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança. Mobility Plan in connection with the Foz Tua hydroelectric plant, a Mobility System is being implemented as a compensatory measure. In 2016 the construction of the quays, recovery of the rail infrastructure and the construction of rolling stock all began. Foz Tua At the beginning of the second half of 2017 operation by a specialised operator will start. The Vale do Tua Interpretative Centre in late 2015 the museum programme and architecture project were approved. Work started in October and it is expected to open to the public in the third quarter of 2017. Protocols have been signed with the Local Councils of Vieira do Minho and Montalegre in the Venda Nova III and Salamonde capacity upgrades currently taking place in the Cávado basin. These protocols aim to contribute to the development of the areas covered. Capacity Upgrades In one case, by financing the facilities for a future business incubator – EUR 539,000; In the other by financing the paving of the Caminho and Formiga track EUR 111,000. In Brazil, noteworthy impact management measures, in addition to local development initiatives, involved compensation and relocation of the families and communities affected by these projects. Brazil CRITICAL ISSUES INITIATIVES EDP Brasil is adopting measures for the management of the impacts of relocation of families and on communities affected by the construction of generation plants. At Cachoeira Caldeirão, the extension of the Compensation and Relocation of Affected Families Programme was noteworthy: although 344 families were identified in the feasibility study phase, it was increased to 750 families during project implementation, with the decision taken to include them all in the package of socio-economic benefits. In 2016, for Relocation families example, Distribuição Espírito Santo completed the construction of a line over a distance of approximately 35 km, between the municipalities of Jaguaré and São Mateus, without the need for relocation of families and with 100% of the compensation being paid following amicable negotiations. In total, infrastructure projects in Brazil required the displacement of 924 families. These impacts were mitigated through compensation in 920 cases and rehousing in 14 cases. In order to maintain open and transparent communication with the Kayabi, Apiaká and Munduruku indigenous peoples of the lower Teles Pires river, EDP Brasil implemented Fale Conosco Indígena (Speak to Us for Indigenous Peoples). Amateur radio (frequency Indigenous peoples 6977 channel 2) is the main channel for dialogue with the indigenous peoples. There is also fale conosco (0800 762 6635), e-mail (faleconosco@saomanoelenergia.com.br) and the services offices in the municipalities of Paranaíta and Alta Floresta. All requests received are evaluated and answered with a record of the questions, claims, ideas and requests. To mitigate, compensate and monitor the impacts of the Cachoeira Caldeirão hydroelectric development, 58 socio-environmental programmes have been put in place. The actions include the construction of nine classrooms with 700 school desks and a commitment has been made to build a hospital. Social Development The impacts of the São Manoel Hydro Plant are mitigated through the Social Facilities and Infrastructure Upgrade Programme. EDP Brasil has invested in excess of R$ 27 million to address improvements in public services, such as enhanced public safety, social assistance and education in the municipalities of Paranaíta (MT), Alta Floresta (MT) and Jacareacanga (PA). Scientific Community EDP's relationships with the scientific community are based on key areas of the Group's activity and are materialized in a host of partnership projects with impact on the business. These institutions are knowledge hubs with which EDP enjoys close relationships and collaboration to devise innovative technical and scientific responses to the challenges of the business. Furthermore, the presence of these institutions in the different regions of the world in which EDP makes investments, allied to the high visibility of its representatives in society, strengthen the strategic importance of this sector. 132 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Over the last year, EDP has continued working to coordinate and structure its many relationships with this area, through an internal working group and greater information sharing in relevant areas. The outcome of this work has been the systematization of relationships with these stakeholders and an understanding of their expectations in relation to EDP. It is therefore possible to create value for the business, particularly through two major blocks attracting talent and research, development and innovation. Within research and innovation joint work is taking place for the development of models to predict social, environmental and economic impacts in EDP's different areas of business. A number of protocols with impacts on the energy generation business and on power grids have been agreed. These protocols are a mean of increasing knowledge, implementing service quality improvement measures and improving the efficiency of the infrastructures managed by EDP. Meanwhile, in terms of talent attraction, ever closer relationships with higher education institutions enable EDP not only to position itself as a major Portuguese employer but also to provide information on the company and energy sector so that it attracts applications from increasingly talented people. The development of EDP's current human resources in partnership with this stakeholder segment is also one of the priorities of these relationships. A number of training protocols provide the framework for the training and skills development of EDP employees. EDP's goal is to make this relationship ever closer through more interaction and new listening processes. This strategy will make it possible to identify new themes, to be managed in protocols with direct impact on the business. The following presents some of the initiatives developed in 2016 with the Scientific Community: PROJECTS STAKEHOLDERS INITIATIVES Partnership with the Nova University School of Business and Economics for the construction of the new Carcavelos Faculty Campus. This is a flagship partnership, with an impact in Portugal and global Nova School of Business visibility. It also cements a closer relationship between EDP and a key stakeholder in research and SBE New Campus and Economics recruitment. Accordingly, energy themes will be addressed in the Nova University SBE's syllabuses and recruitment will be even more coordinated and selective. This is a competition between teams from different technological universities and start-ups, geared towards Energy Efficiency, comfort and safety for B2C customers. The key objective is to promote the Portuguese Universities and creation of new applications and uses for the technology developed by EDP, Re:dy. It is also intended Re:dy Challenge Start-ups to identify high potential elements for the Group, to help EDP form closer relationships with universities and research in the area of energy efficiency and, at the same time, to establish the EDP brand as a sponsor of innovative ideas, giving visibility to the Re:dy brand. Local Authorities Local authorities are of key significance in the EDP Group's stakeholder strategy, given the diverse relationships that they have with the Group companies. On the one hand they have a dual role as customers and concession providers, but they are also legitimate representatives of the communities in which EDP operates. EDP's interactions with this group show that proximity and trust are essential for effective relationships with these stakeholders. In order to meet the expectations of the local authorities, in 2016 the EDP Group's business units made efforts to develop closer relationships and share information on the Group's activities in the regions, to establish partnerships in key areas such as energy efficiency promotion and the creation of initiatives that contribute to regional development. 133 The following presents some of the initiatives developed in 2016 with the local authorities: OBJECTIVE INITIATIVES Produção+Perto: The hydro generation centres, in accordance with their action plans, held three Produção+Perto (Production and Dialogue Proximity) sessions with local councils in the regions in which EDP operates, with the aim of establishing trust and disseminating information about the company's work. 34 local councils took part, in Régua, Castelo de Bode and Caniçada EDP promotes capacity building in the municipalities by providing funding for equipment and infrastructure projects and by delivering training. Examples of this approach are the 2016 Vehicle Donation Programme through which 21 cars were allocated to 21 civil Capacity building protection agencies and training was delivered to local organizations to improve their funding applications to EDP and thus enhance the success of their projects. Inclusion of LED lamps in Street Lighting: Following a period of negotiation between EDP Distribuição and the National Association of Portuguese Municipalities, a protocol was signed on 13 September, 2016, agreeing the revision of Annex I of the Low Voltage power distribution concession contract. This involved the removal of mercury vapour and the use of LED lamps as standard equipment for Energy Efficiency the installation of new Street Lighting systems, replacement of mercury vapour lamps in upgrades of Street Lighting systems and the replacement of obsolete lamps or lamps in a poor state of repair. This initiative was implemented as part of EDP Distribuição's Stakeholder Management Plan 2016, which aimed to address energy efficiency and environmental concerns by applying an innovative technology to the low voltage network. 134 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 8.

Corporate Governance Part I – Information on Ownership Structure, Organisation and Corporate Governance A. Ownership Structure I. Capital Structure 1. Capital Structure According to in Article 4 (2) of EDP's Articles of Association, EDP's share capital to the amount of EUR 3,656,537,715.00 is represented by 3,656,537,715 shares, which are ordinary and have a face value of 1 euro each. The geographical and investor type breakdown of the EDP shareholder structure on 31 December 2016 was as follows: Breakdown of shareholder structure by geography Breakdown of shareholder structure by investor type 29% PORTUGAL 8% 12% SPAIN INSTITUTIONAL 8% EUROPE 15% PRIVATE PERSONS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REST OF WORLD 37% 92% Source: Interbolsa 2. Restrictions on Share Transferability In statutory terms the shares are not subject to any limitations in terms of transferability, given that, according to the Portuguese Securities Code, shares traded in the market are fully transferable. 3. Treasury stock As at 31 December 2016, EDP owned 22,056,438 treasury stock shares, corresponding to 0.60% of the share capital and 0.60% of the voting rights. 147 4. Change of company control EDP is not a party to any significant agreements that come into effect, are amended or cease in the event of a change of company control following a takeover bid (except normal market practice in terms of debt issue). 5. Defensive measures EDP has not taken any measures to prevent takeover bids that would put the interests of the company and its shareholders at risk. The supplementary rules on this matter remain thus in force. On this subject, it is important to note that, pursuant to Article 14 (3) of EDP's current Articles of Association, votes cast by a shareholder on his own behalf or representing another will not be considered if they exceed 25% (twenty-five percent) of all the votes corresponding to the share capital. Although EDP's Articles of Association impose this limitation on the exercise of voting rights, this limitation is not a measure to prevent successful takeover bids. In fact, the inability of the limitation on voting rights to prevent the success of a takeover bid is the result of EDP's current capital structure and of the compliance of the deliberative quorum of two-thirds of the votes cast, which is set out in EDP's Articles of Association for an amendment to the company agreement on this matter with Article 182 (2) of the Securities Code. No defensive measures have been taken aimed at or resulting in serious erosion of EDP's assets in the event of transfer of control of the company or a change in the composition of the Executive Board of Directors, thereby prejudicing the free transferability of the shares and free appraisal by the shareholders of the performance of the members of the Executive Board of Directors. 6. Shareholder agreements PuTaking into account the Article 7 of EDP's Articles of Association, shareholder agreements regarding the company must be communicated in full to the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board by the shareholders that have signed them in the 30 (thirty) days following their conclusion. According to information provided to the company by the shareholders, the Executive Board of Directors is aware of the existence of a single shareholder agreement, which was entered into on 11 April 2007 by Parpública Participações Públicas (SGPS), S.A. ( (Parpública ), Caixa Geral de Depósitos, S.A. ( CGD ) and Société Nationale pour la Recherche, la Production, le Transport, la Transformation et la Commercialisation des Hydrocarbures ( Sonatrach ). Under the terms of this shareholder agreement, which were announced publically, Parpública and CGD made the following commitments: • To support the continued membership of Sonatrach (or of a person indicated by it) in EDP’s General and Supervisory Board, provided that Sonatrach maintains a shareholding of at least 2% (two percent) of EDP's share capital and the strategic partnership remains in effect; and • To refrain from promoting, supporting and/or voting in favour of any change in EDP's Articles of Association that prevents the continued membership of Sonatrach (or of a person indicated by it) in EDP's General and Supervisory Board. Although Parpública has sold its shareholdings in EDP's share capital and CGD does not own a qualifying shareholding in EDP's share capital, according to information at EDP's disposal this does not represent automatic cessation of the effects 148 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 of the shareholder agreement. EDP has not been informed of any agreement to revoke or amend the said shareholder agreement. II. Shareholdings and Bonds Owned 7.

Significant business relationships between owners of qualifying holdings and the company Attentive to the current reporting obligations, the Executive Board of Directors, during 2016, submitted to the General and Supervisory Board the information concerning transactions between related parties. Such information concerned the transactions listed below: Thus, with reference to 2016 exercise, it should be reported the performance of the following operations between companies of EDP Group and owners of qualifying holdings in EDP’s share capital: • Within the scope of the strategic partnership entered into between EDP and CTG in December 2011, it was concluded the transaction related to the sale to CTG of a minority holding of wind assets of EDP Renováveis in Italy and Poland (49% of shares and shareholder loans), being the respectiva purchase and sale agreement signed in 28th December 2015 and reported at the 2015 version of this Corporate Governance Report.

Also in 2016, approximately € 200 million were transferred to BCP through assignment without recourse of a part of the extra cost deficit of Special Production Regime in Portugal in 2015 and of a part of the extra cost deficit of Special Production Regime in Portugal in 2016. • To Sonatrach it was acquired natural gas under EDP Group long term supply agreements, in the approximate value of € 133 million. • EDP Group has supplied electricity and gas to Cementos Tutela Veguín and to other companies integrated in Masaveu Group in the approximate value of € 19 million (Cementos Tutela Veguín is a subsidiary of Corporación Masaveu which, in turn, holds 55,9% of the company Oppidum Capital, S.L. Oppidum Capital holds a participation of 7,19% in EDP’s share capital). • EDP Group has supplied electricity and gas to Liberbank and to related companies in the approximate value of € 5,7 million (Liberbank holds 44,1% of the company Oppidum Capital, S.L.

On July 29, 2010, the General and Supervisory Board approved the first draft of the Regulations on conflicts of interests , which was revised during 2015, and a new version was approved on October 29, 2015 (Regulation) available on the EDP's website (www.edp.pt). These rules for identifying, preventing and resolving potential relevant corporate conflicts of interest have a higher level of exigency than those in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code. Following a decision made by the General and Supervisory Board, on 17 May 2010 the Executive Board of Directors approved the rules on identification, in-house reporting and procedure in the event of conflicts of interest applicable to all EDP Group employees who play a decisive role in transactions with related parties. These rules are available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt). The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for supervising enforcement of the aforementioned rules and reports on its work to the General and Supervisory Board. The General and Supervisory Board noted in relation to 2016, in view of the cases analysed and the information provided by the Executive Board of Directors, that no evidence was found that the potential conflicts of interest underlying the transactions made by EDP may have been settled contrary to the interests of the Company. For more information on the matter, see Point 3.5.1 of the Annual Report of the General and Supervisory Board. 153 B. Corporate Bodies and Committees I.

The Company Secretary was appointed on 23 April 2015 (likewise for the 2015-2017 mandate). Board of the General Meeting Chairman António Manuel de Carvalho Ferreira Vitorino Vic eChairman Rui Pedro Costa Melo Medeiros Company Secretary Maria Teresa Isabel Pereira The Chairman of the General Meeting is automatically a member of the General and Supervisory Board, pursuant to Article 21 (2) of EDP’s Articles of Association.

The logistic and administrative resources for the General Meeting are provided by the Company and the organisation is supervised by the Chairman of the General Meeting. B) Exercise of Voting Rights 12. Restrictions on Voting Rights Pursuant to Article 14 (2) of EDP's Articles of Association, each share corresponds to one vote. According to Article 14 (9) of EDP’s Articles of Association, the holders of rights representing shares under ADR (American Depositary Receipt) programmes may instruct the respective depositary bank in order to see their voting rights exercised or, alternatively, grant proxy to a representative designated by EDP for such purpose, in compliance with applicable legal or statutory provisions; the depository contract should regulate terms and ways for exericising the voting rights, as well as for cases in which such instructions do not exist. EDP's shareholders can only participate and vote at the General Meeting, personally or through a representative, if on the date of registration, 00:00 hours (GMT) of the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting, they own at least one share (Article 14 (10) of the Articles of Association). Proof of ownership of the shares is provided by sending the Chairman of the General Meeting, by the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting, a statement issued, certified and sent by the financial intermediary responsible for 154 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 registering the shares, indicating the number of shares registered and the date of registration. It may be sent by email (Article 14 (13) of EDP's Articles of Association). Participation in the General Meeting also requires the shareholder to express this intention to the Chairman of the General Meeting and the financial intermediary at which the individual registration account has been opened, by the end of the sixth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting. The communication may be sent by email (Article 14 (11) of EDP's Articles of Association). Shareholders who have expressed their intention to participate in a General Meeting pursuant to the Articles of Association and have transferred ownership of the shares between the fifth day of trading prior to that of the General Meeting and the end thereof, must inform the Chairman of the General Meeting and the CMVM immediately (Article 14 (11) of EDP's Articles of Association). EDP's shareholders can submit a postal vote on each of the items on the agenda in a letter addressed to the Chairman of the General Meeting, as set out in Article 14 (6) of the Articles of Association. Pursuant to Article 14 (7) of EDP's Articles of Association, voting rights may also be exercised electronically, in accordance with the requirements necessary to ensure their authenticity, which must be defined by the Chairman of the General Meeting in the invitation to the meeting. Shareholders can find the necessary forms for postal or electronic votes on EDP's website (www.edp.pt). EDP has taken measures to encourage shareholders to exercise their voting rights, such as elimination of financial obstacles that may affect their exercise. These measures include: • General circulation of the notice of meeting of the General Meeting with an express indication of the channels available for the exercise of voting rights and in publications on the CMVM website (on www.cmvm.pt) and EDP website (on www.edp.pt), on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon newsletter and in mailings to shareholders; • Payment of the costs of issuing declarations of ownership of shares for all shareholders who participate in the General Meeting (directly or by post); • Payment of the costs involved in remote voting, including postal voting. As per EDP’s By-Laws, votes cast by a shareholder in his own name or as a representative of another exceeding 25% (twenty-five percent) of all the votes representing the share capital are not considered. This limitation applies to all decisions of the General Meeting, including those for which the law or EDP's Articles of Association provide for a qualified majority of the company's share capital. Pursuant to Article 14 (4) of EDP’s Articles of Association, votes for which, under Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code or any legal rule that amends or replaces it, he is responsible will be considered cast by the same shareholder. EDP's shareholders are obliged to provide the Executive Board of Directors, in writing and in a complete, objective, clear, truthful form, and in a manner acceptable to the board, all information that it requests from them on facts concerning them and related to Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code. Noncompliance with this obligation shall result in prevention of the exercise of voting rights pertaining to the shares owned by the shareholder in question (Article 15 (2) and (3) of the Articles of Association). If the limitation on the counting of votes affects a number of shareholders, it will operate in proportion to the ordinary shares owned by each one (Article 14 (5) of the Articles of Association). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 20 (1) of the Securities Code, or any legal rule that amends or replaces it, shareholders who become owners of a shareholding of 5% (five percent) or more of the voting rights or share capital, must inform the Executive Board of Directors thereof within five business days of the date on which ownership occurred. They cannot exercise their voting rights until they have made this communication (Article 15 (1) of EDP's Articles of Association). 155 13. Maximum percentage of voting rights that can be exercised by a single shareholder or shareholders that are related in some of the relations of Article 20 (1) See Point 12 14. Decisions of shareholders who, under the Articles of Association, can only be made by a qualified majority other than those provided for by law Decisions by the General Meeting are taken by a majority of votes cast, unless the law or the Articles of Association require a qualified majority (Article 11 (3) of the Articles of Association). Article 10 (1) of the Articles of Association defines the performance of functions in any corporate body is incompatible with: • the status of a legal person that is a competitor of EDP or a company in a control or group relation with EDP; • the status of a legal person or an individual related to a legal person that is a competitor of EDP; • the exercise of functions, of any nature or for any reason whatsoever, notably by appointment to a corporate office, by employment contract or by services provision agreement, at a legal person that is a competitor of EDP or at a legal person related to a legal person that is a competitor of EDP. Nevertheless, Article 10 (4) defines that the incompatibilities set forth in the foregoing paragraphs may also not apply to the performance of functions as a member of the general and supervisory board, to the extent permitted by law, subject to authorization given by prior resolution, with the favor of two thirds of the votes cast at the elective general shareholders’ meeting. The competition relation must be expressly referred to and precisely identified in the appointment proposal, and the authorization resolution may be subject to conditions, notably to a holding of no more than 10% of EDP’s share capital. In all other cases, the deliberative quorum set out in Article 383 (2) of the Company Code applies. II. Management and Supervision A) Composition 15. Corporate governance model EDP's governance structure is based, since 2006, on the dual model and consists of the General Meeting, Executive Board of Directors, General and Supervisory Board and the Statutory Auditor. The division of competences, inherent to such model, between the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board, has assured an effective management of the company, benefitted by a constant and attentive supervision. According to Article 11 (2) (b) of the Articles of association, it is the responsibility of the General Meeting of EDP to elect and dismiss the members of the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board, as well as their Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen, if any, and the Statutory Auditors, based on a proposal by the General and Supervisory Board (or by delegation to the Financial Matters Committee / Audit Committee). The General Meeting also appoints the members of the Environment and Sustainability Board, on proposal of the Executive Board of Directors, and Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting, which is responsible for setting the remuneration of the members of the corporate bodies (except the Executive Board of Directors, whose remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board). 156 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The separation of management and supervision roles is embodied in an Executive Board of Directors, which is responsible for the management of the company’s business, and a General and Supervisory Board, the highest supervisory body. Considering this structure, we can say that the dual model of corporate governance in place in EDP has allowed effective separation of the company’s supervision and management in pursuit of the goals and interests of EDP and its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, thereby contributing to achieving the degree of trust and transparency necessary for its adequate functioning and optimisation. Furthermore, this model has proved appropriate to the company's shareholder structure as it allows supervision by key shareholders on the General and Supervisory Board. For a better understanding of EDP's corporate governance, EDP's website (http://www.edp.pt/pt/aedp/governosocietario/estatutoseregulamentos/Pages/Estatutos.aspx) allows shareholders and the general public to view the up-to-date Articles of Association in Portuguese and English, the Internal Regulations of the Executive Board of Directors, General and Supervisory Board and its committees. Worth noting that EDP has since 2010 a Corporate Governance Manual, whose primary objective consists of registering and sharing the provisions of the Executive Board of Directors and of General and Supervisory Board regarding best practices recommendations applicable to EDP on corporate governance, in reference to CMVM recommendations. The Manual was revised in 2015, as to incorporate recent changes to legislation, having been approved by the General and Supervisory Board and by the Executive Board of Directors in January 2016. Just like the standard recommendations, also the Manual has a dynamic nature. It should therefore continue to be revised periodically, considering the contributions of all interested parties in the continuous development of EDP’s governance model. The Manual for the Corporate Governance of EDP is available to shareholders and general public at its website (www.edp.pt). The primary objective of this manual is to record and share an understanding of the two corporate bodies in terms of the recommendations of good corporate governance practices applying to EDP and appropriate guidelines to comply with them. EDP sought to go beyond the legal requirements and regulations for this area, particularly concerning information reporting, given EDP's meticulousness and goals as regards the quality of its corporate governance practices. The Corporate Governance Manual therefore sought to serve the following purposes in order to achieve this basic goal: • To reflect critically on recommendations on best practices set out in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code in order to contribute actively in optimising EDP's practices; • To select the recommendations deemed most appropriate to EDP’s governance model, focusing on measures taken and indicating potential measures for full adoption of good practices; • To identify recommendations that are not appropriate to EDP’s interests and give reasons for this position and indicate other ways of achieving the goals set out in the CMVM Corporate Governance Code; • To help targets of the recommendations to reflect on the best governance practices to be followed at EDP; • To draft a formal document that will help compliance with reporting obligations on corporate governance practices, such as the annual report required by law; • Describe EDP’s governance practices that are not set out in the Corporate Governance Code but achieve the goal shared by the General and Supervisory Board and the Executive Board of Directors to develop and increase the quality of EDP’s governance processes. With the publishing of the manual, EDP intends to keep materializing a pioneer role of excellence in terms of corporate governance best practice promotion, hoping that this initiative may also contribute to an enrichment of the debate on these matters, in a context of the overall organization and functioning of companies, particularly in Portugal. 157 16. Articles of Association rules on procedural and material requirements for the appointment and replacement of members of the Executive Board of Directors and General and Supervisory Board It is the role of the General Meeting to elect and remove members of the Executive Board of Directors and the General and Supervisory Board, including their chairmen. In the event of permanent or temporary absence of any of the members of the Executive Board of Directors, the General and Supervisory Board arranges for his/her replacement and the appointment must be ratified by the next General Meeting. In the event of permanent absence of any of the members of the General and Supervisory Board, the substitutes on the list submitted to the General Meeting must be summoned by the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board to replace him/her, following the order on the list.

Independent members of the Executive Board of Directors and General and Supervisory Board 159 EDP's Articles of Association (Article 9 (1), Artilce 10 (1), Article 11 (2) (d), Article 21 (4), Article 22 (1) (a), Article 23 and Article 27) and the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board (Article 7)), both available on its website (www.edp.pt), lay down the rules on independence and incompatibilities for members of any of the company's corporate bodies. The criteria of independence set out in EDP's Articles of Association are in line with those laid down in 414 (5) of the Company Code and determine that independence means an absence of direct or indirect relations with the company or one of its bodies and an absence of any circumstances that might affect impartiality of analyses or decisions, e.g. because the people in question own or are acting on behalf of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital of EDP or have been re-elected for more than two terms of office continuously or intermittently. Pursuant to Article 9 (1) of EDP's Articles of Association, independence is “absence of direct or indirect relations with the company or one of its bodies and an absence of any circumstances that might affect impartiality of analyses or decisions, e.g. because the people in question own or are acting on behalf of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital of EDP or have been re-elected for more than two terms of office continuously or intermittently . In view of the need to clarify the aforementioned Article 414 (5) of the Company Code, as there are diverging legal opinions, Associação de Emitentes de Valores Cotados em Mercado (“AEM”) requested an opinion from the CMVM , whose opinion was that the capacity as independent is only lost if, “on the basis of the criterion of number of terms of office, in a situation likely to affect his/her impartiality in analyses or decisions if the members of the supervisory bodies of public limited companies, having been elected for a first term of office and re-elected continuously or intermittently for a second and third term, are re-elected (for the third time, therefore) for a fourth term of office.” Pursuant to its Internal Regulations, the General and Supervisory Board has in place a specific procedure regarding compliance with a large number of rules on incompatibilities and independence applicable to positions on this board (Articles 6 and 7 of the General and Supervisory Board Internal Regulations). This procedure includes the following aspects: • Acceptance of a position as member of the General and Supervisory Board is subject to a written statement setting out specifically (i) the inexistence of any incompatibility under the law or Articles of Association; (ii) compliance with the independence requirements set out in its Internal Regulations, if the person has been elected as an independent member; (iii) the members' obligation to report to the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board or, for the Chairman, directly to the board any subsequent event that might generate incompatibility or loss of independence; • Every year, the members of the General and Supervisory Board must renew their statements as to the inexistence of incompatibility and compliance with the independence requirements, if applicable; Also every year, the General and Supervisory Board conducts a general assessment of compliance with the rules of incompatibility and independence by its members. At the same time, the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board has broadened the independence criteria applicable to its members, going beyond the provisions of Article 414 (5) of the Company Code and Article 9 of EDP's Articles of Association, and so people who directly or through their spouse or relative or similar in a straight line and to the collateral third degree, inclusive, are in one of the following situations cannot have independent status: • Being holder, director, having contractual ties or acting on behalf or on the account of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital or voting rights in EDP or the same percentage in a company of which it is a subsidiary; • Being a holder, director, having contractual ties or acting on behalf or on the account of owners of a qualifying shareholding of 2% (two percent) or more of the share capital or voting rights in a company that is a competitor of EDP; and • Having been re-elected for more than two consecutive or non-consecutive terms of office. 160 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The rules of independence covering members of the General and Supervisory Board are particularly important regarding the following requirements: • The board must consist of a majority of independent members (Article 434 (4) of the Company Code and Article 21 (4) of EDP's Articles of Association); • The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee is entirely composed of independent members of the General and Supervisory Board (Article 23 (2) of EDP By-Laws and Article 2 (1) of the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee’s Internal Regulations); • The Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board must comprise a majority of independent members (Article 27 (1) (b) of the General and Supervisory Board's Internal Regulations). In compliance with the above procedure, at the start of their terms of office, the members of the General and Supervisory Board stated that they were not in any of the situations of incompatibility set out in the Companies’ Code (Article 414A (1) (a) to (e), (g) and (h) (ex vi Article 434 (4)) and Article 437 (1)) or under the Articles of Association and, where applicable, that they complied with the independence requirements of the Internal Regulations of the General and Supervisory Board. Of the incompatibility situations for the exercise of the role of member of the General and Supervisory Board, pursuant to the Article 414-A of the Companies’ Code, it is considered the exercise of functions of administration or supervisory in five companies. Therefore, one may not be elected or designated a General and Supervisory Board member if holds office of administrator or supervisor in five companies. At the end of 2016, the members of the outgoing General and Supervisory Board renewed their statements on incompatibilities and independence. On 2 March 2017, the General and Supervisory Board assessed compliance with the rules on incompatibilities and independence of the elected members at the General Meeting of 21 April 2015. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Board of the General Meeting made similar statements of compliance with the criteria of independence and incompatibility for their positions, as set out in Article 414 (5) and Article 414-A (1) of the Company Code and in Articles 9 and 10 of EDP's Articles of Association. The above statements are available to the public on EDP's website, at “http://www.edp.pt/en/aedp/governosocietario/Independenciaeincompatibilidade/Pages/DeclaraçãodeIndependênciaeI ncompatibilidades.aspx”.

Whistleblowing policy and channels The EDP Group has consistently implemented measures to ensure the good governance of its companies, including the prevention of incorrect practices, particularly in the areas of accounting and finance and, for this purpose, approved, on 3 March 2016, the Regulations Whistleblowing Procedures. EDP provides Group employees with a channel that enables them to report any alleged unlawful practice or accounting or financial irregularity in their company directly and in confidence to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee of the General and Supervisory Board. With the creation of this channel for reporting irregular accounting and financial practices, EDP aims at: • Ensuring that any employee can freely communicate his/her concerns in these fields to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee; • Facilitating the early detection of irregular situations that, if they occurred, might cause serious damage to the EDP Group, its employees, customers and shareholders. The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee can be contacted by email, fax and post and access to information received in this regard is restricted. The members of this committee are authorised to receive these reports. All complaints sent to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee are treated in strict confidence and the complainant remains anonymous, unless this prevents investigation of the complaint. Pursuant to the regulations, EDP guarantees that whistleblowing employees will not suffer any reprisals or disciplinary action for exercising their right to report irregularities, provide information or assist in an investigation. 200 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 The Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee informed the General and Supervisory Board of its work as part of the whistleblowing mechanism in 2016. The conclusion was that none of the 39 reports received contained complaints with an impact on accounting, finance, internal control or audit matters. With the exception of 2 complaints currently under process of enquiry, all the complaints have been dealt and closed by the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee until the end of 2016. EDP makes available, at its website, greater detail regarding the Whistle Blowing Procedures’ Regulation to adopt in what concerns to Communication of Erroneous Procedures (http://www.edp.pt/en/aedp/governosocietario/comunicacaodeirregularidades/Pages/ComunicacaodeIrregularidades.a spx). III. Internal Control and Risk Management 50. People, bodies or committees responsible for internal audits or implementation of internal control systems Internal control matters are the responsibility of the Corporate Centre, which plays a structural role in assisting the Executive Board of Directors in defining and overseeing implementation of strategies, policies and goals. The most important of the Corporate Centre departments and offices in terms of internal control are the Internal Audit and Compliance Department and the Risk Management Department. The former performs internal audits or ensures that they are performed in the Group. It is also responsible for the financial reporting internal control system (SCIRF) and for the compliance role in the Group, with a view to an independent assessment of the internal control system and implementation of measures to make it more effective by optimising and aligning processes and systems. The Risk Management Department's main responsibility is to coordinate the Group's risk assessment studies in order to assist the Executive Board of Directors in controlling and mitigating them and provide integrated risk-return analyses. Under the law, the General and Supervisory Board permanently oversees and evaluates internal accounting and auditing procedures, the efficacy of the risk management system, the internal control system and the internal auditing system, including the way in which complaints and queries from employees and others are handled. This duty has been assigned to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee, which, among other tasks, permanently monitors and supervises: • EDP’s financial affairs; • Internal auditing procedures, the company's accounting practices and the internal control system for financial information and financial reporting and the compliance function, in coordination with the Internal Audit and Compliance Department; • Matters relating to the internal control system for financial information and to risk management process, particularly taxation, legal and financial aspects. • The activity and independence of the Statutory Auditor, with whom it should maintain a close connection. 51. Description of hierarchical and/or functional dependency on other company bodies or committees The Internal Audit and Compliance Department belongs to the Corporate Centre and although it is answerable to the CEO, it reports in practice to the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee. The department's work is supervised by the Financial Matters Committee/Audit Committee, which approves the annual internal audit plan before it is sent to the Executive Board of Directors and monitors its systematic implementation. 201 52. Other company areas with risk control duties The management of risk is an integral part of the common practices of business management and it is the responsibility of all, from the Executive Board of Directors right down to the individual staff member. Each one is responsible for knowing the risks existing in their area of intervention and for managing them in accordance with their role, expertise and delegated responsibilities. The Group manages its meaningful risks in a portfolio approach, optimizing the risk/ return trade-off transversely across its business areas, aiming to create value and to stand out in the markets where it operates. The Group works towards a permanent progress of its risk management processes in order to reflect the evolution of its needs and to maintain its alignment with international risk management best practices. The integration of risk management in the most relevant business and decision making processes is promoted as part of i) strategic development, ii) investment decisions, iii) business plan and iv) operations management, with the purpose of ensuring stability in results and optimize its response to changes in context and opportunities. The risk management process is structured around 3 lines of defence (business operation, risk management/ compliance and internal and external auditing), each led independently and ensuring an adequate level of segregation relative to one another. The functions of risk identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment and monitoring are followed by a set of bodies with clearly established roles and responsibilities, typified by Group policies that are approved and ratified by the competent bodies of the Group: • The General and Supervisory Board (GSB), in particular the Financial Committee/ Audit Committee, is responsible for monitoring on a permanent basis and evaluating internal procedures for accounting and auditing, in addition to the efficacy of the risk management system, the internal control and the internal auditing systems, including the way in which complaints and queries are received and processed, whether originating from employees or not. The General and Supervisory Board is additionally involved in the Group’s Strategic Plan, ensuring, implicitly, an alignment between management and shareholders regarding risk appetite. • The Executive Board of Directors (EBD) is the highest body responsible for risk-related decision-making, supervision and management control. It is responsible for the approval of the business plan, for setting the management objectives and policies of the EDP Group. It is responsible, among other duties, for defining the Group's risk exposure, in line with the best practices in risk management procedures and policies (namely, the respective exposition limits by risk category), as well as the allocation of resources, depending on the risk-return profile of the various options available. • The Risk Management Department, headed by the Chief Risk-Officer, lends an integrated and holistic view of the Group's risk position (top-down perspective), supporting the prioritization and coordination of cross-cutting initiatives, offering a segregated and business-independent view regarding key risks. Its main responsibilities are: i) to maintain and update an inventory of the Group’s most significant risks and fostering their implementation in the various Business Units and Corporate Departments; ii) to promote and monitor the implementation of the management and control actions regarding the Group’s most significant risks; iii) to systematically measure specific risks and conduct risk-return analyses, noting and reporting adjustment needs when necessary; iv) to define main concepts, methods and risk measures and Key Risk Indicators (KRI), supplementary to the Key Performance Indicators (KPI); v) to develop and support projects and initiatives aimed at the effective improvement of the management process of significant risks; and vi) to support the Executive Board of Directors in the risk management and business continuity areas. • The Management of Business Units and Corporate Departments is the first responsible for an integrated risk management in each of their business areas. Its main responsibilities are: i) to propose and approve (through the respective Board of Directors) the definition of key principles for risk management, aligned with the orientations defined by corporate policies; ii) to ensure that the risks within the scope of their activity are identified, analyzed and evaluated broadly, rigorously and consistently throughout the Group, using established methodologies; iii) to optimize the risk/ return trade-off of their activity, aligned with the orientations established by the Executive Board of Directors, regarding the definition and implementation of risk management strategies, implementation of effective initiatives in treatment costs of key risks, the clear and equilibrated allocation between parties in case of internal or external contract of products or services and the definition of mechanisms and levels of residual risk transference 202 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 (insurance); iv) to monitor and report periodically their risk position, by the definition and regular monitoring of KRIs, risk reports and the evaluation of existing risk controls; and v) to highlight key aspects of risk management to their respective risk-officers, Risk Management Department and appropriate decision makers. • Local structures for risk management (risk-officers) assume a key role on operationalizing risk management. Typically, they report hierarchically to a member of the respective Board of Directors, and in coordination with EDP Group Chief Risk-Officer, acting independently from business operation. In large and/ or particularly complex Business Units local replicas of risk management corporate structure exist, articulated with the Risk Management Department. Their responsibilities include: i) to identify and characterize through quantification and qualification the materiality of key risks (both threats and opportunities), within the scope of their activity and in articulation with the business; ii) to perform studies on key strategic issues and associated risks, in close articulation with the business and the Risk Management Department; iii) to support the Board of Directors and Departments on decision making, in the perspective of risk; iv) to advise on mitigation and hedging strategies for key risks; v) to monitor and report key risks to decision makers and Risk Management Department, to implement policies and procedures, including the follow-up of expositions vs. established risk limits, the systematic register of incidents and quasi-incidents, including the characterization of events and its quantitative impact; vi) to develop and promote methodologies to analyze, evaluate and treat actual and emerging risks and support its implementation; vii) to coordinate initiatives regarding crisis management and business continuity; viii) to coordinate the existing Risk Committees (if applicable); and ix) to provide adequate risk related information to the Risk Management Department, decision makers, and remaining relevant stakeholders. 203 Risk-officers network of EDP Group Furthermore, there are a number of regular forums for the discussion, analysis and issue of opinions on risk-related topics: • EDP Group Risk Committee has the main objective of supporting the decisions of the Executive Board of Directors in the identification, assessment, management and control of risk, in terms of: i) supporting the identification of significant risks and the characterization of the EDP Group's risk profile; ii) discussing relevant risk analysis and evaluation projects results developed with Business Units and Corporate Departments; iii) advising and/ or recommending risk management strategies (e.g., regarding policies, procedures and limits); and iv) monitoring and controling the evolution of significant risks. This Committee is held at half-yearly intervals (at least). It is composed of the key decision makers and those responsible for the Group's risk management (the Executive Board of Directors, the Corporate Centre and selected Business Units). • The Individual Risk Committees are set up and held at Business Unit levels when the degree of complexity of risk management justifies such, taking on a structure replicated from the Group's Risk Committee. These Committees are composed of the key decision makers and those responsible for risks of each Business Unit, typically coordinated by the respective risk officer. 204 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP Group’s risk Committes 53. The main types of economic, financial and legal risk to which the company is exposed in its business The taxonomy of risks for the EDP Group combines in an integrated approach and in common language the various mapped risks existing in relation to the Group's different Business Units, structured around four major families: strategic, business, financial and operational. 205 EDP Group’s risks taxonomy Strategic risks Strategic risks typically incorporate risk of medium to long-term time horizons and low probability of occurrence. In any case, the EDP Group closely monitors and reports on these risks, since it considers that these risks may have a significant impact if they occur. The strategic risks can be broken down into two different types: • Risks of the surrounding context, associated with external developments that may have a negative material impact on the Group, in particular but not limited to, severe macro-economic, social/ or political crisis in core geographies for the Group, technological disruptions of various kinds, profound changes resulting from climate change and disruptive changes in competitive paradigm. • Regarding the risk of a macro-economic, social and/ or political crisis in Portugal and/ or Spain, the EDP Group believes that the adoption of the quantitative easing program by ECB, the stability of public deficit and of the interest rate of public debt in Portugal and Spain, as well as the stability of political context, suggest a material reduction of the probability of actual occurrence of these risks (compared with previous years). • Regarding technological disruption, the EDP Group has sought to position itself at the forefront of technological development in the sector, looking at this issue not as a threat but as a central vehicle for promoting growth in the future. The EDP Group has accordingly actively and transversely invested in and investigated the promotion of new technologies in the various stages of the value chain, namely EDP Inovação’ activity level. • Regarding climate change, such changes may have a significant and across-the-board impact on the various stakeholders over the medium to long term (e.g., in terms of average temperatures, average sea levels, structural changes in water and/or wind volumes, or the incidence of extreme weather phenomena). In this 206 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 sense, the Group has decisively invested over recent years in strengthening its portfolio of renewable energy as well as in a concerted strategy of environmental sustainability, which has been internationally recognised, not only in order to reduce its ecological footprint, but also to ensure its resilience to the possible materialisation of risks deriving from climate change. • Regarding disruptive changes to the competitive paradigm, the Group recognizes the risks associated with changes to the business model paradigm (e.g. in relation to distributed generation). The EDP Group addresses this risk through meticulous analyses and prospective investment, allowing it to proactively anticipate and adapt its business model to possible market development trends. • Strategic risks, associated with investment decisions, relationships with key partners (shareholders and others), internal governance and corporate planning (in its various forms). • Regarding investment decisions, EDP’s growth strategy implies the constant evaluation and decision-making in relation to investment options that allow it to implement the strategy established and approved by its shareholders. Accordingly, a meticulous and consistent process is defined across the Group, with pre-established criteria1 for analysis, decision-making and monitoring of projects. This process is conducted at the corporate level by the Business Analysis Department, locally supported by the various Business Units. Additionally, Investment Committees regularly meet to discuss, monitor and advise on i) investment analysis and decisions; ii) compliance with investment implementation schedules; and iii) evaluation of impact of detected or potential deviations. These forums are performed both at the Business Unit level and at the corporate level, involving decision-makers and key experts of the Group in the relevant fields. • Regarding the relationship with partners (shareholders and others), the EDP Group has a solid and stable core of shareholders, which is aligned with and actively participates in the Group's strategy. On the other hand, the EDP Group is guided by strict criteria at all levels for the selection of its partners in the various countries and business areas in which it operates, the management of which is led by the Executive Board of Directors, Business Units and Institutional Relations and Stakeholders Department. • Regarding internal governance, the Group considers that the design and implementation of its various corporate bodies ensures compliance with the best international practices on this topic (see previous section for more information). • Regarding corporate planning (particularly in terms of brand and communication, investor relations, human resources, information systems, business strategy, and others) the Group believes that the current structures and processes allow it to adequately manage these risks. Business risks The business risks encompass all risk factors intrinsically linked to revenue from the core activity of the EDP Group in the generation, distribution and sale of energy in the various countries and markets where it operates. The business risks can be broken down into two different types: • Energy market risks, related to electricity prices (pool) and other commodities, renewable energy generating volumes (hydro and wind power), energy consumption (associated with demand) and supply margins. • Regarding price of electricity, the impact is limited by the fact that a significant share of generation is contracted in the long term, especially in relation to EDP Renováveis and most of the installed capacity in Brazil, as well as the case of power plants still covered by CMEC2, in Portugal, which will start being subject to market price from June 30, 2017 onwards. Currently, generation subject to market price fluctuations includes: i) all ordinary status generation in Spain; ii) the Ribatejo and Lares power plants, new hydroelectric power plant projects; iii) generation in Brazil in excess of or in deficit to the PPA; and iv) part of the wind energy farms of EDP Renováveis in Spain, USA, Poland and Romania. The Energy Management Business Unit (UNGE) is responsible for proactively acting in the MIBEL3 and other forward markets (including OTC) in order to optimize the margin of market generation and limit the respective risk, according to the delegation of powers clearly 1 Particularly related to the definition of minimum return levels, up to date and geography/ business line-specific discount rates as well as to the resilience to multiple adverse scenarios of delays, overruns, fluctuations in key business variables, political environment and regulations 2 Costs of Maintenance of Contractual Balance 3 Iberian electricity market 207 established and ensuring periodic P@R Profit at Risk” reporting, based on a proprietary model. Energy Management Business Unit (UNGE)’s operations are adequately framed by a specific risk policy, including exposure limits. • Regarding the price of other commodities (mostly fuel and CO2), subject to fluctuation due to supply and demand dynamics or changes in international legislation and relevant only to power plants exposed to market risk, this risk is monitored and proactively managed by the Energy Management Business Unit (UNGE), which negotiates and manages coal and gas contracts and CO2 allowances. It is also responsible for mitigation of the fuel prices risk via hedging (including foreign exchange risk in USD, in coordination with the Financial Management Department). • Regarding renewable energy generation volumes, the EDP Group has a degree of material exposure to this risk, particularly in relation to water volume (Wind Energy Capability Index4 tends to be less volatile than the Hydroelectric Capability Index5, on an annual basis), arising from its increasing focus on a generation portfolio with ever greater renewable energy, as well as the progressive entrance to the market (until 2017) of a set of generation power plants covered by CMEC mechanisms. It should be noted that this risk, although it may introduce some volatility in annual results, has a significantly lower impact on NPV6 in the lifetime of the hydroelectric power plants, since it i) diversifies inter-annually; ii) diversifies through technologies (lower hydro productivity is, in part, compensated by higher thermal production at typically higher prices) and iii) is uncorrelated with the market. On the other hand, exposure in Brazil is significantly mitigated by i) the fact that there is hydrological diversification throughout the country (through financial coupling mechanisms); as well as ii) the fact that a PPA on fixed energy generation is established; and iii) the fact that the Group joined, in the end of 2015, the hydro risk renegotiation mechanism, which combined with the cap on PLD7 price limits the exposure to the deficit of allocated energy relative to energy sold in PPA (for the Regulated Environment). On the other hand, the normalization of hydrological affluences and reservoir levels, investment plans for new capacity as well as the current macro-economic context contribute to limit the materiality of this risk in the future • Regarding energy consumption (electricity and gas), the EDP Group is subject to fluctuations in the amounts of energy sold (depending on factors such as, among others, economic activity and annual temperatures). A trend of falling energy sales has been noted in recent years, as the result of a slowdown in economic activity in Portugal and Spain. Consumption can also be affected, besides such economic cycle fluctuations, by situations of rationing (as happened in Brazil in 2001). Government estimates indicate a low probability of rationing in Brazil, due to the progressive normalization of hydro affluences and consequently reservoir levels (figures above homologous periods) as well as a slowdown in demand as a consequence of the current macro-economic context. This risk, like the previous one, is difficult to mitigate by itself. EDP chooses to manage it through diversification across multiple technologies, countries and business lines. • Regarding sales margins, the current customer migration to the free market enhances the aggressiveness of offers from suppliers and can add additional volatility in terms of market shares and unit margins. Moreover, there is risk associated with deviations in actual consumption from the forecasting model adopted by the Group. These risks are managed by the Group's energy sales companies, with particular emphasis on initiatives to i) strengthening the core offer (e.g., through combined electricity and gas products); and ii) introducing innovative products and services (e.g., Funciona and Re:dy). In addition, the Prices and Volumes Committee evaluates and regularly makes recommendations for the dynamic management of this risk. • Regulatory risks, related to changes in legislation and regulations that the Group is required to comply with in the various countries and markets in which it operates (in particular, but not limited to, sectoral packages, regulatory frameworks, environmental legislation and taxes, and other). Changes resulting from the introduction of sectoral packages and modifications of revenue models have impacted on the EDP Group in recent years in a material manner, particularly in Portugal (as a result of the Financial Assistance Programme) and Spain (due to the large imbalance of the tariff deficit in that country). It is expected that this risk shall continue to be relevant in the future, although somehow less burdensome as a 4 Ratio between the yearly wind energy output vs. reference year 5 Ratio between the yearly hydro energy output vs. reference year 6 Net present value 7 Currently of R$ 422,56/MWh 208 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 result of the gradual stabilization of the macroeconomic environment in Portugal and the tariff deficit in Spain and Portugal. This risk is managed proactively by the EDP Group, through monitoring and thorough preparation of the various dossiers and adopting a constructive and cooperative attitude in their discussion. This allows the materialisation of unfavourable options and/or those out of synch with reality in the different market contexts in which the Group operates to be anticipated and minimized. Financial risks The financial risks encompass the market risk factors linked to the (non-operational) energy business of the EDP Group in the various countries and markets where it operates. Financial risks can be divided into four different types: • Financial variables risks, associated with fluctuations in international markets in interest rates, exchange rates, inflation and valuation of financial assets held by the Group. • Regarding interest rates, the risk is mainly associated with the percentage of debt at floating rates, as well as any increases in costs associated with fixed rate debt refinancing needs in a context of rising current interest rates. This risk is managed and mitigated by the Group's Financial Management Department, which ensures compliance with the risk profile, using the procedures and tools provided by the Group's risk policies. Periodic reports on the evolution of these variables and sources of risk are prepared. • Regarding foreign currency exchange rates, the risk is associated with fluctuations in the cost of the purchase and sale of electricity and fuel and with the cost of investments denominated in foreign currencies, as well as fluctuations in the value of net assets, debt and income denominated in foreign currencies. The EDP Group acts proactively in order to ensure a broadly balanced net structural exposure (assets liabilities) in USD, GBP and CAD. On the other hand, the geographical diversification (and exposure to multiple currencies) contributes for the reduction of annual result volatility. The remaining risks are managed and mitigated by the Group's Financial Management Department, in conjunction with the Energy Management Business Unit (UNGE), EDP Renováveis and EDP Brasil, in the same way as above. • Regarding inflation, the risk is mainly associated with the fluctuation of operating revenues and costs in the various countries where the EDP Group operates. In terms of mitigation, the revenue models of regulated activities as well as part of the PPAs include inflation pegging components in order to preserve adequate revenue for the business activity. A significant component of the Group's current business activities is also focused on markets with stable inflation rates. For the remaining risk, as well as active management of the various supply and services contracts, the EDP Group addresses this risk from an integrated perspective, mitigating it through an appropriate debt profile (fixed rate/floating rate) aligned with the revenues profile. • Regarding the valuation of financial assets, EDP adopts a conservative risk policy with reduced levels of exposure, based on a reduced weight of strategic financial assets and short term cash investments mainly based on bank deposits (without market risk). This risk mainly results from the possibility of devaluation of the financial assets that EDP holds (traded on securities markets). It is managed according to the procedures and tools provided by the Group's risk policies. • Counterparty and credit risks, associated with unexpected changes in the compliance capacity with obligations by customers, financial counterparties (mainly associated with deposits in financial institutions and financial derivatives) and energy counterparties. • Regarding financial counterparties, the adverse macroeconomic and financial environment has led to a fall in ratings of various financial institutions where the Group invests its liquidity (impacted by the adverse macroeconomic and financial environment). This risk is managed through: i) a careful selection of counterparties; ii) an appropriate diversification of risk over multiple counterparties; iii) an exposure based on financial instruments of reduced complexity, high liquidity and of a non-speculative nature; and iv) regular monitoring of the positions held. • Regarding energy counterparties, this risk is reduced for operations in an organized market. For operations in OTC8 markets and fuel purchases, the Energy Management Business Unit (UNGE), which is responsible for monitoring and the interface with wholesale markets, monitors transactions by applying exposure and negotiation limits that have been established and approved in advance by a higher management according to 8 OTC: Over the Counter 209 the counterparty rating (external whenever possible, or internally rated if the former is unavailable), and using clearing houses for clearing. The counterparty risk is also associated with the sale of long-term energy agreements (PPA), which is minimized by the fact that a significant proportion of counterparties in this context are sovereign entities (governments or state-owned electricity systems). Meticulous scrutiny and approval criteria are likewise applied for private counterparties. • Regarding customers, the Group is exposed to default risk in Portugal, Spain and Brazil. The average level of risk in Spain is structurally mitigated in terms of expected loss due to a mix of customers with greater weight of the B2B segment (which has less relative weight of average default). The risk in Brazil is mitigated through financial collateral to mitigate the loss (for the Free Contracting Environment), and through the partial recovery of non-compliance by the regulated tariff (for the Regulated Contracting Environment). This is monitored by EDP Distribuição and EDP Soluções Comerciais (in Portugal) and HC Energía and Naturgas (in Spain), which are responsible for carrying out the meter reading cycles and cutting off the service/taking legal action and debt recovery. In addition, mitigation tools such as credit insurance and setting up bank collateral are used, whenever this is deemed necessary. • Liquidity/solvency risk, associated with specific cash shortfalls, difficulties in access/cost of credit and rating reduction risk. • Regarding possible sporadic cash shortfalls, there is a risk of possible default of the EDP Group in meeting all its short-term liabilities in the committed time periods, or just being able to do so under unfavorable conditions. This risk is mitigated through careful liquidity management, by means of: i) centralization (cash pooling) of all the Group's liquidity at the holding company except for Brazil; ii) keeping adequate levels of liquidity (cash and firmly committed credit lines) based on detailed forecasting of cash requirements (reviewed in 2016 to cover two years of refinancing); iii) an appropriate strategy to diversify funding sources; and iv) the diversification of debt type and maturity profiles. • Regarding access to and the cost of credit, the EDP Group has achieved, despite the adverse economic context, all funding necessary for the usual roll over of debt and to finance the Group's business. EDP’s Group has successfully continued with its strategic commitment to reduce leverage (expressed as Net Debt/EBITDA excluding Regulatory Assets) over forthcoming years. Additionally, the Group has acted throughout 2016 towards increasing the average maturity of its debt and reducing its average cost. • Regarding the risk of a ratings decline, the EDP Group can be impacted in its access to and cost of financing by adverse changes in its rating profile (assigned by international agencies). EDP proactively manages this risk by maintaining a low risk profile and maintaining stable contractual standards, which assure that its liquidity position does not depend on mechanisms as financial covenants or rating triggers. • Other liabilities’ risk, associated with obligations relating to the capitalization of the Defined Benefit Pension Fund of the Group for Portugal (which has a risk associated with the market value of its assets), and additional costs associated with early retirement as well as medical expenses. The liabilities for employee social benefits are calculated annually by an Independent Actuary on the basis of IFRS-IAS assumptions (taking various factors into account, including interest rate, demographic aspects, economic variables and the applicable requirements). The Defined Benefit Pension Fund is regularly monitored by the Pension Fund Committee that meets at an established frequency, in terms of the value of its assets and the variations in terms of its liabilities (e.g., actuarially related). 210 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 Operational risks The operational risks encompass the risk factors other than those linked to the energy and financial business of the EDP Group in the various countries and markets where it operates, associated with the planning, construction and operation of physical assets, implementation of processes, human resources, information systems and litigation. The operational risks can be broken down into five different types: • Physical assets risks, related to unforeseen occurrences in projects under development/construction, damage to physical assets in operation and (technical and non-technical) operating losses, associated with the operation of the assets (mainly in distribution). • Regarding projects under development/construction and assets in operation, the EDP Group is exposed to incidents derived from external causes (e.g., seismic or atmospheric phenomena, fire, damage to structures, burglary and theft, environmental pollution) or internal causes (e.g., damage caused by defects of origin and/or faulty installation), which can result in, inter alia, threats to the physical integrity of the Group's employees or third parties, repair or replacement costs of equipment, asset unavailability and consequential loss of profit or compensation to third parties. These risks are initially managed and mitigated by the various operational areas of the Group's business units, which propose and implement in an articulated manner the best practices in terms of the different policies, standards and operating procedures, inspection and regular preventive maintenance as well as crisis management plans and business continuity for catastrophic events. To this regard, it should be noted the revision of crisis management and business continuity policies in 2015, in order to ensure the continuous alignment with international best practices. Secondly, a significant portion of the remaining risk is mitigated through a comprehensive range of insurance policies (particularly in terms of property damage, civil liability, and the environment), insured in an integrated manner through a special area for this field the Insurable Risks’ Unit. This approach ensures consistency in the risk management policies, guarantees the dissemination of best practices and strengthens the negotiating position of the Group. The existing insurance policies contribute to significantly mitigate the impact of large-scale events (e.g., associated with extreme and comprehensive weather phenomena, non-availability of revenue generating assets or significant compensation to third parties) as well as much less frequent incidents with catastrophic impact (e.g., earthquakes). • Regarding operating losses, the EDP Group is, firstly, liable for regulatory penalties if it does not meet the objectives set for distribution efficiency (technical losses) and also, on the other hand, for the loss of revenue associated with increased consumption of non-invoiced energy (non-technical losses). The various energy distribution business units (EDP Distribuição, EDP Gás, HC Energía, Naturgas Energía, Bandeirante and Escelsa) are responsible for this risk. Programs are continuously developed to monitor and mitigate this risk (including the launch of comprehensive programs to combat fraud). • Process implementation risks, associated with irregularities in the implementation of various processes (particularly, but not limited to, commercial activities, supplier selection and management, billing and collection from customers, planning and budgeting of activities). This risk is monitored by the various business units. Its mitigation regarding financial reporting is controlled through the group-wide Financial Reporting Internal Control System (SCIRF), which systematically assess both quantitatively and qualitatively the existence and adequacy of the design and documentation of the various existing processes, as well as their internal control mechanisms, based on annual cycles. • Personnel risks, associated with incidents impacting on the physical integrity of employees, the impact of unethical conduct and labour and trade union relations. • Regarding incidents impacting on the physical integrity of employees, the Group directs its activity around a zero accident culture, with awareness of employees concerning the risks involved in the various activities, as well as continuous identification and implementation of best practices for the prevention and meticulous analysis of incidents. • Regarding potentially unethical conduct by employees or other associated entities, the EDP Group regularly develops a training course (for all employees) on ethical models of conduct and behaviour in the presence of transgressions in the ethical domain. This risk is monitored by the Office of the EDP Ethics 211 Ombudsman, which is an independent entity responsible for collecting, analysing and assessing in the Ethics Committee all allegations of unethical conduct, under strict conditions of confidentiality and protection of the respective sources. Moreover, the EDP Group Ethics Committee is responsible for establishing the action lines to mitigate and penalise unethical conduct, whenever necessary, according to the facts collected and reported by the Ombudsman. • Information systems risks, associated with both the non-availability of management information systems as well as failures in the integrity and security of their data. These risks are managed by specialized areas within each of the business units (centralized in the Information Systems Department for Portugal and Spain). Criticality and maximum unavailability times permissible for each of the main families of applications have been established for their mitigation, in close coordination with the various Business Units (end users). Disaster recovery redundant systems been sized and implemented to address the business specifications (particularly demanding for the associated critical systems, e.g., the implementation of financial transactions, communication and grid operation and trading of energy). Business Units with operational information systems (i.e., EDP Produção and EDP Distribuição) have specialized teams to guarantee the security and integrity of systems. • Litigation risks, associated with losses arising from non-compliance with existing tax, labour, administrative, or civil legislation, or any other, that has an economic (penalties, compensation and agreements) and reputation impact. EDP Group analyses, monitors and reports the aggregate exposure and material developments to all relevant bodies, whether at the level of the Board of Directors or the General and Supervisory Board. In addition to overall exposure and by country, all cases deemed to be of a material nature (contingency over EUR 2.5 million) are collected, analysed and reported individually. All ongoing processes are evaluated and classified individually as probable, possible or remote, according to their probability of resulting in a negative impact on the EDP Group. EDP and its subsidiaries' board of directors, based on the information provided by legal advisors and on the analysis of pending law suits, recognises provisions to cover the losses estimated as probable, related with litigations in progress. This treatment includes not only ongoing disputes (litigation in courts), but also the main contingencies in dispute and not materialised (and which may also translate into a negative impact, either through decision by the court or by out of court settlement). 54. Identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment and monitoring of risks Given the size of EDP Group and its geographical diversity, it is important to define a common process for all Business Units that recognises and manages the heterogeneity of businesses and activities in which the Group operates. Accordingly, risk management in the EDP Group can be divided into 5 major integrated and structured phases (identification, analysis, evaluation, treatment and monitoring), complemented by a previous phase of establishment of context, and adequate levels of communication between all stakeholders: 212 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP Group’s Risk Management Process • The identification of risks concerns the survey and update of the main risks associated with the Group's business, as well as their representation in a structured repository – the taxonomy of risks. Each of the Business Unit and Corporate Departments is primarily responsible for this exercise, within their scope. The Risk Management Department, in coordination with risk-officers, is responsible for the validating and integrating the different exercises and for obtaining and maintaining a global perspective (at the EDP Group level). The Group recently updated its top-down global risk map, based on interviews and in conjunction with the Group’s main risk-owners. More recently, it also developed a reference taxonomy of risks, promoting a common language and facilitating the structure of different exercises for risk identification across all Business Units. • The analysis of risks concerns the establishment of criteria to assess its nature and order of relative magnitude, as well as the analysis of individual and aggregated exposition according to the defined criteria. Each Business Unit and Corporate Department is primarily responsible for this exercise, within their scope of activity, being supported by the Risk Management Department, in coordination with risk-officers, namely through the development of adequate methodologies. This standardization and systematization of analysis and assessment criteria helps make risks of a heterogeneous nature comparable, informs the various decision makers of the orders of magnitude of the various risks and guides the prioritization of management and mitigation initiatives and the definition of clear risk 213 management policies at various levels (including the definition of limits). In addition to this perspective, risk-return analyses are performed systematically (based on EBITDA@Risk, CF@Risk or other methods) associated with the main strategic guidelines and decisions of the Group (e.g., regarding the Group’s Strategic Plan, key investment decisions or other topics deemed to be relevant). • The evaluation of risks is related to the comparison between the risk profile and the risk appetite, tolerance and capacity of the Group (stated both implicitly or explicitly), as well as on the definition of adequate strategies for treatment, when necessary. This exercise is responsibility of the Executive Board of Directors and Business Units, supported by the risk-officers, who act in coordination with the business operation (or risk-owners) and the Risk Management Department (leaded by the Chief Risk-Officer). It is important to highlight the recent formalization of EDP Group’s risk appetite statement, with the external objective of structuring a holistic narrative around the strategic pillar of controlled risk, as well as the internal objective of promoting a reflection on the risk-return tradeoff of strategic options. • The treatment of risks concerns the adequate implementation of the risk strategies previously established, including the definition of adequate mechanisms of control. This exercise is responsibility of each Business Unit and Corporate Department, within the scope of their activity. • The monitoring of risks ensures the effectiveness of action on identified risks, both in terms of control and periodic reporting of the Group’s position as regards several risk factors, as well as the effective implementation of the policies, standards and procedures established for risk management. This role is ensured by the Boards of Directors of the various Group Business Units. The Risk Management Department and risk-officers are responsible for promoting and enhancing risk control and management measures, disseminating best practices and supporting the disclosure of concepts, methods, risk measures and key risk indicators (KRI). Additionally, the Risk Management Department, supported by the network of risk-officers, develops a set of bi-weekly or quarterly reports sent to the Executive Board of Directors and to the Board of Directors of each Business Unit. 55. Main features of the risk management and internal control systems in place in the company for the disclosure of financial information EDP Group has incorporated, into its management, the Internal Control System of Financial Reporting (SCIRF), based on criteria established by the regulatory framework of internal control issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013), in relation to business processes and entity level controls, and the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT), in relation to the general controls of information technology. According to the adopted methodology and approved responsibilities model, activities were carried out related to the development, monitoring and maintaining of the internal control system, within the competence of those responsible that participating in it at the corporate level, entrepreneurial units and business units level (business and shared services units companies). As part of the activities related to to evolution, quality and strengthening of the internal control system, the topics regarding the analysis of financial and fraud risks related to financial reporting were strengthened, in view of the continuous improvement of the system.

Remuneration I. Power to set Remuneration 66. Power to set the remuneration of corporate bodies and company directors Pursuant to the Articles of Association, payments to the company officers are fixed by a Remuneration Committee appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, with the exception of the remuneration to members of the Executive Board of Directors, which is fixed by a Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board. When establishing the remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board and Statutory Auditor, the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting takes account of its fixed nature and the imperative rules on its determination, in particular Article 440 (2) of the Company Code, which sets out the criteria for setting the remuneration of the General and Supervisory Board, Article 374-A of the Company Code on the remuneration of members of the officers of the General Meeting and Article 60 of Decree-Law 224/2008 of 20 November on the remuneration of the Statutory Auditor. 218 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 II. Remuneration Committee 67. Membership of the Remuneration Committee, including names of the natural or legal persons hired to assist and declaration on independence of each member and consultant The membership of the Remuneration Committee of the General Meeting and of the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board is set out in Point 29. In 2016, no natural or legal persons were hired to assist any of the Remuneration Committees refered to on the previous paragraph. Therefore, no-one who provides or has provided in the last three years services to any body answering to the Executive Board of Directors or the Executive Board of Directors itself or who is currently a company consultant was hired. This statement covers any natural or legal persons that are related to them by an employment or service agreement. 68. Knowledge and experience of remuneration policy of the members of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board is composed of members of the General and Supervisory Board with qualifications and experience in remuneration policy, according to Annex I of the current Report. III. Remuneration Structure 69. Remuneration policy of management and supervisory bodies Executive Board of Directors Remuneration policy for the members of the managing body is set by the Remuneration Committee appointed by the General and Supervisory Board. This committee defined the remuneration of the directors, intending for it to reflect the performance of each member of the Executive Board of Directors in each year of their term of office (annual variable remuneration) and their performance during their term by fixing a variable component that is consistent with maximisation of EDP's long-term performance (variable multi-annual remuneration). The recommendation uses an undetermined concept whose satisfaction depends on the concrete circumstances of the issuing company and especially on its shareholders' understanding of what is reasonable in these circumstances. Interpretation of the reasonability of the relative weight of the variable remuneration against the fixed remuneration must take account of the other elements in the recommendation, particularly of orientation towards alignment of the remuneration structure with the shareholders' long-term interests. One of the natural consequences of this principle is an increase in the weight of the variable component in order to create appropriate incentives for the company's executive directors to foster sustainable growth. The relative weight of the variable remuneration against the fixed remuneration take account particularly of orientation towards alignment of the remuneration structure with the shareholders' long-term interests. As a result the weight of the variable component is higher to create appropriate incentives for the company's executive directors to foster its sustainable growth. The remuneration policy statement, as approved by the shareholders, lays down that the total variable component can reach twice the fixed component during a term of office, thereby placing a maximum limit of two-thirds of the remuneration depending on fulfilment of strict company performance goals. Variable remuneration depends on whether 219 the executive directors achieve a performance of 90% of the business plan. Only if they achieve 110% fulfilment will they receive the maximum amounts allowed by the company's remuneration policy. Variable remuneration is divided into annual, which may only reach 80% of fixed remuneration, and multi-annual, which may reach 120% of the fixed remuneration. Variable multi-annual remuneration is only paid if the goals have been met and is paid three years after the financial year in question. If the remuneration goals are fully met in a term of office, 60% of the directors' variable remuneration is deferred for no less than three years. If we compare this percentage with that set out for credit institutions and financial companies, pursuant to Directive 2010/76/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November, as it is a paradigm that was widely analysed and discussed in Europe, we find that EDP's policy on variable remuneration is equivalent to the strictest used by these entities. In accordance with the remuneration policy of the members of the Executive Board of Directors proposed by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board “a significant part of the variable remuneration” corresponding to the variable multi-annual remuneration may be a maximum of 120% of gross annual remuneration and it will be paid three years after the financial year in question. Payment of the multiannual variable remuneration is conditional on the non-realization of intentional unlawful acts, known after the completion of the evaluation and that jeopardize the sustainability of the performance of the company, being paid after the clearance and Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board approval. The remuneration policy statement approved by the General Meeting on 19 April, 2016 sets out the following: • Fixed annual remuneration – EUR 800,000 gross for the CEO, EUR 560,000 gross for the administrator responsible for finance matters and for the Chief Executive Officer of EDP Renováveis Group and EUR 480,000 for the remaining members of the Executive Board of Directors. Maintenance of directors' retirement savings plans during their term of office, at a net amount of 10% of their fixed annual remuneration. The characteristics of these retirement savings plans are set out in current legislation applicable to these financial products; • Annual variable remuneration – for each member of the Executive Board of Directors its value is limited to 80% of their gross annual fixed remuneration. The amount is determined on the basis of the following indicators for each year in office: performance of the EDP Group's total shareholder return against Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI-20, earning per share, net debt to EBITDA ratio, operational cash flow excluding regulatory receivables, and residual income. The weighted average of these indicators is given an overall weight of 80% for all members of the Executive Board of Directors, when determining their annual variable remuneration. The other 20% is based on an individual assessment by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board; • Multi-annual variable remuneration – also for each member of the Executive Board of Directors, this component may be between 0% and 120% of their fixed annual remuneration based on an annual accumulated assessment of the directors' performance in achieving economic sustainability for the EDP Group. The award of this multi-annual remuneration, although calculated on an annual basis, only takes effect if, at the end of the term of office, at least 90% of the strategic objectives have been achieved. These will be assessed on the basis of performance and comparison with defined strategic benchmarks, as well as the individual contribution of each member of the Executive Board of Directors to such performance. This payment component is fixed on the basis of the following factors: performance of total return for the Group's shareholders against Eurostoxx Utilities and PSI-20 in the term of office, performance of earnings per share in the term of office, performance of Net Debt to EBITDA ration in the term of office, performance of the sustainability index applied to the EDP Group, and performance of operational cash flow excluding regulatory receivables in the term of office. The weighted average of these indicators is given an overall weight of 65% for all members of the Executive Board of Directors, when determining their multi-annual variable remuneration. 35% of the remuneration that is determined by the qualitative internal assessment of the Executive Board of Directors by the Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board is reserved. Payment of the multiannual variable remuneration is deferred in time, for a period not less than three years, getting the appropriate payment conditional on the non-realization of intentional unlawful acts, known after the completion 220 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 of the evaluation and that jeopardize the sustainability of the performance of the company, being paid after the clearance and Remuneration Committee of the General and Supervisory Board approval. General and Supervisory Board Pursuant to the provision of the Article 440 of the Companies’ Code, the remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board is fixed, in view of their duties. The remuneration of the Chairman of the General and Supervisory Board was fixed on the basis of the almost full-time performance of his duties, unlike the rest of the members of such body. Considering the study developed by the Remuneration Committee of the General Shareholders’ Meeting in 2015, as well as the challenges the Company intended to pursue during 2016, the Commission defined the following remuneration policy guidance for the exercise began on 1st January 2016 until the term of the respective mandates: • A differentiation between the remuneration of the members of the General and Supervisory Board and those of the members of the Executive Board of Directors shall be maintained, and there will be no variable component or any other remunerative supplement for the General and Supervisoy Board. • It shall be taken into account the performance merit and the complexity of the functions performed by the members of each body, so that the cohesion, stability and development of the company is not endangered. • As to the General and Supervisory Board Chairman, it shall be particularly considered (a) the relevant duties exercised in a full-time basis (or, at least, 80% of the available time); (b) that the Chairman is not member of any relevant corporate body in listed companies; (c) that the Chairman office’s functions comprehend a strong component of institutional representation; and (d) that it also demands the selection of a public figure with a highqualified curriculum and with public recognition and prestige; • In what regards the Deputy Chairman, it shall be considered the duties and works performed by him in other committes, being expected, as mentioned, that throughout the social exercise there will be a higher clarification of the respective functions. • It is also important to distinguish other specific positions in the General and Supervisory Board, namely the participation of General and Supervisory Board members in other committees, as well as the functions in those committees. • Finally, it should be considered that, historically, the remuneration of the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting Board is similar to the remuneration attributed to a Committee Chairman. Therefore, the remuneration of the Chairman of the General Shareholders’ Meeting Board shall be aligned accordingly. The shareholders approved the statement of remuneration policy. 70. How remuneration is structured to allow alignment of the interests of the members of the managing body with the company's long-term interests and how it is based on assessment of performance and discourages excessive risk-taking As set out in the remuneration policy described in Point 69, remuneration is structured to allow alignment of the interests of the members of the Executive Board of Directors with the company's long-term interests. The time period considered for the payment of the variable component of the remuneration (gap of three years regarding the exercise at stake), the subjection of this payment to the non-performance of unlawful willful actions known after the assessment and that jeopardize the sustainability of the company’s performance, to which is added i) the utilization of qualitative criteria looking forward for a strategic perspective and of medium term in the development of the company, ii) the existence of a maximum limit for the variable remuneration and iii) the relative weight of this component in the total value of the remuneration, represent decisive elements to promote a performance of the company’s management 221 focused not only in short term goals, but also that integrates in its performance the company’s and the shareholders’ interests in a medium and long term perspective. The members of the managing body have not concluded any agreements with the company or third parties that have the effect of mitigating the risk of variability of their remuneration fixed by the Remuneration Committee. 71. Reference to a variable remuneration component and any impact of performance evaluation on this component As described above in point 69, remuneration policy in effect for 2015-2017 involves three main components: i) fixed remuneration, ii) annual variable remuneration and iii) multi-annual variable remuneration. The indicators used to assess the performance of the Executive Board of Directors in order to determine annual and multi-annual variable remuneration are as follows: Annual performance indicators The annual performance indicators aim to evaluate the Executive Board of Directors in a short term perspective. For such, stock exchange indexes are considered, as well as financial performance indicators, compared against the annual budget proposed by the Executive Board of Directors and approved by the General and Supervisory Board, having each of the budgets the business plan as a starting point. This type of performance evaluation allows the measurement of the level of fulfilment of short term objectives assumed by the Executive Board of Directors towards the shareholders. Quantitative and quantitative component and its weight KPI Weight Benchmark Description Comparison between EDP's Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and the TSR of two major indexes: the Eurostoxx utilities (SX6E, which encompasses the most important utility companies within the Total shareholder return (TSR) vs Eurostoxx 50% PSI20 25% Eurozone); and the PSI20 ( the Portuguese stock utilities e PSI20 50% SX6E market index).

Mechanisms and Procedures of Control 89. Company mechanisms for monitoring transactions with related parties The General and Supervisory Board approved objective, transparent rules on the identification, prevention and resolution of relevant corporative conflicts of interest called Framework on Handling of Conflicts of Interest, which was revised in late 2009. Following a decision made by the General and Supervisory Board, on 17 May, 2010 the Executive Board of Directors approved the rules on identification, in-house reporting and procedure in the event of conflicts of interest applicable to all EDP Group employees who play a decisive role in transactions with related parties. These rules are also available on EDP's website. As part of its improvement of governance practices, on 29 July 2010, the General Supervisory and Board approved EDP's rules on conflicts of interest and transactions between related parties, which was reviewed in 2015 and a new version was approved on 29 October 2015, available on EDP's website (www.edp.pt). This set of rules on the prevention, identification and resolution of potential corporate conflicts of interest has a wider scope of application than that set out in CMVM Regulation 4/2013. 229 The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee is responsible for supervising enforcement of the aforementioned rules and reports on its work to the General and Supervisory Board. For further information on this matter, see Point 3.5.2. of the annual report of the General and Supervisory Board. 90. Transactions that underwent controls in the year Attentive to the current reporting obligations, the Executive Board of Directors, during 2016, submitted to the General and Supervisory Board the information concerning the transactions between related parties. Such information concerned the transactions listed below: • Sale to CTG of a minority holding of wind assets of EDP Renováveis in Italy and Poland (49% of shares and shareholder loans), being the respectiva purchase and sale agreement signed in 28th December 2015. On the 27th October 2016, the financial closing of the operation occurred in which CTG, through ACE Poland S.A.R.L. and ACE Italy S.A.R.L., both fully owned by ACE Investment Fund LP (a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Hong Kong Ltd, which, in turn, is a fully subsidiary of CTG) paid approximately de € 363 million correspondent to the final price agreed between the parties. • Provision by Banco Comercial Português (BCP) to EDP Group of financial intermediary services, having integrated the syndicate of banks which acted as Joint Lead Managers and Bookrunners of the bonds issuances occurred in May and August 2016. • Sale to BCP, through assignment without recourse transactions, of around € 200 million, referent to a part of the extra cost deficit of Special Production Regime in Portugal in 2015 and to a part of the extra cost deficit of Special Production Regime in Portugal in 2016. • Acquisition to Sonatrach of natural gas under EDP Group long term supply agreements, in the approximate value of € 133 million. • Provision, by EDP Group, of electricity and gas supply services to Cementos Tutela Veguín and other companies integrated in Masaveu Group in the approximate value of € 19 million. • Provision, by EDP Group, of electricity and gas supply services to Liberbank and related companies in the approximate value of € 5,7 million. The General and Supervisory Board noted that, with basis on the cases analyzed and information provided by the Executive Board of Directors for 2016, there was no evidence that the potential conflict of interests in EDP operations were resolved contrarily to the company’s interests. At the same time, it is important to highlight Article 17(2) of EDP Articles of Association, that defines a number of matters subject to favourable prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board. This corporate body has competences to set the parameters for measuring the economic or strategic value of the operations that must be submitted for its opinion, and these were approved by the referred Board on the 18th June 2015. In this scope, during 2016 exercise, 25 operations were submitted to favourable prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board with an average value € 352 million and a maximum value of €1 000 million. Regarding the waiver of prior opinion, were submitted to the General and Supervisory Board 11 operations, with the average value of € 292 million and a maximum value of € 800 million. In what concerns operations subject to favourable prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board, 5 of them have inherent transactions with related parties (in the average value of € 299 million). Regarding operations in which there were waivers of prior opinion, 3 have inherent transactions with related parties (in the average value of € 100 million). Considering the specificities underlined to these operations, previously to the issue of a favourable prior opinion or to the waiver of a prior opinion by the General and Supervisory Board, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, always as possible, analyzed them and concluded for the non-existence of evidences that the potential conflict of interests subjacent to the operations performed by EDP have been resolved in a way contrary to the company’s interests. 230 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 91. Procedures and criteria applicable to the supervisory body's prior assessment of transactions between the company and holders of qualifying shareholdings or entities related to them in any way The current rules on the issue and waiving of a prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board, as referred previously, were approved on 18 June, 2015, along with the procedures for communication and clarifications between it and the Executive Board of Directors. Pursuant to EDP's Articles of Association, the General and Supervisory Board fixes the parameters for measuring the economic or strategic value of operations submitted to it for an opinion and sets up speedy mechanisms for issuing an opinion in urgent cases or when the nature of the subject so warrants and the situations in which this opinion can be waived (Article 21 (7)). The mechanism for waiving a prior opinion from the General and Supervisory Board may only be used in cases of exceptional urgency or if the nature of the subject so warrants, as set out in EDP's Articles of Association and the regulations of the General and Supervisory Board in effect in 2011 (current Article 13 (5)). All matters in which a prior opinion is waived are later appraised at meetings of the General and Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the General and Supervisory Board has set out strict rules on transactions between related parties in order to prevent conflicts of interest. Within this scope, it should be highlighted what is defined in the Regulation regarding “Conflicts of interests between related parties in EDP” in what concerns the procedures and criteria applicable to the supervision for previous evaluation of business between the company and qualified shareholders or any entities with whom the latter are related: For legal transactions or situations between related parties that are likely to cause a conflict of interest between those involved that will have an impact on the interests of EDP, the Executive Board has to request the preliminary opinion of the General and Supervisory Board or its waiver, and also has to provide the following information: • A brief description of the operations and obligations assumed by the parties. • A statement the procedures adopted for selecting the counterparty, particularly if the operation was based on a tender/consultation or limited tendering procedure. • In the case of a limited tendering procedure, the reasons for such decision and the measures adopted to mitigate any risks from potential conflicts of interests. • In the case of a tender/consultation, statement of the type of contact established with potential stakeholders and identify such. • In the event competitive offers existed, information on the terms of the different proposals and the reason for the choice made. • Identification of the parameters to measure the operation performed under normal market conditions for similar transactions . • Measures taken to prevent or resolve potential conflicts of interests. • Evidence, if applicable, of the multiannual nature of the operation, in which case the starting date of the selected tender/contract should be reported together with the date on which the supplies and/or services provided shall be provided or carried out. With respect to legal business or cases that exist between related parties that are likely to give rise to a conflict of interests between those involved, which could impact the interests of EDP, these should be subject to a preliminary opinion from the General and Supervisory Board: • If the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee can meet before the General and Supervisory Board meeting, an opinion from this Committee should be requested, which should be presented to the General and Supervisory Board for decision making purposes. 231 • If it is not possible for the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee to meet, the assessment of the potential conflict of interests must be made directly by the General and Supervisory Board within its decision making authority. With respect to legal business or cases that exist between related parties that are likely to give rise to a conflict of interests between those involved, which could impact the interests of EDP, which are subject to a request for waiver of the preliminary opinion from the General and Supervisory Board, at least three Members of the Committee should be consulted, and the majority have to be independent. When considering the request by the Executive Board, in the event of a request to waiver the preliminary report, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, the General and Supervisory Board or the Chairman of this Board, may recommend to the Executive Board that appropriate measures must be taken to address the potential conflict of interest. II. Business Information 92. Location of accounting documents providing information on transactions with related parties, pursuant to IAS 24, or reproduction of the information Information on transactions with related parties, pursuant to IAS 24, is set out in Note 46 of the consolidated and individual financial statements. Part II Assessment of Corporate Governance 1. Corporate Governance Code in Effect EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A. (EDP) is a listed company whose securities are admitted to trading on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon stock market. Pursuant to Article 2 (1) of CMVM Regulation 4/2013 on governance of companies issuing shares admitted to trading in a regulated market located or operating in Portugal, EDP abides by the recommendations set out in the Corporate Governance Code, as approved by the CMVM in July 2013, available on www.cmvm.pt. It has not opted to follow any other code of recommendations in this matter. This report is structured in compliance with Article 1 (4) of CMVM Regulation 4/2013, and therefore abides by the model in its Annex I, not including the sections not applicable to EDP's corporate governance model. 2. Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code The following table lists the CMVM recommendations on corporate governance established in the referred Corporate Governance Code and indicating whether or not they were adopted, in full or partially by EDP, as well as where more detailed information can be found in this report on the adoption of each specific recommendation. 232 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE DESCRIPTION IN RECOMMENDATION ADOPTION STATUS COMMENTS REPORT I. VOTING AND CONTROL OF THE COMPANY Chapter B I.1. Companies must encourage their shareholders to take part and vote in Title I general meetings, for instance by not fixing an excessively large number of Adopted shares required to have voting rights and introduce the means necessary for postal and online votes. No. 12 page 154 Chapter B I.2. Companies must not use mechanisms that hinder decision-making by Title I their shareholders, such as by fixing a deliberative quorum larger than that Adopted provided for by law. No. 14 page 156 Chapter B I.3. Companies must not set up mechanisms that result in a time lapse Title I between the right to receive dividends or subscribe new securities and the Adopted voting right of each ordinary share, unless this is duly justified by the shareholders' long-term interests. No.12 page 154 Over the past five years, the subject of statutory limitation on voting rights has already been discussed by the General Meeting of EDP on I.4. The articles of association of companies that limit the number of votes two occasions. The limitation of the number of votes set out in Article that can be held or cast by a single shareholder, individually or with other 14 of the Articles of Association reflects the will of the shareholders shareholders, must also set out that the amendment or maintenance of this of EDP expressed through resolutions of the General Meeting, in the provision must be submitted to the vote of the general meeting at least every Not Adopted defence of the company's specific interests: (i) a change of the limit five years – with no increased quorum requirement above that laid down by from 5% to 20% was approved by the shareholders at the General law – that all the votes cast must be counted without the aforementioned Meeting of 25 August 2011, involving participation of 72.25% of the limitation on this decision. capital and approval by a majority of 94.16% of the votes cast; (ii) a later increase to the current 25% was approved at the General 233 Meeting of 20 February 2012, involving participation of 71.51% of the capital and approval by a majority of 89.65% of the votes cast. The shareholders have thus been periodically called on to decide on limiting the number of votes. The continued existence of the limitation has prevailed and the reflection on the adjustment of the relevant ceiling for counting voting rights, precisely to progressively increase this level. The momentum of shareholders of the Company has thus proven to be perfectly in tune with the sense advocated in the Recommendation and sufficiently apt for pursuing its goals, avoiding rigid formulas for this review set down in the Articles of Association, which has also fostered the particularly intense scrutiny of this clause by shareholders. Chapter A I.5. No measures must be taken that have the effect of requiring payments or liability for expenses on the part of the company in the event of transfer of Title I control or a change in the membership of the management body that may Adopted interfere with the free transmissibility of shares and free appreciation by the No. 4 and 5 shareholders of the members of the management body board. page 148 234 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE DESCRIPTION IN RECOMMENDATION ADOPTION STATUS COMMENTS REPORT II.

The National Electricity System includes the activities of generation and supply of electricity under free market competition conditions (through licensing in generation and through prior registration in supply), and the activities of transmission and distribution provided through exclusive public service concessions. The management activity exercise of organised electricity markets is free, subject to authorization. The activity of logistic operation to change the electricity supplier must be independent of the other SEN entities the Entidade Reguladora dos Serviços Energéticos ERSE (Energy Sector Regulator) determined that, until it is developed the logistic and the legislation for this activity, it should be performed by the distribution operator of medium and high voltage, currently EDP Distribuição. The transmission, distribution and supply of electricity (including last resort activities and market facilitator), as well as the logistics of changes of supplier and organized markets management are subject to regulation by ERSE, which is responsible for the preparation, issuance and enforcement of regulations and for establishing the tariffs and prices related to network usage access tariffs and electricity supply for clients in the regulated market electricity tariffs charged by the Supplier of Last Resort. For transmission, distribution and supply of last resort activities, the law establishes a remuneration right fixed by ERSE, under the tariff regulations, to ensure economic and financial balance under an efficient management. Electricity transmission is ensured by the National Transportation Network (RNT) and is carried out under public service concessions, exclusively by REN Redes Energéticas Nacionais, SGPS, S.A., for a period of 50 years. The Law 83-C/2013, Law of the State Budget 2014 ( Lei do Orçamento de Estado 2014 ), approved by the Portuguese Government on 31 December 2013, introduced an extraordinary contribution applicable to the energy sector (CESE), with the objective of financing mechanisms that promote the energy sector systemic sustainability, through the establishment of a fund which aims to contribute for the reduction of tariff debt and to finance social and environmental policies in the energy sector. This contribution focuses generally on the economic operators that develop the following activities: (i) generation, transport or distribution of electricity; (ii) transport, distribution, storage or wholesale supply of natural gas; (iii) refining, treatment, storage, transport, distribution and wholesale supply of crude oil and oil products. CESE is calculated based on the companies’ net assets as at 1 January, which comply, cumulatively, to: (i) tangible assets; (ii) intangible assets, except industrial property elements; (iii) financial assets assigned to concessions or licensed activities. In the case of regulated activities, CESE focuses on the value of regulated assets if it is higher than the value of those assets. The applicable rate is 0.85% for power plants with an equivalent annual utilization of installed capacity greater than or equal to 3,000 hours, 0.565% for power plants with an equivalent annual utilization of installed capacity greater than or equal to 1,500 and less than 3,000 hours and 0.285% for power plants with an equivalent annual utilisation of installed capacity less than 1,500 hours. The exemptions include assets of wind generation, mini-hydric power plants, and power plants with licenses granted following a public tender and land comprising the public domain. The CESE system has been extended for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 by the Law 82-B/2014, of 31 December, Law of the State Budget 2015 ( Lei do Orçamento de Estado 2015 ), Law 159-C/2015 of 30 December and Law 42/2016 of 28 December. Note that, the Stability Programme 2016-2020, published in April 2016 by the Portuguese Government does not make references to CESE. The Public Finance Board (CFP) following several contacts with the Ministry of Finance, was informed that there is the assumption that CESE will continue until 2020, being reduced from 2017 to about 60% of the preditect value for 2016. 51 281 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Specific Não disponível This Decree-Law in article sector 91, foresees the transfer of concession rights of public hydric indicator for this resources of RTN to the companies holding the rights, and being subject to the payment of an economic and financial equilibrium value. The article 92 defines the calculation formula for the economic and financial equilibrium value, which was determined based on the value identified in two assessements conducted by highly reputed independent entities: Caixa Banco de Investimento, S.A. and Credit Suisse First Boston. On that basis, the Government (INAG), REN and EDP Produção signed on 8 March 2008, several service concession arrangements related to the exSEP plants for which EDP Produção paid approximately 759 million Euros (corresponding to the contractual compensation following the Dispatch 16982/07) for the extension of the period to operate the public hydric domain for an additional average period of 26 years. On 20 August 2012, the Administrative Order 251/2012 was published. This regulation replaces the previous mechanisms and establishes a new incentive scheme to energy generators. Capacity payments should contribute decisively and rationally to maintain the production capacity of electricity (availability incentive) and to perform future investment in new production capacity (investment incentive), and therefore, to ensure security supply levels that are not guaranteed by the operation of the normal market mechanisms. The availability incentive is applicable to thermoelectric power plants until the end of the operating license, beginning in the calendar year following the date of termination of the PAF ( Programa de Apoio Financeiro ). This incentive corresponds to an annual compensation of 6,000 Euro/MW/year. Investment incentive is applicable to new hydroelectric power plants and power enhancement projects, during the first 10 years after the formal recognition of their eligibility to receive the incentive. On 27 February 2013, the Administrative Order 85-A/2013 was published, approving the nominal tariff applicable to the tariff repercussion of the yearly fixed amount of the costs for maintenance of the Contractual Stability Compensation (CMEC), setting the rate at 4.72%. This rate is applicable between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2027 and reflects a costs reduction for the system of approximately 13 million Euros per year, which corresponds to a present value of 120 million Euros. This adjustment results from the application of the calculating mechanism of the interest rate related with the fixed portion set out in Decree-Law 240/2004, of 27 December, amended by Decree-Law 32/2013, of 26 February (point iv) of paragraph b) n.4 of article 5.º). The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013, that modifies the remuneration applicable to the production of electricity by mini hydro plants (PCH). Establishes that the PCH that were framed by a remuneration scheme prior to DecreeLaw 33-A/2005, of 16 February, benefit from that remuneration scheme for a period of 25 years from the grant date of the exploration license or until the expiration date of their water use license, whichever occurs first. After this 25-year period and as longer as the above mentioned license remains valid, electricity produced by these plants will be sold at market prices. Following the publication of Law 74/2013 of 4 June, which established a regulatory scheme in order to ensure the balance of competition in the wholesale electricity market, determining that the costs of general economic interest (CIEG) of the global use of the system tariff (UGS) should also be supported by the producers under the ordinary regime and other producers not included in the guaranteed return system, the Dispatch 12955-A/2013, of 10 October fixed the payment per MWh injected into the network, for each one of the power plants covered, in 3€ for on-peak hours and 2€ for off-peak, during the period from 11 October to 31 December 2013. Directive 26/2013 of 27 December, established the terms and conditions of the business relationship between those electricity producers covered by DecreeLaw 74/2013 and the operator of the transmission network. On 30 July 2015, the Administrative Order 225/2015 was published, which change the Law 74/2013 implementing rules. The impact of the designated “extra market rules” being now determined by Order of the Government member responsible for the energy. 160 282 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

On 14 September 2016, ERSE published in the Official Gazette 177, 2nd series, the Directive 15/2016 on the competitive balance scheme of The market, which wholesale chapter thefollowing determines summarizes thethe information status of EDP’s producers must send that commitments, order to ERSE inthe and specifies to allow main it to calculate objectives the values and goals associatedwith associated non-market to the achievement events occurred of the in the strategic Portuguese agenda market,with and aligned as well as the values the Principles of installed Development capacity contained of Sustainable of thein the operating licenses or production for the determination of the social tariff cost to be supported by each power-generating plant. This Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. Directive also defines the treatment to be given either in billing for the concept of net production of pumping or the billing related to the natural gas combined cycle plants for which it is provided that the application of the net power will only be made from the moment it reaches the operating threshold defined in Ordinance 225/2015 of 30 July. In 2016, the criteria of social tariff attribution was amended by Law 7-A/2016 of 30 March, Law on State Budget 2016 . This amendment allows the extension of the current number of effective beneficiaries, pursuant to Decree-Law 138-A/2010 of 28 December, as amended by Decree-Law 172/2014, of 14 November, and Decree-Law 102/2011, of 30 September, without reducing the applicable current discount. The existing social discounts, until the entry into force of this regulatory change, comprise the regime of extraordinary social support to the energy consumer (ASECE) and social tariff of 13.8% and 20% of the invoice, respectively. On 8 April 2016, Order 5138-A/2016 repeal ASECE and approved that the social tariff started to include this component. Therefore, the social discount rate supported by the social tariff was 33.8 % of the invoice from 1 July 2016. On 24 June, it was published in the Official Gazette 120, series 2, the Directive 12/2016 of ERSE that approves the social tariff in force from 1 July to 31 December 2016. Order 11946-A/2016, of 17 October, maintains the application of the social discount amount supported by the social tariff discount of 33.8% of the invoice for 2017. The social tariff is supported by the electricity suppliers under the ordinary regime and by the hydroelectric plants with capacity greater than 10MW, in proportion of the installed capacity in each electric power plant. On 8 March 2016, ERSE Directive 6/2016 was published in the Official Gazette 47, series 2, concerning the booking and reporting of power transactions by market participants in specific remuneration schemes. Such measure establishes that the producers of electricity covered by CMEC in accordance with the Commercial Relations Regulation ( Regulamento das Relações Comerciais (RRC)) and the Tariff Regulation ( Regulamento tarifário ) shall to send to ERSE information on trading transactions and orders. Following the Order 4694/2014, it was published on 5 September 2016, in the Official Gazette 170, series 2, the Order 10840/2016 of the State Energy Secretary’s Office, with the audit conclusions on the determination of an overcompensation risk in the CMEC revisibility calculation in relation to the power plants covered by this mechanism in the system services market. Given the audit conclusions, this Order determines the following: i) Maintain, until the end of the annual revisibility mechanism of CMEC, the mechanism for the calculation of the system services prices and the proportion of energy generated by CMEC power plants, established in articles 2 and 3 of the Order 4694/2014 of 21 February, from the State Energy Secretary; ii) Forward the audit report and the Monitoring Committee's opinion to ERSE for monitoring purposes regarding the above mentioned prices and, if appropriate given the results obtained in these reports, find the best regulatory and punitive ways to treat them; iii) Forward the audit report and the Monitoring Committee's opinion to the Portuguese Authority of Energy and Geology (DGEG). The Order 12378-A/2016, of 13 October, launches the review process of the remuneration model of power guarantee in order to create a market mechanism that exclusively remunerates the availability services provided by electric power producers, in line with the guidelines given by the European Commission in 2016 for capacity compensation mechanisms. The Article 169 of the Law 42/2016 of 28 December, which approves the State Budget for 2017, suspends as from 1 January 2017, the capacity payments in the modality of incentive to availability by creating a mechanism which remunerates exclusively the availability services provided by electricity generators. In addition the article 170, of the above mentioned law, determines that the final adjustment of CMEC will be determined and based on a study prepared and presented by ERSE, until the end of the first half of 2017. The value of the adjustment shall be determined in accordance with Decree-Law 240/2004, of 27 December, as amended by Decree-Law 199/2007, of 18 May, 264/2007 of 24 July, and by 32/2013 of 26 February. Distribution Electricity distribution is carried out through the National Distribution Network (RND) and consists of a medium and high-tension network and a low-tension distribution network, exclusively under public service concessions. The distribution of electricity in medium and high-tension has been concessioned to EDP Distribuição by the Portuguese Government pursuant to article 70 of Decree-Law no. 29/2006, as a result of converting the licence held by EDP Distribuição under the former regime into a concession agreement, which was signed on 25 February 2009, for a period of 35 years.

The DL 13/2014 has established that the suppliers of last resort shall, until the date to be set by ordinance, and by applying transitional rates continue to supply electricity to customers who have not hired on the open market their supply. Ordinance n.º 27/2014 has defined as the termination date of the transitional rates for this type of supplies on 31 December 2014. At 30 March 2015, Ordinance 97/2015 defined a new termination date of the transitional rates for this type of supplies on 31 December 2017. For the low-voltage segment, the Decree-Law 75/2012 of 26 March, establishes the extinction of the regulated tariffs for sales to final customers with contracted power higher or equal to 10.35 kVA from 1 July 2012, and from 1 January 2013, for customers with contracted power less than 10.35 kVA. This law also establishes a transitional tariffs system set by ERSE: (i) final customers with contracted power between 10.35 and 41.4 kVA can take advantage of this rate until 31 December 2014 ; (ii) final customers with contracted power lower to 10.35 kVA can take advantage of this rate until 31 December 2015. The Decree-Law 75/2012, also establishes, for the economically vulnerable customers, the right to join the contract on the open market or choose to keep the supply by the supplier of last resort, benefiting, in any case from discounts in the tariff access provided by law. In order to postpone the extinction of the transitional rules for the supply of natural gas and electricity to final customers with annual consumption lower or equal to 10,000 m3 and in the standard low voltage, was published the Decree-Law 15/2015, of 30 January, which predicts that the date of extinction of the transitional tariff for the standard low voltage would be set by an ordinance. Consenquently, Ordinance 97/2015, like happened for the others voltage levels, defined the extinction date for the transitional tariff as 31 December 2017. Law 42/2016, of 28 December, determined that during 2017, the Government will proceed to the extension of the deadline for the termination of these tariffs to 31 December 2020. Public Domain Assets In Portugal some fixed assets relating to electricity generation and distribution in the regulated market are subject to the public domain regime. These assets are directly related with the Group's activity, which can freely manage them, but cannot dispose of them for private commercial purposes while they are related with the public domain regime. Gas Portugal The National Natural Gas System (SNGN) basis of organization and operation, were established by the Decree-law 30/2006 of 15 February. This DL was developed by the DL 140/2006 of 26 July, that established the general basis applicable to the SNGN activities. The DL 231/2012 of 26 October, proceeds to the third amendment of DL 140/2006, changed by the DL 65/2008 of 9 April and by the DL 66/2010 of 11 June, incorporating essentially the principles of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/73/CE of 13 July, establishing common rules for the natural gas internal market. In the distribution activity for natural gas, EDP Group develops its activity in Portugal through its subsidiary EDP Gás Distribuição, S.A. EDP Group is present in the commercialization of natural gas, both in the regulated market (EDP Gás Serviço Universal) and the free market (EDP Comercial). Additionally, the Group develops the supply business of propane gas, through EDP Gás GPL, S.A. 160 284 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Therefore, according with Ordinance 97/2015 of 30 March, the extinction of the transitional tariffs for the natural gas supply to final customers with annual consumption lower or up to 10 000 m3 was set at 31 December 2017. This ordinance, also proceeds to the alteration of the extinction date of the transitional tariffs for the natural gas supply to final customers with annual consumption over to 10 000 m3, from 30 June 2015 to 31 December 2017 (amending the Ordinance 127/2014 of 25 June). On 15 June 2016, the tariffs set by ERSE were published for the years 2016-2017 and the parameters for the regulatory period 20162019. The income allowed for EDP Gás Distribuição, S.A. include the initial revaluation of its assets (with reference to 31 December 2007), approved by the Finance Ministry. The Resolution of the Council of Ministers 33-A/2016 published in Official Gazette 111/2016, 1st Supplement, Series I of 9 July 2016, creates the conditions for the automatic application of the social tariff on electricity and natural gas, determining the exchange of information between the competent services of the Public Administration. As of 1 July 2016, the social tariff is automatically applied by the suppliers. Activity in the energy sector in Spain Electricity Spain In Spain, Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico (HC Energia) is the parent company of an industrial group, EDP-España, that operates in the electricity and gas sectors. In the electricity sector, HC Energia generates, distributes and supplies electricity. Production is based essentially on traditional coal thermal power plants and, on a smaller scale, on hydroelectric and nuclear power plants. Electric Sector Regulation On 27 November 1997 the Electric Sector's Law 54/1997 was approved, which (i) implements the principles included in the Protocol signed on 11 December 1996 between the Ministry of Industry and the major electric power companies regarding greater liberalization and competition in the electricity sector and (ii) incorporates into Spanish law the provisions contained in Directive 96/92/EC on common rules for the internal electricity market. Additionally, on 6 July 2007 the Law 17/2007 of 4 July came into force, amending the Law 54/1997, to adapt it to the Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Council and Parliament of 26 June 2003 on common rules for the internal market of electricity. Law 54/1997 was updated by the Royal Decree 13/2012 of 30 March, incorporating the principles of the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July that revokes the Directive 2003/54/CE. On 27 December 2013, was published in the Official State Gazette the Law 24/2013 which replaces Law 54/1997 maintaining the principles established in previous legislation but with particular emphasis on economic and financial sustainability of the electricity sector. Generation Since 1 January 1998 electricity generation operates on a free market competition basis, which covers the purchase and sale of energy and other services related to the supply of electricity. The market structure for electricity generation has been widened by Law 17/2007 of 4 July, in order to include the forward market and the intraday market, as well as technical issues, complementary services, deviations management and non-organised markets. The organisation and regulation of the market for electric power generation is defined by Royal Decree 2019/1997 of 26 December, and its implementing standards. Electricity is paid at the system's marginal price plus a component for the adjustment services necessary to ensure an adequate supply. Additionally, the Order ITC/2794/2007 of 27 September, which revised the electricity tariffs from 1 October 2007, replaced the concept of power availability remuneration of electricity generation by the concept of capacity payments stated in article 14.5 of the Law 24/2013, which sets a remuneration of the availability service for the procurement of capacity in the medium term developed on the Order ITC/3127/2011 and the incentive to invest in long-term capacity.

However, since the adoption of the Royal Decree 9/2013, the retribution will be calculated based on the Spanish Government ten year bond yield, plus 200 basis points. These assumptions were developed in Royal Decree 1047/2013, repealing the Royal Decree 325/2008. According to the Law 24/2013 the transmission activity is performed by a single entity. There is also a distinction made between the primary transmission system (facilities> 380 kV with international networks and with extra-peninsular and insular systems) and the secondary transmission system (facilities <220 kV other than primary transmission systems and the one below with transmission functions). Distribution Law 54/1997 established that the remuneration for each company must respect criteria based on the costs needed to develop the activity, taking into account a model of characterization of distribution areas and other parameters. On 19 March 2008, the Royal Decree 222/2008 of 15 February entered into force, establishing a new system of remuneration for the electricity distribution activity and modified the system of Acometidas (system that regulates the installation that connects the distribution grid to the point of delivery of energy to the customers). This remuneration system is based on investments and increased demand of each distributor. On 1 April 2012, came into force the Royal Decree 13/2012, amending the remuneration criteria of the distribution activity related to the assets in use that are not amortised, taking as basis for their financial retribution their net amount. Additionally, the return on assets in use in the year t shall be initiated at 1 January t+2. However, since the adoption of the Royal Decree 9/2013, the distribution activity remuneration will be calculated based on the Spanish Government ten year bond yield, plus 100 basis points. during the second quarter of 2013 and 200 b.p. from 2014 forward. These principles were embodied in the new Law 24/2013 and developed in Royal Decree 1048/2013, repealing the Royal Decree 222/2008. The application of the new methodology adopted in the Royal Decree 1048/2013 was conditioned by the approval of the standard facilities list and unit investment values and operation and maintenance, which occurred with the publication of the Order IET/2660/2015 of 11 December. On 10 June 2016, the Spanish Government has published the Ministerial Order IET/980/2016, that has set the final compensation amount from HC’s electricity distribution business for 2016. In addition, new regulation has set the regulatory average remaining life of HC’s existing assets as at 31 December 2014 at 25.13 years. Consequently, HC evaluated the accounting criteria of the regulated activity, starting to recognise income according to the amortisation pace of its assets, considering the limit of 25.13 years. Supply Law 54/1997 established a progressive liberalisation of electricity supply and the introduction of supply activities to enable customers to progressively choose their suppliers and liberalising the supply market from 1 January 2003. Additionally, since 1 July 2009, distributors can no longer act as suppliers (sell electricity) acting strictly as grid operators. Law 24/2013 determines that certain consumers are entitled to be provided with voluntary prices for small consumers and last resort tariffs for reference traders. The reference traders are determined according to the criteria established in Royal Decree 216/2014. 160 286 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Competence Commission (CNMC) considering the costs of the system as defined in the Law 24/2013. Charges applicable to consumers and producers are determined by calculation methods adopted by the Government and CNMC that will serve to cover certain costs of the system, without prejudice of what is in force for the access fees of the transport and distribution networks. Temporarily, and while these methodologies are not approved, fees and charges are defined by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism. On the other hand, on 1 July 2009 the system of electricity tariffs became extinct and all consumers were transferred to the liberalised market. However, the Royal Decree 485/2009 of 3 April, provided that the consumers of low-tension, with contract capacity not exceeding 10 kW, were eligible for last resort tariff, which determines the maximum price of supply. These tariffs will be applicable by the suppliers of last resort, where EDP Comercializadora Último Recurso, S.A. is included. Law 24/2013 replaces the concept of last resort tariff by voluntary price for the small consumer and the concept of CUR by reference supplier , leaving the term tariff of last resort reserved for reducing the rate to be applied to vulnerable consumers or rate disincentive for consumers who are temporarily without supplier. The Royal Decree 216/2014 sets out the methodology for the calculation of the voluntary price for small consumer and their legal framework of contracting. Vulnerable Consumers Royal Decree 13/2012 and Law 24/2013 define vulnerable consumers as individuals who meet certain social characteristics of consumption and consumer purchasing power determined by the Ministry of Industry. Until the Ministry of Industry defines new criteria, these customers must apply the criteria defined by Royal Decree 6/2009 of 30 April on the social allowance, which is a subsidy covering the difference between the value of the Tariff of Last Resort (TUR) and the reference value. The Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 establishes that social allowance will be financed by vertically integrated companies that perform simultaneously the activities of generation, distribution and sale of electricity. Law 24/2013 maintains the established by Royal DecreeLaw 9/2013 and determines that the social allowance will cover the difference between the voluntary price for small consumer and a baseline, called tariff of last resort and will be applied by the correspondent reference supplier in the invoices of the covered consumers. Since Royal Decree 216/2014, the discount is a reduction of 25% of the value of the voluntary price for the small consumer. On 28 March 2014, the Spanish Government approved the Royal-Decree 216/2014 which establishes the structure and the calculation of the voluntary prices applicable to small electricity consumers and the legal regime under which the contracts will be indexed to the market electricity price. This Royal-Decree entered into force on 1 April, with retroactive effects to 1 January 2014. Gas Spain NG Energia, a subsidiary of HC Energia Group which operates in the natural gas distribution and supply, owns all the EDP Group's gas assets in Spain. The transport and distribution of natural gas in Spain is a regulated activity. Law 34/1998, approved on 7 October 1998, amended by Law 12/2007 of 2 July 2007, transposed to Spanish legislation the provisions of Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 26 June 2003 related with common rules for the natural gas internal market. Law 34/1998 was updated by the Royal Decree 13/2012 of 30 March, incorporating the principles set by the European Parliament and Council’s Directive 2009/72/CE of 13 July which came to revoke the Directive 2003/55/CE. The above mentioned legislation identifies the following operators in the context of the supply of natural gas by pipeline: § Gas transport companies, owners of facilities for regasification of liquefied natural gas, transport or storage of natural gas. After the publication of Royal Decree 13/2012, companies that hold the equipment from the main grid of transport must operate and manage their own grids or hand over their management to an independent operator, in the cases referred by legislation; § Distribution companies, owners of distribution facilities, whose function is to distribute natural gas by pipeline, as well as to build, maintain and operate such facilities in order to bring natural gas to the consumption points; § Suppliers, companies that have access to the facilities owned by third parties, which purchase natural gas for sale to consumers or other suppliers for the purpose of international exchanges; § Final consumers, who purchase natural gas for own consumption and direct consumers in the market, who have direct access to third party facilities. 51 287 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

On 4 July 2014, the Spanish Government approved the Royal Decree-Law 8/2014, subsequently amended by Law 18/2014, of 15 October. Thus, urgent measures were approved for growth, competitiveness and efficiency in the energy sector, in accordance with european directives. For the gas sector, the objective of this reform is to design an economical stable system, minimizing costs to consumers and eliminating the structural tariff deficit. The main measures are: i) creation of a National Energy Efficiency Fund, for which the gas and electricity suppliers companies and petroleum products traders will have to make mandatory contributions until 2020. This fund will also be provided with resources from EU funds (FEDER) and other resources allocated by the state budget; ii) definition of the mechanism of gas deficit recovery generated until 31 December 2014 for a period of 15 years and the deficit generated from 1 January 2015 for a period of 5 years; iii) aligning remuneration of regulated activities with the demand trends; iv) elimination of the distribution remuneration update based on price and review of the compensation units; and v) cut in the remuneration of regulated activities since 5 June 2014. The parameters of the remuneration of the regasification, storage, transportation and distribution of natural gas activities will be determined by regulatory periods of 6 years, subject to adjustments every 3 years. Order ETU/1977/2016, of 23 December, recognises the definitive deficit figures for the regulated activities of the gas sector for the years 2014 and 2015. The 2014 deficit recognised for all the system's financing agents is 1,025 million Euros, which will be recovered through rates and regulated prices until 2031, from which Naturgas Energia Distribuição has a 5.45% participation. On the other hand, the recognised deficit for the year 2015 is 27 million Euros, which will be recovered until 2021, and from which Naturgas Energia Distribution has a 6.38% participation. Law 2/2015 of 30 March, on the indexation of the Spanish economy, aims to establish a new index system, in order to monetary values of regulated prices do not be amended as a result of price index or formulas, affecting the determination of price updates related to the hire of meters, royalties, and periodic inspections. Until the approval of the Royal-Decree that will detail how these updates will be revised, the reference prices as the industrial index price and the consumer index price will be zero. Law 8/2015 of 21 May, which among other modifies the Law 34/1998 of 7 October, liberalize the periodic inspection service in the hydrocarbon sector, that until now was performed exclusively by the distributor, considers the connections of transport-distribution as distribution' assets and enables the Corporation of Strategic Reserves of Oil Products (CORES) to constitute strategic reserves of natural gas and promote the development of the organised market. These aspects are regulated in more detail in Royal Decree 984/2015 of 30 October. Additionally, Royal Decree 984/2015 amends the Royal Decree 949/2001 in relation to third party access regime to the natural gas system facilities allowing independent procurement of inputs and outputs for the transmission and distribution system that allows users to change the gas introduced without any restriction, which is essential for the development of the organized market of natural gas. 160 288 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The Ministerial Order IET/2736/2015, of 17 December (corrected by Ministerial Order IET/274/2016, of 29 February), established the tariffs and the revenues related with the access to the gas sector installations by third parties and the remuneration of regulated activities for the year 2016. The update of the retribution will be calculated according to Law 18/2014. Order ETU/1977/2016, of 23 December, established the tariffs and revenues associated with access to the gas sector installations by third parties and the remuneration of regulated activities for 2017, maintaining in general the values that have existed so far. Activity in the energy sector in Brazil Electricity Brazil In Brazil, the EDP Group generates, distributes and supplies electric energy through its subsidiary EDP Energias do Brasil, S.A. (EDP Energias do Brasil). In early 90s, the Brazilian electricity sector has undergone major structural and institutional changes, having migrated from a monopoly run by the State to a market model, involving private capital. This market model includes the existence of two distinct systems, the regulated system and the liberalised system. Regulated System The Regulated Contracting Environment is for the sale of electricity between generators, energy importers or retailers, selling energy to distributors who in turn, acquire energy to ensure supply to consumers. Since 2004, the main form of contracting by a distributor concessionaire is through the realization of public auctions regulated by National Electricity Agency (ANEEL). The rules of these auctions are designed so that the winner is the one with the lowest price. The distribution companies must estimate the amount of electricity to contract in auctions and they are obliged to purchase 100% of their needs respecting the condition that, market increases must be met by energy from new ventures, contracted 3 years (Auction A-3) or 5 years (Auction A-5) in advance. Failure to comply with the supply of energy to its markets may result in severe fines. Liberalised system In the liberalised market, electricity is traded among production concessionaires, independent power producers, auto-producers, agents and free consumers. In this market, the contractual conditions, such as price, duration and amount of the contract are traded freely and negotiated between the parties (Decree No. 5,163/04). Free consumers can return to the regulated system under certain conditions. Regulatory changes The Federal Government has defined changes in the electric sector through Provisional Measures. The Provisional Measure 577, published on 31 August 2012, addresses the termination of public service concessions of electricity and the temporary service, and the intervention for the suitability of the public service of electricity. This measure results in the Law 12,767 of 27 December 2012. Several significant changes in regulation regarding the electric sector occurred during 2012, such as the Provisional Measure 579/2012, in which the Federal Government presented measures to reduce electric energy bill to the consumer. The expected average reduction for Brazil amounted to 20.2% due to government actions: Concession Renewals (13%) and changes of Sector charges (7%). This measure results in the Law 12,783 of 11 January 2013. Regarding concessions renewal, the generation concessionaires in which contracts expire between 2015 and 2017 may antecipate the renewal of their concessions and shall make available their physical energy guarantee for the quotas system to be distributed proportionally to the market share of each distributor, affecting the energy acquisition contracts. The transmission concessionaires in which contracts expire between 2015 and 2017 may renew their concessions and, considering that the assets bounded to the electricity transmission service are totally depreciated, only the operation and maintenance costs will be considered for the annual allowed revenues calculation. 51 289 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Thus, the difference the revenue due to the discounts no longer will be reimbursed through the tariffs of other consumers. This decree was amended on 7 March 2013, by the Decree 9,745, which increased the costs that can be incurred with funds from the Energy Development Account CDE. Eletrobrás, the managing company of the sector funds, among them the CDE, is responsible for monthly transferring to the distribution utilities of the costs related to: generation allocated under the Energy Relocation Mechanism ERM (Hydrological Risk Quotas); replacement amount not covered by quotas (Involuntary Exposure) and the additional cost of the thermal power plants activation outside the order of merit (ESS Energy Security), occurred from January to December 2013 and the annual amounts approved by ANEEL to cover, entirely or partially, the positive balances in Conta de Compensação de Variação de Valores de Itens da Parcela A CVA , arising from the cost of purchasing electricity and System Services Charge ESS. Following the tariff readjustment process of EDP Escelsa, on 30 July 2013, Resolution 1,576/13 approved the amount of 90,670 thousand Reais. For EDP Bandeirante this process occurred on 23 October 2013 and Resolution 1,641/13 approved the amount of 237,874 thousand Reais. These values were transferred by Eletrobrás, as a lump sum to cover the positive balances of CVAs corresponding to the acquisition of electricity and the ESS, as established in Decree 7,891, with redaction of the Decree 7,945. On 12 February 2014, ANEEL, after examining the administrative appeal filed by EDP Escelsa, reviewed by the Order No. 287/2014, the Regulatory Remuneration Base (BRR) part of the 6th Periodic Tariff Review, incorporating 32 million Reais to the Gross BRR and 24 million Reais to the Net BRR. The amount was incorporated into the tariff and the values that were not received in 2013 were adjusted by the SELIC (overnight rate of the Sistema Especial de Liquidação e de Custódia) and added as financial component in the tariff adjustment of 2014. On 7 March 2014, the Decree 8,203/2014 was published, which authorizes the transfer of funds from CDE to pay the exposure costs to the spot market in the Electricity Trading Chamber CCEE in January 2014. 1.2 million Reais were allocated to Brazilian distribution companies, according to ANEEL's calculations published in Order No. 515/2014. On 13 March 2014, the Ministries of Mines and Energy (MME) and Treasury announced the following measures to support the national electricity sector: (i) Establishment of Centralized Account (Account-ACR), managed by the CCEE (Electricity Trading Chamber) with the aim of preserving the consumer tariff volatility, besides relieving distributors cash flow for 2014 expenses; (ii) 4 billion Reais of additional Financial Contribution from the National Treasury in the Energy Development Account (CDE); and (iii) performance of Existing Energy Auction of the Year A , with energy delivery in 2014, expected to be held in April and supply starting from 1 May 2014. These measures were implemented by Decree 8,221/2014, of 2 April 2014 related with the cover of the extra costs for 2014, with retroactive effects to February, which defines the financing method and the subsequent effect on electricity tariffs. This is a non-refundable contribution cost. 160 290 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

November 2015. The ACR-Account resources obtained through bank loans sold out in April 2014. Therefore, in August 2014 a new loan of 6.5 billion Reais was approved. EDP Escelsa received 596 million Reais until November, related with the months of February to October 2014, while, for the The following same summarizes chapter period EDP Bandeirante the status received million Reais. Theand 309 commitments, of EDP’s value of the Account-ACR specifies was insufficient andtogoals the main objectives cover the November associatedand December to the achievement of the ANEEL deficit, forcing to defer strategic agendapayment for 2015. and aligned with March In the 2015, CCEE Principles signed a new of Sustainable of theReais. loan of 3.4 billion Development Thus, EDP Escelsa and EDP Bandeirante received 104.2 million Reais and 64.4 million Reais, respectively, to cover the deficits of Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. November and December 2014. The amounts received by the ACR-Account to cover the 2014 deficit will be considered in the energy tariffs from the 2015 ordinary tariff processes. The existing energy auction, called Auction A , held on 30 April 2014, for the purchase of electricity from existing generation projects secured the contracting of approximately 2,046 MW of hydroelectric and thermal power plants of natural gas and biomass. The power supply starts in 1 May 2014 until 31 December 2019. Auction A aimed to meet the immediate need for energy contracting by distribution due to involuntary exposure as well as reduce the impact on tariff adjustments. Following the tariff readjustment process of EDP Escelsa, which occurred on 6 August 2014, Resolution 1,768/14 approved an index of 26.54% which 19.61% is from economic adjustment and 6.93% from the financial components adjustment. For EDP Bandeirante the tariff adjustment process took place on 22 October 2014, and was approved by Resolution 1,809/14 an index of 22.34% rate, being 15.05% the economic adjustment and 7.29% the financial components adjustment. Through Normative Resolution 613/2014 of May of 2014, ANEEL establishes the criteria for the allocation of the exceeding funds of the Reserve Energy Account CONER, which has been allocated to distributors in order to reduce the tariff deficit. From January 2015, entered into force the Flags Tariff System. This system signals to consumers the real costs of electricity generation, and consists on three flags: green, yellow and red. The green flag indicates that the cost of energy production is lower and, therefore no changes are applied to the energy tariffs. The yellow and red flags represent the increase in energy production cost, and is added an additional amount to the energy tariff. Only consumers classified as low income residential subcategory will have discount on the additional amount applied by the yellow and red flags. On a monthly basis, the operating system conditions are reassessed by the National Electric System Operator ONS, which defines the best strategy for power generation over demand. On 4 February 2015, the Tariff Flag Resource Account was established, through the Decree 8,401. Distributors should collect the proceeds from the application of this system to this account, managed by the CCEE. Proceeds are allocated to cover the costs that are not included in the distribution tariff, such as: Energy Security of the System Service Charge ESS, thermal dispatch, Itaipu hydrological risk and quotas, exposure to spot market and the Power Reserve Account CONER surplus. ANEEL should approve on a monthly basis, the transfers to the distribution companies. Any costs not covered by revenue will be considered in the next tariff process. On 27 February 2015, through Ratifying Resolution 1,859, ANEEL established the new criteria for the additional tariff and the operation of the Flags Tariff System: a) Green Flag: used in the months in which the value of the Variable Unit Cost CVU of the last plant to be dispatched is less than the amount of 200 R$/MWh; b) Yellow Flag: used in the months in which the value of the Variable Unit Cost CVU of the last plant to be dispatched is equal to or greater than 200 R$/MWh and lower than the maximum value of the Differences Settlement Price PLD, currently at 388.48 R$/MWh. For the period of 1 January to 1 March 2015, the consumption proportional increase is 1.5 R$ per 100 KWh. From 2 March 2015, the consumption proportional increase is 2.5 R$ per 100 KWh; c) Red Flag: used in the months in which the value of the Variable Unit Cost CVU of the last plant to be dispatched is equal to or greater than the maximum value of the PLD. For the period from 1 January to 1 March 2015, the consumption proportional increase is 3 R$ per 100 KWh. From 2 March 2015, the consumption proportional increase is 5.5 R$ per 100 KWh. After 1 September 2015, as determined by ANEEL Ratifying Resolution 1,945 of 28 August 2015, occured the approval of the red flag amount redution to 4,5 R$ per 100 KWh. At the same time, ANEEL accepted the request of Extraordinary Tariff Review RTE from the distributors and defined the applicable methodology. The results of the RTEs Dealers of Electricity Distribution were approved, through the Resolution 1,858. For EDP Bandeirante the application of new tariffs, from 2 March, resulted in an average increase in its customers of 25.12% and for EDP Escelsa the effect was 26.83%. As at 26 January 2016, ANEEL approved the division of the red flag in two price levels, into force from 1 February. The first level will have a value of 3 R$ per 100 kWh consumed and will be used when the CVU of the most expensive plant to be dispatched is between 422.56 R$/MWh and 610 R$/MWh; the second level will continue to be 4.50 R$ per 100 kWh consumed and will be used when the CVU of the most expensive plant to be dispatched exceeds 610 R$/MWh. 51 291 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

On 4 August 2015, ANEEL approves the Annual Tariff Adjustment of EDP Escelsa, through Resolution 1,928. The rates were increased on average by 2.04% and 1.68% for high voltage consumers and 2.29% for low voltage consumers. On 20 October 2015, ANEEL approved the result of the 4th Periodic Tariff Review of EDP Bandeirante. The average effect for consumers was 16.14%, being 17.09% for high voltage consumers and 15.37% for low voltage consumers. The portion B, designed to cover the costs of the electricity distribution business, was set at 823 million Reais, which deducted from the Other Revenue sharing results in 791 million Reais. For 2016 to 2019, the annual Productivity component (Pd) of factor X was set at 1.14%, while the transition component (T) of the same factor X was set at -0.23%. Technical losses were set at 4.59% and non-technical losses were fixed in a downward trajectory that starts at 9.83% in 2016 and ends at 8.45% in 2019. On 23 November 2015, ANEEL approved, through Normative Resolution 686/2015, changes to the tariff revision methodology on Regulatory Remuneration Base (BRR). The main changes are the following: (i) the exchange of BRR monetary adjustment index, from IGP-M (General Market Price Index), from FGV (Getulio Vargas Foundation), to the IPCA (Price Index Broad consumer), from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics); (ii) the assessment of hand labor costs and smaller components of investment through pre-approved regulatory values by type of equipment; and (iii) update of tariff transfer of systems, vehicles, and rentals. On 28 March 2016, was published Normative Resolution No. 703, of 15 March 2016, through which ANEEL changed some regulatory procedures affecting the calculation of sectorial assets and liabilities relating to: (i) Variation Compensation Account of the A items amounts (CVA) ; (ii) Energy over contracting and Short Term Market Exposure (MCP); (iii) Other financial components; and (iv) Limits of the Power Purchase Costs Transfer. The main changes with impact for the distribution companies are: (i) “glosa” calculation of the outstanding balance for power purchase CVA; (ii) exclusion of hydrological risk for the composition of contracts price in the “glosa” calculation, except for availability contracts; (iii) use of the carrying amounts of energy contracts and short-term market performance for the calculation of the outstanding balance of the power purchase CVA and for the System Service Charge (ESS) and the Reserve Energy Charge (EER); and (iv) calculation of the short-term market results through specific financial component. On 7 August 2016, ANEEL approved the result of the 7th Periodic Tariff Review of EDP Escelsa. The average effect for consumers was 2.80% and -6.18% for high voltage consumers and -0.67% for low voltage consumers. Portion B, designed to cover the costs of the electricity distribution activities was set at 862 million Brazilian Reais, which deducted from Other shared revenues results in 846 million Brazilian Reais. From 2017 to 2019, the annual Productivity component (Pd) of factor X was set at 1.15%, while the transition component (T) of the same factor X has become zero. Technical losses were set at 7.14% under the injected energy and non-technical losses were fixed at 11.45% for low voltage. On 19 September 2016, ANEEL approved, through Normative Resolution 733/2016, the conditions for the application of a new tariff, the White Tariff. 160 292 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. The adherence to this new system can be made since January 2018, as follows: (i) immediately for new connections and for consumers with average annual consumption exceeding 500 kWh/month; (ii) up to 12 months for consumers with average annual consumption exceeding 250 kWh/month; and (iii) up to 24 months for the remaining consumers. Consumers may return to the Conventional Tariff. The Provisional Measure 735/16, converted in Law 13,360 published on 18 November 2016, restructures the management of the sector funds: Energy Development Account CDE, Global Reversion Reserve RGR and Fuel Consumption Account CCC, whose values today are approximately of 20 billion Brazilian Reais, transferring this management from Eletrobrás to the Electric Energy Trading Chamber CCEE, until 1 May 2017. This Law indicates a reduction of the sector charges to determine that the Granting Authority shall submit a Structural Reduction Expenditure Plan for CDE until 31 December 2017 and also limits the fuel reimbursement for the Northern Region distributors to 3.5 billion Brazilian Reais until 2017, which are subject to budgetary and financial availability. From 2030, the cost distribution of the CDE between concessionaires and licensees will be proportional to their markets. The transition between the current allocation, which overloads the regions S/SE/MW, and the markets’ proportional allocation, will happen between 2017 and 2030. Additionally, it creates favourable conditions for the transfer of the shareholder‘s control of concessions, simplifying the bidding process and the terms of the payment to the Union. Finally, it authorizes the transfer of the Union debts to Itaipu for the end-consumers tariffs and it revokes the possibility of concessions extension for companies whose start of operations has been postponed, even if it recognizes the exclusion of the company’s responsibility. In Order 2,777, of 18 October 2016, ANEEL granted the litigation review of the non-technical losses of EDP Bandeirante by altering the values corresponding to the measured market, adding to it the consumption related to occurrences of fixed invoices and irregularities. So, a financial component, in distributor favor, of 2 million of Brazilian Reais was considered in the adjustment to be applied from 23 October 2016. In the Normative Resolution 2,158, of 18 October 2016, ANEEL approved the 2016 Annual Tariff Adjustment of EDP Bandeirante. The tariffs were readjusted by -23.53%, corresponding to the average tariff effect that will be perceived by consumers as of 23 October, 2016. Generation The generation market is based predominantly on the existence of Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between generators and distributors, with tenders to supply long-term demand, the adjustment of medium and short term and daily market for deviations, or spot market. Electricity generation in Brazil relies mostly on hydroelectric technology. Power generation plants are the object of concession, permit or registration, according to the type of plant, the power capacity to be installed and the destination of the energy. Depending on the destination of energy, power generation plants can be classified as: § Generation companies, producing electricity for public service distribution; § Independent producers (which assume the risk of the sale of electricity with distributors or directly with free consumers); § Auto-producers (energy generation for own consumption, the excess of which can be sold through an authorisation). The capacity payments of a generation plant defined by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and set out in the concession agreement or authorization act, correspond to the maximum amount of energy that can be used for commercialization through contracts, in accordance with Decree 5,163 of 2004. An unfavourable hydrological scenario could damage revenues and the results of hydroelectric production due to the lack of capacity to produce the necessary energy in order to fulfill the contractual obligations. The systemic production deficit, by national hydroelectric plants related to the Energy Reallocation Mechanism (MRE), cause the reduction of capacity of all hydropower plants in the country, through the factor known as Generation Scaling Factor GSF. This decrease compels those companies to buy energy in the free market to comply with the agreements with the consequent of a negative exposure in the spot market. 51 293 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Distribution The public service concession arrangements for electricity distribution are allocated by tender and establish rules regarding price, regularity, continuity, safety, timeliness and quality of services and supplies provided to consumers and users. These arrangements also define penalties for possible irregularities. With the publication of the Decree 8,461, of 2 June 2015, the extension of the electricity distribution concessions encompassed in the Law 12,783, of 11 January 2013, may be extended for thirty years, once meet the following criteria: (i) relative efficiency to the service quality; (ii) economic and financial management efficiency; (iii) operating and economic rationality; and (iv) moderate tariffs. The distribution concessions held by EDP Energias do Brasil, which were granted after February 1995, date of entry into force of Law 8,987, are not covered by the regulatory changes. Still, these changes are likely to influence the rules that will be applied in the renewal of these concessions. In most states, mainly in the North and Northeast, the concession area corresponds to the state boundaries. However, mainly in São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, the concessions for distribution may cover areas smaller than the state itself. In some cases, the concession area is extended beyond the geographical limits of the state where the distribution company is located. The distribution activity operates in a regulated environment, with tariffs determined in the context of incentive regulation ( price cap ) with a remuneration on the basis of the assets used in the distribution energy service (BRR). The tariff also includes a portion to cover the operating costs established from a standard company, the reference company (with costs that would be charged by an efficient operator at the concession area). The regulatory EBITDA has two parts: (i) regulatory depreciation of BRR assets and (ii) return on capital prudently invested multiplied by the regulatory WACC. Finally, the tariffs also consider the costs of acquiring energy, hiring the use of transmission and sector-based charges as costs to be included in the tariff. The tariff portion that includes the regulatory remuneration, the depreciation charge and the value of the operating costs is called portion B. The costs of buying energy, hiring of basic network and charges, set up the portion A of the tariffs as set out in the concession contracts for distribution companies. Tariffs are adjusted annually based on changes in portion A costs and in the monetary correction of portion B costs, by the Market prices index (IGPM), discounted of productivity gains (factor X). The adjustment index is calculated in such a way to pass the non-controlling cost variations of the portion A and the corrected portion B. Periodically (on average every 4 years), a Periodic Tariff Review occurs, generating the recalculation of all costs, the definition of a new BRR and a new reference company, capturing productivity gains occurred in the period between revisions. At the beginning of 2010 an addendum to the concession contracts of distribution companies was signed to ensure the neutrality of sector costs. On 25 November 2014, ANEEL made addendums to the concession contracts with brazilian electric distribution companies to reduce significant uncertainties regarding to the recognition and realization of regulatory assets/liabilities and, as a consequence, to qualify them to be recognised in the financial statements. After the addendums, it was considered that the conditions are met to recognise regulatory assets/liabilities as assets and liabilities. Therefore, on 10 December 2014, EDP Brasil signed the Fourth and Fifth Addendum to the Concession Agreement with ANEEL. 160 294 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

As one of the metigation measures for the problem of the electricity overcontracting felt by the most distributors throughout 2016, ANELL published some normative resolutions. Normative Resolution 711/2016 allowed distributors, in agreement with the production agents: to reduce, postpone or cancel energy trading agreements in the ACR (CCEARs). There is a charge or receipt of bonuses by the distributor for 3 years, depending on the contract price, in relation to the average purchase price of the distributor. In addition, there was a large number of customers that went to the ACL market, especially due to the high costs of thermoelectric generation that occurred between 2014 and 2015, with a significant impact on the over-contracting of the distributors. In this context, Normative Resolution 726/2016 was published, which made it possible the contracts devolution when the customers are in new energy trading agreements in the ACR. Normative Resolution 727/2016, in turn, and within the package of measures adopted by ANEEL regarding overcontracting, has improved the use of the New Energy Deficits and Deficit Compensation Mechanism (MCSD), with the possibility of contractual reduction by producers. The reductions will occur from the most expensive contract to the cheapest, without mechanism of charges and bonuses. With the publication of Normative Resolution 728/2016 in June 2016, the regulation of the phenomena of Voltage Imbalance, Harmonic Distortions, Voltage Fluctuations and Short-Term Voltage Variations were reviewed, with the addition of obligations that will allow the improvement of quality of the product supplied by the distributors, such as the definition of limits and reference values for the indicators, the obligation of quality studies for the energy distribution network access. In 2016, ANEEL initiated a new methodology for the supervision of electricity distribution services, focused on preventive actions, using analytical intelligence and evidence-based inspection techniques in a context of Responsive Regulation. The objective is the development of Improvement Plans, which will be monitored by the regulator. Supply The electricity suppliers that do not own electric assets, are authorised to act exclusively in the free market (ACL), selling or buying energy in quantity, conditions and prices freely negotiated. The commercialization of energy with a distributor is only possible through participation in the Auction set by the distributors , with the negotiation of contracts, for a maximum of two years, and commencement of energy delivery within a period not exceeding two years. Public Domain Assets In Brazil, fixed assets used in the distribution and the supply activities are bound to these services and cannot be removed, sold, transferred or mortgaged without the prior and express consent of the regulator (ANEEL). Activity in the Renewable Energies Sector In December 2007 the EDP Group incorporated EDP Renováveis, S.L. in Spain so as to concentrate the Group's subsidiaries in the renewable energies sector. On 18 March 2008, EDP Renováveis was converted into a public limited company. On 4 June 2008, a share capital increase of EDP Renováveis was made through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 196,024,306 shares. This share capital increase was not subscribed by the EDP Group, resulting in a dilution of the interest held in EDP Renováveis from 100% to 77.53%. The share capital increase amounted to 1,566,726 thousand Euros, of which 980,121 thousand Euros relates to the capital increase and 586,605 thousand Euros relates to the share premium.

In October 2015, the Government approved Royal Decree 947/2015 and a Ministerial Order aimed at allowing the installation of new renewable capacity through competitive tenders. On 14 January 2016, the first auction of renewables’ capacity was held. The auction was designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme that the one that applies to current installations (RD 413/2014). Following this framework, auction participants were requested to bid on the “initial investment” (CAPEX) parameter which would then, by being plugged in the formula set by RD 413/2014 determine the “Rinv” (investment premium) that would eventually be awarded. Developers were bidding to build 500 MW of wind energy and 200 MW of biomass plants. The auction was very competitive, around 5 times oversubscribed for onshore wind. EDPR was awarded 93 MW of wind energy (see note 49). In 2016 the Spanish Government announced it would carry out a new renewables capacity auction in the first months of 2017, after submitting to the CNMC a draft legislation package to articulate the process. Although the auction rules will be in line with the previous ones, there will be some differences. For example, the auction will be technologically neutral, meaning that projects based on different renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar and biomass, will be able to compete for contracts. The auction will also include control mechanisms and guarantee requirements to ensure the execution and completion of the winning projects. Projects will need to be completed by December 2019, in order to contribute to the fulfillment of the Spanish 2020 target (20% of its energy coming from renewable sources). Regulatory framework for the activities in Portugal The Portuguese legal provisions applicable to the generation of power from renewable sources are currently established by Decree-Law 189/88 dated 27 May, (subsequently amended by Decree-Law 168/99 of 18 May, Decree-Law 312/2001 of 10 December and Decree-Law 339-C/2001 of 29 December). Also relevant is Decree-Law 33-A/2005, of 16 February 2005 ( DL 33-A/2005 ), which establishes the feed-in tariff remuneration applicable to energy produced by renewable sources. The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013 that maintains the legal stability of the current feed-in tariff contracts (following Decree-Law 33-A/2005) and protects the value of the investments made by wind energy producers. However, this Decree Law granted the possibility to adhere to voluntary changes of the existing feed-in tariff. Indeed, wind generators could extend the support scheme (generally 5 or 7 years) in exchange of upfront payments or discounts on existing tariffs. EDPR chose a 7 year extension of the tariff defined as the average market price of previous twelve months, with a floor of 74€/MWh and a cap of 98€/MWh (values updated with inflation from 2021 onwards) in exchange for yearly payments from 2013 to 2020. 160 296 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

This ITC allows the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects placed in service or with the beginning of construction in 2009 and 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment, Insurance and Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was approved and includes an one year of ITC extension, which allow the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects with beginning of construction until December 2011 as long as placed in service until December 2012. On 1 January 2013, the US Congress approved The American Taxpayer Relief Act that includes an extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Congress set 31 December 2013 as the new expiration date of these benefits and changed the qualification criteria (projects will only qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2013). The legislation also includes a depreciation bonus on new equipment placed in service which allows the depreciation of a higher percentage of the cost of the project (less 50% of the Investment Tax Credit) in the year that it is placed in service. This bonus depreciation was 100% in 2011 and 50% for 2012. On 16 December 2014, the US Congress approved the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 that included an extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Congress set a new expiration date of 31 December 2014 and kept the qualification criteria (projects can qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2014). On 15 December 2015, the US Congress approved the “Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016” that included an extension of the PTC for wind energy, as well as the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Developers had until the end of 2016 to start construction of new wind farms to qualify for 10 years of production tax credits at the full level. Congress introduced a phase out for projects that start construction after 2016 and before 2020. These projects will still qualify for production tax credits, but at reduced levels. The levels are 80% for projects starting construction in 2017; 60% in 2018; and 40% in 2019. Developers of projects that start construction before 2020 may choose to claim 30% investment tax credits instead of production tax credits, subject to a similar phase out. The phase out reduces the value of the 30% investment tax credit to 24% in 2017; 18% in 2018; and 12% in 2019. Neither production tax credits nor investment tax credits are allowed for wind projects that start construction in 2020 or later. The aforementioned Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 also extended the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects. Solar projects that are under construction by the end of 2019 will now qualify for the 30% ITC. The credit is reduced to 26% for projects starting construction in 2020 and to 22% for projects starting construction in 2021. The credit drops to a permanent 10% level for projects that begin construction in 2022 or later or that begin construction before 2022, but are placed in service in 2024 or later. Projects must be placed in service by the end of 2023 to qualify for a credit above 10%. On 9 February 2016, the US Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan (CPP) announced by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on 3 August 2015, a rule to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants, which is pending judicial review. As of year-end 2016, the judicial review process is ongoing with the DC Circuit Court. Additionally, on 5 May 2016, the US Internal Revenue Service issued guidance that wind farms have 4 years from their start of construction to be placed in service and qualify for the PTC. As a result, projects that start construction prior to year-end 2019 and are placed in service prior to year-end 2023 will be eligible for the PTC. The IRS ruling also includes a provision that allows developers to secure the PTC if 5% of a project's capital components by dollar value are safe harbored in a given year and construction is complete within 4 years. Thus, if a developer safe harbors 5% of project Capex in 2016, will be qualified for 100% of the PTC if the construction is concluded until 2020. Regulatory framework for the activities in Poland On 19 February 2016 the PiS MPs party proposed a draft law on wind investments covering localization, realizations and operation of wind farms, the so-called Wind Turbine Investment Act. After a long approval process in which the renewable sector succeeded in introducing some amendments to the original draft the law was finally approved and published in the Polish Official Gazette in June 2016. The main measures of this new law include minimum distance restrictions for new wind farms and increased real estate tax burden. On the other hand, and following the delay of implementation of the RES Act Chapter 4 introduced in late December 2015, PiS’ government has introduced to Polish parliament a more comprehensive amendment proposal to the RES Act in early May 2016. After having gone through Poland’s parliamentary appreciation process the amendments were finally approved and published in late June, in line with the intentions to have the Chapter 4 in force since 1 July 2016. While keeping the core of the new auction system introduced by the new 2015 RES Act these new amendments have also introduced some modifications (namely introducing technology baskets for future tenders and improving the treatment of biomass, biogas and cofiring technologies). 51 297 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The PPI provides short-term (2018) and medium-term (2023) renewables’ capacity targets and also includes a provisional timetable of the next renewable tenders to be launched between 2017 and 2019. 2. Accounting Policies a) Basis of presentation The accompanying consolidated and company financial statements of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. reflect the results of the company's operations and its subsidiaries (EDP Group or Group) and the Group's interest in its joint ventures and associated companies, for the years ended at 31 December 2016 and 2015. EDP S.A.'s Executive Board of Directors approved the consolidated and company financial statements (referred to as financial statements ) on 2 March 2017. The financial statements are presented in thousand Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. In accordance with Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 of the European Council and Parliament, of 19 July 2002, as transposed into Portuguese legislation through Decree-law 35/2005 of 17 February, the company's financial statements and the Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and their predecessor bodies. The EDP Group's consolidated and company financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the E.U. until 31 December 2016. As described in note 49, the Group adopted in the preparation of consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2016, the accounting standards issued by IASB and IFRIC interpretations effective since 1 January 2016. The accounting policies used by the Group in preparing the consolidated financial statements described in this note were adopted in accordance. The new standards and interpretations recently issued but not yet effective and that the Group has not yet applied on its consolidated financial statements, can also be analysed in note 49. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of the fair value accounting to derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale investments, except those for which fair value is not available. Assets and liabilities that are hedged under hedge accounting are stated at fair value in respect of the hedged risk. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Liabilities for defined benefit plans are recognised at the present value of the obligation net of plan assets fair value. 160 298 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The issues involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or where assumptions and estimates are considered to be significant, are presented in note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgments in preparing the financial statements. Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Change in line item on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position As at 31 December 2016, EDP Group included in Debtors and other assets from commercial activities , the previous line item Trade receivables . For comparison purposes, it was changed this line item also for the comparative period. b) Basis of consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities and results of EDP, S.A. and its subsidiaries (Group or EDP Group) and the equity and results attributable to the Group, through the investments in associates and jointly controlled entities. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group applied IFRS 3 (revised) for the accounting of business combinations. The changes in accounting policies resulting from the application of IFRS 3 (revised) were applied prospectively. Controlled entities Investments in subsidiaries where the EDP Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Until 31 December 2009, when the accumulated losses of a subsidiary attributable to non-controlling interests exceed the non-controlling interests in its equity, the excess was attributed to the Group and charged to the income statement as incurred. Profits subsequently reported by the subsidiary were recognised as profits of the Group until the losses attributable to the non-controlling interests previously recognised by the Group have been recovered. As from 1 January 2010, the due proportion of accumulated losses are attributed to noncontrolling interests, implying that the Group can recognise negative non-controlling interests. As from 1 January 2010, on a step acquisition process resulting in the acquisition of control the revaluation of any investee previously held is booked against the income statement when goodwill is calculated. On a partial disposal resulting in loss of control over a subsidiary, any participation retained is revalued at market value on the sale date and the gain or loss resulting from this revaluation is booked against the income statement, as well as any gain or loss resulting from the disposal. Jointly controlled entities EDP Group classifies an arrangement as a joint arrangement when the jointly control is contractually established. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement. After determining the existence of joint control, the Group classifies joint arrangements into two types joint operations or joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint operators) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, so the assets and liabilities (and related revenues and expenses) in relation to its interest in the arrangement are recognised and measured in accordance with relevant IFRSs applicable. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint ventures) have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, so this investment is included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of joint ventures, included under the equity method. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a jointly controlled entity, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of that entity. 51 299 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Business combinations that occurred after 1 January 2004 are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition cost corresponds to the fair value determined at the acquisition date, of the assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed including the costs directly attributable to the acquisition, for acquisitions up to 31 December 2009. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, costs directly attributable to the acquisition of a subsidiary are booked directly in the income statement. As from the transition date to IFRS (1 January 2004), positive goodwill arising from acquisitions is recognised as an asset carried at acquisition cost and is not subject to amortisation. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, the EDP Group has the possibility to book non-controlling interests at fair value or at cost, implying that the full amount of goodwill can be booked in the financial statements, including the portion attributable to the non-controlling interests, against non-controlling interests, if the first option is chosen. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates is defined as the difference between the cost of acquisition and the total or corresponding share of the fair value of the net assets acquired, depending on the option taken. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the period when the business combination occurs. The recoverable amount of the goodwill in subsidiaries is assessed annually, regardless of the existence of any impairment triggers. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. Until 31 December 2009, contingent acquisition prices were determined based on the best estimate of probable future payments, being the future changes in the estimate booked against goodwill. As from 1 January 2010, goodwill is no longer adjusted due to changes in the initial estimate of the contingent purchase price and the difference is booked in the income statement. 160 300 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

This accounting treatment is maintained for all options contracted until 31 December 2009. Until 31 December 2009, when an interest in a subsidiary was disposed, without a loss of control, the difference between the sale price and the book value of the net assets held by the Group, plus the carrying value of goodwill in that subsidiary, was recognised in the income statement of the period as a gain or loss resulting from the disposal. The dilution effect occurs when the percentage of interest in a subsidiary decreases without any sale of interest in that subsidiary, for example, if the Group does not participate proportionally in the share capital increase of that subsidiary. Until 31 December 2009, the Group recognised the gains or losses resulting from a dilution of the interest in a subsidiary following a sale or capital increase, in the income statement. As from 1 January 2010 onwards, in an acquisition (dilution) of non-controlling interests not resulting in a loss of control, the difference between the fair value of the non-controlling interests acquired and the consideration paid, is accounted against reserves. The acquisitions of non-controlling interests through written put options related with investments in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests, are recorded as a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, against non-controlling interests. The fair value of the liability is determined based on the contractual price which may be fixed or variable. In case of a variable price, the changes in the liability are recognised against the income statement as well as the effect of the financial discount of the liability (unwinding). Investments in foreign operations The financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries and associates of the Group are prepared using their functional currency, defined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. In the consolidation process, the assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Regarding the investments in foreign operations that are consolidated using the full consolidation method and equity method, the exchange differences between the amount of equity expressed in Euros at the beginning of the period and the amount translated at the official exchange rates at the end of the period, on a consolidated basis, are booked against reserves. Foreign currency goodwill arising on the acquisition of these investments is remeasured at the official exchange rate at the balance sheet date directly against reserves. The income and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated into Euros at the approximate exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences from the translation into Euros of the net profit for the period, arising from the differences between the rates used in the income statement and those prevailing at the balance sheet date are recognised in reserves. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences previously recognised in reserves, are accounted for in the income statement. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising on transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. Business combinations achieved in stages In a business combination achieved in stages, on the date of obtaining control, the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquiree (iii) the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; over the net of amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognised as goodwill. If applicable, the negative difference, after evaluating the consideration transferred, of the amount of any non-controlling interest recognised in the acquiree, the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; over the net value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement. The Group recognises the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business and the carrying value in consolidated results in Other income. Additionally, the Group reclassifies the deferred amounts in other comprehensive income relating to the previously held equity interest to the income statement or consolidated reserves, according to their nature. 51 301 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged assets and liabilities or group of hedged assets and liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. When the hedging relationship ceases to comply with the requirements for hedge accounting, the accumulated gains or losses concerning the fair value of the risk being hedged are amortised over the residual period to maturity of the hedged item. Cash flow hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives qualified as cash flow hedges are recognised in reserves. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement. When a hedging relation of a future transaction is discontinued, the changes in the fair value of derivative recognised in reserves remain recognised in reserves until the future hedged transaction occurs. When the future transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognised in reserves are recorded immediately in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge model is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. This model allows that the exchange differences recognised in the exchange differences consolidated reserves to be offset by the foreign exchange differences in foreign currency loans or currency derivatives contracted. The ineffective portion of the hedging relationship is recognised in the income statement. The accumulated foreign exchange gains and losses regarding the net investment and the related hedging instrument recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign entity is sold, as part of the gain or loss resulting from the disposal. 160 302 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Effectiveness In 2016, as far as shareholders return is concerned, EDP kept its dividend distribution policy with a dividend distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the For an hedge relationship to be classified as such, in accordance with IAS 39, its effectiveness must be demonstrated. Therefore, the year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20.

Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale investments are non-derivative financial assets which: (i) the Group intends to hold for an undetermined period of time, or (ii) are designated as available-for-sale on initial recognition. Held to maturity investments Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity that the Group intends and has the ability to hold to maturity. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of financial assets, are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell these financial assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which the transaction costs are recognised directly in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to receive their future cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially all of, the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred control over the assets. Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Available-for-sale investments are also subsequently carried at fair value. However, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired. When this occurs, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences relating to these assets are also recognised in fair value reserves if arising from shares, and in the income statement if arising from debt instruments. Interest, calculated using the effective interest rate method, as well as dividends received, are recognised in the income statement. The fair value of listed investments in active markets is based on current bid prices. The Group determines the fair value of unlisted securities through (i) valuation methodologies, such as the price of similar recent arm’s length transactions and discounted cash flow techniques, and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. After initial recognition, held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The remaining financial assets whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, with any subsequent impairment loss being booked against the income statement. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not transfer financial instruments into or out of fair value through profit or loss. 51 303 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less indicator for this sector transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. All financial liabilities are booked at amortised cost, with the exception of the financial liabilities hedged at fair value hedge, which are stated at fair value on risk component that is being hedged. g) Equity instruments A financial instrument is classified as an equity instrument when there is no contractual obligation at settlement to deliver cash or other financial asset to another entity, regardless of its legal form, and there is a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of equity instruments are recognised in equity, as a deduction to the amount issued. Amounts paid or received relating to sales or acquisitions of equity instruments are recognised in equity, net of transaction costs. Distributions related to equity instruments are deducted from equity, as dividends, when declared. Preference shares issued by the Group are considered as an equity instrument when there is no contractual obligation to redeem the shares and dividends are paid at the discretion of the Group. Preference shares issued by subsidiaries, classified as equity instruments and held by third parties, are recognised as non-controlling interests. h) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. On transition to IFRS, on 1 January 2004, the Group decided to consider as deemed cost the revalued amount of Property, plant and equipment in accordance with the Group's previous accounting policy, which was comparable in general terms to the depreciated cost determined in accordance with IFRS. Subsequent costs are recognised as property, plant and equipment only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. Repair and maintenance costs are charged in the income statement as incurred, according to the accrual principle. The Group carries out impairment tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. 160 304 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Land is notas In 2016, depreciated. Depreciationreturn far as shareholders of tangible assets is calculated is concerned, EDP kept a straight-line onits dividend distribution their estimated basis over policy useful lives, with a dividend as follows: distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the Number of year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx years Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20. Buildings and other constructions 8 to 50 The following chapter summarizes Plant andthe machinery: status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of Hydroelectric the strategicgeneration agenda and aligned with the30Principles to 75 of Sustainable Development of the Thermoelectric generation 25 to 45 Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. Renewable generation 30 Electricity distribution 10 to 40 Other plant and machinery 4 to 25 Transport equipment 4 to 25 Office equipment and tools 2 to 16 Other property, plant and equipment 3 to 50 According to IFRS, the estimate of the useful life of assets should be reviewed whenever a change in the expected economic benefits flowing from the assets occurs as well as when the technical use planned for the assets differs from previous estimates. Changes occurring in the depreciation charge for the year are accounted prospectively. At the end of December 2016 EDPR Group has changed the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 3). Capitalisation of borrowing costs and other directly attributable costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that needs a substantial period of time to be ready for its intended use or sale. The amount of interest costs eligible for capitalisation is determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on those assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the outstanding borrowings during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs begins when expenditure for the assets is being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Other expenses directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of the assets, such as cost of consumed materials and personnel costs, are also capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. Government grants Government grants are initially booked as deferred revenue, under non current liabilities only when there is reasonable certainty that the grant will be received and that the Group will fulfil the grant term conditions. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are booked in the income statement on a linear basis, on the same period in which the expenses are incurred. Grants that compensate the Group for the acquisition of assets are recognised in the income statement over the related assets useful life. Transfers of assets from customers The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) issued in November 2008, the interpretation IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 27 November 2009, being applicable for periods beginning after 31 October 2009. For EDP Group, the first period after the approval of this interpretation is the year 2010. IFRIC 18 is applicable for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of Property, plant, and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of energy. This interpretation clarifies: the conditions in which an asset is under this interpretation; recognition of the asset and its initial measurement; identification of the services identified (one or more services in exchange for assets transferred); income recognition; accounting for the transfer of money from customers. The Group adopted this interpretation for the allowances received from customers, recognising the assets received by its estimated construction cost against operating income. The assets are depreciated based on its useful life. i) Intangible assets The Group's intangible assets are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group performs impairment tests whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, the latter being calculated by the present value of the estimated future cash flows obtained from continued use of the asset and its sale at the end of its useful life. 51 305 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments under operating lease contracts are recognised as an expense in the period to which they relate. Finance leases Finance leases are recognised by the lessee, at the inception of the lease, as assets and liabilities at the fair value of the leased assets which is equivalent to the present value of the future lease payments. Lease payments include the interest charges and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. The interest charges are recognised as costs over the lease period in order to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Lessors record assets held under finance leases as leased capital, by the net amount invested in the lease. Lease payments include the financial income and the amortisation of the outstanding principal. Financial results recognised reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the outstanding net balance of the lessor. Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease Following the issuance by International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, applicable from 1 January 2006, arrangements including transactions that, although do not take the form of a lease, convey the right to use an asset in return for a payment, are recognised as leases, provided that, in substance, they comply with the requirements defined in the interpretation. k) Investment property The Group classifies as investment property, property held for capital appreciation and/or for rental purposes. Investment property is recognised initially at acquisition or production cost, including directly attributable transaction costs, and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. 160 306 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Investment property is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets (between 8 and 50 years). l) Inventories The following chapter summarizes the status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the Inventories are measured at the lower of acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is determined by using the weighted average method. CO2 licences held by the Group for trade purposes are booked as inventories and measured at fair value, at each balance sheet date, against the income statement. m) Accounts receivable Accounts receivable are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and being presented in the statement of financial position net of impairment losses which are associated. Impairment losses are recorded based on the regular assessment of the existence of objective evidence of impairment resulting from doubtful accounts receivable as of the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, being subsequently reversed through the income statement if the estimated losses decrease, in a later period. n) Employee benefits Pensions Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that grant complementary retirement benefits for age and early retirement pensions. Defined benefit plans In Portugal, the defined benefit plan is assured by (i) a closed pension fund managed by an external entity, covering responsibilities with benefits that are complementary to those provided under the Social Security System (namely retirement and early retirement pensions), and (ii) by a complementary specific provision, recognised in EDP Group company’s statement of financial position. Benefits are generally determined and assigned through the combination of one or more factors, such as age, years of service and the relevant base retribution (pensionable salary). In Brazil, Bandeirante and Escelsa have defined benefit plans managed by a closed complementary welfare entity, external to EDP Group, covering responsibilities associated with retirement and early retirement pensions, according to factors such as age, years of service and the relevant base retribution. The Group’s pension liability for each plan is calculated by independent experts annually, for each plan, at the balance sheet date, using the projected unit credit method. The discount rate used in the calculation is determined based on market interest rates of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have similar maturity to the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from: (i) differences between financial and actuarial assumptions used and actual amounts; and (ii) changes in the actuarial assumptions are recognised against equity. The increase in past service costs arising from early retirements (retirements before the normal retirement age) or plan amendments are recognised in the income statement when incurred. The Group recognises as operational results, in the income statement, current and past service costs. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is recognised in financial results. The assets of the plan comply with the recognition criteria established by IFRIC 14 IAS 19 and the minimum funding requirements established by law or by contract. Defined contribution plans In Portugal, Spain and Brazil, some companies have defined contribution social benefit plans that complement those granted by the Social Security System, under which they pay an annual contribution to the plans, calculated in accordance with the rules established in each plan. These contributions represent a percentage of the fixed and variable remuneration of the employees included in this plan and are accounted for as cost for the period in which they are due. 51 307 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Provisions for dismantling and decommissioning in electric power plants The Group accounts for provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of assets when there is a legal, contractual or constructive obligation at the end of the assets’ useful life. Therefore, such provisions have been booked for the electric power plants to cover the cost of restoring the location and land to their original condition. The provisions are calculated at the present amount of the expected future liability and are accounted for as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of those assets. Considering that, at the end of December 2016, EDPR Group changed the useful life of its wind farms from 25 to 30 years (see note 2 h and 3), the capitalisation rate (number of years) of the dismantling and decommissioning provisions has changed to 30 years with effects from December 2016. Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. p) Recognition of costs and revenues Costs and revenues are recognised in the period to which they relate regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual basis. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and costs are recognised under Other assets or other liabilities. Revenue in EDP Group arises essentially from electricity generation and energy (electricity and gas) distribution and supply activities. Revenue related to the sale of energy and access tariffs to energy distribution network is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after elimination of intra-group sales. Revenue recognition occurs when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the extent usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be reliably measured. The moment when an entity has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer varies depending on the activities carried out by the Group companies. 160 308 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The energy distribution is a regulated activity, which is remunerated through tariffs set by each country Regulatory Body (ERSE in Portugal, CNE in chapter The following Spain andsummarizes ANEEL in Brazil). the status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the In Portugal and Spain, revenue arises mainly from the sale of access tariffs, as well as from the recovery, from the commercialisation Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. entities, of the costs related to the global management activity of the system. In Brazil, revenue results from the electricity sales to final consumers, in the regulated market, based on the tariffs determined by ANEEL, which are included the use of the distribution and transport system tariff, among other components. In Portugal and Brazil, these activities are subject to public service concession arrangements (see aa)). The energy supply is carried out in regulated and non-regulated markets. In non-regulated market, revenue is recognised based on commercial agreements. In regulated market, revenue is recognised according to the tariffs determined by each country Regulatory Body. Revenue recognition includes two components: (i) energy sales already invoiced, based on actual consumption readings and/or in estimated consumption based on the historical data of each consumer; and (ii) estimates of energy supplied and not yet invoiced (energy into energy meter). Differences between estimated and actual amounts are recorded in subsequent periods. Additionally, it should be noted that, in energy distribution and supply activities, there is a tariff adjustment mechanism through which gains or losses of a certain year are recognised in the period to which they relate and recovered in the future years tariffs – Tariff Adjustments (see x)). The revenue recognition related with services rendered is based on the percentage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date. This occurs when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, when it is probable the existence of economic benefits associated with the transaction to the entity who sells, when the percentage of completion of the transaction at the reporting date can be reliably measured and the costs incurred with the transaction and the costs to be incurred to complete the transaction can be reliably measured. Whenever it is not possible to reliably measure the completion of a transaction involving services rendered, revenue is only recognised to the extent of the expenses recognised as recoverable. q) Financial results Financial results include interest costs on borrowings, interest income on funds invested, dividend income, foreign exchange gains and losses, realised gains and losses, as well as gains and losses on financial instruments and changes in the fair value of hedged risks, when applicable. Interest is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recognised on the date the right to receive is established. Financial results also include impairment losses on available-for-sale investments. r) Income tax Income tax recognised in the income statement includes current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is also recognised in equity. Deferred taxes arising from the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedge derivatives recognised in equity are recognised in the income statement in the period the results that originated the deferred taxes are recognised. Current tax is the tax expected to be paid on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred taxes are calculated in accordance with the balance sheet liability method, considering temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax basis, using the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date for each jurisdiction and that are expected to be applied when the temporary difference is reversed. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except for goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, differences arising on initial recognition of assets and liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not be reversed in the future. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to absorb deductible temporary differences for taxation purposes. 51 309 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The referred policy comprises two types of programs to be assigned to certain employees (incentive and retention programs), being the eligible beneficiaries and assignment requirements subject to the conditions established. u) Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets or groups of non-current assets held for sale (groups of assets and related liabilities that include at least one noncurrent asset) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered mainly through sale, the assets or groups of assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The Group also classifies as non-current assets held for sale, non-current assets or groups of assets acquired exclusively for its subsequent resale, that are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The measurement of all non-current assets and all assets and liabilities included in a disposal group, is adjusted in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards, immediately before their classification as held for sale. Subsequently, these assets or disposal groups are measured at the lowest between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. v) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the balance sheet date, including cash and deposits in banks. This caption also includes other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships that are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in USA. w) Operating segments The Group presents the operating segments based on internal management information. In accordance with IFRS 8, an operating segment is a Group component: (i) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses; (ii) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity's chief operating decision maker in order to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; (iii) for which discrete financial information is available. 160 310 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 x) Tariff adjustments In 2016, as far as shareholders return is concerned, EDP kept its dividend distribution policy with a dividend distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the In regulated activities, the regulator establishes, through the tariff adjustment mechanism, the criteria to recognise gains or losses of one year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20. period in future periods. The tariff adjustments accounted for in the EDP Group financial statements represent the difference between the amounts invoiced by Portuguese regulated companies (based on the applicable tariffs published by ERSE in December of the previous year) The following chapter revenue and the regulated calculated summarizes based on the status EDP’s costs. of actual The assetsand commitments, specifiesresulting or liabilities the main and goals are the tariff adjustments fromobjectives recovered associated orto returned through the of the achievement electricity and gas the strategic tariffs charged agenda and aligned with theinPrinciples to customers subsequent of periods. Sustainable Development of the Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. Decree-Law 165/2008 of 21 August recognised the unconditional right of the regulated operators of the electric sector to recover the tariff adjustments under a regime identical to the one used for the tariff deficits. Consequently, EDP Group booked under the income statement caption Revenues from energy sales and services and other Electricity and network access, the effects resulting from the recognition of tariff adjustments, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities. According to the referred Decree-Law, the tariff adjustments determined annually, will be recovered by the regulated operators even in case of insolvency or cease of operations. ERSE is the entity responsible to establish the method to ensure that the entity entitled to these rights continues to recover the tariff adjustments until its complete payment. The Decree-Law also allows the transfer of the right to receive the tariff adjustment to third parties, in whole or in part, through future electricity tariffs. Decree-Law 87/2011 of 18 July establishes the unconditional right of regulated operators in the natural gas sector to recover tariff adjustments and related interest expenses, notwithstanding the form of the future payment or situations of insolvency and cessation of operations, and allows the transfer to third parties of the right to receive tariff adjustments. The EDP Group recorded in the income statement, under the caption Revenues from energy sales and services and other Gas and network access, the effects of the recognition of tariff adjustments of Natural Gas, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities and Trade and other payables from commercial activities. y) CO2 licences and greenhouse gas emissions The Group holds CO2 licences in order to deal with gas emissions resulting from its operational activity and licences for trading. The CO2 and gas emissions licences held for its own use are booked as intangible assets and are valued at the quoted price in the market on the date of the transaction. The licences held by the Group for trading purposes are booked under Inventories at acquisition cost and measured at fair value, at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses resulting from these measurement are recognised in the income statement of the period. z) Statement of Cash Flow The Statement of Cash Flow is presented under the direct method, by which gross cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities are disclosed. The Group classifies cash flows related to interest and dividends paid as financing activities and interest and dividends received as investing activities. aa) Group concession activities in the scope of IFRIC 12 The International Financial Reporting Committee (IFRIC) issued in July 2007, IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements. This interpretation was approved by the European Commission on 25 March 2009 and is applicable for the annual periods beginning after that date. In the case of the EDP Group, the first annual period after the approval date is 2010 and, therefore, the EDP Group adopted IFRIC 12 for comparative purposes as of 1 January 2009. IFRIC 12, was applied prospectively since it was impracticable to apply it retrospectively. IFRIC 12 is applicable to public-private concession contracts in which the public entity controls or regulates the services rendered through the utilisation of certain infrastructure as well as the price for such services and also controls any significant residual interest in the infrastructure. According to IFRIC 12, the infrastructures allocated to concessions are not recognised by the operator as tangible fixed assets or as financial leases, as the operator does not control the assets. These infrastructures are recognised according to one of the following accounting models, depending on the type of remuneration commitment of the operator assumed by the grantor within the terms of the contract: Financial Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator has an unconditional right to receive certain monetary amounts regardless the level of use of the infrastructure within the concession and results in a financial asset recognition, booked at amortised cost. Intangible Asset Model This model is applicable when the operator, within the concession, is remunerated on the basis of the level of use of the infrastructure (demand risk) and results in an intangible asset recognition. 51 311 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

This anticipated return is computed based on the total anticipated benefit that the institutional investors will receive and includes the value of PTC’s / ITC's, allocated taxable income or loss and cash distributions received. The control and management of these wind farms are a responsibility of EDPR Group and they are fully consolidated in these financial statements. The upfront cash payment received is recognised under Institutional partnerships in USA and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This liability is reduced by the value of tax benefits provided and cash distributions made to the institutional investors during the contracted period. The value of the tax benefits delivered, primarily accelerated depreciation and ITC are recognised as Income from institutional partnerships on a pro-rata basis over the useful life of the underlying projects (see note 7). The value of the PTC's delivered are recorded as generated. This liability is increased by an interest accrual that is based on the outstanding liability balance and the targeted internal rate of return agreed. After the flip date, the institutional investor retains a non-significant interest for the duration of the structure. This non-controlling interest is entitled to distributions ranging from 2.5% to 6% and taxable income allocations ranging from 5% to 17%. EDPR NA has an option to purchase the institutional investor’s residual interest at fair market value during a defined period following the flip date. The financial instruments held by the institutional investors issued by the partnerships represent compound financial instruments as they contain characteristics of both financial liabilities and equity. Post flip non-controlling interests is the portion of equity that is ascribed to the institutional investor in the institutional equity partnership at flip date. This amount is reclassified from the total equity attributable to the Parent to non-controlling interests caption in the period in which the flip date takes place. 3. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements in Preparing the Financial Statements IFRS require the use of judgement and the making of estimates in the decision process regarding certain accounting treatments, with impact in total assets, liabilities, equity, costs and income. The actual effects may differ from these estimates and judgements, namely in relation to the effect of actual costs and income. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how its application affects the Group’s reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 Accounting policies. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP Group, the reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. The Executive Board of Directors believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements present fairly the Group operations in all material respects. 160 312 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 Impairment In 2016, as far as shareholders return is concerned, EDP kept its dividend distribution policy with a dividend distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the Impairment of available-for-sale investments year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20. The Group determines that available-for-sale investments are impaired when there has been a significant or prolonged decline in their fair value. The following chapter summarizes the status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the Determination of a significant or prolonged decline requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Group assesses, among other Group, the factors, demonstrating priceway normal sharethis the company’s volatility, effort assuming as to meet significant its challenges. a decline of more than 20% in listed shares. In addition, valuations are generally obtained through market prices or determined by external entities, or through valuation models that require assumptions or judgment in making the fair value estimates. Alternative methodologies and the use of different assumptions and estimates could result in different impairment losses recognised with a consequent impact in results. Impairment of long term assets and Goodwill Impairment tests are performed whenever there is a trigger that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets is less than the corresponding net book value of the assets. On an annual basis, the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The investments in subsidiaries, on a company basis, and in associates are reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering the uncertainties regarding the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill as they are based on the best information available, changes in the assumptions could result in changes on the determination of the amount of impairment and, consequently, in results. Impairment of receivables Impairment losses related to doubtful debts are estimated by EDP based on the estimated recoverable amounts, the date of default, debt write offs and other factors. Certain circumstances and facts may change the estimated impairment losses of doubtful debts, namely changes in the economic environment, economic sector trends, client’s credit risk and increases in the rate of defaults. Changes in the estimates and judgement could change the impairment test results, thereby affecting results. Fair value and classification of financial instruments Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by the price of similar recent transactions under market conditions or determined by external entities, or by pricing models based on net present value of estimated future cash flows techniques considering market conditions, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These methodologies may require the use of assumptions or judgements in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of different methodologies and different assumptions or judgements in applying a particular model, could generate different financial results and different financial instruments classification from those reported. Additionally, financial instruments’ classification as debt or equity requires judgement in the interpretation of contractual clauses and in the evaluation of the existence of a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. Contractual Stability Compensation CMEC Following a Portuguese Government decision to extinguish the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), EDP and REN agreed to the early termination of the PPAs, with effect from 1 July 2007. As a result of the PPAs termination and in accordance with the applicable legislation, a contractual stability compensation (CMEC) was granted to EDP Group. The mechanism for granting this compensation includes three types of compensation: initial compensation, compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism and final compensation. Initial compensation was recognised when the PPAs terminated as an account receivable of 833,467 thousand Euros, booked at its net present value, against deferred income. Part of the initial compensation is recognised as operating income each year against a reduction of the deferred initial compensation. According to the applicable legislation, securitisation of this amount is possible. Compensation resulting from the revisable mechanism refers to the correction of the initial compensation for each period considering the actual conditions and is recognised as a loss or gain in the period to which it relates. Final compensation will be calculated in accordance with the terms defined by the legislation relating to the termination of the PPAs, after the end of the revisable mechanism period (10 years). Interest resulting from the discount rate used is booked in the period to which it relates, based on the respective implicit rate, against income for each period. 51 313 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

In the third quarter of 2013, the Group reviewed and extended the useful life of the combined cycle plants from 25 to 35 years based on a technical study conducted by an independent entity that considered the technical availability for an additional period of 10 years. This study covered the combined cycle plants in Portugal (Lares and Ribatejo) and Spain (Castejon 1 and 3, Grupo 4 and Soto 5). At the end of December 2016, EDPR Group changed the useful life of its wind farms from 25 to 30 years. The redefinition of the useful life of the wind generation assets was based on technical, financial and economic studies (performed internally and by an independent expert) and in other considerations such as contractual or regulatory constraints. Based on these studies, it is judged reasonable and accurate to use the standard of 30 years for the entire fleet, although useful life may have some level of discrete asset variation depending on the specific site specificities. Useful lives of generation assets Hydro independent generator in Brazil The hydro generation assets in Brazil for Independent generators are amortised during their estimated useful lives, considering the existing facts and circumstances at the date of preparation of the financial statements. This includes, among other issues, EDP's best estimates of the useful lives of such assets, which are consistent with the useful lives defined by ANEEL, the respective contractual residual indemnification values at the end of each concession period, as well as related technical and legal opinions. The remaining period of amortisation and the indemnification values at the end of the concessions may be influenced by changes in the regulatory legal framework in Brazil. Tariff adjustments Portugal Tariff adjustments in Portugal represent the difference between costs and income of the National Electricity and Gas System, estimated at the beginning of each period for purposes of calculating the tariff, and the actual costs and income of the System established at the end of each period. The tariff adjustments assets or liabilities are recovered or returned through electricity tariffs to customers in subsequent periods. Decree-Law 237-B/2006 of 19 December, and Decree-Law 165/2008 of 21 August, recognised an unconditional right of the operators of the electricity sector to recover the tariff adjustments and related interest expenses, notwithstanding the form of the future payment or situations of insolvency and cessation of operations. Additionally, the legislation allows the transfer to third parties of the right to receive tariff adjustments. Therefore, under this legislation, regulated companies may provide to third parties, in whole or in part, the right to receive the tariff adjustments through the electricity and gas tariffs. In accordance with the accounting policy in force, the EDP Group books under the caption Revenues from energy sales and services and other Electricity and network access, the effects of the recognition of tariff adjustments in the electricity sector, against Debtors and other assets from commercial activities and Trade and other payables from commercial activities. 160 314 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

However, Royal Decree Law 29/2012, endorsed on 28 December, abolished the regulatory requirement mentioned in paragraph (ii) above. The direct consequence of this suppression is that access tariffs will not be related to the sufficiency of the tariffs, so there may be temporary imbalances, to be recovered in a single annual fee in subsequent years. In 2010, Royal Decree Law 14/2010 addressed the correction of the tariff deficit of the electricity sector. Under this decree, the temporal mismatch of the settlements for 2010 tariff deficits came to be considered as a revenue deficit of the electricity system and a set of measures was established so that the various industry players contribute to the reduction of the tariff deficit. These measures included the establishment of generation rates, financing plans energy efficiency savings by the generation companies and various regulatory measures that help reduce the additional costs of certain technologies in the special regime. In 2012, two decrees were adopted to reduce the tariff deficit in order to reach the limit set by Royal Decree Law 14/2010: (i) Royal Decree Law 1/2012, which temporarily suspended the inclusion of new facilities in the ‘‘pre-asignación’’ registrations maintained by the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism before the power plant is entitled to make use of the Spanish special regime; and (ii) Royal Decree Law 13/2012, which provided for reductions in the remuneration for distribution activity and an extraordinary decrease on other regulated activities. In 2014, Royal Decree Law 1054/2014, establishes the procedures for the transfer of the right to receive the deficit of 2013 from the Spanish system, as well as, the methodology to define the interest rate applicable to this deficit, which main guidelines are: (i) definition of a 15 years time frame during which the deficit amount will cumulate interest. This time frame consists in two periods: the first, which began in 1 January 2014 ending on the date of the additional liquidation of the provisional liquidation 14 of the year 2013; and the final period, from which the additional liquidation of the provisional liquidation 14 of the year 2013, is made, until 31 December 2028; and (ii) the rights to receive (base amount plus interests) are expressly recognised, with their respective taxes and will be considered as system costs. These rights can be total or partially assigned, transferred, transmitted, discounted pledged to third parties, if properly communicated to CNMC ( Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia ). Brazil On 25 November 2014, ANEEL made addendums to the concession contracts with brazilian electric distribution companies to reduce significant uncertainties regarding to the recognition and realization of regulatory assets/liabilities that existed since 2010, when the IFRS were adopted in Brazil. As a consequence, the CPC issued on 28 November 2014, the OCPC 08 (Recognition of Certain Assets and Liabilities in Accounting and Financial Reports of Electric Distribution) which determines how to treat these regulatory assets/liabilities in the financial statements. Therefore, on 10 December 2014, EDP Brasil signed the Fourth and Fifth Addendum to the Concession Agreement, where it was established that, in the case of concession termination, the outstanding balances of any failure of payment or reimbursement by the tariff (assets and liabilities), will be considered on the indemnity calculation, based on the regulator pre-established regulations. EDP Group considers, based on the issued legislation (Portugal, Spain and Brazil), that the requirements for the recognition of tariff deficits as receivables and payables against the income statement have been satisfied. Revenue recognition Energy sales revenue is recognised when the monthly energy invoices are issued, based on actual meter readings or estimated consumption based on the historical data of each consumer. Revenue relating to energy to be invoiced, regarding consumption up to the balance sheet date but not measured, is booked based on estimates that take into consideration factors such as consumption in prior periods and analysis relating to the energy balance of the operations. The use of different estimates and assumptions could affect the Group’s revenue and, consequently, its reported results. 51 315 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The Group records provisions in accordance with existing obligations to cover the present value of the estimated cost to restore the locations and land where the electricity generation units are located. The calculation of the provisions is based on estimates of the present value of the expected future liabilities. The use of different assumptions in the estimates and judgement from those referred could lead to different financial results than those considered. Measurement criteria of the concession financial receivables under IFRIC 12 In 2012, the Provisional Measure 579/12 was published in Brazil, meanwhile converted into Law 12,783/13, which determines the amount of the indenisation payable to the distribution companies regarding the assets not amortised or depreciated at the end of each concession, that should be determined based in the methodology of the new replacement value. This methodology determined an increase in the indenisation amount (financial asset IFRIC 12) of Bandeirante and Escelsa, booked under IFRIC 12 terms. The indenisation amount variation is booked against Revenues from energy sales and services and other. This amount corresponds to the difference between the new replacement value versus the historical cost. Entities included in the consolidation perimeter In order to determine which entities must be included in the consolidation perimeter, EDP Group evaluates whether it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee ( de facto control). This evaluation requires judgement, assumptions and estimates in order to conclude whether the Group is in fact exposed to the variability of returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the investee. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to a different consolidation perimeter of the Group, with direct impact on the consolidated financial statements. Business combination Under IFRS 3 (Business Combination) in a business combination, the acquirer shall recognise and measure in the consolidated financial statements the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value at the acquisition date. The difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired leads to the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a purchase at a low price (bargain purchase). The fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is carried out internally or by independent external evaluators, using the discounted cash flows method, using the replacement cost or other fair value determination techniques, which rely on the use of assumptions and estimates including macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rates, interest rates, exchange rates, discount rates, sale and purchase prices of energy, cost of raw materials, production estimates and business projections. Consequently, the determination of the fair value and goodwill or gain from a purchase at a low price is subject to numerous estimates and judgments and therefore changes in assumptions could result in different impacts on results. 160 316 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Financial Risk Management Policies Financial risk management The EDP Group’s business is exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effect of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group’s exposure to financial risks arises essentially from its debt portfolio, resulting in interest and exchange rate exposures. The status and evolution of the financial markets are analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with the Group’s risk management policy. Derivative financial instruments are used to minimise potential adverse effects, resulting from interest rate and/or foreign exchange rate risks on EDP Group's financial performance. The management of financial risks of EDP, S.A. and other EDP Group entities is undertaken centrally by EDP, S.A., in accordance with policies approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The Financial Department and the Energy Management Business Unit identify, evaluate and submit to the Board for approval, hedging mechanisms appropriate to each exposure. The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for the definition of general risk management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. As for the subsidiaries in Brazil, the management of the financial risks inherent to the variation of interest rates and exchange rates is carried out locally, according with the principles set by rules of EDP Energias do Brasil's Management and aligned with the principles/policies set by the EDP Group for this geographical area. Exchange-rate risk management EDP, S.A.'s Financial Department is responsible for managing exchange rate risk exposure resulting from foreign currency financial debt, entered into with the aim of funding the EDP Group's investments in the currency of its respective cash flows. Seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the financial costs of the EDP Group companies and, consequently, on the consolidated results, the Group resorts to exchange rate derivative financial instruments and/or other hedging structures. The policy implemented by the EDP Group consists of undertaking derivative financial instruments to hedge exchange rate risk with characteristics similar to those of the hedged asset or liability. The operations are revalued and monitored throughout their useful lives and, periodically, their effectiveness in controlling and hedging the risk that gave rise to them is evaluated. EDP Group is exposed to exchange rate risk in US Dollars (USD), Brazilian Reais (BRL), Romanian Leu (RON), Polish Zloty (PLN) and Canadian Dollars (CAD). Currently, the exposure to USD/EUR, PLN/EUR, RON/EUR and CAD/EUR exchange rate risk results essentially from investments of EDP Group in wind parks in the USA, Poland, Romania and Canada, respectively. The majority of these investments were financed with debt contracted in the respective local currency which allows to mitigate the exchange rate risk related to these assets. The Brazilian subsidiaries exposed to the USD/BRL exchange rate risk as a result of their USD debt, use derivative financial instruments to hedge this risk. Additionally, investments in the Brazilian subsidiaries of EDP Energias do Brasil, whose net assets expressed in BRL are exposed to exchange rate risks, are monitored through analysis of the evolution of the BRL/EUR exchange rate. Regarding investments in wind farms of EDP Renováveis in Brazil, the Group also contracted financial derivatives to partial cover exchange rate exposure of these assets. The exchange rate and interest rate risk on the GBP, CHF and JPY bonds issued by EDP Finance B.V. under the Medium Term Notes Program for the Issuance of Debt Instruments has been hedged as from their issuing date. Sensitivity analysis exchange rate Regarding the financial instruments that result in an exchange rate risk exposure, a fluctuation of 10% in the Euro exchange rate in relation to the following currency, as at 31 December 2016 and 2015, would lead to an increase/(decrease) in the EDP Group results and/or equity as follows: Dec 2016 Profit or loss Equity Thousand Euros +10% -10% +10% -10% USD 11,162 -13,642 -31,468 38,461 11,162 -13,642 -31,468 38,461 51 317 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Brazil Interest rate and exchange rate risk management The main tool used to monitor and control market risk in the Brazilian subsidiaries is Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is the maximum expected loss in the operations portfolio over a specific period of time, resulting from an adverse movement in the market that has a specific confidence interval. The VaR model used is based on a confidence interval of 95% and assumes a 10 day time frame for settlement of positions, based essentially on historical data. Considering the market data for the last 2 years and the observation of the relationship between the different prices and markets, the model generates a series of scenarios for changes in market 160 318 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Interest rate risk 10,392 4,870 Diversification effect -39 -240 10,380 4,832 Counterparty credit risk management EDP Group’s policy in terms of counterparty risk on financial transactions is managed through an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit rating and exposure to each counterparty, avoiding significant concentrations of credit risk. Counterparties in derivative financial instruments are institutions with high credit rating so the risk of counterparty default is not considered to be significant. Therefore, guarantees and other collaterals are not typically required for these transactions. EDP Group has documented its financial operations in accordance with international standards. Derivative financial instruments are mainly contracted under ISDA Master Agreements. The amount receivable from customers is mainly generated by operations in Portugal, Spain and Brazil, with a diversified customer base, both geographically and in terms of segments (business clients, private and public sector) and size (Supply companies, Business to Business and Business to Consumer). EDP is present in 14 countries and has more than 9.8 million customers in the electricity sector and 1.5 million customers in the gas sector, and usually the contractual relationship with the counterparty tends to be long-lasting. The maximum exposure to customer credit risk by counterparty type is detailed as follows: Thousand Euros Dec 2016 Dec 2015 Corporate and private sector: Supply companies 128,203 262,247 B2B 467,224 337,163 B2C 379,706 382,298 Other 43,428 78,026 1,018,561 1,059,734 Public sector: Debt with payment agreement 66,646 105,209 Debt without payment agreement 163,613 71,426 230,259 176,635 1,248,820 1,236,369 Trade receivables by geographical market for the Group EDP, is as follows: Dec 2016 Thousand Euros Portugal Spain Brazil USA Other Group Corporate and private sector 531,421 70,608 380,560 10,056 25,916 1,018,561 Public sector 122,596 53,171 54,492 230,259 654,017 123,779 435,052 10,056 25,916 1,248,820 Dec 2015 Thousand Euros Portugal Spain Brazil USA Other Group Corporate and private sector 513,300 122,224 384,522 4,239 35,449 1,059,734 Public sector 120,827 17,408 38,400 176,635 634,127 139,632 422,922 4,239 35,449 1,236,369 The amounts receivable from supply companies are concentrated mainly in Portugal, Brazil and EDP Renováveis Group, as follows: In Portugal, these counterparties present a significantly reduced days sales outstanding, about 20 days, and these entities are subject to the sector regulation that establishes collaterals to reduce credit risk. The collateral provided is updated based on the average of the last quarter monthly sales, which reinforces a low risk profile; In Brazil, it refers mainly to: (i) the amounts from sale of electricity to wholesale dealers and trading companies, (ii) accounts receivable relating to energy traded in the Electric Energy Trading Chamber CCEE; and (iii) charges for the electricity network access; In EDPR EU, main customers are operators and distributors in the energy market of their respective countries. Credit risk is not significant due to the limited days sales outstanding and to the quality of its debtors. Counterparty risk comes from the countries that have renewable energy incentives, and is usually seen as a regulatory risk; 51 319 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The age of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired may vary significantly depending on the type of costumer (Corporate and private sector or public sector). EDP Group recognises impairment losses based on a economic case by case analysis, according with the characteristics of the costumers. Regarding third-party receivables generated by the Group’s day-to-day business, the credit risk arises essentially from customers default, whose exposure is limited to the energy supplied until the supply interruption occurs. The very criterious credit risk analysis made for new costumers, as well as the large number of customers and their diversity in terms of sectors of activity are some of the main factors that mitigate the concentration of counterparty credit risk. EDP Group believes that the amount that best represents the Group's exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of trade receivables and other debtors, net of the impairment losses recognised. The Group believes that the credit quality of these receivables is adequate and that no significant impaired credits exist that have not been recognised as such and provided for. Liquidity risk management The EDP Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with a firm underwriting commitment with national and international financial institutions as well as term deposits, allowing immediate access to funds. These credit lines are used to complement and backup national and international commercial paper programmes, allowing the EDP Group’s short-term financing sources to be diversified (see notes 30 and 35). Energy market risk management In its operations in the non-regulated Iberian electricity market, EDP Group purchases fuel to generate electric energy and sells the electric energy generated by its plants in the organised market (OMIE and OMIP) as well as to third parties. The Group is exposed to energy market risks namely in its operations in the non-regulated market. Some electricity generating plants despite operating in the market, are subject to the CMEC legislation, and the changes in the operating margins are determined essentially by the difference between the prices in the market and the reference indexes defined in the contracts. As a result of its energy management operations, EDP Group has a portfolio of operations related to electric energy, carbon emissions (CO2) and fuel (coal and gas). The portfolio is managed through the engagement of operations with financial and physical settlement on the forward energy markets. The objective of the operations is to reduce volatility of the financial impact resulting from the managed positions and also to benefit from arbitration or positioning within the trading limits approved by the Executive Board of Directors. The financial instruments traded include swaps (electricity, coal and gas) and forwards to fix prices. The activity of energy management is subject to a series of variables which are identified and classified based on their common uncertainty characteristics (or risk). Such risks include market price evolution risk (electricity and fuel) and hydroelectric production volume risk (price and volume risk), as well as credit risk of the counterparties. 160 320 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Risks are monitored by means of a series of actions involving daily monitoring of the different risk indicators, of the operations grouped in the systems and the prudence limits defined by management area and risk component, as well as regular backtesting and supplementary validation of the models and assumptions used. This monitoring not only ensures the effectiveness of the strategies implemented, but also provides elements to enable initiatives to be taken to correct them, if necessary. The principal price and volume risk indicator used is the margin at risk (P@R), which estimates the impact of the variation of the different risk factors (price of electricity and hydrological) on the following year’s margin, P@R corresponding to the difference between an expected margin and a pessimistic scenario with a probability to occur of 5% (confidence interval of 95%) considering a time frame of 1 year. Both the volumes which are certain and those, which although uncertain, are expected, namely production of the plants and the corresponding consumption of fuel, are considered. The P@R distribution by risk factor is as follows: P@R Distribution by risk factor Thousand Euros Dec 2016 Dec 2015 Risk factor Negotiation 9,000 2,000 Fuel 50,000 20,000 CO2 8,000 10,000 Electricity 66,000 47,000 Hydrological 97,000 123,000 Diversification effect -134,000 -119,000 96,000 83,000 Regarding credit risk, the quantification of exposure considers the amount and type of transaction (e.g. swap or forward), the rating of the counterparty risk that depends on the probability of default and the expected value of credit to recover, which varies depending on the guarantees received or the existence of netting agreements.

Extraordinary Contribution to the Energy Sector (CESE) The Law no. 83-C/2013, of 31 December (State Budget for 2014), established the Extraordinary Contribution to the Energy Sector (CESE). The application of this Contribution has been extended for the years 2015 and 2016, by Law no. 82-B/2014, of 31 December (State Budget for 2015) and Law no. 159-C/2015, of 30 December (Extension of revenue provided in the State Budget for 2016). The State Budget for 2017 (Law no. 42/2016, of 28 December), determined the extension of this contribution to 2017. It should be noted that the Stability Programme 2016-2020, published in April 2016 by the Portuguese Government had already provided the duration of the CESE until 2020. This Contribution aims to finance mechanisms that promote the systemic sustainability of the energy sector, through the establishment of a fund that aims to contribute for the reduction of tariff debt and to finance social and environmental policies in the energy sector. The EDP Group companies that operate in the generation and distribution of electricity and in the distribution of natural gas (EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia, S.A., Empresa Hidroeléctrica do Guadiana, S.A., FISIGEN Empresa de Cogeração, S.A., EDP Distribuição Energia, S.A. and EDP Gás Distribuição, S.A.) are subject to CESE. CESE is calculated based on the assets value with reference to the first day of financial year 2016 (1 January 2016) which respect, cumulatively, to Tangible assets; Intangible assets, with the exception of elements of industrial property; Financial assets assigned to concessions or licensed activities. In the case of regulated activities, CESE focuses on the value of regulated assets (i.e the amount recognised by ERSE for the calculation of allowed revenues as at 1 January 2016) if it is higher than the value of the previous referred assets. Given its legal framework, CESE is not considered a deductible expense in determining the taxable income. Therefore, the Group booked under the caption Extraordinary contribution to the energy sector (CESE) in the Consolidated Income Statement, the amount of 61,630 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 62,054 thousand Euros) concerning to CESE for the year ended 31 December 2016. This contribution is also applicable to EDP Gestão da Produção de Energia, S.A. power plants that are subject to the legal regime that establishes the compensation mechanism to maintain the contractual balance, and so this contribution amount was recognised according to the Decree-Law n.º 240/2004 of 27 December. EDP Group is disputing this tax payment relying on the competent authorities. 160 334 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Group The recoverable amount of the goodwill in subsidiaries is assessed annually, as at 30 September, independently of the existence of any indicators of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use of the assets, calculated using valuation methodologies supported by discounted cash flow techniques, considering market conditions, the time value of money and the business risks. The EDP Group is composed by a significant number of subsidiaries in several locations, as mentioned in its consolidation perimeter. Therefore, the impairment tests at subgroup level are carried out for each cash generating unit (CGU) identified in each country where the EDP Group develops its activities, namely: ● HC Energia Distribution, Generation & Supply of electricity; ● HC Energia (including NG Energia Group) Distribution & Supply of gas; ● EDPR Europe – Renewable generation; ● EDPR North America and EDPR Brasil Renewable generation; ● EDP Brasil Generation, Distribution and Supply of electricity. At EDP Group level, these cash generating units are subsequently aggregated by business units, ensuring however that goodwill impairment analysis does not exceed a business segment. For the purposes of these tests, the EDP Group has defined a set of assumptions to determine the recoverable amount of the main investments by each cash generating unit, being presented by aggregation in each business units after the impairment tests carried out at each subgroup/cash generating unit. Goodwill impairment test analysis – HC Energia Group (including NG Energia) The discount rates after taxes used by the Group in the impairment test analysis range between 4.0% and 5.1% (2015: between 4.5% and 5.5% respectively). Regarding to generation business, the evaluation of the assets (power plants) considers a portfolio logic based in the future cash flow projection of the remaining useful life. In the electricity and gas distribution business the cash flow projection period considers the perpetuity of the business as assets are operating under a license with no foreseen end date. 160 342 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 The main assumptions In 2016, on which impairment as far as shareholders return tests is concerned, are as are based EDP follows: kept its dividend distribution policy with a dividend distributed of €0.185 per share. EDP share price closed 2016 year with a decrease of 13%. Considering the dividend paid in the In the generation business, the estimated energy produced by the power plants: consider the best estimate of future market demand year, EDP shares yielded a -7% shareholder return, 5 p.p. below the Euro Stoxx Utilities Index and 2 p.p. above PSI20. and total installed capacity; Prices -The of electricity, following chaptergas summarizes defined and coal werethe considering status of EDP’s market expectations thecommitments, and specifies future regarding the goals the considering curves andand priceobjectives main regulation associatedintoforce. For gas and coal the achievement prices of the were also strategic used the agenda andcontracted aligned with thefor prices future long Principles term purchases, of Sustainable namely theof Development acquisition the contracts for gas; Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. Investment costs: the best available estimates of the future investments were used in order to guarantee a regular use of existing assets, as well as the estimates that resulted from legislative changes; Operating costs: operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s historical experience and internal models; In the regulated business, namely distribution of electricity and gas, officially approved asset remuneration was used, considering the regulated mechanisms for the annual remuneration updates. In generation, the elimination of generation taxes has been considered from 2021 onwards and capacity payments have been considered from 2023 onwards; The projections for the generation and electricity distribution businesses are based on the long-term estimates of the various assumptions used in the analysis. Regarding the supply of electricity and gas businesses, long-term projections were extrapolated using growth rates that evolve at inflation rate; Discount rate: the discount rates used reflect EDP Group’s best estimate regarding the specific risks associated to each CGU. The Group has performed a series of sensitivity analyses to the results of impairment tests in some key variables, such as (i) cost of fuel and respective impact on pool price, (ii) alternative case with a less favourable regulatory context and (iii) discount rates. The sensitivity analysis results show that (i) a decrease of 5% in the cost of fuel accompanied by the expected impact in the pool prices and operation hours of the generation assets or (ii) alternative case with a less favourable regulatory context or (iii) an increase of 100 bps on the discount rate do not result in any impairment indicators. Goodwill impairment test analysis – EDP Renováveis The future cash flows projection used is the useful life of the assets (at the end of December 2016 EDPR Group has changed the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 3)) which is consistent with the current depreciation method.This projection also incorporate the long-term energy sale contracts in place and long-term estimates of energy prices, for the assets with market exposure. The main assumptions used for the impairment tests are as follows: Power produced: net capacity factors used for each CGU utilize the wind studies carried out, which takes into account the long-term predictability of wind output and that wind generation is supported in nearly all countries by regulatory mechanisms that allow for production and priority dispatching whenever weather conditions permit; Electricity remuneration: regulated or contracted remuneration has been applied where available, as for the CGUs that benefit from regulated remuneration or that have signed contracts to sell their output during all or part of their useful life; where this is not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and using external data references; New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms expected to be built in coming years, adjusted by probability of success and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections. The tests considered the contracted and expected prices to buy turbines from various suppliers; Operating costs: established contracts for land leases and maintenance agreements were used. Other operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; Terminal value: considered as a 15% of the initial investment in each wind farm, considering inflation; and Discount rate: the discount rates used are post-tax, reflect EDPR Group’s best estimate of the risks specific to each CGU and range as follows: 2016 2015 Europe 3.3% 5.6% 3.8% 6.0% United States of America 4.7% 6.7% 4.5% 6.6% Brazil 10.4%-12.8% 9.6% 11.7% Impairment tests were performed taking into account the regulation changes in each country, disclosed in note 1. 51 343 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Cumprimento Parcial L Limited Verification llllllllll Não disponível * Specific indicator for this sector Given the evolution of the national electricity sector, in particular with the liberalised market, the legislature sought to adapt the mechanism of hydrological correction account to the market conditions, and for such, issued Decree-Law 110/2010 of 14 October, which provides the termination of this mechanism by 31 December 2016 and establishes a transitional regime applicable until that date. Under the terms of this Decree-Law, the differential of hydrological adjustment should be reflected in the tariff calculation applicable to all energy consumers, to cover the variation risk of tariff costs and revenues associated to the hydrological variability in Portugal. The positive differentials of the hydrological correction account must be delivered by EDP Energias de Portugal, SA (EDP, S.A.) to the RND concessionaire, against the hydrological correction account, in benefit of the overall system usage tariff or another tariff applicable to all electricity consumers. Thus, the negative differentials must be recovered in favor of the hydrological correction account through the same tariff and delivered by the RND concessionaire to EDP S.A. The financial charges or income that have always been associated with the accumulated balance of this account are booked against results. This Decree-Law establishes that the hydrological correction account, which has always been applied to the accounts of the EDP Group, should be evidenced in EDP, S.A.'s financial position statement and the corresponding annual movements explained in the notes to the financial statements. As at December 2015, ERSE published the document “Tariffs and prices for the electricity and other services”, that integrates the annex “Income and adjustments allowed for 2016 of regulated electricity companies”, which determines that the differential of the hydrological correction to consider in the system usage tariff of 2016 amounts to 10,142 thousand Euros. This document also refers following the DL 110/2010 of 14 October, that the hydrological correction account mechanism ceases in the end of 2016. As at 31 December 2016, the amount is exclusively related to financial charges. 160 364 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

This increase in liabilities with employee benefits was measured and recognised in the income statement in the amount of 13,387 thousand Euros (see note 9). The weighted average duration of the defined benefit liabilities in Portugal is 11 years. In December 2016, following the decision and implementation of the autonomisation of the Medical Plan and Death Subsidy Plan, was made a first contribution of 81,940 thousand Euros, in line with the financing plan approved by Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority (ASF). In 2017, EDP Group estimates to make a contribution of 163,900 thousand Euros, as defined in the financing plan. Employee benefit plans Some EDP Group companies grant post-retirement benefits to employees, under defined benefit and defined contribution plans, namely pension plans that pay retirement complements of age, disability and surviving pensions, as well as early retirement pensions. In some cases healthcare is provided during retirement and early retirement, through mechanisms complementary to those provided by the National Health Service. The following is a summary of the nature of the plans and the companies covered, as well as financial and economic data of the plans: I. Defined benefit pension plans The EDP Group companies in Portugal resulting from the EDP spin-off in 1994 have a social benefits plan funded by a closed Pension Fund, complemented by a specific provision. The EDP Pension Fund is managed by an external entity as well as the management of its assets is subcontracted to external asset management entities. This Pension Fund covers the liability for retirement pension complementary benefits for age. The responsibilities for early retirement are not covered by the fund’s assets, being adequately provisioned through a specific provision. In Spain, following the revision of the collective labour agreement ( Convenio Colectivo ) signed in December 2007, HC Energia Group companies implemented an early retirement program. Bandeirante in Brazil has two defined benefit plans managed by a closed complementary welfare entity, sponsored by companies of EDP Brasil, in order to manage a set of benefit plans for employees and ex-employees of Bandeirante: DB Plan in force up to 31 March 1998, a Balanced Benefit Plan that grants Balanced Proportional Supplementary Benefits (BSPS) in the form of an annuity payable to participants enrolled until 31 March 1998, of an amount defined in proportion to accumulated past service up to that date, based on compliance with the regulatory granting requirements.

Provision for legal and labour matters and other contingencies includes provisions for litigation in progress and other labour contingencies, which are related essentially with: i) Requests for the refund of tariff increases paid by industrial consumers of the Brazilian subsidiaries Bandeirante and Escelsa in the amount of 13,443 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 9,363 thousand Euros). These requests result from the application of Administrative Orders DNAEE no. 38 of 27 February 1986 and no. 45 of 4 March 1986 Plano Cruzado, effective from March to November 1986; ii) In 2012, following the decision by the arbitration court, which partially accepted Terriminas' claim, and condemned EDP Produção to pay the amount of 1,329 thousand Euros regarding the price differential for 1985 and 1986, EDP Group has booked a provision to cover this contingency. Therefore, at 31 December 2016, the estimated liability amounts to 5,836 thousand Euros, corresponding to the indemnity discounted amount. This process is in a foreclosure stage and an appeal was filled by EDP Produção; iii) During April 2015, ERSE has notified EDP Comercial on its decision regarding the opening of an administrative infraction proceeding, within the framework of the Energy Sector Sanctions Regime (RSSE), requesting several information. In July 2015, ERSE sent a statement of objection to EDP Comercial whose response with defense arguments was prepared and submitted within the deadlines set by law. On 10 December 2015, ERSE issued a decision condemning EDP Comercial to a fine of 7,500 thousand Euros. It was decided to appeal the decision within the legal deadline set for this purpose, and a provision in the above mentioned amount has been recognised; iv) The remaining legal litigations correspond mainly to indemnities for fires, interruption of electricity supply, electrocution, as well as for other damages caused. In accordance with IFRS 3, in the course of an acquisition, the acquiring company must recognise, at the acquisition date, a contingent liability for the present obligations resulting from past events which fair value can be reliably measured. Within the process of acquisition of control of Porto do Pecém, the Board of Directors identified a contingency, which estimated responsibility amounts to 6,339 thousand Euros (21,745 thousand Brazilian Reais) as at 31 December 2016. 51 379 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

The assumptions used in the calculation of the provision include an inflation rate of 2% and discount rates between 0.35% and 0.42%. Enresa has the responsibility of decommissioning nuclear power plants, as well as of treating and accommodating radioactive waste, within three years after the conclusion of the operational activity of nuclear power plants; ii) Provisions for dismantling of wind farms of 268,191 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 117,228 thousand Euros) to cover the costs of bringing the sites to their original conditions, of which 103,638 thousand Euros refer to the wind farms of the EDPR NA Group, 162,413 thousand Euros refer to the wind farms of the EDPR EU Group, 1,504 thousand Euros refer to the wind farms of the EDPR Brasil Group and 636 thousand Euros refer to the wind farms of the EDPR Canada Group. The variation relates essentially with the net effect of: i) the extension of the useful life of the renewable assets from 25 to 30 years (see note 2 h and 3); ii) the aforementioned cost to be incurred that has been revised according to an in-deep analysis performed by the EDPR’s technical department; and iii) the update of the discount rates.

As part of the institutional collaboration, it was agreed in 2012 the rehabilitation and the conversion of 2 gas turbines of 16 MW decommissioned from Tunes Thermoelectric plant to be installed in Chokwé Mozambique in open cycle mode. In 2014, EDM requested the transfer of the project to the Nacala area, where the turbines now need to be adapted to work on diesel. It is estimated that from this conversion a negative impact of 8,006 thousand Euros will arise (31 December 2015: 8,006 thousand Euros). In their ordinary course of business, EDP Group subsidiaries are involved in several litigations and contingencies (of possible risk) of administrative, civil, tax, labour and other natures. These legal, arbitration or other actions, involve customers, suppliers, employees, administrative, central, municipal, tax, environmental or other authorities. In EDP Group and its legal advisors' opinion, the risk of a loss in these actions is not probable, and the outcome will not affect on a material way its consolidated financial position. The processes whose losses were considered as possible, do not require the recognition of provisions and are periodically reassessed.

EDP Group is convinced that this campaign has clearly benefited consumers and competition in both sectors. As at 31 December 2016, EDP Group and its legal advisors believe this is a possible contingency. However, considering the defense arguments presented and the lack of jurisprudence in this matter, the respective risk value can still not be determined; vi) Decree-Law 67/2016, of 3 November, approved an exceptional regime for regularisation of debts from fiscal and contributing nature to social security. Adherence to this regime implies a full payment of debts that allows, among other benefits, the waiver of compensatory and default interests. On the other hand, it is clear that adherence to this regime does not legally imply the acceptance of the legitimacy of the tax debt by the taxable person, nor does it prejudice the maintenance of the tax litigation, which will follow its normal course. After a detailed analysis, the EDP Group opted to adhere to this exceptional regime, through the payment of approximately 57,342 thousand Euros, which implied a reduction in tax contingencies classified as possible in the amount of 76,727 thousand Euros (which included compensatory and default interests). The possible contingencies more relevant in Brazil, are as follows: i) Bandeirante is involved in a lawsuit with the client White Martins, S.A., on the alleged existence of reflex effects of the Administrative Order 38/86 and 45/86 of the extinguished DNAEE, in the electricity tariff charged between 1986 and 2000. EDP Group classifies the risk of loss of this lawsuit as possible, considering that the customer complaint has no legal basis, in accordance with existing jurisprudence with regard to such complaints. In June 2015, the decision was favourable to Bandeirante. In December 2015, White Martins, S.A. was entitled to appeal against this decision, which did not occurred during the first semester of 2016. Therefore, the favourable decision to Bandeirante became effective, thus the process was closed (31 December 2015: 30,020 thousand Euros); ii) Investco is involved in a legal action of a civil nature mostly related with indemnity claims resulting from the filling of the hydroelectric reservoir, in the amount of 26,536 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 26,093 thousand Euros); iii) There is a public civil action filed against Bandeirante and Escelsa by ADIC – Associação de Defesa dos Interesses Colectivos, claiming a compensation arising from a tariff readjustment on part A from 43 concessionaires. The estimated value attributable to Bandeirante and Escelsa amounts to 44,047 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 28,981 thousand Euros); iv) Bandeirante is a party to a lawsuit related to the COFINS (Contribution for social security financing) from 1993 to 1995 in joinder with AES Eletropaulo, where is discussed the application of the tax amnesty introduced by the Provisional Measures paragraphs 18586 and 1858-8, granted to taxpayers who did not collect COFINS, considering it improper. In the trial of 2nd Instance, was partially confirmed the right to amnesty, and applied the Decree-Law 1,025/69, which established the payment of procedural costs in favor of the National Treasury. From that decision, was presented an appeal which holds trial. The adjusted amount as at 31 December 2016 is 21,186 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 16,355 thousand Euros); 160 382 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A. Notes to the Consolidated and Company Financial Statements for the periods ended 31 December 2016 and 2015 v) Bandeirante and Escelsa have administrative and judicial tax actions regarding compensations which were not approved by the 2016, asTax In Brazilian Authorities,which: far as shareholders (i) are supported return by judicially is concerned, EDP kept recognised credits its dividend (IRPJ Corporate distribution tax policy with income and a dividend CSLL Social distributed of Contribution €0.185 per on net profits) share. and price EDP share closed of (ii) resulted tax contributions 2016 in 2001 ofof year with a decrease IRPJ, 13%.

According with this opinion, the updating of rates derived from the RTE should be recognised since 2002. As at 31 December 2016, the estimated value amounts to 96,828 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 69,717 Thethousand Euros); following chapter summarizes the status of EDP’s commitments, and specifies the main objectives and goals associated to the achievement of the strategic agenda and aligned with the Principles of Sustainable Development of the vi) Lajeado has a judicial tax action initiated by the Brazilian Tax Authorities in 2014 aimed at collecting tax contributions (IRPJ and Group, demonstrating this way the company’s effort to meet its challenges. CSLL) resulting from the disallowance of expenses regarding goodwill arising from a business combination (acquisition). As at 31 December 2016, this contingency amounts to 24,950 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 19,064 thousand Euros); vii) Porto do Pecém was subject to a tax execution procedure in the amount of 21,225 thousand Euros, related to an alleged nontaxation under Corporate Income Tax (CIT) and Socia Contribution on Net Profits (CSLL) of prior years’ financial income and exchange rate gains (31 December 2015: 16,237 thousand Euros). Finally, it should identify relevant litigation and contingencies that although the EDP Group classify their risk as remote, namely: i) On 27 October 2009 and 5 January 2010, the EDP Group received two tax assessments regarding 2005 and 2006 taxable income for the EDP tax Group, which included an adjustment of 591 million Euros regarding its subsidiary, EDP Internacional SGPS, related to the tax treatment considered by the EDP Group in relation to a capital loss generated with the liquidation of a subsidiary, whose main assets consisted of investments in operating subsidiaries in Brazil, namely Escelsa and Enersul. As at 31 December 2016, the amount of this tax contingency totals 264 million Euros (31 December 2015: 255 million Euros). Considering the analysis made, the technical advice received and a favourable binding opinion obtained from the tax authorities in relation to the nature of the transaction occurred in the year of the assessment, the EDP Group considers as remote the risk associated with this matter. Under this analysis, the capital loss is tax deductible for income tax purposes as established in article 75 number 2 of the Corporate Income Tax Code ( Código do IRC ) based on the wording of the law in force at that date (actual article 81). Bearing the above in mind, and given that the EDP Group’s tax procedures comply with applicable Portuguese tax legislation at the date of the events, the Group is currently using all available legal means to contest these additional assessments. As a result of the administrative appeal dismissal, EDP presented a judicial claim, on 6 June 2012, which is still being analysed; ii) Bandeirante through the Union of Power Industry of the State of São Paulo SindiEnergia, filed two claims against the Department of Finance of the State of São Paulo, seeking the suspension of the effects of Decrees 55,421/2010 and 55,867/2010. Both claims are concerned with VAT incidence on energy technical losses (theft, deviation or fraud) and obtained a favourable decision which was confirmed by the Court of Justice of the State of São Paulo. These decisions are still subject of appeal to higher courts, however, given that the higher courts jurisprudence supports the thesis discussed in this process, the EDP Group classifies as remote the risk of losing this action. The estimated value at 31 December 2016 amounts to 115,195 thousand Euros (31 December 2015: 72,300 thousand Euros). 38.

Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Fair value of financial instruments is based, whenever available, on listed market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined through quotations supplied by third parties or through internal models, which are based on cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models. These models are developed considering the market variables which affect the financial instruments, namely yield curves, exchange rates and volatility factors, including credit risk. Market data is obtained from stock exchange and suppliers of financial data (Bloomberg).

Relevant or Subsequent Events EDP acquires gas distribution assets from Repsol in the north of Spain On 25 January 2016, EDP, through its subsidiary for the gas business in Spain, Naturgas Energía Grupo, S.A. (Naturgas) has reached an agreement with Repsol, S.A. (Repsol), for the acquisition of gas distribution assets in the north of Spain. The assets acquired comprise approximately 82,000 supply points of liquefied propane gas (LPG), in Naturgas incumbent areas (Basque Country, Cantabria and Asturias regions). The assets were acquired during the third and fourth quarters of 2016 by 116 million Euros (initial price estimated). The transaction is subject to a price final ajustment. Auction 13/2015 Investco On 13 April 2016, was held the Auction 13/2015 by ANEEL, in which the company Transmissora Aliança de Energia Elétrica S.A. (Taesa), acquired the power transmission lines and Investco substation. On 27 June 2016, Taesa signed the concession agreement and the implementation and commercial operation of the new facilities is limited to 27 December 2019. The respective Investco assets will be transferred to Taesa until 180 days after the effective entry into commercial operation of the new facilities. As at 31 December 2016, these assets are booked in the financial statements of Investco by 39 million Brazilian Reais (11 million Euros). Ordinances 268-B/2016 and 69/2017 DGEG performed an investigation for the evaluation of public policies regarding the energy sector, in which it has come to the conclusion that the renewable energy generators with feed-in tariff have received, apart from this tariff incentive, public support for the promoting and development of renewable energy. DGEG's investigation estimated an amount of 140 million Euros as an excess over what they should have received. On 13 October 2016, Ordinance 268-B/2016 was published, determining the recovery to SEN of the amount allegedly received in excess, through feed-in tariff reduction granted by the Last resource supplier (CUR). On 28 December 2016, Law 46/2016 was published. The article 171, determined that the public support for the promoting and development of renewable energy received by the elegible energy generators with feed-in tariff (at this date) should not be cumulative with the administratively fixed remuneration received by those generators. In this sense, this article determines the adoption, through an ordinance, of a mechanism for deduction or replacement of the public support received under these conditions. Thus, on 16 February 2017, Ordinance 69/2017 was published determining the recovery to SEN of the amount allegedly received in excess, through feed-in tariff reduction granted by the Last resource supplier (CUR). This ordinance repeals and replicate the content of the Ordinance 268B/2016. The publishing of orders from the State member responsible for the energy sector is expected, that will identify the producers and the amounts which one of them shouldn't have received, in order to calculate the new feed-in tariff that allows this amount to be recovered as fast as it is possible. For Renewable energy generators under this situation, which have already lost their right to feed-in tariffs, it establishes that it is the CUR who has the responsability to recover the amounts identified by DGEG, though it is not clear in what way will they recover these amounts. Half of the amount recovered under this mechanism will reduce tarif deficit, being the other half allocated to future yearly tariffs. 51 401 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

This standard is included in the IASB's comprehensive project to replace IAS 39 and relates to issues of classification and measurement of financial instruments. The main issues considered are as follows: the financial assets can be classified in two categories: at amortised cost or at fair value. This decision will be made upon the initial recognition of the financial assets. Its classification depends on how the entity presents these financial assets and the contractual cash flows associated to each financial asset in the business; debt instruments can only be measured at amortised cost when the contractual cash-flows represent only principal and interest payments, which means that it contains only basic loan features, and for which an entity holds the asset to collect the contractual cash flows. All the other debt instruments are recognised at fair value; equity instruments issued by third parties are recognised at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the profit and loss. However, an entity can irrevocably select equity instruments at initial recognition for which fair value changes and the realised gains or losses are recognised in fair value reserves. Gains and losses recognised in fair value reserves can not be recycled to profit and loss. This is a discretionary decision, and does not imply that all the equity instruments should be treated on this basis. The dividends received are recognised as income for the year; the exemption that allows unquoted equity investments and related derivatives to be measured at cost, under IAS 39, is not allowed under IFRS 9; and changes in fair value attributable to own credit risk of financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss, shall be recognised in Other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value changes related to these financial liabilities shall be recognised through profit or loss. The amounts recognised in Other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified/transferred to profit and loss. ● IFRS 15 Revenue from the Contracts with Customers The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in May 2014, IFRS 15 Revenue from the Contracts with Customers, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, being allowed its early adoption. This new standard presents the principles that shall be applied by an entity in order to provide more useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, term and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a client. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, as provided in the 5 steps methodology. The 5 steps methodology consists in the following steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ● IFRS 16 Leases The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in January 2016, IFRS 16 Leases, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted for entities that have also adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, and supersedes IAS 17 Leases and its associated interpretative guidance. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information to the users of financial statements, namely about the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. 51 403 EDP ‐ Energias de Portugal, S.A.

Reporting content Sustainability context Within the framework of the defined strategy, EDP fosters a corporate culture that constantly pursues a performance of excellence in sustainability, based on its eight principles of sustainability (www.edp.pt> sustainability> principles). The Group's sustainability performance is globally reported on the basis of the financial consolidation criteria defined and described in the next section. Regarding these companies, the Group defines a clear strategy for the continuous improvement of its performance, supported by the internal process of identifying the material themes for the year and the emerging trends in the sector, always taking into account the local conditions in which it operates. Regarding assets not consolidated by the Group (identified below), the Company positively influences its performance and highlights the main initiatives of the year throughout the report. In the supply chain, a management approach is adopted and the material themes are published and, in this context, the Group advocates a relationship based on trust, collaboration and shared value creation (page 125). Finally, where the client is concerned, EDP has a growth strategy supported by an increasingly cleaner supply, contributing to greater energy efficiency and an increasing reduction of its carbon footprint (page 123). Consolidation Criteria The non-financial information presented was consolidated according to the accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standard Board. Additionally, due to its relevance, the disclosure of the operational, environmental and social information is extended to the companies that are consolidated by the equity method, with reference to the performance of the Jari, Cachoeira Caldeirão and São Manoel hydropower plants. 429 There was no significant changes in the consolidation perimeter in any materially relevant to the sustainability report. Materiality In terms of sustainability management and reporting on its performance, the EDP Group periodically identifies the issues and trends that could possibly influence the creation of value for the company in the short, medium and long term. The Material Themes bring together both the financial and non-financial dimensions, including economic, environmental and social information likely to influence or be influenced by different EDP Group stakeholders. The materiality analysis consists of evaluating and prioritising the relevance of an issue to EDP and its stakeholders, periodically reviewing their expectations, in order to support the decision-making process and the development of strategies within the organisation. In 2016, the internal methodology for determining the Materiality of the EDP Group was adopted for all the main companies and is available in the Sustainability Management Approach document at www.edp.pt> sustainability> publications> 2016. The issues identified in the Materiality Matrix: • Financial Sustainability gains importance on the side of society, whereas on the business side it remains unchanged. This latter reports its performance according to the regulatory context where its activity is carries out. • Environmental Management and Biodiversity reduces its importance to the business with the Baixo Sabor and Salamonde II hydropower plants starting operations, and having the business plan strongly based in new wind capacity; • Diversity and Equal Opportunities emerge in this year as a high importance subject for Society; • The subject Market Liberalization changing of importance to the business shows the internalization of this issue to the business; • Health & Safety is assumed as prioritary to the business; • Business Ethics, as a transversal and basic value to the Group, sees its importance to the business reduced, confirming its higher level of maturity and the trust of the Group in the implemented Ethical process, already internalized; • The same level of maturity is now given to the Risk Management process; • Local Communities see their importance to society reduced, mas this change has no expression. Verification according to AA1000AS 2008 The material themes (page 63) are identified within the framework defined by AA1000 APS (2008), ensuring the identification of critical stakeholders; integrating their expectations into the corporate and operational strategy and seeking to respond appropriately to their expectations. In 2016, like in previous years, EDP was subject to verification of compliance with AA1000 AS (2008), type 2, specifically on the principles of inclusion, materiality and response, by the audit firm KPMG. Inclusion of stakeholders The inclusion principle assumes that the most relevant stakeholders for the company are consulted, in order to learn about their expectations and concerns, and incorporating them into the decision-making process. Periodically, interaction initiatives are promoted with different segments of the company's stakeholders, while there are communication channels dedicated to specific segments. During 2016, the following initiatives stand out: 430 ANNUAL REPORT EDP 2016 • Formalisation of the Stakeholder Management function in all business units of the EDP Group with completion of the implementation process of the stakeholder management methodology in all geographies, marked by the conduct of auditing processes for stakeholders by EDP Renováveis, EDP Brazil and EDP Spain. • Development of the EDP Group's first Integrated Stakeholder Management Plan, with stakeholder engagement initiatives in the different geographies, namely Spain, Brazil, and the EDP Renováveis business, with the aim of responding to critical issues and managing the risk associated with the operations in various geographies. • Maintenance of transversal training in Project Communication with employees whose functions require an external relationship. Response and Integrity EDP responds strategically to the main expectations of its stakeholders, making commitments and defining action plans for material themes. EDP's Target Goals are listed on page 52, organised by the Material Themes of the year. Internal and External Verification The overall coordination of the process of drafting the EDP Report and Accounts is the responsibility of the Planning and Management Control Department. The contents are subsequently read and approved by the Executive Board of Directors and by the General and Supervisory Board.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process. Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report comprising our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high levei of assurance but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit and we also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internai control; obtain an understanding of internai control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internai control; • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; KPMG • conclude on the appropriateness of managemenfs use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, events or future conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion • communicate to those charged with governance, including the oversight body, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, and significant audit findings including any significant deficiency in the internai control identified during our audit; • from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, including the oversight body, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter; and • we state to the oversight body, that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them ali relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. Our responsibility also includes the verification of the consistency of the information included in the Consolidated management report with the Consolidated financial statements, as well as the verification of the disclosures required by numbers 4 and 5 of the article 451, of the Portuguese Companies Code. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS About the Consolidated management report In compliance with article 451, nr. 3, e) of the Portuguese Companies Code, we are of the opinion that the consolidated management report has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the information contained therein is consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements and, taking into account the knowledge and appreciation of the Group, we have not identified material inaccuracies. 10 About the corporate governance report In compliance with article 451, nr. 4, of the Portuguese Companies Code, we are of the opinion that the corporate governance report includes the elements required by the Entity pursuant to article 245 A of the Securities Code, and no material inaccuracies have been identified in the information disclosed therein, complying with the provisions of paragraphs c), d), f), h), i) and m) of that article. On the additional elements provided for in article nr. 10 of Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 In compliance with Article nr. 10 of Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014, and in addition to the key audit matters mentioned above, we also report the following: • We were appointed auditors of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. for the first time at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting held on the 31 January 2005 to complete last year of the term of the three year period running from 2003 to 2005.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatements whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a report comprising our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high levei of assurance but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit and we also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internai control; • obtain an understanding of internai control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity's internai control; • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management; 4 • conclude on the appropriateness of managemenfs use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, events or future conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as a going concern; • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; • communicate to those charged with governance, including the oversight body, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, and significant audit findings including any significant deficiency in the internai control identified during our audit; • from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, including the oversight body, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter; and • we state to the oversight body, that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them ali relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. Our responsibility also includes the verification of the consistency of the information included in the management report with the financial statements, as well as the verification of the disclosures required by numbers 4 and 5 of the article 451, of the Portuguese Companies Code. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS About the management report In compliance with article 451, nr. 3, e) of the Portuguese Companies Code, we are of the opinion that the management report has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the information contained therein is consistent with the audited financial statements and, taking into account the knowledge and appreciation of the Entity, we have not identified material inaccuracies. About the corporate governance report In compliance with article 451, nr. 4, of the Portuguese Companies Code, we are of the opinion that the corporate governance report includes the elements required by the Entity pursuant to article 245 A of the Securities Code, and no material inaccuracies have been identified in the information disclosed therein, complying with the provisions of paragraphs c), d), f), h), i) and m) of that article. 5 On the additional elements provided for in article nr. 10 of Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 In compliance with Article nr. 10 of Regulation (EU) nr. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014, and in addition to the key audit matters mentioned above, we also report the following: • We were appointed auditors of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. for the first time at the extraordinary shareholders' meeting held on the 31 January 2005 to complete last year of the term of the three year period running from 2003 to 2005. We were appointed at the shareholders' meeting on 21 April 2015 for the current term from 2015 to 2017. • The Executive Board of Directors confirmed to us that it is not aware of the occurrence of any fraud or suspected material fraud in the financial statements. In the planning and execution of our audit under ISA we have maintained professional skepticism and designed audit procedures to respond to the possibility of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud. As a result of our work, we have not identified any material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. • We confirm that the audit opinion we issue is consistent with the additional report we prepared and delivered to the Entity's oversight body on the 2 March 2017. • We declare that we have not provided any prohibited services pursuant to article nr. 77, nr. 8 of the Statute of the Statutory Auditors Institute and that we have maintained our independence from the Entity during the performance of the audit.

We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board of the International Federation of Accountants. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Reasonable Assurance Sustainability Parameters are free from material misstatement and limited assurance about whether the Limited Assurance Sustainability Parameters are free from material misstatement. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principies of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our work included also a moderate levei of assurance in accordance with the AA1000 Accountability Assurance Standard 2008 (AA1000AS) (Type 2) issued by Accountability, that consists in the verification of the nature and extent of the organization's adherence to the AA1000APS (2008), and the evaluation of the reliability of the performance information as reported in the appendix Sustainability Reporting . 2 mm Ii * * iii « i Scope 4 The scope of our work was as follows: • Reasonable Assurance: A reasonable assurance engagement with respect to the indicators: Economic Data (G4-EC1, G4-EC4, G4-EC5, G4-EC9), Sector (G4-EU1, G4-EU2, G4-EU3, G4-EU4, G4-EU5, G4-EU15), Environmental (G4-EN3, G4-EN8, G4-EN11, G4-EN15 (GHG Scope 1), G4-EN16 (GHG Scope 2), G4-EN21, G4-EN23; G4-EN31), Product (G4-PR3), Labour Practices (G4-10, G4-LA1, G4-LA6, G4-LA9, G4-LA12), Fines and Penalties (G4-EN29, G4-S07, G4-S08, G4-PR9) Absenteeism rate, Billing of Energy Efficiency Services, C02 avoided, Maximum Certified Installed Capacity ISO 14001 and Maximum Certified Installed Capacity OSHAS 18001, involves performing procedures to obtain sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the indicators disclosed are free from material misstatement whether caused by fraud or error. The procedures performed depend on professional judgment, including the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the indicators mentioned above, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we considered internai control relevant to EDP in the preparation and presentation of the referred indicators in order to design assurance procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our engagement also included assessing the suitability of the criteria used by the Board of Directors of EDP in the preparation of the indicators, as explained in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of the EDP Annual Report, in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the quantification methods, in the reporting of the policies used and the reasonableness of the estimates made by EDP. Among others, our procedures included: Interviews with relevant responsible persons and relevant staff at operating and corporate levei concerning the identification of the indicators mentioned above; Interviews with relevant responsible persons and relevant staff at operating and corporate levei concerning the preparation of the indicators; Evaluation of the systems used for collection, calculation and reporting of the indicators; Recalculation of the indicators at corporate and operational levei; and Validation of the design and effectiveness of controls. • Limited assurance: Our limited assurance engagement on the sustainability information consisted in inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of the EDP Annual Report as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2016, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. These procedures included: Interviews with relevant responsible persons and relevant staff at corporate and operational levei concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues, and the implementation of these across the business; Interviews with relevant staff at corporate operational levei responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information; Visits to operating sites in Portugal, Spain and Brazil, selected on the basis of a risk analysis including the consideration of both quantitative and qualitative criteria; 3 MS Comparing the information presented in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of the Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 to corresponding information sources to determine whether ali the relevant information contained in such underlying sources has been included in the Report; Reading the information presented in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of the Report to determine whether it is in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the sustainability performance of EDP. The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement or an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and Assurance Engagements, and consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of ali significant matters that might be identified in an audit or a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information presented in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of the EDP Annual Report as a whole. 5 Our multidisciplinary team included specialists in AA1000APS, stakeholder dialogue, social, environmental and economic business performance. Conclusion 6 Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions. Reasonable Assurance Sustainability Parameters • In our opinion, the indicators: Economic Data (G4-EC1, G4-EC4, G4-EC5, G4-EC9), Sector (G4-EU1, G4-EU2, G4-EU3, G4-EU4, G4-EU5, G4-EU15), Environmental (G4EN3, G4-EN8, G4-EN11, G4-EN15 (GHG Scope 1), G4-EN16 (GHG Scope 2), G4EN21, G4-EN23; G4-EN31), Product (G4-PR3), Labour Practices (G4-10, G4-LA1, G4LA6, G4-LA9, G4-LA12), Fines and Penalties (G4-EN29, G4-S07, G4-S08, G4-PR9) Absenteeism rate, Billing of Energy Efficiency Services, C02 avoided, Maximum Certified Installed Capacity ISO 14001 and Maximum Certified Installed Capacity OSHAS 18001, are presented in ali material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G4.0), of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as described in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of EDP's Annual Report. Limited Assurance Sustainability Parameters ' Based on the limited assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information included in the chapter Performance and appendix Sustainability Reporting of EDP's Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2016 is not presented fairly, in ali material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (G4.0) and the Electric Utilities Sector supplement, of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as described in the appendix Sustainability Reporting of EDP's Annual Report. Additionally and also based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that EDP has not applied the principies of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as included in the AA1000 Accountability Principies Standard 2008, as described in the appendix Sustainability Reporting of EDP's Annual Report. mm Ik M MM Ii l « l Without affecting our conclusions presented above, we present some of the key observations: In relation to the Inclusiveness principie EDP has Consolidated its process of stakeholders' consultation in the different countries where operates, in line with the stakeholder management model defined at the corporate levei. In 2016, EDP finalized the development of a stakeholder management plan, ensuring a better harmonization across the EDP Group. EDP annually performs specific initiatives of relationship with some groups of stakeholders, ensuring inclusion and the review of stakeholder expectations. In relation to the Materialitv principie EDP has established a comprehensive process for determining material issues, which consolidates a vision at the corporate and local leveis.

The EDP Group finalized the redefinition project of the whole process of materiality whose the objective is to ensure better harmonization of this among ali countries. This work aims to determine the materiality per stakeholder's segment. In relation to the Resoonsiveness principie EDP address the answer of its main stakeholders' expectations by defining a set of goals and targets. In 2016, action plans were developed per company in order to ensure better alignment and communication of its commitments and corporate goals to the most relevant material issues identified by stakeholders. Our assurance report is made solely to EDP in accordance with the terms of our engagement. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to EDP those matters we have been engaged to state in this assurance report and for no other purpose. We do not accept or assume responsibility to any third party other than EDP for our work, for this assurance report, or for our conclusions.

Introduction We were engaged by EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A. ( EDP or the Company ) to perform a work to assess the internai control system over Consolidated financial reporting ( SCIRF ) of the Company and its subsidiaries ( Group or EDP Group ) as at 31 December2016, based on the criteria established in the internai control framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013) in relation with global business and control procedures, and with the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies ( COBIT ) in relation to the general information technologies controls. Responsibilities The Executive Board of Directors is responsible for adopting adequate measures to ensure to a reasonable degree of security the implementation and maintenance of an adequate internai control system over the Consolidated financial reporting and the proper development of improvements to the system. Our responsibility is to assess and express a conclusion, with reasonable assurance, on the effectiveness of the EDP Group's internai control system over Consolidated financial reporting. Scope The internai control system over the Consolidated financial reporting is a process designed, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of Consolidated financial statements for externai purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principies and includes policies and procedures that: • respect to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposals of assets of EDP Group; KPMG & Associados S.R.O.C., S.A.

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods of the internai control over Consolidated financial reporting are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Conclusion 11 In our opinion, the Group's internai control system over Consolidated financial reporting as at 31 December 2016 is adequate and effective, in ali material aspects, according to the criteria established in the internai control framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013) in relation with global business and control procedures, and with the Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies (COBIT) for general information technologies controls. 2 KPMG 12 On 2 March 2017 we issued our audit report on the Consolidated financial statements of the Group as at 31 December 2016, expressing an unqualified opinion. 13 This report has been prepared according to your request in accordance with terms as described in paragraph 1.
