It gives us great pleasure to be able to share with you again through our Integrated Report the changes and innovation that we have been pursuing over the year at Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction. Even amidst the low-growth trend that has been prolonged by the global recession, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction has been growing to become a global corporation that adds value to the Earth by offering world-class products and technology to our clients. Despite the difficulties of the past year, the company was able to win orders for large-scale projects in strategic markets, including Saudi Arabia and India, and lay the foundation for business expansion by establishing a new subsidiary, Doosan GridTech, winning performance improvement projects for local thermal power plants and participating in national nuclear decommissioning projects. In addition, we achieved significant business results by adopting marketing strategies tailored to each region, which led us to successfully enter the Egyptian and Indonesian power markets. Based on the Doosan Way, which is embedded in our work processes, our employees have helped to fulfill the social responsibilities we hold as a corporate citizen and supported our continuous efforts to achieve sustainable growth. Human rights management is being reinforced through town hall meetings and wider efforts are being made to promote the voluntary practice of business ethics, while we have also sought to upgrade our preventive Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) systems and energy efficiency systems. We also had the honor of being presented with the Grand Prize at the Korean Shared Growth Awards ceremony, in recognition of the various supply chain support activities we were engaged in, such as the Shared Growth Supporters work. We have received favorable recognition both at home and abroad for our performance in sustainability management, which includes receiving the ESG A rating from the Korea Corporate Governance Service and being listed a Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) Korea company. Continuing the practice of sustainable growth in the global market Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction is pursuing sustainable growth by responding proactively and swiftly to changes in the global power market. As part of these efforts, we launched the Service Business Group this year, through which we are seeking to broaden our service offerings for power plants worldwide and strengthen the area of recurring businesses to contribute to a stable business structure. Furthermore, we are continuing with efforts to expand our business by adopting innovative technology, which harnesses the benefits of information & communications technology, such as the RMS (Remote Monitoring Service) for power plants and Digital Factories, and we are also diversifying our business portfolio to better meet the needs created by the tightening of environmental regulations under the new climate regime. Faithfully fulfilling our corporate social responsibilities in alignment with the United Nations' SDGs Built upon the reinforcement of human rights, environment, safety, supply chain and ethics management activities and the faithful fulfillment of our social responsibilities, mostly achieved through contributions to local communities, we aim to tie together the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed by the UN with our core businesses to establish and achieve the goal of contributing to sustainable growth worldwide. We will particularly focus on effectively addressing the areas of energy, water and climate change and make every effort to produce greater outcomes. Moreover, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction seeks to continue the practice of sharing with local communities through events like the Doosan Day of Community Service, a heartwarming event arranged to help the needy and which is led by social volunteer groups composed of employees from 30 Doosan work sites around the globe. Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction strives to continuously pursue sustainable growth this year as well and will always endeavor to do its best in line with the company slogan, Winning Team, all the while forging ahead to realize our vision of becoming the Global Leader in Power & Water. We kindly ask for your interest and support as we continue on our journey towards achieving sustainable business growth.

In the future, detailed activities will be conducted for each of the SDGs in association with business strategies, and the progress will be shared through an integrated report. 28 29 Opportunity Analysis of the SDGs Business & Strategy Commitments to Sustainability Sustainable Management Performance of Overseas Subsidiaries Appendix Analyzing the Risks and Opportunities of Objectives in Contributing to the SDGs The worldwide interest in the environment is applied throughout the UN SDGs in diverse ways. In particular, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, climate change action, etc. are closely related to the water and power plant businesses, which are two of Doosan Heavy Industries Analyzing Risks and Opportunities & Construction's primary areas of focus. To define the core areas of the SDGs and Doosan's objectives, the current overview and forecasting of water, energy and response to climate change worldwide have been examined and, subsequently, factors of potential risks and opportunities have been analyzed. Importance and Current Status Forecast water As a response to strengthened environmental regulations and water shortages, demand for desalination and advanced water treatment are estimated to increase. Also, the markets for innovative water reuse, recycling technology and infrastructure that help with supplying safe water will grow, which will further expand the water supply through desalination plants. In addition, the growth of the advanced water Clean Water and The Global Risks Report of 2016, published by the Forecast of clean water supply treatment market, such as ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge), will also be accelerated due Sanitation World Economic Forum, selected water risk as one to reinforced environmental regulations. vs. demand in 2030 of the major economic risks along with the global financial and food crises.
