My career in public service and now with DuPont has reinforced this lesson while adding a global perspective to the complexity of the systems like food and energy and materials That’s why innovation companies like DuPont are so vital — production on which we all rely. For example, farmers have they have the scientific and engineering know-how, as well always faced challenges from variable weather patterns. as the market knowledge, to bridge the divide between two Now, they must also contend with climate change, which can sets of goals that might otherwise appear in competition contribute to the severity of short-term weather extremes and capture the opportunity.

Finally, DuPont periodically invests in the construction of new facilities that impact the communities in which they are located by providing jobs and foster the development of local infrastructure systems to supply the facility with materials and feedstocks. For example, DuPont launched a $225 million cellulosic ethanol plant in Nevada, Iowa in 2015 that is among the first commercialscale cellulosic biorefineries in the world. The plant will convert corn stover (corn cobs, leaves and stalks) to 30 million gallons of fuel-grade ethanol annually. DuPont is devoted to working with producers to create value across the biomass supply chain. Our vision is to provide sustainable solutions to the evolving advanced biofuels market globally, while creating new opportunities for rural communities in America and around the world. 20 2017 Global Reporting Initiative Report 2012: $1.200 B 2012: 1,039 2013: $1.295 B 2013: 693 2014: $1.236 B 2014: 603 DuPont 2020 Food Security Goals 2015: $1.146 B Engaging and Educating Youth 2015: 633 One of the most pressing challenges 2016: facing $1.040 Bhumanity is ensuring By the end of 2020, DuPont 2016: will 507 facilitate 2 million engagements for people ample and nutritious food suppliesREMAINING: everywhere. $4.083 B As with young people around the world REMAINING: 525 to transfer the knowledge a global leader in Agriculture & Nutrition, DuPont believes in of sustainable food and agriculture and the impact it will have innovating to help feed the world — and doing it in a responsible on a growing population.

This strategic focus reflects a shift business, and providing credible information about our in portfolio and several significant acquisitions and divestitures environmental performance to our stakeholders over the past 5-10 years. As a result, DuPont is now focused on delivering solutions that help address some of the world’s I.

We believe market compliance. In 1989, when we announced our first set of demand for low carbon, environmentally responsible, sustainable corporate goals, our focus was on reducing the environmental goods is increasing. DuPont is uniquely positioned to capitalize on footprint of our manufacturing operations. Subsequent sets of this trend and we continuously evaluate opportunities for existing corporate sustainability goals have continued our drive toward and new product and service offerings considering the anticipated a smaller footprint, and committed us to apply our science and demands of a low-carbon economy.

The scope of the review includes all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources, and Scope 3 emissions from Fuel and Energy Related Activities. The GHG inventory applies to all owned and leased facilities under DuPont’s operational control. WSP provided a “Review Findings” report to DuPont which lists in detail the specific review tasks completed and areas which have been flagged for clarification or improvement. DuPont has addressed all requests for clarification and has completed all necessary corrective actions. The details of the scope of this assurance review can be found in Table 1.

Professional Conduct WSP has conducted this limited assurance review in its capacity as an independent third party in accordance with the ISO 14065 International Standard, Greenhouse gases — Requirements for greenhouse gas validation and verification bodies for use in accreditation or other forms of recognition. ISO 14065 specifies the principles and requirements employed by WSP to make this GHG assertion. WSP has not contributed to the compilation of DuPont’s 2015 GHG inventory and members of the Assurance Team are not working with DuPont’s 2015 GHG inventory beyond what is required of this assignment.
