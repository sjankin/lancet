Golden Star supports the Sustainable Development Goals 6 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 | 7 OUR PEOPLE At Golden Star, we believe that our people are our greatest assets. Their continued dedication is the main driver of success for our company. As such, we develop and invest in our employees to help them reach their full potential. In 2016, we directly employed some 2,563 people. Our contractors employed a further 1,744 employees at our operations. Of our employees (permanent and contract) in Ghana, 51% are from local communities, 66% are from the Western Region, and 99% are Ghanaian, with $47M in salaries paid in the year. We are also pleased to report that the proportion of women in our workforce increased from 10% in 2015 to 12% in 2016. Although a modest increase, this is important given that the mining industry is typically male dominated. CROSS-CULTURAL AWARENESS TRAINING We aim to foster a workplace environment in which diversity is respected, supported, and celebrated. To help achieve this, we provided crosscultural awareness training for our employees in 2016. Key components of the training included: understanding of culture, tolerance, communication, language, expectation and values. 10,000 WOMEN SCREENED In 2016, the Golden Star Ladies Clubs hosted their fourth breast cancer awareness program to coincide with International Pink Ribbon Day. The group surpassed their three-year target with over 10,400 women screened in over 30 communities, potentially saving as many as 272 lives in the process. In 2016 alone, more than 90 participants were referred to specialists for further assessment. This is particularly important since over 70% of breast cancer cases in Ghana are not identified until at an advanced stage, which limits treatment options and chances of survival. We were thrilled to hear feedback from the specialist medical providers that a number of women and girls reported for treatment. The program also aimed to build awareness and capacity around the disease. Information pamphlets were distributed to participants and data collected from the screening exercises was shared with Breast Care International (BCI), a Ghanaian NGO. The data will be vital for supporting local breast cancer research and treatment. INCREASING TRANSPARENCY Open, honest, and frequent communication is essential for meaningful engagement with stakeholders and to establish a foundation of trust and respect between all parties. We employ a variety of communication methods to provide stakeholders with an understanding of our operations, obtain feedback, and address concerns. Our communication frameworks include Community Mine Consultative Committees (CMCCs), outreach through our community liaison offices, and regular consultations with stakeholders. In 2016, we began using social media as an additional tool to connect with our stakeholders. We started a corporate responsibility blog and established a presence on LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook. The initial reception by stakeholders has been highly positive. For example, one of our blog posts featuring Mr. Robert Gyamfi – our GSBPL Community Relations and Social Responsibility Manager – accepting an award from the Minister of Trade and Industry received over 11,000 hits. Prestea Underground team members 8 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES 9 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES SAFETY, HEALTH AND WELLBEING Wendy Antwi and Ohenebaa Ekufoa Adabo assisting with breast cancer awareness program At Golden Star we value and are committed to safety and employee wellbeing. We believe that job-related injuries and illnesses are unacceptable. To support this, safety and health targets are integral components of our performance management systems. HEALTH AND SAFETY ACHIEVEMENTS In 2016, our lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) was 0.36, compared to a LTIFR of 0.25 in 2015. Despite the increase, our performance compares favourably with that of many of our peers. For 2017, we have set a goal for each of sites to establish individual targets for LTIFR and all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) reductions Our teams were recognized by the Ghana Minerals Commission and Ghana Chamber of Mines at their respective 2016 annual awards ceremonies. The Wassa team was recognized for placing second in the National Inter-Mines Safety and First Aid Competition, and second in the ‘Most Improved Mine’ category. At the Ghana Mining Industry Awards, Wassa placed First Runner up in category of ‘Best Performer in Occupational Health and Safety’. Additionally, the Minerals Commission recognized the efforts of Mr. Sidi Adam, with the first ever individual excellence award for leading the Wassa team to win three consecutive National Inter-Mines First Aid and Safety Competitions. We pride ourselves on these achievements as they demonstrate our teams’ dedication to continually improving our safety and health performance. UNDERGROUND MINE SAFETY In 2016, we continued our transition to a greater focus on underground mining. To achieve ‘operational readiness’, we completed several programs related to underground mine safety including update of risk registers, conducting underground baseline occupational hygiene studies to monitor key health and hygiene hazards, and conducted extensive ‘live emergency drills’ to train our workforce and management on what do should a real emergency ever arise. 10 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES 11 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES LOCAL CONTENT We recognize that our operations serve as an extraordinary catalyst for local economic development in the communities in which we operate. Through local value retention programs, we can enhance and maximize the economic and social benefits of our operations for host communities. We implement a variety of projects and programs to facilitate local involvement in our operations, including local hiring policies for local communities, social enterprise initiatives such as our oil palm plantation, alternative livelihood and capacity building programs, and we prioritize buying local goods and services wherever possible. LOCAL VALUE RETENTION PROJECT RECOGNISED In November 2016, the Golden Star (Bogoso/Prestea) team was recognized at the Ghana Mining Industry Awards for its Prestea South Mbease Nsuta Community Benefit and Value Retention Initiative. The initiative received second place in the ‘Corporate Social Investment Project of the Year’ category. The project, involving 18 local businesses, retains and enhances social, economic, and environmental benefits for host communities by using local goods and services traditionally provided by larger mining industry suppliers outside of the host community. The project not only enhances local employment with over 250 previously long-term unemployed youth now employed, but is also re-invigorating the local economy with over $10M in payments made to the local companies in 2016. A key aspect of the project has been the support Golden Star provided for the formation, registration, and licensing of the umbrella company – Local Companies in Mining Services (LOCOMS). With the requisite skills, capacity and registrations, LOCOMS can now compete for other work in the wider Ghanaian industrial setting, further adding to the project sustainability and potential benefits. Another part of the project was the rehabilitation of a garbage disposal site in Prestea that was becoming a major challenge for residents and businesses. In fact, the site posed serious health and sanitation risks, and had led to partial closures of surrounding hospitality businesses. Golden Star facilitated the rehabilitation of the site and worked with local stakeholders to develop a plan for future site development as well as an improved, sustainable waste management strategy. The two most impacted local hospitality businesses are now experiencing rejuvenation in business and are both planning expansions. The conversion plan for the former refuse disposal site incorporates parkland, outdoor eating areas, kiosks, toilet facilities and other infrastructure. When completed this site will provide valuable community open space and will be one of the only community recreational sites in Prestea. Mrs. Ruth Kobina and Mrs. Florence Obrese supply catering services to LOCOMs 12 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 | 13 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT We recognize that we can play an important role in helping build healthy and vibrant communities in the areas where we operate. By working in partnership, the possibilities of what we can achieve together are endless. In 2006, we established the Golden Star Development Foundation (GSDF), which is funded yearly with $1 for every ounce of gold we produce, in addition to 0.1% of our pre-tax profit. The investments are used to fund community development projects in partnership with our local stakeholders. Projects include construction of schools, clinics, and community centers as well as the provision of scholarships. To date, some US$3.39M has been invested by Golden Star into the GSDF. GSOPP TURNS 10 In October 2016, we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation (GSOPP), Golden Star’s flagship, social enterprise initiative. GSOPP, also funded with $1 for every ounce of gold we produce, is a partnership between Golden Star, the Traditional Authorities, local farmers, and the agroforestry industry. GSOPP adopts the smallholder concept of agriculture. Traditional authorities contribute land to the initiative and smallholders – typically affected local farmers – are assigned a plot of land to cultivate. Farmers are provided with interest-free loans to facilitate production. Golden Star provides training, capacity building and agronomic support. To date, Golden Star has contributed some $5.7M to the initiative. Over 1,053 hectares of oil palm have been planted and over 41,228 tonnes of oil palm fruit have been harvested. WORKING TOGETHER (MSA) Genuine volunteering is not only altruistic, but in many communities, brings an improved quality of life to those who are most vulnerable. In 2016 a new youth NGO was formed in Prestea, Maintenance Sustainability Africa (MSA), and the group immediately supported our initiatives for the conversion of a former refuse site to a community, recreational parkland. Since the completion of the capping of the site, the young men and women of MSA have made an immense contribution to the people of Prestea, by planting the site with grass, nurturing the seedlings, and maintaining the site. We are proud of MSA; together, we have become true partners in development by sharing responsibility for taking action for the betterment of society. Although the project is in its infancy, the actions of this group are a first for Prestea, and provide enormous symbolism to others. Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation stock cultivation 14 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES 15 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES ENVIRONMENT We work to avoid, reduce, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts throughout all stages of the mine life cycle, from exploration through to operations and closure. By minimizing our environmental footprint, we can help maintain the viability and diversity of the surrounding environment for future generations. ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE We are committed to meeting or, where feasible, surpassing legal and regulatory requirements related to the environment. To do so, we maintain comprehensive monitoring programs – which incorporate key performance indicators (KPIs) – to track our performance. Examples of some KPIs that we track include: • ▪ Water use, recycling, quality, and discharges; • ▪ Land disturbance and rehabilitation; • ▪ Noise and vibration levels; • ▪ Electricity consumption; and, • ▪ Air quality. Tracking our performance helps drive continual improvement in our environmental management programs. Key data related to our environmental performance can be found in the section ‘Year at a Glance.’ In 2016, our Golden Star Wassa operations were re-certified under the International Cyanide Management Code, and our Bogoso operations participated in a pre-audit in preparation for Code re-application. AFTER WE MINE Mining is one activity in a long-cycle of multiple and sequential use of land. Mine-site rehabilitation is an integral part of our operations life cycle. Through rehabilitation and later revegetation, landforms are re-established and brought to their agreed next land use. We work closely with local stakeholders to plan for an appropriate next (i.e. post-mining) land use. We completed mining of several open pits at Benso in 2015. As the agreed next land use for these pit was the formation of ‘pit lakes’, we undertook engineering works to integrate the pits into the local hydrology, so that the pits flush and drain with rainfalls, like natural lakes and surface water systems in the area. With the pit lake engineering now completed, aquaculture trial projects are now being conducted. Fingerlings are showing suitable growth rates, and riparian vegetation is being established to create habitat and future breeding sites. WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS Access to clean water is essential to wellbeing, and is recognized by the United Nations as a basic human right. Statistics from 2000 showed that only 15% of the rural population in Ghana at that time had access to pipe-borne water, while 40% relied on sources considered to be unsafe. Additionally, many individuals and families in our local communities relied on rivers or streams, many of which have been significantly degraded by illegal mining. Given that access to clean water affects so many other aspects of an individual’s wellbeing – from food security and sanitation, to livelihood choices and educational opportunities – we recognize we can make significant contributions to local communities by supporting a variety of water projects. Since we began operations in Ghana in 1999, we have installed over 200 water supply systems for our local communities. The systems support over 20,000 households and an estimated 100,000 people. Census data from 2012 indicate that the proportion of households in our host region with access to pipe-borne water doubled to 30%, in the period since 2000. Additionally, the proportion of households relying on unsafe drinking water sources reduced to 16%, a 40% decrease from 2000. Golden Star’s efforts have undoubtedly contributed to this improvement and we are proud to have done so. Water supply system installed by Golden Star at Akyempim community 16 | GOLDEN STAR RESOURCES CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 | 17 HUMAN RIGHTS As a responsible corporate citizen, we act to respect and uphold human rights in our sphere of influence. This responsibility is embedded in our Policy on Community Relations and Human Rights. We adhere to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which outline our responsibility to conduct due diligence on human rights matters. As proposed by the Guiding Principles our grievance mechanisms provide stakeholders with a process to query and as appropriate, resolve impacts found to have evolved from our operations. As signatories to the UN Global Compact since 2005, we integrate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into the way we do business. The Declaration guides how we relate to our employees and our host communities, to help ensure that we do not negatively impact the human rights of our stakeholders. In parallel we work proactively to enhance the benefits of our operations. For example, by providing local employment and business opportunities, we help enable local stakeholders obtain access to food, water, shelter, and an many cases, improve standards of living. Our investments in local schools help provide access to education, in support of the right to education. Our investments in health stewardship initiatives help enable stakeholders to enjoy the right to health. These are but a few examples of the countless ways in which we can help promote the enjoyment of human rights. POST RESETTLEMENT MONITORING Golden Star ensures that its resettlement projects comply with the International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 5 for Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement. The formation of a resettlement monitoring committee is enshrined in Ghanaian law, and we actively participate in these forums to ensure that our resettlement projects and associated livelihoods activities achieve the required improvements in standards of living and livelihood restoration and enhancement.

This helps ensure that our stakeholders – including our investors, employees, local communities, and governments – are confident in the credibility of our business conduct. We have implemented comprehensive systems, including corporate policies, to embed sound corporate governance practices throughout our business. Training is regularly provided to our employees to ensure awareness of the policies, and as part of our internal audit procedures, all management-level employees must acknowledge the policies annually. To access the policies visit please click http://www.gsr.com/about-us/governance/governance-policies/default.aspx. PROMOTING OUR ETHICS In 2016, our Board of Directors approved a new, comprehensive Business Conduct and Ethics Policy. The Policy details the standards of behavior that must be followed by all company representatives, regardless of position. Key components of the policy include provisions related to government payments, employee relations, and conflicts of interest, as well as provisions related to environmental responsibility and community relations. To access the policy visit please click http://s1.q4cdn.com/789791377/ files/policies/2016/june/2016-06-30-GSR-Business-Conduct-Ethics-Policy.pdf. In 2016 the Board gave its support for the Golden Star Policy on Community Development and Support. This cross-cutting policy recognizes our long-running commitment to investment in alternative economic and capacity building projects such as GSOPP and GSDF, for enduring social and economic benefits. It further states our intention to ensure that our support is culturally and traditionally acceptable, whilst in accord with the tenets of national and international anti-corruption law. ANTI-CORRUPTION As part of our commitment to work against corruption in all its forms, we support the Government of Ghana’s commitment to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by publicly reporting our payments to traditional authorities and all levels of government. Details of these payments are provided in Appendix 1.
