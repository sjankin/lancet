See Appendix A & C for GHG data. Note these numbers reflect GHG developed from the production of electricity and do not account for Direct GHG Emissions from product development or transportation, etc. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 4 OF 18 Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions The Pomeroy US Headquarters campus aims for a goal of year to year decrease in energy consumption. The following report identifies the indirect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the electricity purchased by Pomeroy. GHGs are emitted when fossil fuels are combusted to generate electricity. Therefore any GHGs produced are indirect emissions. Over the years, electricity and natural gas usage data have been collected for each energy consumer at the facility. The facility location is used to determine the correct emission factors to use, as different parts of the country use different fuels to generate electricity. The attached Appendix A & B display purchased energy and quantify the equivalent emissions. Overall, the data trend shows a decline in electricity consumption, even with increased expansion. Note consumption of natural gas increased during the measured years. This increase can be attributed to colder than average temperatures. Consistent efforts have been made to be more energy conscious and efficient. Some conservation actions include installing more efficient equipment. Building optimization measures have been implemented by the facilities management from monitoring this data. Plans for future improvements include further optimizing building operation plan and an additional on campus options for employee health and wellness. Appendix C contains a summary of GHG emissions from purchased energy. It is not intended to address outsourced activities such as supplier manufacturing operations or service‐oriented businesses such as cleaning services. Carbon‐cutting actions such as recycling, waste prevention, and energy efficient product purchasing demonstrate Pomeroy’s commitment towards sustainable business practices, therefore reducing the GHG emissions associated with their activities. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 5 OF 18 Recycling Program The Pomeroy US Headquarters campus recognizes the importance of waste reduction. The facility encourages employees to participate. The current goal is for a year to year increase in recycling materials. Trends show an increase in recycling followed by a decrease. This data indicates first Pomeroy focused on recycling materials already in use. After recycling became part of the standard practices, Pomeroy pursued avenues to reduce consumption of waste generation, such as reusing paper materials. In the tracking period, Pomeroy has successfully cut waste generation by roughly 70%.

However, the quantity removed is not currently tracked. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 6 OF 18 Window Film Replacement In the interest of greater energy usage reduction, Pomeroy invested in a window film replacement project. Window film is a durable film that is installed to a glass surface with an adhesive. These films can improve the energy efficiency of a building with UV absorbing or reflecting layers. They can reduce the solar heat gain through windows during cooling season and reduce the flow of radiant heat out of the building during heating season. The product chosen, EnerLogic 35, has low emissivity technology. There is a thin polymer layer and a metal coating that work together to reduce UV penetration through windows and improve window insulation to provide a better thermal barrier between the indoor and outdoor environments. The reported performance of the new coating is 0.07 emissivity with a 0.24 solar heat gain coefficient. The exact specifications of the previous film are not known, however conventional coatings usually have 0.33 emissivity and 0.27 solar heat gain coefficients. EnerLogic, the manufacture, claims a potential of 5‐15% energy savings from the total building energy consumption with around $0.209/ sf floor space savings. The actual performance will depend on glass type, window to wall ratio, presence of overhangs, climate, performance level of film used and efficiency of building’s cooling equipment. This claim is based on energy models performed using DOE‐2 and the Lawrence Berkeley National Labs Window Program. EnerLogic claims replacing the window film has better simple pay back than replacing windows. Window replacement is assumed $465/ year savings (data taken form a national window manufacture) with an approximate first cost of $7500 providing a 15‐20 year payback. EnerLogic states film replacement at a worst case (assuming need to replace at least once within the payback period) would be a 5.5 yr payback. Not to mention, replacing film is less disruptive to work and employees. Pomeroy has not yet seen a full year to determine the actual impact to energy efficiency. However, due to annual reporting practices, next year may show the impact this replacement measure has provided. POMEROY 2013 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT BY CMS 7 OF 18 Reduced Water Consumption Pomeroy has demonstrated an effort to reduce overall water consumption. Appendix D shows they water consumption data over the past few years. It should be noted that there was a period of construction that may have skewed the numbers. However, Pomeroy has changed (27) urinals to low flush. Additionally, Pomeroy is working with the landscaping to reduce water consumption by increasing the number of drought resistant plants, as well as installing a rain sensor to prevent unnecessary usage. Employee Awareness Pomeroy values employee health and safety. Programs are under development to improve workplace environment and promote safety. This past year, Pomeroy invested in a ¾ mile outdoor walking path and a new indoor fitness area on campus. Employees are encouraged to utilize these facilities to maintain their fitness and improve general wellbeing. Pomeroy provides employees at each of the buildings with fruit. Each day fresh fruit is made available in the common areas. This produce is free and encourages employees to make smart snack choices. Pomeroy also has been promoting environmental awareness and sustainable measures by encouraging employees to use energy saving practices in their day to day activities. From upgrading equipment employees use daily, such as energy efficient monitors, to promoting recycling of office supplies. Pomeroy has demonstrated a clear interest in environmentally friendly and sustainable business from employees to business practices. Indoor Environment Quality Pomeroy’s cleaning vendor has taken steps to support environmental responsibility. The disinfectants used are a concentrated green cleaners. These have a reduced chemical percentage, 2oz per gallon, thus reducing unnecessary overall chemical usage per area cleaned. Additionally, the cleaning vendor has eliminated the used of aerosol cans for stainless steel and glass cleaners. This elimination was discovered by the vendor to be both an environmental sustainability measure and a beneficial cost impact to the vendor.

factors for estimating GHG emissions from electricity use when developing a carbon footprint or emission inventory. Annual non‐baseload output emission rates should not be used for those purposes, but can be used to estimate GHG emissions reductions from reductions in electricity use.

Energy Savings 1. Bring your own mug to the café. Bring reusable bags to the grocery store. 2. Turn off lights, microwaves, or any other electric devices when you leave the room or house. 3. Replacing one incandescent light bulb with an energy‐saving compact fluorescent bulb means 1,000 pounds less carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere and $67 dollars is saved on energy costs over the bulb's lifetime. 4. In North America, fruits and vegetables travel an average of 1,500 miles before reaching your dinner table. Buy local whenever possible. 5. Packaging makes up a third of all garbage tossed in the U.S. To cut down on waste, avoid single‐serving foods and beverages. Instead, buy items in bulk and portion them out into reusable containers. 6. Planting trees help reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by absorbing and storing carbon dioxide. 7. Swap disposable plastic bottles for a reusable BPA Free water bottle. 8. Consider saving energy by washing your clothes in cold water and line drying. 9. Recycle! Stop and check to see if your trash can be recycled! 10. Old electronics can be recycled: laptops, TVs, cell phones, etc. Fuel Economy 1. Slow down. Reducing your speed to 55 mph from 65 mph may increase your fuel efficiency by as much as 15 percent; cut it to 55 from 70, and you could get a 23 percent improvement. National Geographic Society, Green Guide 2. Check your tire pressure. Under inflated tires cause poor fuel economy. 3. Check your air filter. Restricted airflow lowers engine performance. 4. No need to gun it. Accelerate reasonably to avoid wasting fuel. 5. Consider carpooling to work, riding a bicycle to the store or taking public transportation. Water Savings 1. Turn off faucets while scrubbing hands, faces and teeth. You could save 4 Gals/ min! 2. Report or fix leaks and drips! 3. Consider replacing fixtures with low flow fixtures.
