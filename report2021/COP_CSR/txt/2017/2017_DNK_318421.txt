(Excerpt from the BANK of Greenland's mission) The BANK of Greenland's corporate social responsibility is based on its prominent role in society, due to its influence on Greenland's economy, and consideration of the added value that the Bank can generate for society, in addition to its day-to-day operations. This has resulted in the Bank's vision for 2020 Greenland's best company – for the benefit of Greenland . On the basis of our stakeholders' requirements and expectations, and the Bank's strategic goals, we have chosen an overall focus area for our CSR initiatives: to create financial understanding among our customers and the citizens of Greenland. Financial understanding provides opportunities to act and insights to be able to make the best financial choices. This principle is the basis for our banking activities and for our day-today advisory services. Our CSR initiatives also have a heightened focus on selected target groups – especially children and young people, and the socially vulnerable – in order to contribute positively to preventing social problems. The aim is to ensure the citizens of Greenland a viable standard of life and to contribute to economic growth, for the benefit of the individual and society as a whole. The Bank also has a stronger focus on the direct impact of the Bank's CSR activities on selected CSR areas. In future this will be stated more clearly in the Bank's CSR reporting. On its endorsement of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) in the spring of 2013, the BANK of Greenland pledged to implement the UN's ten Global Compact principles within the areas of the environment, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption. Besides reporting on the Bank's progress in relation to the UNGC's ten principles, this report is also prepared in accordance with Sections 135 and 135a of the Danish Accounting Order. Nuuk, 28 February 2017 Martin Kviesgaard Bank Director 3 1. CSR policy and strategy In December 2015, the Bank of Greenland's Board of Directors adopted a CSR policy for the Bank. The policy was drawn up in dialogue with the Bank's stakeholders and their evaluation of the Bank of Greenland's CSR initiatives in 2010-2015. The Bank's CSR work in 2016 is based on the same policy, with the overall objective for the Bank's initiatives being to contribute to resolving challenges in society and to create sustainable growth, for the benefit of Greenland. The Bank's CSR work is also based on the Bank's 2020 vision: ”Greenland's best company – for the benefit of Greenland”. In addition, the Bank's new values (Commitment, Decency, Customer-oriented and Development-oriented) are implemented in the CSR work up to 2020. The business objectives of the CSR work are to maintain the Bank's reputation as a credible and stable bank. This reputation also helps to retain customers' and employees' loyalty, thereby contributing to ensuring satisfactory long-term economic operations. To support the Bank's efforts to create financial understanding, we will continue to work to make our advisory services and credit financing more accessible outside our primary market area. We also wish to continue to involve all of our employees in these initiatives to ensure financial understanding, and also to support other CSR-related projects. This report will concentrate on CSR initiatives in 2016, with the primary objective seeking to fulfil the new strategy for the area. Figure 1 CSR Strategy 2.0 The cornerstone of the strategy is to create sustainable economic development for our customers. We know that it requires insight to be able to use one's financial opportunities. We therefore wish to help to create greater financial understanding throughout Greenland. 4 Sustainable economic development can be used in relation to customers and employees, as well as society at large – and is in harmony with the Bank's own strategic objectives. Creating financial understanding ’ is a means to create opportunities for the individual or family, so that the right choices are made. The work on financial understanding is directed at our customers, in our ordinary advisory services, and also towards other target groups included in CSR activities (target groups with a need for greater financial understanding, such as children/young people, the socially vulnerable, etc.) By focusing on sustainable economic development through our contribution to sustainable financial understanding, we are addressing both the individual customer and Greenland's society in general, which is in line with the Bank's role in society. Financial understanding is based on the Bank's area of expertise and the areas identified by the Bank's stakeholders as opportunities for the Bank to have the greatest impact. The other two focus areas availability and voluntariness – are supporting elements that contribute to financial understanding. Advisory services outside the Bank's normal market area help to create financial understanding and opportunities in those areas. Voluntary contributions are linked more closely to financial understanding, with even greater involvement of employees in school teaching, giving advice to the socially vulnerable, and so on (still with the opportunity for other CSR activities). How the work is organised During the 2010-2016 period, working groups were appointed across the Bank for the strategic focus areas. At the end of 2014, we established the Bank's environmental team, for example, with focus on sustainability and energy reduction. The overall responsibility for the Bank's CSR initiatives is held by the Administration Director, who keeps the Executive Management continuously informed on the progress of this work. The Bank's CSR work is also anchored in a Steering Group which comprises the Administration Director, the CSR Secretary, the HR Manager, and the primary persons responsible for key areas covering the existing strategy. 5 Administration Director CSR Steering Group Working Group for Working Group for Working Group for Access to Advisory Environmental Social and Voluntary Financial Understanding Services and Credit Team Involvement Financing Figure 1 Organisation of the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) work. The BANK of Greenland is the co-founder and a member of CSR Greenland. In March 2013, the BANK of Greenland endorsed UNGC, which is the UN programme for companies' and organisations' social responsibility. The programme comprises ten principles which concern the environment, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption. Members of UNGC must submit a annual report on the progress of their work on the ten principles. The BANK of Greenland's third report as a member was submitted in March 2016, and the fourth report (this report) will be submitted in March 2017. 6 2. Primary activities and targets in 2016 Financial understanding There has been strong demand for a chance to draw up a budget and get a clearer view of own finances. Schools and educational institutions all over Greenland have been especially interested in teaching in financial understanding. For the third consecutive year, Business Combat gives pupils Business Combat was held, and besides the Commercial College in and students a good opportunity to test their Nuuk, NI, the Qaqortoq Commercial College was also a venue for knowledge in realistic this major competition. Business Combat is a reality-based contest conditions. in which commercial college students play against local business Students and pupils can see representatives. that the theory they were taught in school is also During the year, the BANK of Greenland's advisers gave lessons in relevant outside the financial understanding at e.g. Brugsen-i, continuation schools, classroom. Majoriaq, NI and lower secondary schools – on 60 occasions in total. This is also a good way for The focus was on laying a budget, available income and pupils and students to opportunities to save up for later major purchases. In teaching at network with the local lower secondary schools, the focus was also on Qassit, which is a business community. computer game which Jakob Olsen, teacher and NI1 supplements mathematics coordinator and social studies. The game has been developed by the Bank, with focus on everyday finances, and is designed for the 8th to 10th grades. Qassit is based on three scenarios: Continuation school dreams , Home alone and A new town , with exercises for each element. All of the exercises challenge the students' arithmetic skills with tasks that are related to real life. The games has been developed in collaboration with a number of experts, and has been tested by the game's primary target group. ”The close cooperation with Since 2015 the Bank has cooperated with Kommuneqarfik the BANK of Greenland is very Sermersooq on offering courses in financial understanding to important for NI Nuuk, not transfer income recipients. This group includes the unemployed, only with regard to Business single parents and disability pension recipients. Many of these Combat, but also when they people have a need for more knowledge and a better overview of come and give lectures., or their financial opportunities. This was a trial project in 2015 and help to teach some of the after the evaluation in 2016 it has been decided to continue the subjects. courses. If the cooperation with Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq Bramer Sørensen, principal, NI continues to develop as planned, in time the advisory services will 7 also include individual debt counselling for specific clients with special requirements. Availability and information As the Bank introduces additional digital self-service solutions, targeted online banking instruction has been arranged for elderly nursing home residents. The aim is to help the elderly to handle their own finances. Transport is provided from the nursing home to the Bank, and the Bank is also available during opening hours to residents who walk in to get help with online banking. Every year, advisers go to Tasiilaq and Uummannaq to hold customer meetings with residents who do not normally have the opportunity to meet a bank adviser in person. Tasiilaq has around 2,000 residents, and two advisers visit the town to hold as many individual meetings as possible. They also provide instruction in the BANK of Greenland's self-service solutions, and in financial understanding.In the same way, two advisers visit Uummannaq, which has around 2,179 residents, and customer meetings take place in the municipality's premises. There is increased demand for these visits and the plan is to continue them in the coming years, and to also hold information meetings at the town's schools. The aim is also to increase the use of video conferencing, although this depends on the Internet connection in these towns being improved, and being less expensive for residents. Besides Uummannaq and Tasiilaq, the Bank visited Paamiut to hold individual customer meetings and give presentations on day-today finances to the town's residents. In 2016, the BANK of Greenland once again held a number of Twice a year, I and a information meetings in cooperation with Nuna Attorneys on colleague travel to Tasiilaq. such topics as inheritance, death, divorce and wills, in Ilulissat, We do this in order to inform Aasiaat and Sisimiut. As there is increasing interest in these the people of east Greenland meetings, the plan is to hold them in additional towns during about their financial 2017. opportunities, and to offer them the personal, in-depth In southern Greenland, advisers from Qaqortoq provide training advice that is needed when in financial understanding in Narsaq, which has a population of you take a loan for e.g. a around 1,529. house, boat or car, or to start up your own business. Inger Poulsen Customer Adviser 8 A helping hand for entrepreneurs In cooperation with Sermersooq Business Council, the BANK of Greenland Business Fund has allocated a pool of DKK 2 million for small liable loans dedicated to small entrepreneurial projects that can create economic growth and workplaces in Greenland. To be eligible for a loan from the pool, the entrepreneur must have the potential to increase the company's operations to a new level, and just need a capital injection to realise this potential. As an extra help, the BANK of Greenland offers flexible repayment, so that after three years the entrepreneur can convert the loan to actual capital in the company. An important element required of the entrepreneur's product is that it must be innovative, creative, sustainable, importlimiting and/or suitable for export. The background to this assistance is that in 2015 the Bank launched an entrepreneurship campaign to encourage new business start-ups. The Bank assisted with such matters as business plan, company type, budget, contracts, tax, selffinancing and collateral security. Further to this, in 2016 we held an information evening on The good business plan , organised in cooperation with Deloitte. Participants were given an introduction to business plans, budgeting and support opportunities via Greenland Venture and Greenland Business. In cooperation with the Sisimiut Business Council, representatives from the Bank's Business Department also attended an information evening at the Greenland Innovation The loan from the BANK of Centre. Greenland Business Fund gives us enough funding to ensure the project's kick start and create the momentum to Global impressions achieve it. The BANK of Greenland is the Bank for all of Greenland, which has among other things resulted in cooperation with Air Jens-Jakob Lennert Sandgreen Greenland, under which school classes can apply for low-price entrepreneur and inventor of the fares for study trips. This initiative has been taken to support Balloon project young people who wish to travel and gain global inputs, and who save up for the trip. The BANK of Greenland's role in this project consists of a Study Trip Account, which gives school classes and study groups a favourable interest rate of 1% above the official interest rate. 9 Social and voluntary involvement The BANK of Greenland's policy for voluntary work has been drawn up by an internal working group who have presented guidelines for voluntary work undertaken by the Bank's employees. The BANK of Greenland's vision is to be Greenland's best company – for the benefit of Greenland , and voluntary work is an element of fulfilling this vision. (…) adults and children alike Voluntary work and social commitment must benefit Greenland by really love Rosine, when she contributing to society's development. comes down here to Hours are spent on social and voluntary involvement, for the benefit of Mælkebøtten's community children and young people, the environment, culture and sport. We also centre. It's great that she can work with financial understanding, which means that advisers visit help out sometimes, especially companies, schools and educational institutions to teach financial when lots of children want to understanding. join the meal in the community centre. In 2016, the biggest voluntary project was the preparations for and running of Arctic Winter Games 2016. The Bank devoted a total of 1,473 Naja Sarkov Petersen working hours to this event (see the Appendix). Manager of Mælkebøtten Arctic Winter Games 2016 Arctic Winter Games 2016 is the largest sports event ever held in Greenland, and required the voluntary help of residents and companies. The Games took place from 6 -11 March 2016, and the BANK of Greenland established a Nanoq sponsor agreement in 2014, around two years before the Games were held. The Bank made staff available for the entire project, while also paying the employees involved their normal salary. The Bank's involvement was based on how the Arctic Winter Games can help to motivate young The sponsors were our most people to take part in sport, pursue sporting results, and important partners. The majority of develop as individual persons. the sponsors participated actively Competence development has been a cornerstone of the in achieving the project, before, work with the volunteers. It was important to ensure that the during and after the Games. AWG2016 was a success, not least volunteers could see how even greater results can be due to the sponsors' great achieved through cooperation. It was also a key motivating dedication. Without the sponsors' factor for the BANK of Greenland to help to promote active and continued support Greenland beyond its borders. AWG2016 would never have been such a great success. Tasks handled before, during and after the Games ranged from steering group membership to employees in fundraising AWG2016 committees, sports results committees, the gala committee, Experience for the future the Arctic Winter Games secretariat's cashier function and (experience report) 10 officials at various sports venues. The BANK of Greenland also sponsored the Arctic Winter Games with a cash subsidy and offered currency conversion services free of charge during the Games. The overall value of the BANK of Greenland's sponsorship exceeded DKK 1 million. Other voluntary activities in 2016 The BANK of Greenland has continued the 230 helping hands campaign launched in 2014. This gives all of the Bank's employees the opportunity to engage in voluntary work both during and outside working hours. The Bank has allocated 2,000 working hours, including training in financial understanding and voluntary hours for AWG2016, and this has led to permanent cooperation with a number of organisations. The organisations are:  Nuummi Uumasut  Pisiu (the Crime Prevention Board)  Natteravnene (Night Owls)  Red Cross  Nuuk Playground/Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq (Sermersooq Municipality)  Children's rights organisation MIO Via its involvement in the Board and participation in  Association for Greenlandic drum dancers cross-disciplinary CSR projects  Save the Children/Meeqqat Ikiortigit Kalaallit over many years, the BANK of Nunaat Greenland has helped to  Nanubørn (Nanu children) strengthen CSR work in  Mælkebøtten Greenland.

They are available to children who need reassurance and wish to have a chat. The Bank also sponsors refreshments for the Lotte Frank Kirkegaard members attending first-aid courses. Storage space and Head of Secretariat, CSR premises at the Bank are also made available, and the Bank Greenland sponsors reflective tags that are distributed to the children. Again in 2016, the Bank's employees in all towns with branches made an extra effort for the environment, when they tidied up the towns on Saligaatsoq (Cleaning Up Day). The Bank's environmental coordinator is on the steering group to coordinate the tidying-up initiative, which in 2016 took place on land and in port and harbour areas. This cleaning-up initiative was launched in 11 2011 in Nuuk in cooperation with CSR Greenland, and has since spread to several other towns, including all of the towns in which the Bank has branches, where several of the Bank's employees have contributed to coordinating these cleaning-up campaigns. In 2016, the Bank's employees continued to work voluntarily for Kalaallit Røde Korsiat and Nuummi Uumasut (the organisation behind Nuuk's Veterinary Clinic), helped out in local sports clubs and cooked for Mælkebøtten's children's community kitchen. A Bank representative was a member of the Clean Greenland – Green Companies environmental project, which in 2016 concluded three years of cooperation with a targeted environmental action plan for the Bank and attendance of CSR Greenland's environmental conference, which was also attended by international researchers and the Greenland companies that took part in the project. In 2015, the Bank exceeded its annual targets for voluntary work by 34%, equivalent to 392 hours. A total of 1,527 hours were spent on social and voluntary involvement. In 2016, the target was even higher, at 1,800 hours, especially due to the Arctic Winter Games 2016. The number of registered hours was 2,089, around 10% above the target, but still below the long-term goal of 2,200 hours. 3. UN Global Compact – activities and targets 2016 In 2013, the BANK of Greenland was the second Greenlandic company to become a member of UNGC. Membership requires compliance with ten universal principles within the main areas of the environment, human rights, labour rights and anti-corruption. In 2016 the Bank began to prepare a policy for compliance with human rights. This policy is expected to be adopted in 2017, and emphasises the Bank's active membership of UNGC. As part of the responsibility accepted by the Bank, in the event of any human rights infringements the Bank will seek to rectify this as far as this is possible. This includes actions by employees, investors and customers, and by suppliers and other business partners. 3.a. Environment and sustainability In 2014, an overall environmental policy was drawn up and adopted, based on the Bank's support for UNGC. The overall objective for the BANK of Greenland's environmental responsibility is continuous awareness of including sustainability and environmental considerations in our activities on a sustainable business and economic basis. We ensure this by identifying and monitoring our key environmental impacts, initiating procedures to limit the consumption of resources, sharing our knowledge and experience, and giving employees, suppliers and customers the best opportunities to act on an environmentally responsible basis. In 2016 we continued this work of systematising our environmental efforts, which will help to reduce the Bank's costs, attract and retain employees, customers and investors, and enhance cooperation with authorities and suppliers. 12 The BANK of Greenland continues to focus on facilitating its customers' sustainable investments. One of the instruments used is our Nutarsaaneq environmental loan, which in the first instance was funded in cooperation with NIB (the Nordic Investment Bank), whereby customers can take out loans for up to DKK 300,000 on favourable interest rate terms. This loan is for both private and business customers and can be used for energy improvement measures such as replacing old oil-fired boilers, better insulation, replacement of doors or windows, a new roof or investment in solar panel systems, etc. At the end of 2016, a total of 360 Nutarsaaneq loans had been established, compared to 314 in 2015 and 257 in 2014. The Bank's Minguik eco-car loan to purchase ecofriendly cars in energy class A totalled 312 loans in 2016. For comparison, 156 loans were established in 2015, compared to 82 in 2014.In the autumn of 2015, we lowered the interest rates for the two environmental loans, which are now at 2.90%. The low level of interest rates continued in 2016. The BANK of Greenland itself also sets a good example in terms of using sustainable energy. In 2014, we installed solar panels on three of the Bank's buildings, and in 2015 they covered 7.34% of the Bank's electricity consumption at the head office in Nuuk, 27.19% in Maniitsoq and 49.23% in Aasiaat. These figures improved further in 2016, by covering 13% of electricity consumption at the head office in Nuuk, 33% in Maniitsoq and 82% in Aasiaat. In Maniitsoq and Aasiaat, the solar panel systems once again in 2016 even produced surplus electricity, which has been sold to Nukissiorfiit for use in the rest of the town's electricity grid. ” Our environmental loans are These are very convincing figures and in 2016 the Bank has more popular than ever therefore installed solar panels on the roof of the bank before. This concerns loans for buildings in Ilulissat and Qaqortoq. In 2017, the Bank's last ecofriendly cars, and energy branch in Sisimiut is also expected to install solar panels. The renovation of homes and Bank's building in Qaqortoq was subject to energy renovation buildings. We can see high in 2016. This is an element of the ongoing energy optimisation demand for these loans in launched by the Bank in recent years. In 2013-2014, the Nuuk.” branches in Sisimiut and Ilulissat were also subject to energy Yvonne Kyed renovation. The BANK of Greenland has a canteen scheme in Nuuk, whereby a shelter for the homeless receives surplus food every day of the week. In 2014, the environmental team assessed whether reduction of the food prepared could give environmental savings, but it was assessed that the social value of donating food to the homeless was greater. 13 The BANK of Greenland is a member of the Saligaatsoq – Avantangiiserik environmental group, established by CSR Greenland in order to gather working groups which can coordinate environmental projects in Greenland across sectors, areas of expertise, etc. Under this umbrella organisation, the BANK of Greenland is one of seven companies participating in a three-year cooperation project on strategic environmental management. The project is called Clean Greenland – Green Companies and is coordinated in a partnership between CSR Greenland and WWF World Wildlife Fund, and was completed in 2016. In addition, under Saligaatsoq auspices the BANK of Greenland participated in the annual Cleaning Up Day, which again in 2016 was held in all of the towns in which the Bank has branches. In Solar panels are an investment Nuuk, representatives from the Bank also took part in an outdoor exhibition of electrical and hybrid vehicles, which was that quickly pays its way. In held in order to focus on the environmental and financial Aasiaat we have seen how the solar panels cover towards 82% advantages of a car in energy class A. This was the second consecutive year that the Bank combined the exhibition of of the branch's total annual ecofriendly vehicles with the annual Cleaning Up Day. electricity consumption. The Bank is also involved in a project group under CSR Jørgen Aarup Jensen Greenland with the aim of promoting focus on day-to-day Building Officer opportunities to save resources in office environments. Progress in the BANK of Greenland's day-to-day environmental work is ensured by an environmental coordinator/project manager and a team consisting of a wide selection of employees with a special interest in environmental work. The building officer and procurement officer are permanent members of the team, as their areas of responsibility are the focus of the environmental initiative. All of the Bank's branches are also represented in the environmental team and coordinate elements of the environmental initiatives in the Bank. In 2014, the environmental team mapped the Bank's overall environmental footprint and established registration and monitoring of the consumption of resources. The data basis, an assessment of the key environmental impacts and possible measures, and an action plan for concrete reduction targets for 2016, were included in a detailed environmental report. 14 Considering the Bank's printing using the Papercut solution in isolated terms, in 2016 the Bank reduced its environmental impact. This is best illustrated by the box below. It should also be mentioned that the Bank has optimised the use of double pages by almost 50%, which has a significant impact on the Bank's overall printing and paper consumption. It is also expected that in the long term, the tighter management of procurement and stocks, and more environmentally sound procurement, will result in 5-10% lower consumption of paper, office supplies, etc. The BANK of Greenland's total CO2 consumption in 2015 amounted to 286.13 tonnes, compared to 334.29 tonnes in 2014. The Bank was unable to maintain the result for 2015 and can note an increase in CO2 consumption.The Bank's emissions amounted to 313.95 tonnes of CO2 in 2016. This is an increase of 9% and is partly a consequence of the inclusion of one more storey at the Bank's head office. The Bank's employees have also travelled by air more often and over longer distances. As the Bank works under geographical conditions that make other means of transport less accessible, In 2016, the Bank succeeded in or non-existent, its CO2 consumption can fluctuate from year reducing its negative to year. Nonetheless, the Bank aims to continuously reduce its environmental impact by consumption, but is aware that there will be challenges in printing more effectively. fulfilling UNGC's goal of Affordable and Clean Energy and 2016: taking responsibility for Climate Change . 3.b. Human rights A fundamental element of UNGC's goals is to work for gender equality, and the BANK of Greenland has the overall goal at management levels of achieving and maintaining equal ratios of men and women in its management. In August 2013, the BANK of Greenland's Board of Directors adopted Policy and 2015: target levels for the under-represented gender. Irrespective of gender, the BANK of Greenland's employees must experience that they have equal opportunities for career development and management positions. As of the end of 2016 there is an equal distribution ratio, with 50 % women and 50 % men. The Bank's objective is for the ratio of managers of the under-represented gender to be held at minimum 40%. In 2016 the BANK of Greenland also worked on drawing up a social media policy. This policy will first and foremost ensure employees' freedom of expression and protection from digital harassment. Since inappropriate conduct on the social media can have legal employment consequences, the policy must also explicitly define current guidelines and provide guidance on good conduct. The policy has been approved by the Bank's Safety and Cooperation Committee. 15 Another element of the BANK of Greenland's CSR work is that the initiative has been taken to incorporate the UN's human rights principles in supplier contracts. This work will promote knowledge of and responsibility for observing the UN's human rights. In 2016, the Bank contacted the principal subsuppliers in order to update supplier conditions in accordance with our obligation with regard to the UNGC. As a result, 22 subsuppliers have signed to confirm their obligations under the UN's human rights principles. In addition, five suppliers have refused to sign the declaration. The Bank still cooperates with these suppliers, as they are considered to be essential to the Bank's operations and activities as a financial institution. The Bank is also in dialogue with a further 21 subsuppliers and work will continue to bring them on board in 2017. 3.c. Labour rights Training and competence development Employees are part of the BANK of Greenland's public image, and it is our employees who create and maintain close relationships with our customers on a day-to-day basis. The BANK of Greenland has therefore continued to focus on competence development via trainee programmes, supplementary training, management development and on the job training . Training must be seen as part of the Part of the obligation to employee's development and career planning, and in conduct socially responsible conjunction with the Bank's need to recruit and retain business activities is that we qualified manpower and to contribute trainee positions to the require our suppliers to do the local community. same. In 2016, 22 subsuppliers signed to confirm their For the BANK of Greenland it is very important to ensure the obligations in relation to the recruitment of employees with banking expertise, and in 2014 UN human rights principles. the Bank therefore employed eight trainees, who have taken the financial training programme at Niuernermik Ilinniarfik Carsten Th. Pedersen (Greenland's Commercial College) in Nuuk. Four trainees are Administration Director placed in Nuuk, and the other four are attached to the Bank's coastal branches. The trainees completed the programme in the summer of 2016. Besides the actual trainee programme, the Bank has very successfully created trainee positions for young people with a background as financial economists. So far, four trainees have been trained as advisers under this programme, and in 2015 the Bank hired a marketing trainee, who qualified in the summer of 2016 and was then hired on a permanent basis. The higher two-year financial diploma programme is the secondary level of the financial training programme. In 2016, four employees competed the financial diploma programme. To strengthen management development, several of the Bank's managers have completed a management development programme. 16 At all employee appraisal interviews, employees are asked about their language training needs (Greenlandic, Danish or English), and in 2016 relevant employees from the Business Department and the Nuuk department received English lessons. In addition, two employees from the Bank's Call Centre attended Danish courses. In 2016, two employee attended a project management course and were both certified in the PRINCE2 module. The total number of employees was 115 at the end of 2016. The average age was 48, and of the total number of employees, 79 hold financial or extended higher educational qualifications. 81 women and 34 men are employed.At the BANK of Greenland, we have made education and inclusion initiatives in cooperation with Sermersooq Municipality a business procedure that benefits both the Bank and the individual employee. One of UNGC's goals is to motivate companies to train people, Quality Education, for the benefit of both the individual and the company. Working environment, health and safety A safe working environment and living healthily on a daily basis My management development will enable both employees and customers to thrive at the Bank. programme has given me tools to take responsibility for the The number of reported occupational injuries was 5 in 2011, 4 in day-to-day work here in the 2012 and 9 in 2013. The high number in 2013 is primarily due to branch. I've also gained an mould growth in a branch – which was addressed immediately, understanding of the however, and none of the branch's employees appear to have complexity of the manager sustained permanent injury. In 2014, only three cases were role. reported, and in 2015 none at all. This was followed up in 2016, when no injuries were reported. Niels-Anthon Petersen Branch Manager, Assisat Registered absence due to illness at the BANK of Greenland decreased by 101 days in 2016. From 786 (2015) to 685 (2016). Yet this is still far away from the Bank's target of 500 days. The Bank's ambition is to further reduce absence due to illness in 2017. To achieve this, a policy for absence due to illness, and follow-up interviews in relation to a high rate of absence due to illness, is planned to be introduced. 17 Inclusion Since most of the work tasks at the BANK of Greenland require prior educational qualifications or very specialised training, it is a challenge for the BANK to work with inclusion in the broadest sense. As a socially responsible company, we consider it to be an important obligation to work with inclusion in the areas where this is possible. In 2015, we therefore took the initiative to cooperate with Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq on job training for young people who find it difficult to achieve educational qualifications or join the job market, and for adults with special needs, but with prior administrative experience. This cooperation was expanded during 2016. The Bank's Private My inclusion programme has Customer Department has had one employee in a seven-month increased my job satisfaction inclusion programme, and then appointed this employee in a and given me a greater seven-month maternity replacement position. This has been to appetite for the labour market the benefit of the employee, the Bank and society. and the challenges I'll face in the future.” Marie Brandt Petersen Customer Supporter 3.d. Anti-corruption The BANK of Greenland works with all aspects of anti-corruption, including preventing extortion and bribery. In 2014 the BANK of Greenland therefore adopted a gift policy which lays down rules for which gifts employees may receive (and their value). The policy also sets out guidelines for how, for example, employees should handle services for which there is an expectation of receiving something in return. In 2014 the Bank also adopted an anticorruption policy, which among other things stipulates zero tolerance towards conflicts of interest, bribery, extortion, fraud, embezzlement, misuse of gifts and nepotism. We need everyone in All of the Bank's employees have received training in the gift Greenland's labour market and and anti-corruption policies. All employees used this we cannot afford to waste opportunity to complete case and dilemma exercises, so that valuable manpower.

Beate Møller Olsen At the BANK of Greenland we also continuously register and HR Supporter monitor our customer complaints so that we can optimally ensure balanced and fair case handling, and improve our service 18 and information. It is in the Bank's own interest to handle all relevant complaints in accordance with current guidelines and so that customers understand the Bank's reasons for refusing loans and other similar transactions. In 2016, we received 18 complaints. This is one more than in 2015, but eight less than in 2014. Of these 18 cases, five complaints were recognised in full or in part, which is two more recognised complaints than in 2015, but two fewer than in 2014. In 2015 we also established a separate new complaints process reserved for business customers. So far we have not received any complaints via this channel. In 2014, the Bank sponsored Transparency International Greenland's participation in Global Corruption Barometer. This survey was published in 2016 and provides objective tools and new knowledge about the risk of corruption and a lack of transparency. In 2016, the Bank furthermore introduced a whistleblower scheme, on an equal footing with other Danish banks. This will allow employees to file anonymous reports if they experience matters at the Bank which may infringe human rights or other legislation. 4.
