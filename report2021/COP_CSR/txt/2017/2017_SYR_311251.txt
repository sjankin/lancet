Fair Value Measurement of Financial Assets Embedded derivatives Fair value is the price received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their between market participants at the measurement date. risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not measured at FVTPL. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured by taking into account the characteristics of the asset or liability that if market participants would consider those characteristics when pricing the asset or liability Hedge accounting at the measurement date. The Bank enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure to interest The Bank designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and For financial reporting purposes, fair value measurement are categorized into level 1, 2 or 3 based on the non-derivatives in respect of foreign currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

H. Impairment of Financial Assets Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are The Bank assesses the financial assets at each reporting date, except for those classified at fair value recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged through profit or loss, whether there is any objective evidence that the financial assets are impaired. asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, a loss event has occurred which has an impact on the of the consolidated [statement of comprehensive income/income statement] relating to the hedged estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. item. Objective evidence that an impairment loss related to financial assets has been incurred can include Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Bank revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging information about the debtors’ or issuers’ liquidity, solvency and business and financial risk exposures and instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge levels of and trends in delinquencies for similar financial assets, taking into account the fair value of accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the collaterals and guarantees. hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. The Bank considers evidence of impairment for assets measured at amortized cost at both specific asset Cash flow hedges and collective level. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash Impairment losses on assets carried at amortized cost are measured as the difference between the carrying flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash amount of the financial assets and the corresponding estimated recoverable amounts. Losses are flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in recognized in profit or loss. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases, the profit or loss, and is included in the ‘other gains and losses' line item. previously recognized impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are amount of the financial asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortized reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss, in the cost would have been, had the impairment not been recognized. same line of the consolidated [statement of comprehensive income/income statement] as the recognized hedged item.

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contract are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. 74 18 19 75 Financial Statements J. Loans and advances Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate Loans and receivables investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for payments and fixed maturity dates that the Bank has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Loans and receivables investments are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method net of unearned interest and provision for credit losses where applicable. If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying Bad and doubtful debts are carried on a cash basis because of doubts and the probability of nonamount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately collection of principal and/or interest. in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.

These contracts can have various judicial forms (guarantees, letters of credit, recognized for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is credit-insurance contracts). recognized immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in Financial guarantee liabilities are initially measured at their fair value, and subsequently carried at the which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. higher of this amortized amount and the present value of any expected payment (when a payment under the guarantee has become probable).
