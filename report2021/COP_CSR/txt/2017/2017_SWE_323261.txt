J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 6 CEO’s comments 3 At the end of the year we had almost 8,000 residential units in current production, of which 400 are rental units and residential care units. Ground is broken for Älvsjöstaden One of the really big projects that we started during the year is Älvsjöstaden in Stockholm. This is an example of a good location outside of the downtown area that is close to commuter trains. Customers have shown great interest and ground was broken in June for this new district. During the year, production started on 300 residential units and another 500 are planned in the area. We are supplementing an existing singlefamily home neighborhood with a modern city district and creating a good mix of residential units, commercial premises, green parks and inviting courtyards. This type of major development project is a challenge, but it also plays to JM’s strength as a project developer. Building rights for future production As we use land for production, we are also acquiring new land.

On these days, all of JM’s residential projects in Sweden, Norway and Finland are open to the public. In 2016, the theme was Kitchen, Balcony/Outdoor Space and Living Room. Our Open House Days are popular, with an average visitor count of almost 2,000 people on each occasion. These events attract many new potential buyers, most of whom are first-time visitors. It is an opportunity for JM to display our projects with the goal of generating more interest in buying a JM home in the future. Digital meetings with customers JM is accessible where our customers are, which is why digital channels play an important role in our communication with customers and the surrounding world. If a potential customer is interested in knowing whether a suitable JM residential unit is for sale, that information should be available regardless of the time and place. The website serves as the hub for our digital communication, and it works together with all of our digital initiatives and marketing activities. We have decided to be in the forefront when it comes to offering products and services via new digital channels. Traditional, printed sales brochures have been replaced by more project content on our website, which creates more value for our customers. We are continuing to develop #JMinspiration, a section on jm.se where we offer lots of inspiration through articles, “at home with” videos and DIY solutions for everything related to life at home, housing and architecture. We are constantly developing our digital initiatives. The Internet is our most important sales channel, and we are constantly working to improve and simplify this interface for our customers. In 2016, a new organization was introduced for online development at JM, which has made us more flexible and quick to adapt when it comes to meeting the needs of our customers.

Controlled risk taking is decisive for good profitability. Risks and opportunities are two sides of the same coin.

The construction industry is responsible for a significant part of society’s consumption of energy and materials, and as a homebuilder, we carry a heavy responsibility with respect to the environment for future generations.

For example, energy-efficient buildings, through a number of measures with the ambition of being the installations that conserve water and logical spaces for sortleader in building low-energy buildings in all of our projects – ing waste all help to lower operating costs for households and not just individual pilot projects. generate environmental benefits for society. J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 6 ENVIRONMENT 40 Sustainability Calculated energy consumption JM’S ENERGY CLASSIFICATION of housing produced by JM in Sweden JM applies a system for rating energy in residential units, an initiative that benefits our customers. The energy rating kWh/m2 A-temp 140 system is similar to the one used for major appliances, and it indicates a residential unit’s energy use. The system is 120 based on Swedish Standard SS-24300 and JM’s guidelines. 100 The values and parameters we employed are presented 80 on our website jm.se/sustainability to ensure the system is 60 open and transparent. Energy rating also provides JM with increased understanding of the energy use in our residential 40 units. With JM’s low-energy housing concept, we have laid 20 the groundwork for an energy-efficient building, but the build0 ings’ energy consumption will nevertheless vary depending on 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 the inhabitants’ behavior, the design of the energy system and where in the country the building is located. Calculated energy consumption of newly produced homes, excluding household and business electricity JM uses a standardized method to calculate the energy consumption of newly produced homes, which enables a comparison over time. The diagram shows the average CHOICE OF MATERIALS of housing projects that were completed each year. The calculated energy consumption has been reduced by around 40 percent since 2005. JM’s residential units are built using sound, proven and natural materials such as tile and wood. Since the middle of the 1990s, we have had a system in place to evaluate the ENERGY CONSUMPTION DURING THE environmental impact of building materials. This allows us to PRODUCTION PHASE check that the material we use does not contain hazardous JM works proactively to reduce energy use during the prosubstances or in any other way unnecessarily burdens the duction phase.

All pre-construction and installation work in JM’s residential units complies with requirements under the industry rules “Safe water installation”. The industry rules also apply to installed heating systems. JM works with methods during planning and production that avoid humidity in the building to prevent moisture and water damage. We use moisture-tolerant and mold-resistant gypsum wallboard for both wet areas and exterior wall constructions. Stringent requirements are also placed on vapor barriers for bathroom walls in accordance with current construction regulations. CONSTRUCTION WASTE JM endeavors to reduce the total amount of waste generated from its construction operations, as well as the amount of unsorted waste and waste sent to the landfill from construction sites. This work is carried out in collaboration with our suppliers and waste management companies and by offering internal training courses (see facts and key figures on page 116). Examples of measures include: • integration of the Ecocycle Council industry guidelines for waste management during construction and demolition in procedures for all JM projects in Sweden J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 6 Järvastaden in Solna/Sundbyberg. • identification of improvement areas based on studies of • suppliers must be able to demonstrate that they follow up produced waste on their fuel consumption and that they take measures to • introduction of a waste council in all regions within residendecrease their consumption tial project development in Sweden and a central, strategic • testing and assessing consolidated shipments of materials, waste council degree of utilization in trucks and the right type of delivery • improved procedures for pallet management at worksites vehicle to the work sites • efforts to reduce the amount of waste from packaging, • in the agreements JM signs with transport companies, material waste and temporary constructions such as proimplementing strict requirements that are in line with the tective railings and molding material.

The selection is based on criteria for risk factors, which in turn is based on, for example, geographic location, industry, structure of the supplier chain and companies in the manufacturing chain. The analysis consists of two parts based on compliance with JM’s agreement provisions and in particular the Code of Conduct. These evaluations are then followed up with on-site audits in selected factories. If any ­deficiencies are identified during the factory visit, the manufacturer must prepare plans for corrective measures that it must fulfill in order to continue to be a supplier in JM’s supplier chain. In some cases, the follow-up has resulted in JM stopping delivery of materials from a factory.

SEK 203m that is time-limited within an interval of 1–10 years. JM in Sweden uses life expectancy assumptions to calculate its pension liability, which in practical terms means that JM assumes that a man in Sweden who is currently 65 will live for 23 years after retirement and a woman for 25 years.

The amount of the provision is primarily based on the number of residential units per project and is charged to the project upon conclusion. The majority of the warranty provisions have a duration of around two to three years. Since the effect of when in time payment occurs is immaterial, expected future payments are not calculated at present value. Special payroll tax on the pension liability is calculated in full as 24.26 percent of the difference between the pension liability measured in accordance with IAS 19 and the reported pension liability in the legal person.

Property mortgages are only granted to a limited extent for financing with credit institutions. During a tenant-owner association’s production period, the JM Group provides guarantees for the part of the short-term financing in a bank that exceeds an association’s future long-term loans. Guarantee commitments, other relate entirely to the short-term financing. The long-term loans are secured by the mortgage deeds taken out by the association. The Group is obligated to acquire from tenant-owners associations in Sweden, with which JM has signed turnkey contracts, apartments that have not been sold as tenant-owner apartments at the end of the most recent quarter following an approved final inspection. This obligation ensures that the tenant-owners association can settle its short-term bank financing. Starting projects in stages, with requirements for a specific level of sales and reservations, reduces the risk of unsold units. See note 16 Participations in tenant-owners associations, etc. for a summary of this year’s purchases and sales. A tenant-owners association’s only current revenue is its monthly charges. In the past, JM provided a seven-year guarantee to ensure that the association received the estimated monthly charges. This guarantee comprises an undertaking to buy such apartments as are returned to the association from the first owner. JM then buys the apartment for SEK 1 and pays the monthly charge to the association until JM in its turn has sold the apartment. This guarantee has existed since 1993 but has never been utilized. JM considers it unlikely that the guarantee will need to be met in other than exceptional cases. No new guarantees have been issued after the end of 2010. JM takes out policies via Gar-Bo Försäkring AB for its tenant-owners associations as security for paid advances, down payments and charges. The insurance policy primarily ensures that the association can repay a reasonable amount (maximum contribution and charges) to a tenant-owner who has a right of termination due to significant increases in charges during the first year after final account, after which Gar-Bo Försäkring AB is under no obligation to provide any compensation. Claims have not been made against the insurance policy since 1962. Guarantees in connection with assignments largely relate to performance guarantees for contract work with municipalities and municipality-owned companies. These guarantees are in effect during production and for 2–5 years after completion. The commitment initially amounts to 10 percent of the contract price until completion of the work, after which it drops to 5 percent of the contract sum. To the extent that it is considered likely that JM will be held accountable, the commitment is recognized as a liability in the statement of financial position.
