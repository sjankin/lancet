January 29th 2007 was the beginning of our journey. Ten Winters with its weather watches and all our efforts to keep traffic flowing. Ten Summers with its demand peaks. Ten Christmases allowing kids to meet Santa in their hometowns on our trams and subways. Ten year-ends taking students to their final exams. All in all TEN YEARS in capital letters! In capital letters because having only passed these few years (maybe a lot in personal terms but quite few in companies terms), we can anyway proudly say that we have become a world reference in infrastructure management. I am extremely proud to confirm once more that for Globalvia, linking our TEN years of business with the TEN Principles of the UN Global Compact as our DNA is of paramount importance. We do not conceive working outside these Principles which should help us build a sustainable and fair world giving every inhabitant of the globe access to the required infrastructure. The annual submission of a Communication of Progress (COP) is the culmination of our corporate and personal efforts to implement the Ten Principles while we serve communities in eight countries. We support public accountability and transparency, and we therefore commit to continue reporting on an annual basis according to the Global Compact COP policy. Globalvia is fully committed and has internalized the UN Global Compact and its Principles in its strategy, culture and day to day operations while continuing to engage with the local communities we serve, thanks to collaborative projects that pursue to fulfill the broader sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. To this effect, Globalvia once more confirms this firm commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. I, personally and on behalf of all of us who work in Globalvia, proudly accept and support the challenge and are happy to celebrate our anniversary honoring them. Sincerely yours, Javier Pérez Fortea CEO 2017 is the fifth year joining the UN Global Compact and for Globalvia, the commitment is even stronger. Moreover, this year we celebrate our tenth anniversary and we take pride in saying that our Corporate Governance Strategy is a clear path to excellence, and the Ten Principles the perfect resume of it. For Globalvia, the Corporate Responsibility is a KPI measure of value that involves all the activities developed by the company, everywhere and in all the business areas: Human Rights, Corporate Social Responsibility, Labor Relations, Environmental Care and Corporate Governance, among others. For us, to be a part of the UN Global Compact through Communication on Progress report is a responsibility, but also an honor.

In 2013 the company hired a person with intellectual disabilities for the General Services department of Headquarters, who gives support to the receptionist, attends phone calls, scans and copies documents and does several administrative tasks. From the CSR Department the challenge was to build awareness about people with disabilities in the workplace. We were determined to make all employees learn that people with disabilities can make a positive contribution to business at all levels. For that employee and leadership sensitivity training was a real asset. That is why it was decided that the Steering Committee would be in charge of sensitizing Globalvia’s employees and teams to ensure the successful integration of this employee. Nowadays and thanks to everybody, this person is totally integrated in the company. Over time, Globalvia has increased both in number and diversity the Corporate Social Responsibility actions in cooperation with the FCPV, tightening the ties between both entities. This actions are described in following parts of this report.  Collaboration with PRODIS Foundation: intellectual disable people At the beginning of this 2017 year, Globalvia has started a new collaboration with PRODIS Foundation. PRODIS Foundation is an entity committed to people with intellectual disabilities to assist them in their personal development and job inclusion. 18 18 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions All its activities and programs are focused on its main mission: to provide the necessary support to improve the quality of life of these people and their families.

This fact proves the sense and the assured success of this collaboration, which means a further step in the CSR Strategy of the Company.  Collaboration with Juegaterapia: cancer children help in Spain From January 2016, Globalvia collaborates in Valencia with the Juegaterapia Foundation on its ”El jardín de mi hospi” project to offer a happier and more pleasant life to children suffering from cancer during their stay in the hospital. Each employee had the option to make an economic contribution along the year and Globalvia contributed the same amount provided by all, thus doubling the donation. The project “With you, 1=2”, which was described in the COP of 2014, is launched every two years and it was the starting initiative from which this Foundation was selected by all employees. Juegaterapia Foundation’s mission is focused on improving the life quality of children with cancer through free delivery of any type of video consoles and promote the humanization of healthcare environments through psychosocial interventions to promote play, creativity and art as a source of welfare for these patients. That is why “El jardín de mi hospi” project exists. This project consists of the creation of an outdoor space of 1000 m2 located in the roof of the Hospital La Fe of Valencia (Spain).

HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions This garden in Valencia is the third project of the Juegaterapia Foundation after La Paz and Doce de Octubre Hospitals in Madrid. During 2015 and with a similar objective, Globalvia through some concessions, collaborated with other Foundations that provide support to people with cancer. M50 Concession Limited signed an ongoing collaboration agreement with Can Teen Ireland, a nationwide Dublin based support group for young people between the ages of 12 and 25 years who have cancer and for their families. Can Teen provides 1 to 1 support, health professionals involvement, home/hospital visiting, social events and counselling services.

Costa Rica’ school was born in 2013 and it increased his activity until today up to 125 children with ages between 7 and 14 years thanks to Globalvia contribution. Social and sporty school in Costa Rica This school, which is located in Universidad Latina de Heredia Campus, opens its doors every Saturday from 8 to 11 a.m. educating the children different values through the sport. To have a good educational performance is an indispensable requirement to join the school. Chile’ school was born in 2009 and thanks to Globalvia contribution it has been possible to increase the activity of this school to a maximum of 215 children and to expand the project to the female population. Social and sporty school in Chile This school opens its doors to boys and girls who belong to dysfunctional families and/or living in care centers of Independencia and Estación Central communes located in Santiago de Chile. The main objective is to educate them through different values using the sport as a tool. 20 20 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions Furthermore, these two initiatives cover daily health and food needs both for children and their families and engage, inspire and educate them about healthy habits in living. Real Madrid Foundation main objective is to promote, both in Spain as well as abroad, the values inherent in sport, and the latter’s role as an educational tool capable of contributing to the comprehensive development of the personality of those who practice it. In addition, as a mean of social integration of those who find themselves suffering from any form of marginalization, as well as to promote and disseminate all the cultural aspects linked to sport. Ratification Protocol Signing event Thanks to the mutual trust, on March 2017, the collaboration agreement between Real Madrid Foundation and Globalvia Costa Rica has been renewed for three years more. Moreover, it is a tradition to organize a visit to Spain for a few children as a reward for their efforts and merits in their academic and sports trajectory. On the occasion of the children’s trip of this year, Globalvia organized a visit to Globalvia Headquarters Offices, where the CEO could received all of them, as well as a complete visit to Metros Ligeros de Madrid. In these activities, the teenagers could know the work done by our colleagues, could Children’s visit to observe the operation of a light rail and could learn how a sustainable Metros Ligeros de Madrid concession. transport works and the importance of use this type of transport regarding the environmental care.  AUARA Project: the water with values “You drink, other people drink” is the motto of AUARA, a brand of mineral water that invest the 100% dividends on bring drinking water to people who do not have access to it. “Globalvia drinks, other people drink”. This is the reason why the company has started to collaborate with this social entity regarding water supply through buying half-liter bottles. However, the most important thing is not only the charity essence of AURA but also everything it covers. From the bottles design that facilitates its transport and storage, the production with a 100% recycled plastic material until the accessibility thanks to a Braille system integrated in the bottle for blind people AUARA bottle. Globalvia joins AUARA project, with the aim of change a daily act such as drinking water into an extraordinary act such as try to reach a better world. 21 21 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions  School volunteering in Chile Since 2012, Globalvia, through the Aconcagua Highway, supports the children’s school known as Las Luciernagas in Llay-Llay (Chile). After the reconstruction project of the schoolyard carried out in 2014, during 2015 a new huge structure of outdoor games was installed in the schoolyard in regards to the recreation and amusement of the children. Globalvia, through the Itata Highway, supports the children’s rural schools that are closed to the highway in terms of helping in their culture and personal development. In 2014, the collaboration was focused on “Quinchamali” rural school in Children’s visit to the “Quellon” (Chile) and in 2015, the collaboration was focused on “Crucero Claudio Arrau León Museum. Huaro“ rural school in Bío Bío (Florida, Chile). Several cultural visits were organized by the concession through which the employees could enhance the integration of the children who belong to the rural communities.  Collaboration for training of disabled people: CAMPVS Carmen Pardo-Valcarce Foundation realized the integration of people with disabilities required for the disabled community to work to find solutions to break down existing barriers. Thus, the Foundation has launched CAMPVS, an innovative educational project following trends imported from the U.S.A. and UK to involve private enterprise in the world of higher education. People with disabilities may not feel as if they are ready for the job because they do not have the practical, hands-on experience required for skilled positions or they do not have all abilities required. Many people with disabilities who are entering the workforce have not had the benefit of summer employment or part-time jobs as well as specialized training. 22 22 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions As a result of this situation, companies cannot find in these people the adequate training for some positions. CAMPVS is just the answer to this issues. Keeping in mind that hiring and supporting people with disabilities must be a successful endeavor for the business, an innovative training system was designed. Three different and very specific training paths have been defined to give students just the right practical experience needed for a job posting. Along the way, companies will play a key role since employees of the different sponsor companies will teach subjects related this “careers”. Globalvia is one of the Sponsors and as part of the CAMPVS Mentoring program, a total of 10 employees have joined the corporate social volunteering and become Mentors regarding the current school period Training sessions (CAMPVS) (2016-2017). Although five of our colleagues had been mentors in previous years and wanted to continue in the project, five of them have joined the Program this year. Moreover, another colleagues contribute to the CAMPVS project by offering Master class sessions at the facilities of the university that serve as a complement to the training provided by CAMPVS teachers. The content of these Master Classes includes Business operation and structure , Employment relations, agreements, rights and duties of employees , Types of contracts and Selection processes . Master class sessions (CAMPVS) In addition and following the initiative launched last year, Globalvia offers one more year the execution of interview simulations for 10 students currently attending the third and last year of CAMPVS. These interview simulations are designed and structured in the same way as the interviews that take place during real selection processes of the Company. Students come to Globalvia’s offices, are interviewed during a 40 minute period approximately and later get an appraisal report indicating their strengths and areas of improvement. And if this were not enough, Globalvia also wanted to offer CAMPVS students the opportunity to visit one of its railway concessions to bring the activities and business closer to their daily lives. Hence, visits have been organized to Madrid Light Rail for after Easter in which students may enjoy a complete two-hour tour through the concession. 23 23 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions 11 Road Educational Talks: Costa Rica, Chile an Portugal Since 2012, Globalvia has been running a Road Educational Talks program for schools, based on fostering responsible habits and behaviour and preventing accidents when using road infrastructure. At the same time, the children taking part are encouraged to be key actors to build awareness of responsible behaviour on the roads in their immediate circles, thereby becoming agents for change based on looking after oneself and respecting the environment. The aim is to generate and strengthen relationships with neighbouring communities on the road, forging new links and reaffirming the organization’s commitment to local people’s quality of life. “I am responsible” Program in Costa Rica Globalvia develops this program in Costa Rica, Chile and Portugal since several years. In Costa Rica the program is called “I am responsible” and through games, the children learn how to be responsible pedestrians, cyclists and passengers. Besides the training, each child receives a hi-vis jacket to wear when they are on the roads. The program has evolved in creating road educational brigades in a manner that the children could transmit the information to their colleagues in the schools. A total of 360 children has been included in this program until today. Road Educational Program in Chile In Chile the program is called “Learn how to manage your safety”. During 2016 and for the third consecutive year, the plan includes educational activities, interactive and playful presentations adapted to the different ages of the students, accompanied by talks given by staff of Conaset, government agency responsible for road safety. Furthermore, an audiovisual competition on road safety for university students and technicians from Concepción. The participants had to make a video of 30 seconds and the winner will display his video in the cinemas of Concepción. In Portugal, through its concession Scutvias Autoestrada Beira Interior, Globalvia also develops this kind of program since 2005. Road Educational Program There are two modules, the first one is called “Safety Project” and is focused to in Portugal children ages 6-10 on children “Teaching car simulator” and is focused on children ages 12-18. Both modules use games for teaching better. 24 24 III. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions 12 Toy collection campaign Globalvia in partnership with the users of Seville Metro organizes a Toy collection campaign every December. This action, which has a high level of participation, means that a large number of toys can be distributed through local associations. Toy collecting 13 Local literary and musical culture promotion In the framework of the CSR Strategic Plan of the company, it is highlighted the importance of enhancing the local culture of the communities around Globalvia's assets and through its employees and their children. That is why, at the beginning of 2017 Globalvia has launched its first Story Contest with the aim of promote the literary talent of its employees and their children.

Furthermore, during 2016 Globalvia has developed several literary cultural activities inviting the local young users of the Spanish railways concessions to participate voluntarily in them.

HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES III.2 Implementation of human rights actions 14 Support the community On February 2017, M50 Concession Limited launched an initiative to support its employees in their involvement of local community based on activities to promote the local environment, sports, development and well-being.

The new policies and procedures establish guidelines to promote energy efficiency within the Group. • Carbon Footprint: The Carbon Footprint is defined as “all Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) emitted either directly or indirectly by a person, organization, event or product. This environmental impact is measured by taking an inventory of GHG emissions measured in terms of equivalent CO2 emissions following internationally recognized rules. Three types of emissions are considered in the case of organizations: (i) Level 1 or Direct Emissions are greenhouse gases directly emitted by the organization, for example by burning fossil fuels to drive its machinery and vehicles; (ii) Level 2 or Indirect Energy Emissions comprise greenhouse gases emitted by the power utilities used by the organization; and (iii) Level 3 or Other Indirect Emissions consist of emissions attributable to the production or delivery of products and services purchased by the organization. Level 3 Emissions are the hardest to account for given the countless different products and services used by organizations and the difficulty of establishing exactly the inherent emissions concerned unless accurate data is supplied by producers. Globalvia recognizes and is deeply concerned by the issues of climate change and global warming caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and as a socially responsible organization it has taken the initiative of estimating its Level 1 and 2 Carbon Footprint regarding 2015 period. Having established the size of the company’s footprint, it will now be possible to design and implement emissions reduction and/or offset strategies, to define more sustainable practices and to implement targeted savings initiatives. • A Compliance Management System: see Corporate Governance Section. 49 49 V.

Globalvia has the following commitment with the environment: “Reduction of the environmental impact of Globalvia’s activities, also maintaining a respectful approach that benefits the environment”. To overcome this statement, there are two core objectives for the whole organization: • Promoting improvements and innovation projects with an environmental impact • Diagnosis of the environmental impact of operations through a single Environmental Management System for the entire Group. The system's support is mainly based on comprehensive systems certified under standards that contribute to reducing environmental risk, contemplating compliance with both the law and the various international commitments assumed as well as with internal regulations Globalvia also defines a group of objectives to be applied on each phase of the business engagements: • Project › Maintaining strict laws’ consideration and excellent performing of the environmental studies. › Studying and integrating minimization measures concerning acoustic protection, draining waters treatment, landscaping and ecological passages. 54 54 V. ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES V.2 Implementation of environmental actions • Construction › Including specific environmental considerations in the building contracts. › Minimizing the impact by means of environmental training, environmental monitoring, archeological follow up and recovering and reintegrating affected areas. › Environmental Impact Analysis review and follow up in order to identify, predict, evaluate and mitigate the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of Globalvia's activity. • Operation › Cooperating with the Environmental Management System, not only in terms on monitoring, but conducting the appropriate initiatives to mitigate the environmental impact. Aligned with these objectives, Globalvia plans to perform the following initiatives for the period 2013-2015: • Joining the Carbon Disclosure Project (CPD): Along with Globalvia’s commitment to environmental preservation comes the need to know the impact of its activities and to clearly expose to the stakeholders both the measures and the actions towards it’s reduction.

Good environmental practices: stickers • Energy Efficiency Plan: Strategies to reduce the environmental impact aim to make less polluting processes and anticipate future regulations that affect the Company's business, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and waste management. As a result, Globalvia has planed to launch shortly an Energy Efficiency Plan. To do so, it is required that the Company conducts an energy audit at the Headquarters and concessions to identify potential energy-saving opportunities. The energy audit consists in a situation analysis that provides information on the operation of the building, the level of demand for energy used by services, the operation of its power systems and facilities and the condition of the components, energy consumed and associated operating costs. After that some targets of reduction will be established through the implementation of energy efficiency measures. 55 55 V.
