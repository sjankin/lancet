We at Econoler are committed to abiding by the UNGC principles in all our activities. This report presents an overview of the measures and actions undertaken over the past year to put these principles into practice. This report will be shared with our stakeholders via our primary channels of communication. Sincerely, Pierre Langlois Chief Executive Officer Econoler 2 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 2 COMPANY PROFILE Econoler is a consulting firm specialized in the design, implementation, evaluation, and financing of energy efficiency projects and programs. The firm also has experience in renewable energy, energy performance contracting, climate change mitigation, and carbon financing. In addition to its international headquarters in the City of Quebec, the firm has offices in Montreal and Toronto (Canada), Tunis (Tunisia), Cotonou (Benin), Lomé (Togo), Abidjan (Côte-d’Ivoire), Mexico (Mexico), Suva (Fiji), and Hanoi (Vietnam). Econoler’s North American and European subsidiaries include: Econoler USA, Inc. (Washington, D.C.); Econoler S.A. (Sofia, Bulgaria); and IFS2E (Paris, France). Firm Administrative Structure The firm currently operates four divisions: International Projects; Canadian Operations; Program Evaluation; and the Econoler Training Centre. Each department is overseen by a director who reports to the President and CEO. Econoler relies on its team of specialized staff and a worldwide network of associate consultants and partners who participate in project implementation. The firm particularly advocates partnering with local firms and experts. Team members are led by a project management team comprised of a technical director in charge of the quality of outputs and a project manager who oversees contractual and legal obligations to both clients and subcontractors. Lastly, technical directors and project managers report to the Econoler Director of Operations. International Experience Econoler has been operating for the past 35 years in industrialized, emerging, and developing countries on more than 3,000 assignments worldwide. Most of these were carried out for utilities, private firms, governments, as well as major bilateral and multilateral organisations. 3 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 3 DESCRIPTION OF PRACTICAL ACTIONS Econoler is keenly aware that properly fulfilling its corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a major role in maintaining its standing as a leading energy efficiency consulting firm in a rapidly growing and increasingly competitive global market. The firm wants the UNGC principles to become inherent to the core values that drive our staff’s and firm’s tireless pursuit of professional excellence. Econoler joined the UN Global Compact in 2013 for this very reason. Over the past year, we developed a set of ethics policies establishing our positions on workplace antidiscrimination, environmental protection, anticorruption, and human rights. Specific actions related to these major aspects are presented below. 3.1 Labour Econoler is committed to creating and maintaining a physically safe and psychologically healthy work environment where no current or prospective employee is at a disadvantage because of their age, colour, disability, gender, marital status, national or ethnic origin, race, religious belief, or sexual orientation. Physical, mental, and sexual harassment automatically results in dismissal. In September 2016, Econoler hosted a huge one-week celebration to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the firm. Econoler staff from all around the world (Bulgaria, Fiji, Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, Washington, and Montreal) converged on the Quebec City headquarters to partake in numerous celebrations and comprehensive training programs. The week-long event culminated with Econoler offering each employee a painting that represents the firm’s mission and vision for the future. Econoler has also recently added a new important resource to its organization by hiring a Chief Executive Officer. Jean-Francois Montreuil is helping the organization become the biggest national and international EE consulting firm by delivering more coaching and training programs that help Econoler employees develop greater expertise. The CEO’s duties also include restructuring the firm. In fact, the firm now comprises two main departments, National and International, which reinforce cohesion throughout the organization. An external human resources expert has also been hired to support the firm’s expansion activities. All those changes are illustrated in the organigram below. 4 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) Board of Directors President Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vice-President Office Human Assistant Supply Resources to the and Bulgarian Consultant CEO IFS2E Technolo EE Fund gy President Technical (BgEEF) Expert Executive Director Experts Subsidiaries Development Accounting Secretariat Director and Logistics Chief Econoler SA Coordinator Accountant Coordinator Econoler IFI relations & Secretary USA Partnerships Receptionist Development Operations Translators and Project Assistant Manager Support Staff National International Latin America MENA, Asia, and Consultation Training Evaluation and Europe Africa Director Director Director Director Director In addition to providing staff with a competitive healthcare insurance package, Econoler also goes to great lengths to create a pleasant and supportive work environment by organising sporting activities, social gatherings, and a monthly staff luncheon. Econoler ensures objective decisions are made pertaining to the selection of local subcontractors based on experience, education, and merit. Econoler does not hesitate to hire junior resources should their profile comply with project requirements, which is often their first opportunity to acquire international experience that benefits their professional development. Econoler complies with minimum wage standards in every country where it is active and always provides a living wage. Econoler also covers travel expenses and disburses per diems to all local experts. 5 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 3.1.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s labour policy is to create and maintain a safe, healthy, and pleasant work environment where every employee is treated equally to enable them to achieve their professional aspirations. This goal is not only applied to full-time staff, but also to the project subcontractors and partners. 3.1.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Econoler directors monitor and evaluate the work carried out by staff and their deliverables to help them improve their management skills and knowledge. Also, employees have recourse to an anonymous complaint mechanism to report issues on their work environment and relations. 3.2 Environment As a leading international energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm, Econoler naturally makes every effort to engage in and promote environmentally sustainable practices. The firm has adopted a green policy, incorporated concrete actions in our environment-management and daily operations, and participated in a number of voluntary international environmental initiatives. Econoler also wants to establish a committee to exchange information and views about opportunities to reflect our values as a firm specialised in energy efficiency. Once or twice every year, this committee will meet to share the successes of the firm and help other units of the firm learn from the experiences of colleagues. We believe that collaboration and cooperation are essential to the growth of the firm and ensuring that our work provides added value. 3.2.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s environmental policy is to limit the company’s carbon emissions and environmental impact by adhering to strict environmental principles and practices. 3.2.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating At Econoler, we closely monitor our performance in reducing carbon emissions as part of the international voluntary initiatives and communicate results to relevant stakeholders. 6 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) 3.3 Anticorruption Since our professional activities involve diverse national and cultural contexts around the world, including countries where the rule of law is weak, Econoler is committed to avoiding and denouncing any form of corruption and bribery. We prohibit offering, giving, soliciting, or accepting any bribes, whether in cash or other forms, or engaging in any other corrupt practices. Econoler strictly follows its anticorruption principles and does not respond to any calls for proposals and tenders that lack transparency, particularly at the project development stage. If any abnormal situations arise in the course of project implementation, Econoler does not hesitate to denounce these and report them to the relevant authorities. 3.3.1 Goal The ultimate goal of Econoler’s anticorruption policy is to ensure the moral decency, ethical integrity, and legal soundness of the assignments by strictly avoiding association with any corruption or bribery practices. 3.3.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Econoler staff is required to report to our Development Director any issues and questions regarding potential abnormal situations, especially at the early stage of project development. When such suspicions are confirmed, the firms or actors in question are boycotted. Econoler staffers are well informed about our anticorruption policy, and any misconduct on their part will result in dismissal. 3.4 Human Rights Econoler is dedicated to protecting human rights in its work environment and in work agreements with external consultants (local subcontractors and partners). The firm ensures that workers are provided with safe, suitable, and sanitary work facilities. Econoler has a zero-tolerance policy on all forms of harassment (physical, verbal, sexual, or psychological), which is clearly expressed in its Employee Handbook (last update August 2015): Harassment is unacceptable behaviour and is expressly prohibited. Employees engaging in any form of harassment, sexual or other, will be strongly disciplined through appropriate corrective measures including termination of employment. The firm is committed to maintaining a work environment free of harassment with a view to protecting the dignity as well as the physical and psychological integrity of employees. 7 Global Compact The United Nations Communication on Progress (COP) In addition to internal policies that preserve a safe and friendly work environment, Econoler is now integrating gender equality in the majority of its projects. With the new Canadian foreign policy priorities, Econoler starts considering gender equality issues in the energy field. Our main areas of interest about these new Canadian priorities are growth that works for everyone, the environment, and climate action. Empowering women starts with offering them opportunities to be part of the discussion and considering their needs when working on projects. Therefore, we wish to ensure that women’s and girls’ concerns are included in the outcomes of the work we do and that they participate equally as economic actors. 3.4.1 Goal Provide a safe, pleasant and harassment-free work environment to all employees and external consultants equally. 3.4.2 Performance Monitoring and Evaluating Employees who have reason to believe that they are victims of harassment may file a complaint, verbally or in writing, with their immediate supervisor or the Assistant of the CEO. Any complaint is treated in strict confidence. In the event that accusations are founded, appropriate action is taken as quickly as possible. 8 160 Saint-Paul St., Suite 200, Quebec City, QC G1K 3W1 CANADA | Tel.: +1 418 692-2592 Fax: +1 418 692-4899 www.econoler.com
