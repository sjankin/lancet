Actions Human Rights Java Mountain Coffee aims to ensure women farm workers are provided safe, suitable and sanitary work surroundings. We aim to help protect women workers from workplace harassment, including physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, abuse or threats. Sustainable Program Women's Empowerment From 2016 we started to generate the first funds from new sustainable coffee partnerships to be allocated to the Women's Empowerment Innovation Fund. This has assisted us to fund the legalisation process costs to form the first two women farmer cooperatives. From 2017 the certification programs will begin to be implemented under the Sustainable Program which will contribute to the empowerment of the women farm workers. Environment Funds generated from our new sustainable coffee partnerships during 2016 has been allocated to the Women's Empowerment Innovation Fund which will allow us to begin the implementation of our Nursery Program planned for late in 2017. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Java Mountain Coffee is committed to the engagement of a third party independent auditing company to commence yearly sustainable impact audits of the Sustainable Program. The sustainable impact audit will be published and presented to all sustainable coffee partners during the first six months of the following year.
