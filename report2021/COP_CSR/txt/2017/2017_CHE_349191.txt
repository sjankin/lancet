Consequently, we also report on the key developments in this area in the Coop Group‘s annual report. Sometimes, however, our stakeholders, partners and sustainability experts have specific information needs that cannot be met in the annual report due to the scope and level of detail. This specific, specialist information, which is updated annually, is summarized in this Sustainability Progress Report. Further information about the Coop Group‘s long-standing commitment to sustainability and about our management approach can be found here. In conjunction with the annual report, this report satisfies the reporting obligations under the UN Global Compact. Joos Sutter, Chairman of the Chairman of the Executive Committee « Sustainability is part of our corporate DNA. Through more than 300 specific actions, we demonstrate on a daily basis our commitment to increasing sustainability and comprehensively document this at taten-statt-worte.ch and weekly in the Coop member press. In this report, we go into even greater depth and provide you with transparent and detailed information about the progress of our commitment. » Sustainability strategy As a Swiss cooperative with a 150-year-old tradition, the members of the cooperative and its customers are the Coop Group‘s focus. In Retail, Wholesale and Production, we align our business activities with market-driven, environmental and ethical principles; this is the foundation of our success. AExcerpt from the Coop Group Cooperative‘s Articles of Association Art. 2 Purpose 1 The company‘s purpose (...) includes the promotion of its members‘ economic and social interests through mutual self-help as well as of its consumers. Coop takes the necessary steps to sustainably safeguard its competitiveness and its long-term existence in accordance with market-driven, environmental and ethical principles. Find out more about the Corporate Profile in our annual report. We concentrate on areas in which we can achieve significant leverage. We firmly enshrine sustainability in our core business and the line responsibility. Reflecting this, sustainability is incorporated in all relevant Coop Group strategies, through our overarching concept of sustainability. Materiality analysis As a producer and distributor of foods and non-food products, the Coop Group is closely involved in global goods flows. It is both affected by and exerts influence over worldwide environmental and social challenges. We want to make a positive contribution for people, animals and nature and avoid any negative impact our business activities may have. Therefore, we have been committed to sustainability for over 25 years. In order to unify our commitment within the Coop Group, in 2013 we conducted a comprehensive review and identified the main starting points. These form the basis for our specific multi-year sustainability targets 2014-2020 for the entire Coop Group. Find out more about the goals and the process of goal development here. After the first two years, we have now taken stock of progress and reviewed whether we are indeed covering the main themes and whether our targets are sufficiently specific and ambitious. Sustainable Development Goals The Agenda 2030 that has now been adopted by the United Nations is a global action plan for sustainable development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) form the centrepiece. They are intended to overcome the biggest global challenges to reducing extreme poverty and achieving more sustainable development. Through our business activities, we contribute to a number of these goals, while others are within the sphere of influence of other industries or of the public sector. You find more information on our website www.taten-statt-worte.ch. To give one example, «Ensure responsible consumption and production patterns» (SDG 12) has an immediate bearing on Coop‘s core business. With the objective of remaining the most expert provider of particularly sustainable ranges (Project 1.1.) and having established transparent Sustainability Progress Report 2016 5 and sustainable product chains (Project 1.2.) by 2020, and with our commitment to society, a total of 12 multi-year targets contribute to this important area. Internal and external stakeholders We have already closely involved our internal and external stakeholders in the development of multi-year sustainability targets. To review whether the targets adopted are indeed complete and relevant, in the run-up to the 2015 Stakeholder Forum we conducted an online survey. This revealed that our management approach, the range selection and the product chains are of paramount importance to our stakeholders. With just one exception, the additional targets cited related to more specific details about the requirements in the product chains. We incorporated this when revising the multi-year sustainability targets. For internal stakeholders, social responsibility and Coop‘s role as an employer were also very important. While the last point is covered by the comprehensive Personnel Strategy 2020+, the range-related targets were reviewed during the revision of the multi-year sustainability targets. The Coop Group now embraces all the SDGs that are relevant to it. Consequently, there is no immediate need to adjust the multi-year targets. Updating the multi-year sustainability targets When the multi-year sustainability targets were first adopted by the Coop Executive Committee and the Coop Board of Directors in 2013, the decision was made to review the multi-year targets in 2016. There were three main changes: 1. Tighter target values: For the sustainable ranges in particular, the target values were tightened in all three business areas. For instance, we raised the organic target in Retail by almost a fifth (from CHF 1,250 million to CHF 1,660 million). Coop is seeking to create a distinctive profile for itself in the area of sustainable products & services and has therefore set itself even more ambitious targets. 2. Q uantification of target values: In a few areas and markets, sustainability efforts in range selection and in the structure of product chains are so far advanced that qualitative targets have been replaced with measurable quantitative targets. In Retail and Production, for example, the target for critical raw materials has been quantified; likewise, in Wholesale, a quantifiable target has been set for organic farming. 3. Clarification of targets: Particularly in Wholesale, but also in Production, the data basis has fundamentally changed in recent years as a result of acquisitions. Data gathering has also been optimized. Therefore, for the energy and CO2 reduction targets we have decided to relate the targets for 2020 to the reference year 2015, as there is a solid data basis for this. In Retail, these targets still relate to the original reference year 2012. Reporting In the following section, we report on the degree of attainment of the multi-year sustainability targets for 2014–2020, the medium-term developments with regard to these targets, and additional key figures on the Coop Group‘s commitment to sustainability. The following principles apply: – Unless otherwise indicated, the report relates to the year 2016, the reference date being 31.12.2016 – Prior-year figures have been adjusted in each case – In order to review attainment, each target path has been broken down linearly, in one-year periods – For quantitative targets, the colour coding is based on an attainment index: < 98% = or-ange / 98%– 100% = yellow / > 100% = green; for qualitative targets, an assessment is performed by the respective technical specialists – Further information and standpoints on Coop‘s long-term commitment to sustainability can be found here Sustainability Progress Report 2016 6 Project 1.1 Sustainable products & services Coop intends to maintain its status as the most expert provider of particularly sustainable ranges until 2020. This means offering our customers choices for a sustainable lifestyle in all business areas and making a key contribution to more environmentally-friendly, social and humane cultivation, production, processing and provision of goods and services. In this way, we reduce negative impact on soils, water, air, livestock and biodiversity and improve the living conditions of workers and farmers who produce directly and indirectly for Coop. From a business perspective, we are confident that this approach meets a customer need, helps set apart and create a distinctive profile for the Coop Group and opens up market opportunities. Our key starting points: –E  xpansion of high-profile own-label sustainability brands subject to the most exacting sustainability requirements –L  ong-term cooperation with credible partners when establishing and expanding these ranges (e.g. Bio Suisse, WWF, Swiss Animal Protection SAP, Max Havelaar) –P  romotion of externally certified, sustainable standards with maximum credibility such as the Bio Suisse bud or Organic, Fairtrade Max Havelaar or FSC by expanding and marketing the relevant ranges –C  ooperation with research institutes and business partners when developing new ranges, including through the Coop Sustainability Fund Degree of target attainment and trend Targets for Retail Targets for Production Targets for Wholesale 1.1.1 R We are increasing the percentage 1.1.1 P We are increasing the 1.1.1 W We are increasing the 1.

In Retail, sales from sustainable products grew to CHF 3,528 million, which equates to a growth of 6.3%. This indicates that the sustainability ranges are developing especially well in what is a challenging market environment. In Wholesale, the expansion of the range has produced a very good trend which is well above the target path. The main drivers here are the national subsidiaries in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The manufacturing companies further consolidated their leading position in organic and fairtrade products. Chocolats Halba, for example, already generates more than 75.0% of its sales from sustainable ranges. Moreover, since switching cocoa butter to fairtrade, it has enjoyed the strongest growth in sales of sustainable products of all manufactur-ing companies. Cumulatively, the manufacturing companies are slightly short of the target path, due chiefly to the first-time consolidation of Hilcona in the Bell Group. The newly planned Bell Group sustainability strategy is intended to restore the target path. Coop‘s sales from sustainable products: – Own-label brands and quality seals which satisfy the most stringent sustainability standards and thus appeal to customers who attach great importance to compliance with progressive environmental and social standards – Ranges with sustainable added value which satisfy basic sustainability standards and have environmental or social added value compared with conventionally produced products. We therefore support them chiefly in the range of brands and in Wholesale – Regional products which strengthen regional added value while also presenting smaller producers with attractive sales opportunities – Own-label brands and quality seals for special dietary and consumer needs through which we fulfil our social responsibility as a cooperative retailer and wholesaler and producer. We are thereby ensuring that we cater for increasingly stringent requirements in areas including vegetarian/vegan diets and the rise in food intolerances and allergies Sustainability Progress Report 2016 8 Breakdown of sales from sustainable products Sales from sustainable products in Retail in CHF m 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Naturaplan 816 940 954 987 1,049 Naturafarm 442 453 435 443 456 Oecoplan 128 138 142 139 148 Naturaline (textiles and cosmetics) 66 62 59 60 59 Others (Pro Montagna, Ünique, Pro Specie Rara, Slow Food, Fairtrade Max Havelaar, Bio, 573 662 823 875 MSC, FSC, Topten, Hochstamm Suisse, Schweizer Pärke, Natrue, BDIH, Ecocert, Blauer Engel, Bird Life, EU Ecolabel) Sales of own-label brands and quality seals subject to the most stringent sustain2,057 2,166 2,252 2,454 2,586 ability standard Sales of quality seals with sustainable added value (ASC, UTZ, Rainforest Alliance, – – 209 371 animal welfare programmes, PEFC, Natureplus, Nordic Swan, GOTS, Label Rouge, Bluesign)1 Regional organic products (Naturaplan Bio-Regio, Oecoplan Bio-Regio) – – 15 40 Miini Region – – 140 170 Others (Pro Montagna, Schweizer Pärke, AOP, Mar-chio Ticino) – – 185 181 Sales of own-label brands and quality seals with added value for the region 1 – – 322 348 Special products for allergy sufferers (Freefrom, Aha, ear of corn symbol, lacto– – 135 168 se-free, sulphite-free) Products for vegetarians and vegans (Karma, Délicorn, V-Label) – – 193 287 Low-calorie products – – 40 53 Sales of own-label brands and quality seals for special dietary and consumer – – 403 468 needs1 Sales from sustainable products in Retail1 – – 3,319 3,528 Sales from sustainable products in Wholesale 1 128 193 Sales from sustainable products in Production1 204 279 Sales of the Coop Group from sustainable products (consolidated) 3,543 3,855 Share of sales from sustainable products in Production as a % 2013 2014 2015 2016 target 2020 Swissmill (Coop Naturaplan, Bio Knospe) 21.4 22.5 25.8 25.9 24.1 Chocolats Halba (Coop Naturaplan, Bio Knospe, Fairtrade Max Havelaar) 33.4 49.3 57.6 75.5 74.8 Reismühle Brunnen (Coop Naturaplan, Bio-Knospe, Fairtrade Max Havelaar) 36.8 45.0 48.0 50.8 52.3 Nutrex (Coop Naturaplan, Bio-Knospe) 14.4 16.3 16.9 26.5 24.3 Sunray (Coop Naturaplan, Bio-Knospe, Fairtrade Max Havelaar) 21.1 22.7 24.5 25.8 25.0 Steinfels Swiss (Coop Oecoplan, Coop Naturaline Natural Cosmetics, Maya) 25.7 27.0 31.9 32.7 33.3 Bell Group (including Hilcona from 2016 onwards) 17.7 17.8 18.5 16.8 22.0 Share of sales from sustainable products at manufacturing companies – 19.7 21.2 21.5 24.3 Share of sales from sustainable products in Wholesale as a % 2015 2016 target 2020 Transgourmet Switzerland 2.5 3.9 4.6 Transgourmet Germany 1.7 2.6 3.5 Transgourmet Polska 0.1 0.1 0.2 Transgourmet Romania 0.1 0.1 0.1 Transgourmet Russia 0.0 0.0 0.0 Transgourmet France 1.9 2.1 3.0 Transgourmet Österreich 3.0 4.3 4.7 Share of sales from sustainable products at Transgourmet 1.6 2.3 3.0 1 Totals without double counting Sustainability Progress Report 2016 9 Multi-year target 1.1.2 Organic products Sales of organic products in CHF m 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 target 2020 Retail, of which: 934 1,061 1,082 1,104 1,181 1,660 Wholesale – – 28 50 82 Production 183 181 204 279 242 Coop Group (consolidated) – – 1,174 1,255 – Organic sales grew substantially in all areas of business compared with the previous year. The picture is very mixed in Wholesale, where quantitative targets were formulated for the first time in 2016. While most national subsidiaries are well above the target path, Transgourmet France was badly hit in the area of fruit and vegetables by the loss of a major organic customer. Almost all manufacturing companies are achieving growth in this area due to the expansion of their organic ranges and are beating the targets set. Only Sunray is not on track, due to a delay in the anticipated organic certification of producers abroad. Coop Naturaplan, which bears the Bio Suisse bud, is demanding that the whole operation is switched to organic, including production for its own use or the local market. Although this makes the changeover a challenge, it does ensure maximum credibility. Further information about our commitment to organic farming can be found here. Mulit-year target 1.1.3 Fairtrade products/products with social added value Sales of products with social added value in CHF m 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 target 2020 Retail, of which: – – – 515 578 – Fairtrade Max Havelaar 187 219 260 334 397 441 Naturaline products made from fairly traded organic cotton 64 59 56 56 54 – Pro Montagna 38 38 38 40 40 – Other quality seals with social added value (RA, UTZ) – – – 84 88 – Sales of products with social added value 527 – Wholesale, of which: – – – 12 18.1 40 Fairtrade Max Havelaar – – – 12 14 – Production, of which: – – 60 85 3) – Fairtrade Max Havelaar – – 60 74 97 82.5 3 Social added value was not ascertained in 2016 In Retail, Coop is on track with its «Fairtrade growth strategy ». The inclusion of new products such as the Fairtrade festive biscuits and the systematic expansion of the range in areas such as dried fruits and ice cream or desserts, yoghurt, quark and chocolate are yielding continuous growth. In Wholesale, new products are continually being added to the range of products with social added value (see box below). The majority of these products satisfy fairtrade requirements. However, the huge increase compared with the previous year is due in part to improved data gathering. In Production, fairtrade sales of Chocolats Halba and Sunray have risen sharply. Halba switched the bulk of the cocoa butter it uses to fairtrade quality and fairtrade now ac-counts for 63.0% of the cocoa butter and 94.0% of cocoa beans. Sunray has increased the share of fairtrade in its dried fruits in particular. Moreover, almost 45.0% of Sunray‘s fairly traded products are also certified organic. At Reismühle Brunnen, nearly all products from risk countries are fairtrade. Fairtrade and social added value To combat poverty and ensure appropriate manufacturing conditions, we promote the sale of fairly produced and fairly traded products. In Retail, our vision is to have switched all raw materials originating from countries in the southern hemisphere to Fairtrade Max Havelaar by 2020. In textiles, we are taking a similar route with our Naturaline own-label brand and are the world‘s biggest provider of fairly produced, organic textiles. For our Pro Montagna own-label brand, the focus is at home: the raw materials originate from, and are processed in, Swiss mountain regions. This keeps the added value in the mountain regions and a portion of the sale price goes to the Zewo-certified Coop Aid for Mountain Regions. In addition, Sustainability Progress Report 2016 10 most notably in its brands segment and in Wholesale, the Coop Group also supports the UTZ and Rainforest Alliance quality seals, which guarantee basic social standards. They make it easier for products to be admitted to fairtrade ranges and also cover countries/areas that can be certified under Fairtrade Max Havelaar (such as hazelnuts from Turkey). Multi-year target 1.1.4 Regional products Sales of regional products in CHF m 2015 2016 target 2020 Retail, of which: 322 348 500 Regional organic produce 15 40 – Miini Region 140 170 – Other4 185 181 – Wholesale Qualitative Production Qualitative 4 Pro Montagna, Schweizer Pärke, AOC The expansion of the regional ranges is on track within the Coop Group. The Guideline on the Miini Region own-label brand has been tightened up and made more specific with regard to quality and origin requirements. Qualitative targets have been defined in both Wholesale and Production, and these are on track. In Wholesale, all the national subsidiaries are running projects to promote regional suppliers, focusing in particular on fresh produce such as bread, milk, meat and fruit and vegetables. While in Eastern Europe/ Russia, individual markets work directly with the suppliers, at Transgourmet Österreich the independent AMA (Agricultural Market Austria) quality seal is promoted nationwide. In addition, the range of Ursprung/ Origine/Vonatur own-label products has been greatly expanded. The manufacturing companies have increased the percentage of Swiss raw materials used. Sunray, for instance, has switched to Swiss-origin dried beans and launched various farming projects in Switzerland for turnips and pulses. Sustainability of regional products In Retail and Wholesale, we provide a sales channel for regional producers and are increasing regional added value. For the Miini Region own-label retail brand, for instance, at least 2/3 of added value must be created regionally. This benefits both structurally weak regions and smaller, artisanal producers. Regional products travel shorter distances but, because of their small quantities, logistically they are more expensive to handle and necessitate exacting quality control. The Bio-Regio product line provides a retail range of regional organic products which satisfy the most stringent Bio Suisse Knospe requirements. In Wholesale, the Origine/Ursprung/Vonatur own-label brand formulates basic requirements for both origin and animal welfare and the environment. In Production, the focus is on using Swiss raw materials which meet the high legal requirements for animal welfare, working conditions and protecting the environment. Multi-year target 1.1.5 Environmentally-friendly non-food products Sales of environmentally-friendly non-food products in CHF m 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 target 2020 Retail, of which: – – – 501 494 650 Oecoplan 128 138 142 139 147 – Naturaline textiles – – – 50 47 – Naturaline Cosmetics – – – 10 12 – FSC – – – 227 225 – Topten – – – 148 150 – Sustainability Progress Report 2016 11 Due to the growth in online trading and undented popularity of cross-border shopping, the market in the non-food segment was strained in 2016. Increasing sales of sustainable products in this area proved particularly challenging. While the Oecoplan own-label brand has grown solidly, Naturaline Textiles is stagnating. In the home electronics market, Topten marginally increased its sales despite more stringent requirements for Topten products and the changes to the market. As regards lighting, Coop stopped selling energy-saving light bulbs in 2016 and LED already accounts for more than 50.0% of sales. Project 2.1 Sustainable product chains By 2020, Coop intends to have created transparent value chains which take account of the needs of people, animals and nature. In this way, we are contributing in particular to combating poverty, reducing environmental impact and improving animal welfare, while at the same time increasing our resilience to the risks on the sourcing market. It is with regard to our own-label brands that we exert the greatest influence. However, our new purchasing strategy also increasingly places the onus on brand manufacturers. Our key starting points: – Promotion of transparency and traceability as a prerequisite for effective optimization of the product chains – Definition and enforcement of minimum sustainability standards with the emphasis on recognized external standards and industry standards such as BSCI, RSPO, GLOBAL G.A.P. etc. –E  nforcement of ambitious minimum standards for critical raw materials right through to primary production – Commitment to the development and refinement of relevant standards through active involvement in the appropriate bodies – Reduction of packaging material along the product chain Degree of target attainment and trend Targets for Retail Targets for Production Targets for Wholesale 2.1.1 R We are creating transparency / 2.1.1 P We are able to transparently 2.1.1 W We are able to transpatraceability of own-label brands along illustrate the product chain for rently illustrate the product chain the production and supply chain. all products and trace products for own-label products and trace through each production stage. products through each production 2.1 Coop has transparent product stage. 2.1.2 R We apply at least minimum sus2.1.2 P We apply minimum sustain2.1.2 W We promote sustainability tainability standards to 93.3% of critical ability standards to 84.5% of our standards for the critical raw 2.

Re-quirements of the Greenpeace Detox Commitment and the Coop Guideline on Textiles and Leather have been defined. Own-label food brands: Traceability back to the country of the last valuable processing step as the basis for improved BSCI implementation incorporated in SAP. Upstream supplier management: Involvement in the CTI project (Commission for Technology and Innovation) at the University of St. Gallen. Palm oil: Preparation for supply chain mapping of the 20 key business partners back to plantation level. Fish: Origin and fishing method known for the entire range and assessed in each case by WWF (score 1–6). Fishing method is declared on the product. Wholesale Transgourmet Switzerland: Product specifications in the materials management system enable full transparency for Swiss products, currently being set up abroad.. Transgourmet Germany: Transparency based on EU legislation is high in the own-label food brand range. Transgourmet Österreich: Own-label brand contracts with own-label brand suppliers; compliance monitored through supplier audits and supplier assessments. Production Chocolats Halba: Cocoa beans can be traced right back to the cooperative; thus far, only partially the case for cocoa butter. Steinfels Swiss: Forward and backward traceability of the semi-finished products used is ensured. As part of the «Transparency in the value chain» retail project launched in 2015, during the year under review various providers (SIM, Achilles, Sustain) were evaluated by IT-based product chain management solutions and tested in pilot projects. For example, the palm oil product chains of the 20 key business partners were mapped right back to the plantation. These can then be compared with information from the Global Forest Watch Monitoring System based on the available GPS data. Moreover, since the year under review the entire own-label brand range has been traceable right back to the country of the last valuable processing step. In the textiles segment, the product chains of the key suppliers have been mapped, all the way through to wet processes. In addition, the companies were asked to complete a self-assessment covering important points with regard to the implementation of the Detox Commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals from the textile product chain. At a number of national Transgourmet subsidiaries, the requirements for greater transparency were implemented in materials management. However, the focus here is still on screening ranges, defining specific range standards and agreeing these with suppliers (see also Critical raw materials in own-label brands (MYT 2.1.2)). The manufacturing companies know the origin of their main raw materials and, in some cases, work closely with the producers. In the year under review Reismühle Brunnen, for example, processed 1,800 tonnes of rice from its «Fair & Good» project, which is supported by the Coop Sustainability Fund. You can find further information on transparency in the product chain here.

Across all 14 critical raw materials combined, Retail is on target. Some raw materials are not entirely on the target paths (broken down linearly) for the year under review (see also detailed figures below): New approaches have been adopted for hazelnuts or the cultivation of fruit and vegetables in countries with high water stress, and these will start to take effect over the next few years. In Wholesale, the national subsidiaries in Germany, France and Austria undertook comprehensive screening of ranges in 2016 to identify critical raw materials and determine the main actions required. Palm oil, fish/seafood and meat are critical raw materials at all subsidiaries and, in some cases, coffee, cocoa and fruit and vegetables. Appropriate guidelines are currently being drawn up for the sourcing of these raw materials in the own-label brand range. Taken across all manufacturing companies, the quantified target for 2020 has already been exceeded during the year under review. This is due in part to the significant pro-gress made with fresh meat and poultry at Bell. In light of this, the targets will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary in 2017. Further information about critical raw material can be found here.

For example, Chocolats Halba and Steinfels Swiss purchase 100.0% physically sustainable palm oil which meets a RSPO standard (segregated or organic). At Sunray, the wide range of dried fruits and vegetables is still presenting some difficulties. The fruits and vegetables are sourced from a great many small producers, making it very difficult to enforce certification and standardization. For cocoa and hazelnuts, however, Sunray is on course. In the year under review, Chocolats Halba switched to fairtrade for all of its cocoa butter and has attained a percentage of 98.6% for cocoa beans. Multi-year target 2.1.3 Sustainable sourcing of important raw materials Situation with regard to sustainable sourcing of important raw materials 2016 Retail Business partner rating: sustainability has a weighting of 25.0% in the SAP-based rating. Soy footprint: Ascertaining the amount of soy incorporated in the key food ranges (mono products meat, milk and eggs); total content approx. 41,000 tonnes, of which 36,000 tonnes in own-label brand production (equates to a growing area of approx. 140 square kilometres). BSCI-Umsetzung (Business Social Compliance Initiative): high percentage of suppliers in the food, non-food, near-food and non-retail products segment have BSCI status «OK» and are part of the BSCI process. BEPI (Business Environmental Performance Initiative): Pilot project at Chinese suppliers and strong commitment to BEPI Working Group Brussels, to establish the standard as widely as possible. At many producers, particularly in the Far East, Coop alone does not have sufficient influence to demand a comprehensive environmental standard. The project was supported by the Coop Sustainability Fund. Detox: Focus more on stable upstream supplier management than on downstream product checks. Provision of aids and training to impel all suppliers and upstream suppliers to comply with the standard. E.g. preparation of a detox manual in 6 languages (including Chinese). Cooperation as part of the ZHDC towards the joint development of standardized sustainability requirements. FFurther information about Detox can be found here. WWF partnership: Formulation of new targets for the contractual period 2017–2019 in areas including purchasing. Sustainability Fund innovation projects: Support for projects to further develop organic farming (e.g. organic cotton, copper-free cultivation, cultivation that has minimal impact on soil and climate) and sourcing projects (range development for organic farming, e.g. exotic produce, wine etc.). Further information about the Sustainability Fund you can find here. Production Bell: Takeover of suitable poultry producers to establish humane product chains. Reismühle Brunnen: Prolongation of sourcing projects in India and Thailand to establish stable value chains. Sunray:Establishment of sourcing projects e.g. cashews (Benin), cane sugar (Paraguay and Costa Rica), mushrooms (Bosnia and Montenegro), walnuts (Chile and Moldavia). With various sourcing projects and the screening of ranges, the sourcing of important raw materials within the Coop Group is on target. In Retail, good progress was made with ambitious projects such as the broad implementation of the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI) Code of Conduct in the food and non-food range and the implementation of the Detox Commitment with Greenpeace in the textiles segment. Furthermore, as part of our partnership with the WWF, ambitious targets were agreed for the range for the contractual period 2017–2019. At the manufacturing companies, sourcing projects with a proven track record were extended or reestablished.

Now, we are turning our attention more towards importers. We want to also impel importers to take part in BSCI, thereby indirectly reaching their producers as well. Consequently, the share of suppliers with BSCI status «OK » has fallen since 2015. The implementation of BSCI is less advanced among importers. Furthermore, BSCI au-dit systems have been tightened up considerably.

Multi-year target 2.1.4 Animal welfare Implementation of animal welfare standards throughout the range 2016 Retail see also MYT 2.1.2 critical raw materials Sales: Sales: Increase of 20.0% in sales of products with added value in regard to animal welfare, to CHF 751 m. More than 50.0% of meat and eggs at Coop satisfy an animal welfare standard which goes beyond the legal requirements. Ratings: Top ratings in the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare (BBFAW) and in the SAP Report (Swiss Animal Protection) «Animal Welfare in Retail 2015/2016». Import: Since January 2016, imported turkey has met the BTS standard (with the exception of Prix Garantie). Antibiotic reduction: Pilot project optimize and improve health standards among calves, leading to a reduction in the need for antibiotics. Wholesale Transgourmet Germany: Adoption of guideline on sustainable sourcing with minimum requirements on animal wel-fare and incorporation of animal welfare in supplier contracts, addition of more products bearing the animal welfare label of the German Animal Welfare Federation, expansion of own-label range «Ursprung» with more stringent animal welfare requirements and a ban on the use of fattening agents for poultry. Transgourmet Switzerland: Introduction of own-label Origine/Ursprung products with more stringent animal welfare requirements. Transgourmet France: Introduction of own-label Origine/Ursprung products with more stringent animal welfare requirements. Transgourmet Österreich: Preference to minimum Austrian animal welfare standards in the range and planned introduction of own-label brand Vonatur (equates to Origine/Ursprung). Production Bell: Establishment of European turkey and chicken production in accordance with PAS standard (particularly animal-friendly stabling) with the takeover of various poultry pro-ducers in the German-speaking region in order to establish humane product chains. Sunray: all products containing eggs switched to higher animal welfare standards.

Since 2016, chicken has been almost exclusively obtained from husbandry which satisfies the minimum standard in Switzerland, with the exception of Prix Garantie. This standard has already been met for around 80 percent of promotions, so we have achieved a major step in the changeover. While milk (100.0%) and eggs (94.0%) originate predominantly from Swiss production, due to the higher share of brands and imports there is scope for further action with regard to cheese. In Whole-sale, the expansion of the Origine/Ursprung own-label brand has resulted in the first distinctive ranges with more stringent animal welfare requirements (e.g. free-range geese). However, in the eastern European countries in particular, animal welfare efforts are still in their infancy. Aside from Bell, the Coop manufacturing companies purchase their animal raw materials (in particular eggs and milk powder) mainly from Swiss producers, ensuring compliance with the high Swiss minimum standards. At Bell, nearly 88% of fresh meat including poultry at least complies with Swiss animal welfare legislation. Multi-year target 2.1.5 Branded articles Implementation of sustainability standards for branded articles 2016 Retail Critical raw materials: Definition of internal target values for critical raw materials for branded articles (coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea); fish, wood/paper and peat have for many years been covered by the WWF objectives. Palmöl: Brand manufacturers required to switch to sustainable palm oil. Coop is committed to promoting physically sustainable palm oil in accordance with RSPO. EU-Bio: EU organic logo permitted as the entry standard for organic products at certain brand manufacturers. Geschäftspartner-Rating: Inclusion of branded articles in Coop business partner rating.

Consequently, based on a linear breakdown, the 2016 target was not quite met. In Retail, the changeover of charcuterie packaging from fresh PET to recycled PET, which began in 2015, continued in 2016. Moreover, a major project to switch from cardboard to recycled materials or FSC got underway but this will only start having an effect in 2017. There are a number of projects underway in Wholesale to reduce packaging, such as the use of bulk packs and collaborations with own-brand suppliers to optimize packaging. Major improvements have been achieved at the manufacturing companies, chiefly by saving on corrugated cardboard and cling film and through the use of recycled plastic at Steinfels Swiss. More information about reducing and optimizing packaging you can find here. Sustainability Progress Report 2016 18 Project 3.1 Energy management and climate protection Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing society on a global scale. Coop is steadily reducing is energy consumption by 2020 and protecting the climate by systematically lowering CO2-emissions in its own operations (Scope 1 and 2). Therefore, back in 2008 Coop adopted the vision of being CO2 -neutral by 2023 for the parent company and included ambitious climate protection targets in the multi-year targets for the whole Coop Group. Measures are also being taken within the ranges (soya, palm oil, wood etc.) that have a major impact on the climate (Scope 3). Our key starting points: – Implementation of the vision of being CO2-neutral by 2023 at the Coop parent company and measures to reduce energy consumption and increase the share of renewable energies throughout the Coop Group, esp. in new and upgraded buildings – Increasing the percentage of LED lighting – Use of natural refrigerants such as CO2 and ammonia – Installation of closed refrigerated units – Use of waste heat from cooling systems – Switzerland: Construction in accordance with the Minergie standard – Low CO2 electricity generation (100.0% hydropower at the parent company and Bell CH) – Use of renewable energies for heating – Promotion of innovative transport systems using renewable energies Degree of target attainment and trend Targets for Retail Targets for Productions Targets for Wholesale 3.1 Coop is significantly reducing its own energy consumption and protecting 3.1.1 R We are reducing energy 3.1.1 P We are reducing energy 3.1.1 W We are reducing specific energy consumption in absolute terms by consumption in absolute terms by consumption per m2 in the cash & carry 8.6% compared with 2012. 2.7% compared with 2015. business by 5.3% in western Europe and and by 1.3% in eastern Europe (compared with 2015). 3.1.2 W In the delivery wholesale business, we are reducing specific energy consumption per tonne of delivered 3.

In 2008, the foundation for sustainable Energy and CO2 future was laid with the energy/CO2-vision. We reached half time now and we can say, up to now Coop reduced its CO2-emissions by more than 25.0% and could save 100 million francs. The slight increase in Wholesale in western Germany is due to the greater accuracy of data gathering compared with previous years. The sharp rise in Production is mainly due to the integration of Hilcona into the Bell Group in 2015.

At times, the old and new locations had to operate in tandem during the changeover phase. In Wholesale, the big expansion in Russia with an increase in floor space of one third since 2012, the integration of Transgourmet Österreich and the acquisition of a number of companies at Transgourmet France were the main reasons for the increased energy requirements. In Production, the consolidation of the Bell Group (including international and Hilcona in 2015) has caused an increase.

Sustainability Progress Report 2016 21 Project 4.1 Waste management and construction Coop is continually increasing its quota of reusable materials by 2020. As well as the sparing use of resources, the reuse of raw materials is one important way to preserve the availability of resources for the long term. In the spirit of a recycling economy, by collecting various reusable material promotions we help extract secondary raw materials, some of which we use ourselves. In its new and upgraded buildings, Coop takes account of sustainability standards which, as well as energy efficiency and climate protection, also embody social aspects (quality of life, variable potential uses etc.) and biodiversity. Our key starting points: – Collection of various reusable material promotions – Sustainable construction Degree of target attainment and trend Targets for Retail Targets for Production Targets for Wholesale 4.1 Coop is reducing and optimizing 4.1.1 R We are increasing the quota 4.1.1 P We are increasing the quota 4.1.1 W We are increasing the 4.

Because of this, the target for 2020 is very ambitious. In Production, the 2016 quota is slightly below 2015, due to acquisitions, which is why the target for 2020 was set below the one already achieved in 2015. Waste management measures have yet to take effect in the new divisions. In Wholesale, waste recycling measures began in Romania, and Transgourmet Switzerland has drawn up an action plan for 2017-2020. You will find more information about waste management here.
