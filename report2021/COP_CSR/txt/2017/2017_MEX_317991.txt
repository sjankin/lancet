One example is the installation of an irrigation system, where we take advantage of water produced by condensation in our refrigeration equipment to water trees in 2,487 OXXO stores. We also equipped 88% of our Distribution Centers (CEDIS) of FEMSA Comercio with basket-washing machines that optimize water consumption, and we intend to continue increasing this percentage in 2017. At OXXO GAS in Mexico, this year we installed more dry urinals in the service station bathrooms.

At FEMSA we also take care of the way the waste FEMSA Comercio works to build awareness about generated by the products we sell is handled, for appropriate waste management. Since 2015, we have example, at Coca-Cola FEMSA we innovate with been carrying out a Comprehensive Store Waste Management Program, through which we improve the disposal of waste generated by various processes in 1,899 stores. Also, all our Distribution Centers have a specific area for the confinement, separation and classification of waste and, in 2016, more than 17.7 metric tons of waste were properly confined. Moreover, we also launched in 2016 the campaign “No bag, thanks” campaign, inviting clients to reduce the use of plastic bags in their purchases at OXXO stores in Mexico. For the equipment produced at Imbera, this past year we developed a project for the Final Disposal of Refrigeration Equipment, which will start in 2017. This project will allow the proper collection of coolers by the end of its life cycle. We invite our clients to join the “No bag, thanks” campaign.

To expand its scope, in 2016 we evolved towards a virtual platform, where the public has access to truthful and dynamic materials and information related to life skills and resilience, as well as the possibility of interaction with experts in these themes. Cultural Programs Art brings us closer to each other and helps us strengthen our ties with the countries where we operate.

This program, which was created in 2007, is implemented in four cities: Barranquilla, Ibagué, Cali and Valledupar. Through this and other initiatives such as Peace and Reconciliation Spaces and the Vive Bailando program, 353 people were supported in 2016. Citizens’ Plaza In Coca-Cola FEMSA Brazil, together with local governments and other companies, we hold events to support and develop local communities close to work centers, offering advice on health, finance, personal and environmental care to more than 12,000 people in the cities of Moeda, Curitiba, Jundiaí, Sumaré and Mogi das Cruzes. In 2015 we developed the Model for Addressing Risks and Relations with the Community (MARRCO) through which we strive for more effective community relations, building with them dialogue, commitment, trust and cooperation, as well as identifying the risks and opportunities of value creation in the communities. The model also contributes to the identification of how we can optimize the actions and programs that are already implemented to maximize their mutual value. The MARRCO program supports the development of capabilities through multi-disciplinary teams in the workplace—plants as well as distribution centers. In 2016, as part of the first phase of this model’s implementation, we set up teams in 23 work centers at Coca-Cola FEMSA, FEMSA Logística, Imbera and PTM in 7 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica.
