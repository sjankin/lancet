Communication on progress (COP) for Scania CV AB From the core values to global management systems and the way Scania conducts its business, Scania is committed to upholding the ten principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact relating to human rights, labour, the environment and anticorruption. We are embedding its 10 principles in our operations, in our supplier and other business relationships and take actions that advance societal goals. This Communication on Progress (COP) is Scania’s annual disclosure to stakeholders about the company’s efforts to implement the principles of the UN Global Compact. Scania joined the UNGC in 2012. Scania has one primary channel to report sustainability information, our integrated Annual and sustainability report. To highlight how central sustainability is to our business, in 2016 The Scania Report, addresses sustainability issues both on strategic and in-depth level. It reflects how sustainability drives and has impact on our business, long-term organisational strategy, risks, and opportunities. Content is written both for business partners, employees and for other engaged stakeholders, CSR specialists and analysts. On some topics the report is complemented with information on our webpage. The report is available at www.scania.com/sustainability. By containing Standard Disclosures from the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Reporting Guidelines, we aim to fulfil the “In accordance – Core” criteria of its 4.0 framework. The report is also aligned with the Volkswagen Group guidelines on sustainability reporting, and is selfdeclared. This year as well you can find our GRI-index with references on how each GRIindicator relates to a UN Global Compact principle: http://www.scania.com/group/en/section/sustainability/gri-index/ .
