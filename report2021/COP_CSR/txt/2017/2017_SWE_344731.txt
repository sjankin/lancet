With our four complementary and cooperating business areas we are well-equipped to take on the market’s opportunities and challenges. Improved profitability and a robust cash flow helped Peab achieve all its financial goals and pre-tax profit of over two billion Swedish krona. Orders increased in all the business areas and totaled SEK 41.4 billion (37.8) for the year while order backlog Orders received in 2016 increased to at the end of December was SEK 33.6 billion (27.0). The improved profit stems mainly SEK 41.4 billion. from business areas Industry and Project Development but the contract operations in Construction and Civil Engineering showed stable results. In Project Development it was particularly positive to see that in Housing Development the operative operating margin continued to develop well and for the entire year of 2016 improved to 8.5 percent (6.5). In business area Industry sales volumes and profit increased in Concrete, Gravel and Rock, Asphalt as well as Rentals.

We also regularly I am convinced that the key to our success lies in the interplay between a number of factors. First and foremost there are the people behind this year’s fine figures – all Peab’s ask our customers how well employees. Their fantastic efforts and goal-oriented work have been a major contriour deliveries live up to their bution to the result this year. I also want to point out our strategic decision to create expectations. Our overall SCI four complementary and cooperative business areas. In addition to comprising our value in 2016 displays a stable value chain and to a certain extent making us self-sufficient, they provide a good result but to reach our goal of balance between more capital intensive business areas and those with lower investment having the most satisfied custneeds. Yet another crucial factor is our decentralized organization based on local omers in the industry we need entrepreneurship that operates close to customers and considers the local market. to work harder.” RUNNING A BUSINESS RESPONSIBLY IS KEY TO CONTINUED SUCCESS AND COMPETITIVENESS Developing a sustainable business is fundamental to Peab and our efforts intensified after signing UN Global Compact in 2012. We have identified crucial sustainable aspects of our business and gathered them into four areas: The Employees, The Business, Climate and Environment and Social Engagement. One of the most prioritized issues at Peab is a safe and healthy working environment based on the premise that everything we do follows the law, regulations and collective ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 3 Comments from the CEO bargaining agreements. We actively promote through clarity, leadership and cooperation attitudes and behavior built on the culture of safety we want in Peab. We combine this with systematic risk management, preventive measures and knowledge exchanges in our efforts to eliminate accidents at Peab’s workplaces. We have a big responsibility to minimize the environmental impact of our operations throughout the value chain. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions, streamlining the use of resources and striving to phase out environmental and health hazardous substances in production are a major part of this work. The Group’s four business areas are dependent on many different suppliers and subcontractors. To ensure Peab’s business is correct and reliable a company line for purchasing in our organization was adopted. We work continually to ensure that in our procurement process we take our responsibility for business ethical, financial, social and environmental aspects. The foundation of our work with diversity and equality means that Peab welcomes everyone and excludes no one. In order to be the best company in the industry we need the most skilled and this requires the broadest recruitment base possible. Through the Peab School we provide high school construction and civil engineering education. In addition, during the year the Peab School has taught students and Peab personnel about equality and diversity. This better enables us to take important steps towards our long-term goal of a Peab that reflects society in general and our customers specifically. GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES CHALLENGED BY CAPACITY SHORTAGES In many ways the circumstances for the construction and civil engineering industry are favorable: strong Swedish economy, population growth and low interest rates combined with an enormous need for new housing for several years ahead. According According to the forecast by the Swedish to the forecast by the Swedish Building and Planning Agency 700,000 new homes Building and Planning Agency 700,000 will be needed until 2025. Add to this all the infrastructure investments and public new homes will be needed until 2025. sector construction. However, despite this positive situation there are signs growth in construction will slow down in the coming years because of a capacity shortage, primarily in human form. This comes as no surprise since the current situation is largely the result of far too little investment in housing construction and infrastructure in the past two decades. HEALTHY COMPETITION ON EQUAL TERMS An efficient construction sector with long-term competence and capacity to meet the needs of society is crucial to growth in the country and to its well-being. With the resource shortage the Swedish construction market is currently facing we need access to both domestic and foreign labor but only if the game rules are unequivocal and apply to everyone active on the Swedish market. Only then will the right conditions exist for healthy competition on equal terms and safe workplaces. Furthermore we have to come together – politicians, labor market partners, authorities, the construction industry – and work harder to match the existing labor force better with what is needed. If the construction industry is going to be part of putting more people to work in Sweden the possibility of creating a more flexible and competitive salary system needs to be looked into. And finally, there has to be a more far reaching perspective on construction in Sweden. Simply by smoothing out the curves between underproduction and overheating we can create long-term conditions for a healthy industry and a supply of the skilled workers so badly needed in the sector. Förslöv in March 2017 WITH THE AMBITION TO BE THE BEST COMPANY IN THE INDUSTRY Peab has a good financial position and we are working in a market with stable conditions. Our work on continuous improvement is producing results and we are clearly on the right road. Totally focused on running a responsible and sustainable business we continue to work on our ambition to be the best company in the industry. We intend to achieve this goal by having the most satisfied customers, the best Jesper Göransson workplace and most profitable company in the industry. President and CEO ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 4 External circumstances and the market Nordic construction and civil engineering market The economy in the Nordic countries Sweden Even if the growth in the Swedish economy halted visibly in 2016 the general situation is still positive and the increase in GDP is in line with the ten-year average. In the last few years growth has primarily been stimulated by national demand, where housing investments as well as private and public consumption have been the strongest driving forces. Record low interest rates, rising home prices and higher employment all boosted household consumption and investments. Current indications show that the interest rate has reached its lowest point and that inflation has slowly started to move upwards. It is reasonable to expect that the growth rate for public consumption will slow down and that the high level of building construction investments will level out. Factors that have the potential to influence the Swedish economy negatively in the coming two years are greater uncertainty about developments in the US and its influence on Swedish exports, a possible backlash on the housing market where interest rate increases and financial austerity might lead to price adjustments and more household savings. Norway Norway’s economy appears to have reached its lowest levels in 2016 after a few years with little growth in the GDP. The decline in investments in the oil sector is expected to continue, entailing only marginal recovery for the economy at large. After a weak development in gross investments in 2015-2016 it is reasonable to expect a positive reaction this year. The recovery will probably be most noticeable in the service and manufacturing sectors. Household consumption was impacted negatively by rising unemployment, small increases in wages and growing inflation. These factors will now probably develop in the opposite direction which might give positive incitement to household consumption. Finland After years of backwards movement the Finnish economy took a few steps towards growth in 2016 and the recession seems to be over. Household consumption is behind the growth. Industrial production increased for the first time in several years. Exports are still weak and the financial recovery will probably stop at growth of about one percent annually in the coming two years. Unemployment will probably continue to decrease at a slow pace. Consumer trust increased noticeably and in the fall of 2016 it was at its highest level in five years. Household consumption will probably drive growth in the coming years due to low interest rates, growing employment and pent up purchasing needs. Investments also profit from the low interest rates and less investment in manufacturing is compensated by more construction.

Therefore we put great effort in ensuring that what we plan and carry out is sustainable. Understanding stakeholders’ demands and needs helps Peab to prioritize correctly in our work on sustainability. Peab’s vision is to be the Nordic Community Builder. Our daily operations contribute to developing communities by planning, constructing and building everything from housing, offices and schools to hospitals, roads and bridges. We can create added value for our stakeholders by running our business with a responsible and long-term perspective. Our role as a large employer with local connections provides us with good insight into local community needs. Our ambition is to convert this knowledge into an active commitment to society with a special focus on giving young people a good future. A TRANSPARENT DIALOGUE WITH STAKEHOLDERS Peab’s definition Peab’s operations influence and are influenced by a great number of stakeholders. A transparent dialogue with them is an important tool in understanding what issues are of sustainable most important for each stakeholder group.

Responsibility and authorization is delegated to the business areas and there is a support system with experts on different levels in the organization. This is complemented by steering and supporting documents. CODE OF CONDUCT, POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS A fundament of Peab’s operations consists in complying with international conventions and national laws. A number of policies then make up the steering documents concerning sustainability. Our code of conduct is based on the UN Global Compact that Peab All aspects of sustainability are integrated signed in 2012, together with Peab’s core values. In 2016 the code of conduct was into our operations, which creates added reviewed and an updated version will be adopted and integrated into operations in 2017. value for Peab’s stakeholders. The code of conduct is complemented by a number of underlying policies and guidelines, such as Peab’s ethical guidelines. The overreaching company policy is an integrated environmental, quality and work environment policy that complies with the quality certification standard ISO 9001:2008, the environmental quality standard ISO 14001:2004 and the requirements in the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s statute AFS 2001:1. For more information about steering the work environment and environmental work please refer to pages 17 and 28 respectively. SUSTAINABILITY WORK ORGANIZATION Peab’s executive management has the overriding responsibility for managing and developing work on sustainability in the business. During the year Peab’s Sustainability Council, chaired by the CEO, has been responsible for coordinating Group sustainability work and creating the prerequisites for integrating sustainability into operations. The Sustainability Council also prepared different matters and presented them to executive management, which is responsible for making the formal decisions. Each business area is responsible for the continuous work with sustainability issues in operations, supported by experts on different levels in the organization. A review of how to handle our strategic sustainability work in the future will be done in 2017. Peab also has an Ethical Council which in part works preventively with education in business ethics and in part prepares and decides in cases when there is a suspicion of irregularities. Please find more information about the Ethical Council on page 24. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 16 The Employees Peab grows through our employees It is crucial for Peab’s competitive capacity, in the long and short term, to attract, recruit, keep and develop employees. Together we build a company characterized by abundant opportunities to develop, diversity, equality, good Sustainability leadership and a safe work environment so that we can offer the best workaspects place in the industry. Health and work environment Skills supply A HEALTHY AND SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT  Equality, diversity and There are a slew of difficult and risky work activities in the construction and civil equal treatment engineering industry which is why Peab prioritizes issues regarding health and a safe work environment. GRI:  LA5, LA6, LA7, LA9, As an employer we are responsible for guaranteeing a safe workplace, and this is a LA11, LA13 pivotal point in our goal to be the best workplace in the industry. By systematically GC: 2–3, 6 working with risk management and preventive measures together with exchanging knowledge and experience we strive for a zero vision concerning accidents at Peab’s work sites. The Group goal is to halve the number of workplace accidents during the period 2015-2017. Accidents and incidents are reported continuously and the goal is evaluated quarterly. LEADERSHIP AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY WORKING TOGETHER A great many work risks can be eliminated through procedures and information, but creating a safe workplace requires clear leadership and everyone taking responsibility to act in a way that considers their own personal safety as well as that of their colleagues. Clarity, leadership and cooperation are important factors in developing attitudes and behavior that creates the safety culture we want to have in Peab. Other tools we use to create a healthy and safe work environment is our collaboration with union representatives and recurring workplace revisions in all three countries. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 17 The Employees FOCUS WEEK AND REFLECTION DAY INSPIRE ENGAGEMENT One of the initiatives taken in 2016 was the recurring focus week when everyone in Peab management visits workplaces to talk to employees and gain an understanding of the challenges and good ideas for solutions found there. During the focus week in 2016 there were a total of 1,277 activities in Sweden, Norway and Finland, of which Goal about half (615) were workplace visits. Discussion meetings (662) that included regarding workeveryone working on the sites were held at workplaces not visited.

Employees and subcontractors pause production to get together and consider what each person can do to make the workplace safe and reach the goal of halving the number of accidents in Peab. Steering activities for the work environment Peab’s work environment policy is integrated into the company policy and is the basis for our strategic work environment measures which are included in the business management system. Peab follows the laws and regulations of each country. The requirements set out in AFS 2001:1 are observed in Sweden and in Norway Peab works according to the Work Environment Act and follows valid regulations for the construction and civil engineering industries. Finnish operations are certified according to OHSAS 18001. Work environment issues are part of daily operations. Strategic work is done on the Group and business area levels and relevant competence in work environment matters can be found on every level of the company. Assignments and mandates have been delegated throughout the organization. In addition to the 141 (78) employees who work with the work environment in the Group, Peab employees are also represented by safety representatives (elected by the employees). There are 712 (713) safety representatives in Sweden, 85 (97) in Norway and 40 (35) in Finland. Peab also has 79 (61) work environment administrators (HAMare), a union assignment. Together the three groups that handle the work environment make up 7.8 (7.4) percent of all employees in Peab. An employer Peab’s crisis organization is activated in the event of a serious accident.

ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 19 The Employees GOALS AND INITIATIVES FOR GREATER EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY We are convinced that everyone benefits from a construction and civil engineering industry with employees that mirror the society at large more than they do today. Working with attitudes and behavior is crucial to making changes. We really need to get rid of the industry’s reputation of having a macho culture and we have to start with our own company. Peab’s goal is to be a role model in the industry in ten years’ time with concrete examples and visible results regarding work on equality and diversity. We want to create a labor force characterized by diversity by going on the offensive for change. To achieve this we will take a number of concrete measures in the coming years:  All employees will receive training in equality, diversity and equal treatment. In 2016 about 3,000 employees participated in workshops where groups of mixed professions had a profound discussion about Peab’s fundamental values, diversity, equality and ethics finishing with an agreement on everyone’s shared responsibility for contributing to the desired culture.

At Peab the nature, performance and skills level of an employee’s job decide their pay level, independent of gender, age or ethnic background. In accordance to Swedish law a wage review is conducted every year containing an analysis of wages paid to women and men. The purpose of this analysis is to identify, rectify and prevent subjective differences in pay and other terms of employment for the same or equivalent positions. Subjective differences are rectified. In the review that Peab conducted in 2015 a total of 28 subjective pay differences were identified. The wages of these individuals have been adjusted afterwards. The next review will take place in 2017. Legislation in Norway and Finland have similar requirements for an analysis of wages and ensuing measures. Number of employees per country and gender The chart shows the number of employees annually per 31 December. By the end of 2016 Peab had 13,869 (13,300) employees, of which 12.1 (11.9)% were women.

Attitude changing workshops Local initiatives have been inspired by the dialogue in the Group about common values, diversity and equality. For instance, Peab in Örebro started workshops discussing desirable attitudes on the workplace. One of the enthusiasts behind the initiative, assistant construction manager Magnus Nilsson, says starting the workshops is just common sense and wanting to take responsibility for creating an inclusive culture that welcomes everyone. Working with these important issues can also contribute to strengthening relations with the community. “We hope to inspire others too, both in Peab and in the construction industry at large. By working with the attitudes in the construction industry and creating better contacts between businesses and immigrants maybe some of them will go into the construction program. Individuals, companies and society all benefit from this,” says Magnus Nilsson. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 22 The Business Reliable business is the foundation of our success Peab is a reliable and competent partner with a strong local presence that continuously delivers quality and makes the customer’s interest our own.

GRI:  SO4, SO5, SO7, PR5 GC: 1-7, 10 Peab performs annual SCI (Satisfied Customer Index) surveys with external and internal company customers and private housing customers. The three areas valued most highly by our customers are that we are a safe and reliable partner, have a structured and transparent work method and the right skills in the right place. The results from the SCI surveys are included in the operative business plans that 73 support the Group strategy; to strengthen and develop Peab’s customer relations. In 2016 the total SCI result for the Peab Group was 73 (73) on a scale 1–100. The Group’s goal is a combined SCI result of at least 75 by the end of 2017. The number of respondents in 2016 amounted to over 2,200 (2,000). This represents an average response rate of 40 (42) percent which can be compared to the industry In 2016 the total SCI result for the Peab Group average of between 25 to 30 percent. was 73 (73) on a scale 1–100. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 23 The Business PARTNERING – A DYNAMIC AND EFFICIENT WAY TO COLLABORATE Partnering as a collaboration form is growing in the construction and civil engineering industry since it has proven to lead to better results from a comprehensive customer perspective. Partnering is, as the name suggests, a partnership in which the general contractor and the customer, together with architects, consultants and other key players, organize and take responsibility for the construction process. It’s particularly suitable for complex construction and civil engineering projects where creative and solution-oriented cooperation between key players leads to the best project results. PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SUPPORTS COMMUNITY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Requirements concerning the social engagement of businesses have become common in public procurements in recent years. This means that as the procured partner we are expected to, for example, bring youths, immigrants or people who have different kinds of disabilities into the work connected to the procured project. This development is completely in line with Peab’s commitment to improve life in the community along with our engagement to improve integration and create job opportunities for youths. PEAB’S RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN Peab’s business concept is based on quality in every aspect of the construction process. The Group’s four business areas are the fundamental links in the chain, and are in turn dependent on a large number of suppliers and subcontractors. Purchases in Peab make up more than 70 percent of turnover and involve approximatly 41,000 suppliers annually. Peab considers a business partner a supplier if Peab has received at least one invoice from a unique VAT number during a year. In order to fulfill our ambition of going from largest to best our procurement process Supplier base has to make correct and secure deals that take into consideration business ethics and finances as well as environmental and social factors. INTENSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF RELIABLE BUSINESS Based on a thorough analysis of the present situation and an extensive dialogue within the organization, in 2016 Peab arrived at a common consensus concerning purchasing procedures in Peab. Focus is on ensuring the business we do is safe and reliable, and that our purchasing organization has the know-how to support and develop these procedures. Reliable business means that we work with the right 7,500 SUPPLIERS REPRESENT 95 suppliers in the right way in order to handle risks and prevent irregularities.

The three ations, which means that they are handled by the local project organization. There is a largest categories are civil engineering central purchasing organization that reinforces project purchases and supports the transportation, electrical as well as water project organization. Within the central purchasing organization we are developing and sewage contracts. a category-based work method which means we are organizing the function based on the products and services that they are specialized in buying. Steering through categories increases risk awareness and the opportunity to be more effective in each purchasing area. Coordinating this centrally then makes it easier to take advantages of Peab’s size. CLEAR-CUT DEMANDS AND EXPECTATIONS All agreements Peab signs with suppliers state the rules and demands that apply in part for the particular project and when doing business with Peab in general. Our code of conduct is enclosed in all agreements and, as of 2016, there is an ethics clause in the contracts detailing expectations on suppliers and the consequences if they do not live up to the code of conduct, labor law demands and workplace safety regulations. CONCRETE MEASURES FOR FOLLOW-UP AND RELIABLE BUSINESS A summary of the follow-up measures taken so far:  Quarterly supplier base controls resulting in approval or rejection. 17 suppliers were listed for rejection in 2016 and disapproval as suppliers to Peab; nine because of irregularity risks and eight due to commercial risks. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 24 The Business Everything in order In 2016 we increased control of our subcontractors and suppliers as part of our continuous improvement work. As a result more and more subcontractors and suppliers follow the industry demands laid down in UE 2015. This entails a responsibility to ensure that all subcontractors have collective bargaining agreements, F tax certificates and do not have wage or other compensation disputes with employees. The main purpose is to get rid of dishonest companies, gain control over the contractor chain and ensure safe workplaces. This is completely in line with Peab’s ambition to strive towards a healthy construction industry that promotes good business ethics, quality and a good work environment.  Semi-annual checks concerning work environment, labor law and purchasing issues at all of Peab’s workplaces.  Competence development in the purchasing organization to ensure good insight in the demands suppliers need to comply with.  Based on risks connected to our code of conduct and reliable business we have during the year initiated targeted measures and follow-up of supplier markets and suppliers.

In 2015 we started using a completely fossil-free diesel, HVO 100. The availability of this fuel is limited and we increase the use as possible. Peab’s ECO-Asfalt®, manufactured based on carbon dioxide neutral bio-oil (please see more on page 31), represented 59 percent of Peab’s total asphalt manufacturing in Sweden at the end of 2016. Bio-oil is now used at 8 of the 21 asphalt plants in Sweden and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 19,600 (6,700) tons annually, compared to the use of traditional fuel oil. Reducing the laying temperature of the asphalt by around 30 degrees cuts energy consumption by an estimated 20 percent and carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent. In 2016 lower temperature asphalt represented 4.4 (1.9) percent of Peab’s total asphalt laid in Sweden and Norway. CHARTING OUR ENERGY CONSUMPTION In accordance with an EU directive Peab started charting energy consumption in 2016. We began with the largest companies in business area Industry, Peab Asfalt and Swerock, representing about 50 percent of the total energy consumption. We continue to chart energy use in the rest of Peab’s operations and will finish by 2020. EFFICIENT USE OF MATERIAL Construction and civil engineering operations generate large amounts of waste material. Peab aims to have the most material-efficient production possible in all our operations, in part by creating less waste material and in part by taking care of and recycling as much as possible. Material efficient work methods also contribute to reducing carbon dioxide emissions since both manufacturing and waste management of material requires energy. Waste material in one place can very well be raw material in another. It is therefore crucial to cooperate with other players in the value chain and the industry to create circular flows and more efficient use of materials. It is also essential to create a Examples of shared perspective on responsibility and ethical handling of waste material in the recycling and industry. In order to lessen the risk that some part in the value chain does not fulfill its responsibility, explicit demands should be integrated into business agreements use of resources in combination with continuous onsite controls and follow-up.

ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 28 Climate and Environment Peab’s ECO-Asfalt – a better choice for the environment Bio-oil is used to dry and heat the gravel material in the manufacture of ECO-Asphalt, which is the part of the process requiring the most energy. The bio-oil is made from vegetable waste material from food production and is classified as carbon dioxide neutral by the Swedish Energy Agency. The variant ECO-Asfalt plus additionally reduces the temperature of the asphalt by up to 30°C. This achieves a number of sustainable values, such as lower energy consumption and a better working environment since it reduces the amount of smoke gasses and particles. Another environmental gain is that more recycled asphalt is used in the asphalt produced. Landfill material is a prioritized area in civil engineering operations. Excess material is classed, depending on how it can be handled, as either waste or a resource. In 2016 Peab developed a method for managing the masses created, received or taken from a site. It helps Peab reduce spreading unwanted substances while increasing the possibility of recycling and re-use of masses. RE-USE AND RECYCLING AS A BUSINESS CONCEPT The Recycling segment of Peab’s subsidiary Swerock AB currently has around 20 facilities in Sweden. They work mainly with managing excess material from construction and civil engineering operations, doing everything from handling contaminated Steering environmasses to using them in construction for civil engineering purposes. Recycling also handles other construction and demolition waste, provides equipment for water mental work purification and manages a construction logistics center together with other players Environmental work takes place on in the Peab Group. Recycling’s business concept can be summed up in: “We contribute all levels and is an integrated part to sustainable construction by preventing the generation of waste as well as through of Peab.

This is now being followed up by risk assessments and phase outs of dangerous chemical products. Materials used in construction operations are being registered in Byggvarubedömningen to identify products and materials that contain environmental and health hazardous substances. This allows us to identify where, and to what extent, products and materials that contain environmental and health hazardous substances are used.

Peab’s commitment to the Mentorship education of youths and our need for know-how in the future has been the basis for our independent upper secondary school, the Peab School. The founding idea of Sustainable sponsorship the school has been to create a high quality, modern upper secondary construction program with equal focus on creating a secure, aware citizen as on creating a skilled and employable worker. This is also stated in the school’s goal: Best School – Best Journey. The Peab School is a safe place and offers a good study and work environment for everyone there. We work actively with establishing values in daily school life and together preventing any form of discrimination or abusive conduct. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 33 Social Engagement Each year there are about 430 students in the construction and civil engineering program at the five Peab Schools in Ängelholm, Malmö, Gothenburg, Solna and Upplands Väsby. Some initiatives at the Peab Schools in 2016: Language introduction for 100 immigrant youths at the Peab School in Gothenburg As a part of the project for more diversity and tolerance the students in the Peab School in Ängelholm took a study trip to the extermination camp Auschwitz Work with restoring buildings on the Utøya Island continued. For us this is an unmistakable stand for freedom of speech and democracy with the added advantage of allowing our students to practice their skills by building for Utøya’s future Future plans for the Peab School include broadening the curriculum to contain, besides There are around 430 students annually in the construction and civil engineering program, programs for adult education and the construction and civil engineering program at the five Peab Schools located in courses that leads to better integration. Ängelholm, Malmö, Gothenburg, Solna and Upplands Väsby. In 2016 Peab was one of the main sponsors for EuroSkills held at the Swedish Exhibition & Congress Centre in Gothenburg. During three days about 500 young professionals from 28 countries competed in different professions. Over 65,000 people visited EuroSkills and employees that used to be students at the Peab School were there to inspire the next generation. INTERNSHIP AND MASTER THESES – FIRST STEP TO A JOB In order to make better use of the knowledge and experience of immigrants Peab signed a document of intention with the Swedish Public Employment Service. The ambition is to offer 100 immigrants internships during 2016-2018. The intention of the so-called 100 Club is to create a long-term and strategic collaboration to help immigrants get their bearings in Sweden. At the end of 2016 31 people had been offered employment or internship in Peab through the 100 Club. Peab also accepts interns from industry-related programs as well as practicing professionals, and each year there are students at the university level who do their master thesis at Peab. The Peab School trains young immigrants Preparations already began in the spring of 2016 for the Peab School in Gothenburg to open its doors at the end of the summer to a language introduction course for 100 young immigrants. The aim of the course is to prepare students for regular Swedish upper secondary school classes as well as teach them about Swedish society in order to facilitate their integration. A prerequisite for high quality in the program is having the right competence on hand through experienced, trained teachers aided by interpreters and other important support functions. Summing up impressions from the first term we find that the students are highly motivated in their studies and have a strong desire to be successful in Sweden. They have many and varied dreams about their futures and over half of the students are interested in continuing in construction. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 34 Social Engagement LOCAL COMMUNITY BUILDING PROJECTS IMPORTANT IN EVERYDAY LIFE Peab is a big employer with strong local roots. Whatever Peab constructs affects the labor market and people’s everyday lives in both big and small towns giving us the responsibility and the opportunity to contribute to the development of local societies. Norwegian Utøya is a good illustration of how Peab takes responsibility for the community, in this case by building up long-term partnerships that both the Peab School and the Norwegian Labor Party Youth League (AUF) learn from and where “The feeling you get when both parties are winners. you see all the committed and diligent students in the Intending to further strengthen our position Peab will in cooperation with the Peab language introduction, so School and an external player carry out at least one local community building project filled with positive thoughts annually.

In 2016, 26 employees in Peab were mentors in some form. This collaboration provides, in addition to personal mentorship, professional guidance for high school students through the concept Job Mentor as well as seminars in parenting for our employees. Another form of mentorship is the way so many of Peab’s employees are involved in supervising young people just beginning in the industry. The Peab School has founded a supervisor training course (approved by the National Agency for Education) aimed at strengthening the supervisors’ competence in, for instance, Peab’s core values, the work environment for minors, youth psychology, learning, motivation, conflict management and value systems. There are now about 1,000 trained supervisors among Peab’s employees. SUSTAINABLE SPONSORSHIP WITH A SOFT SPOT FOR YOUTHS For many years Peab has been hugely involved in sponsoring, often on a local level. Peab’s ten-year collaboration with the In 2016 Peab’s sponsoring policy was revised in order to clarify our commitment to Mentor Foundation has contributed to our young people, innovation and diversity. The common denominator for all our sponsorbelief in the importance of good role ship is that it support our vision, our business plan and our sustainability goals.

The organization is formed around a central Group sponsorship council that meets once a month to decide on sponsorship requests and the return expected from the applicant. In 2016 we increased our sponsorship to sports for the young by 100 percent and social community building projects by 130 percent. Our goal for 2017 is just as ambitious. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 35 Social Engagement We will replace traditional sponsorship with modern, commitment-based sponsoring that has tangible results for the community. We engage ourselves in activities that create new engagement. A VOICE IN THE PUBLIC DEBATE It is our responsibility as community builders to be a voice in the public debate. The primary issues we get involved in concern the young and the skills supply along with greater diversity and equality in the industry, which are all important areas to ensuring a long lasting and efficient construction sector that can meet the needs of the market. Another vital factor that can contribute to this is access to foreign construction companies and foreign workers. When Ylva Johansson, Minister for Employment, presented the In 2016 we increased our sponsorship to government’s new regulations for workers posted in Sweden to the media in February sports for the young by 100 percent and social community building projects by 130 percent. 2017, she did it at one of Peab’s housing construction sites in Ulriksdal, Solna. Peab’s President and CEO Jesper Göransson, who participated in the meeting, welcomed both foreign construction companies and workers to Sweden but expressed the importance of unequivocal game rules that pertain to all the players active on the Swedish market. This makes a healthy, orderly industry possible.

MSEK 15,000 Broader environmental responsibility in Transportation and Machines 12,000 Recycling is a relatively new unit in product area Transportation and Machines and 9,000 with it business area Industry takes greater responsibility for the environment. This is partly achieved through taking care of soil masses as well as by sorting and 6,000 recycling demolition material and partly through establishing facilities close to 3,000 construction and civil engineering projects which reduces CO2 emissions by cutting down on transportation. Recycling also paves the way for new business 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 opportunities in other segments. Developing Recycling enables Peab to offer comprehensive solutions for construction and civil engineering projects. Per product area, 2016 After the changes made in Transportation and Machines the product area developed positively in 2016. Phasing out unprofitable operations and developing profitable ones has given Transportation and Machines a good platform for the future.

The consequences of all this is a huge demand for new housing and a continued positive market. The greatest challenges Peab faces are the labor shortage in the industry, particularly in large cities, cost increases, especially in subcontractors and higher land prices. 2016 was a strong year for Peab and production starts in Sweden accelerated. Business was characterized by high completion of planned projects. More than 2,600 of our own developed homes went into production in Sweden, Norway and Finland, creating homes for over 7,500 people. Peab has a good development rights portfolio and in 2016 it intensified its efforts in business development and personnel recruiting in order to acquire and develop new development rights for future homes.

Here Peab is creating 16% (14%) a vibrant city area characterized by diversity, creativity and proximity to Gothenburg’s 4% (5%) city center. The houses will comply with the Swan environmental standard. The first 67 apartments were sold in the spring of 2016. Another example of how an industrial 80% (81%) area can be transformed into a residential city district is Kvarnholmen in Nacka in the Stockholm area. By 2025 a total of 3,000 apartments will be built. In April 2016 Peab put 47 apartments in Kvarnholmen up for sale. Another example is Vallastaden in Linköping where Peab is one of the contributors to developing a new visionary Sweden Norway part of the city. Peab is building 136 of the 900 apartments being constructed by a Finland large number of developers. The area will contain a wealth of forms of housing such as rentals, tenant owner and ownership apartments. Since Peab is located all over Sweden it has a strong market position. In order to meet the growing demand a new region was added in Uppsala in 2016 and in January 2017 Housing Development strengthened its presence in southeast Sweden with a new region. Operations in Norway and Finland In 2016 housing prices rose by 8.3 percent, much more than expected, on the Norwegian market (source: Boligprodusentene). Prices are expected to continue to rise in 2017. Price increases on Peab’s largest markets, Oslo and Tromsø, were 23.2 respective 7.5 percent in 2016. Peab is a relatively small player on the Norwegian market, but during 2016 it acquired development rights in order to initiate a number of housing projects in the coming years. In 2016 three significant development projects were acquired in Oslo: Hans Haslumsvei (planned sales start in 2019), Trondheimsveien 113 (sales start 2017), and Skårer/Lørenskog (sales start 2018). In 2016 Peab started the partly owned project Himmel & Hav in Tromsø with 300 apartments. This is Peab’s largest own development project in northern Norway ever. Sales volumes of new housing grew by some 25 percent on the Finnish market and there were about 34,000 new apartment start-ups. Helsinki and Tampere represent about 55 percent of new construction in Finland (Source: Statistikcentralen). These cities are also Peab’s growth areas. The number of Peab’s sold homes on the Finnish market increased in 2016. Three important sales starts in 2016 were Kronobergs in The industrial area Kvarnholmen in Nacka in the Stockholm region is being transformed into Helsinki, Teku in Oulu and Korkeavuori in Turku.

Peab put future development business. 47 apartments in Kvarnholmen on the market in April 2016. Property Development The market for offices in the areas around the largest Swedish cities was strong in 2016 along with the real estate market. Positive development is expected to continue in the rental market as well as stable development of housing prices. As a property developer Peab has broad range of expertise in enriching and developing areas and land for commercial space or uses such as offices, malls, hotels, industries and sports facilities. Peab’s main ambition is to develop projects based on our own development rights in our own balance sheet. Cooperation with other partners in joint ventures may occur during a project. The aim is to create capital efficient development in cooperation with partners that strengthen our business and profitability. Two larger property deals were sealed in 2016. One was establishing a joint venture together with the Malmö-based real estate company Volito in order to build the largest office building in Hyllie as well as own and manage the hotel property Värdshuset 5 at Hyllie Station Square.

The Annual Report and the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view of the parent company as well as of the Group’s position and result.

The consolidated income statement and balance sheet and the parent company’s income statement and balance sheet will be presented for adoption by the AGM on May 10, 2017. Our Auditor’s report was submitted on March 31, 2017 KPMG AB Dan Kjellqvist Authorized Public Accountant ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 110 Auditor’s report Auditor’s report To the general meeting of the shareholders of Peab AB (publ.), corp. id 556061-4330 REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS Opinions We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of Peab AB (publ.) for the year 2016, except for the corporate governance report on pages 114-117. The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 36-109 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2016 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2016 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance report on pages 114-117. The Board of Directors´ report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue recognition for construction projects See notes 2 and 26 and accounting principles on page 68 in the annual account and consolidated accounts for detailed information and description of the matter.

We have assessed loss-making contracts and evaluated whether the reserves reflect the risks in projects, and challenged management’s assessments of these risks. We have also evaluated reports from the Group’s own and externally engaged legal experts concerning disputes and assessed whether and how these were taken into consideration in project forecasts. ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 111 Auditor’s report Valuation of project and development properties See notes 2 and 22 and accounting principles on pages 70 – 71 in the annual account and consolidated accounts for detailed information and description of the matter. Description of key audit matter Response in the audit Project and development properties amount to SEK 7,007 million The Group assesses the net realisable value of the project and (6,742) per the balance sheet date.

Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-35 respectively 114-128. The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of Peab AB (publ.) for the year 2016 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for Opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.

ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2016 113 Auditor’s report Auditor’s responsibility Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, any member of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or Officer in any material respect: loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. • has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or • in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. The examination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts. Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materiality. This means that we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material for the operations and where deviations and violations would have particular importance for the company’s situation. We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge from liability. As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. The auditor’s examination of the corporate governance report The Board of Directors is responsible for that the corporate governance report on pages 114-117 has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. Our examination of the corporate governance report is conducted in accordance with FAR´s auditing standard RevU 16 The auditor´s examination of the corporate governance report.

Auditor’s statement on the corporate governance report to the Annual General Meeting of Peab AB (publ) company id nr. 556061-4330 The Board of Directors are responsible for the corporate governance report 2016 on pages 114-117 and that it has been prepared according to the Annual Accounts Act. We have read the corporate governance report and based on this reading and our knowledge of the company and the Group we believe we have sufficient grounds for our statement. This means that our statutory review of the corporate governance report has a different focus and a much more narrow scope than compared to the focus and scope of an audit according to the International Standards on Auditing and the professional code for auditors in Sweden. In our opinion a corporate governance report has been prepared, and its legal contents agree with the annual accounts and Group accounts.
