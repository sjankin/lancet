Market expectations Market trends Reduction of fuel consumption To understand the significant market trends, Faurecia consults This target is linked to the reduction of greenhouse gases. In 2013, specialized bodies and also participates in think tanks to the European Commission adopted average CO2 targets of 95 g/ translate these trends into principles that can be used directly km (equivalent to approximately 4 l/100 km) for the automotive for its products. The main trends that impact automobiles are industry in Europe, effective from the end of 2020, with a planned the urbanization of populations, the reduction in the consumption level of 130 g between 2015 and 2020. This 95 g target is leading and the diversification of energy resources, changes in mobility, automakers to work to improve parameters such as vehicle connectivity, consumer protection and health and the increased weight, efficiency of powertrains (engines and transmissions), role of women in society. Faurecia takes these “mega” trends into electrification, rolling resistance and aerodynamics. Faurecia account; most of the time they are translated into the automobile makes a major contribution in the fields of vehicle weight industry through the reduction in consumption and emissions, reduction and optimizing powertrain operation, mainly through including electrification, connectivity and autonomous vehicles. energy recovery. Currently the European Commission is discussing a level of between 68 g and 78 g per kilometer by 2025/2030 and significant technological developments would be required to achieve this performance level. 76 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 Research and development Market expectations 7 Starting September 2017, a new test protocol called the WLTP 80% of pollution emission. Thanks in particular to the expertise (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedures) will gained through its partnership with Cummins, Faurecia has gradually replace the existing NEDC (New European Driving developed solutions dedicated to these specific markets. The Cycle). The new protocol is more representative of actual proprietary technology for reducing nitrogen oxides in the driving conditions but will impact the test results by between gaseous phase (Ammonia Storage and Delivery System – ASDS) 5% and 15%. Alongside this, the anticipated reduction from the combined with the existing expertise in particulate capture can production of diesel vehicles will impact the average emission already meet the increasingly demanding global emission figures because diesel emits between 10% and 15% less CO2. standards.

As regards the Chinese regulations, they will remain based on the European One of the major automotive trends is the automation of driving, ones until 2023. which may extend to the complete autonomy of the vehicle. It Increasingly widespread in gasoline engines, direct fuel injection represents a defining challenge for the automotive industry, allows the engine to work leanly and to limit consumption, but because it will ultimately decide the driving mode, automated generates particulates that may require treatment in the exhaust or not, based on the constraints of the road and the will of the system. Since 2014, Faurecia has supplied the world’s first driver. Automation will also result in improved passenger safety, particulate filters for gasoline engines as standard equipment. thanks to numerous on-board sensors and algorithms. It will make traffic more fluid by taking into account and anticipating For Diesel engines, regulatory change combined with high traffic realities (traffic intensity, traffic lights, etc.) and allow temperatures generating nitrogen oxides will result in the passengers to make better use of the time spent in the vehicle widespread adoption of post-treatment in the exhaust system (work, communicate, relax, study, etc.). This move towards for such emissions by 2017 in most markets. automation began with the integration of driving support tools Through their high cylinder capacity and their intensive use, the such as line-crossing alerts and obstacle detection radars. It is engines of commercial and public works vehicles (Off-Road) are now gaining momentum with, as a first step, delegated driving, major sources of pollution emission. Thus, in China, although meaning the vehicle can drive autonomously in particular they only represent 5% of total vehicles, they are responsible for conditions and on protected roads, while requiring the possibility Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 77 7 Research and development Research and innovation of rapid vehicle command recovery (approximately ten seconds), driving options, new vehicles will be created such as Robot Taxis. as of 2020. As a second step, the automation process will reach The automation of driving opens up considerable prospects for more advanced levels as of 2025, with vehicles capable of more reconfiguration of vehicle interiors, by integrating new use cases autonomous driving requiring them to control and adapt their as previously described. It will make it possible to offer new and behavior to the environment, road and conditions. In the third differentiated experiences for passengers, by physically adapting and last step of the process, there will be fully autonomous the vehicle interior and adding predictive functions capable of vehicles under all conditions of use as of 2030.

The target reduction is of the order new materials and manufacturing processes and its expertise in of 40%. optimizing product/process design, has made weight reduction a priority, as shown by a product range of the highest standard. Many other advanced studies are underway with other automakers throughout the world, demonstrating the relevance The multi-criteria approach allows to combine the effects of a of Faurecia’s proposals in this field. systems approach to product design with the development of new shaping or assembly technologies. Furthermore, Faurecia initiated the launch in France of an economic carbon fiber project, known as FORCE, which will This has resulted in weight reductions in the order of 20% to 30% ultimately make it possible to offer carbon composite parts in new products currently being developed. This corresponds for mass-produced vehicles. The project, which involves a to gains of approximately 60 kg out of the 200 kg represented consortium of 13 partners, is currently in its second phase and by Faurecia products. Some of the following products and will result in a laboratory pilot line that can produce several kilos processes were introduced in 2012.

On a more general note, Faurecia has the full range of Finally, Faurecia Interiors is working on intelligent surfaces technologies used to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides which include electronics and plastic technologies to optimize and particulates for diesel engines, regardless of the vehicle the packaging of the instrument panels, center consoles and (passenger and/or commercial), it being understood that door panels. the specifications of these technologies are defined by the automakers, who are also responsible for carrying out the tests. The underlying principles of these technologies are of two types: Energy recovery c recycling of gases through the low-pressure loop. The Faurecia develops technologies for the recycling of thermal gases burned are reinjected into the cylinders to lower energy available in exhaust systems to be recycled, either the combustion temperature and oxygen content in the directly, in order to heat the cabin or heat up the powertrain combustion chamber. This loop, known as the EGR (Exhaust or transmission faster, or indirectly, by converting the heat Gas Recirculation), requires an electric valve that opens into electricity to power the accessories and potentially hybrid on demand. Faurecia has developed its own valve to meet powertrains or into mechanical energy to move the vehicle. growing market demand; The direct application (known as thermal recycling) resulted c direct treatment of gas through Selective Catalytic Reduction in the launch of two new products in 2012: Generation 2 of (SCR). Using this process, Faurecia has developed a system the underfloor Exhaust Heat Recovery System (EHRS), more for mixing gases using either a liquid catalyst known as compact than Generation 1, and the Exhaust Heat Recovery AdBlue® or gaseous ammonia directly. Faurecia is developing Manifold (EHRM) which has been fitted in particular to the its own gaseous catalytic system to reduce emissions of latest version of the Ford Fusion. These products, applied to nitrogen oxides. The Ammonia Storage and Delivery System conventional and hybrid vehicles, reduce CO2 consumption by 2 (ASDS) process stores ammonia in a compact gaseous to 8 g/km of carbon dioxide on the EU test cycle. Both products form, delivering an improved performance compared with are present in the new Hyundai Ioniq hybrid launched in 2016. a traditional liquid-form storage system, in particular at low temperature. This system is now in production for trucks and For the indirect application with conversion of thermal energy buses. into electric power, two technologies have been considered: thermoelectricity, which uses a semiconducting material Faurecia also develops a system that incorporates an oxidation crossed by a heat flow to generate electricity, and the generation catalyst, a gas mixer with a liquid or gas catalyst (BlueBox), and of mechanical energy from the “Rankine” cycle, which uses particulate filters. It moves all of these components closer to the vaporized fluid to power a turbine. This mechanical energy is engine, thus substantially increasing the system’s temperature then converted by the turbine into electricity. This generates and efficiency, in particular under conditions of urban traffic, about 1 to 2 kW of power which reduces CO2 emissions by 4 and to make size and therefore weight gains. This technology to 10 g/km. enables, in combination with the engine architecture, the auxiliary systems defined by the automaker and the engine For trucks using the “Rankine” system, the mechanical energy calibration (not controlled by Faurecia) to eliminate 95% of generated will be directly converted to mechanical energy in the nitrogen oxides when using AdBlue® and up 99% when using engine crankshaft, thereby creating a power boost of around 10 ASDS and to comply with the 2017 Euro 6.c standard as well as to 15 kW and reducing CO2 emissions by about 45 g/km. the 2020 Euro 6.d standard. EGR and SCR technologies are increasingly being used for passenger and utility vehicles (less than five metric tons) in Air quality Europe and North America. The most stringent regulations 2015 saw the introduction of a statutory European real driving make particulate filters and SCR or EGR systems mandatory emissions test to measure nitrogen oxide emissions. Mentioned for commercial vehicles. Faurecia is on track to conquer these in Section 7.1 the test, known as the RDE (Real Driving Emissions) markets. In addition, some applications require innovations test, will stipulate a compliance factor between real driving tests such as the Thermal Regenerator™. These NOx treatment and bench tests. As of September 2017, this compliance factor technologies have already been incorporated into Faurecia’s will be 2.1. It will be reduced to 1.5 as of 2020. To achieve the product offering, and are already included in several models that requisite performances levels (80 mg of NOx per kilometer), all are looking ahead to the Euro 6 standard or similar regulations. 80 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 Research and development Research and innovation 7 Furthermore, in 2014, Faurecia supplied the world’s first structures for the new Alfa Romeo Giulia, received the 2014 particulate filters for gasoline direct injection engines.

Faurecia includes recyclability and the use of recycled materials Inclusion of recycled materials in its environmental approach. This includes anticipation of the end-of-life phase and optimization of production waste recovery. Faurecia offers an increasing number of recycled plastic parts. Within Faurecia Seating, depending on the type and category of Recyclability vehicle, various components are now partly made of recycled European Directive 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000 on endpolypropylene. Taking all these components together, recycled of-life vehicles stipulates inter alia that vehicles will have to be plastics can now account for 15-20% of the materials comprising 95% recoverable by weight, of which 85% will have to be actually the seats manufactured by Faurecia. reusable or recyclable, by January 1, 2015.

These to a process of forecasting and recovering future end-of-life materials are then compression formed to obtain structural products. Selective trials overseen by Faurecia comprise the first parts that meet the mechanical specifications required by phase of a comprehensive approach by the automotive sector in automakers. partnership with industrial firms, academia and auto “clusters”, Life cycle analysis studies show that the use of recycled materials to forecasting volumes of materials available for recycling in can reduce the environmental impact of manufactured products. the future. Faurecia, like its automaker customers, has considerably Faurecia Interiors, after performing tests on the recycling and extended its panel of suppliers of recycled materials. This recovery of complex products via disassembly, has begun allows us today to offer increasingly technical applications with similar operations after shredding vehicles. Industrial-scale increasingly wide material grades. recyclability studies and tests have been undertaken with certain car-shredding plants, both on existing products and CONTROLLING THE USE OF CHEMICALS: THE REACH materials being developed, including agro-composites.

In some cases, such as catalyst protectors in exhaust cycles at the design stage. Faurecia also uses life cycle analysis systems (ceramic fibers), Faurecia has defined an internal procedure that is more stringent than REACH. Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 87 8 Faurecia and sustainable development Faurecia and the environment Faurecia also takes part in work carried out alongside LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS automakers and various industry federations or associations Faurecia increasingly uses life cycle analysis (LCA) as an in order to anticipate possible restrictions on the use of engineering tool at various levels to steer its strategic decisions substances in the coming years and coordinate efforts to and those of automakers: on its products, on the entire vehicle propose alternatives where necessary. The federations and (from the extraction of materials to delivery to automakers) associations involved include the French Vehicle Equipment and on the entire vehicle life cycle (including customer use and Industries Alliance (FIEV), the French Automotive Industry recycling). Cluster (PFA), the German Automotive Industry Association (VDA), and the European Association of Automotive Suppliers Framed by international standards ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, this (CLEPA). Faurecia leads the task force on REACH as well as the methodology consists of assessing the environmental impact one formed to address issues raised by the Global Automotive of products designed and manufactured by Faurecia for use in Declarable Substance List (GADSL). automobiles. It involves the fullest possible impact assessment, including climate change (including CO2), the consumption of MANAGING CONSUMPTION OF MATERIALS non-renewable resources (oil and coal) and eutrophication. One of the important aspects in reducing the environmental LCA allows both Faurecia and automakers to: footprint is managing the consumption of materials, through c make the right design choices for current vehicles (with the optimization of product design and the optimization of gasoline or Diesel internal combustion engines) and for materials used during the parts industrialization phases and those of the future using alternative fuels and with more the management of manufacturing processes. The use of environmentally-friendly emission control systems; product simulation has enabled considerable reductions in the number of prototypes used for destructive testing over the last c assess and avoid impact transfer by focusing on alternative few years. On the manufacturing side, the simulation of parts solutions (e.g. by developing a lighter but non-recyclable transformation processes and the digitalization of production product). resources to manage variability thus avoiding high scrap levels This is an especially useful innovation tool for evaluating benefits and breakdowns are tangible examples. as well as any impact transfers as far upstream as possible through a comprehensive overview of the environmental impacts that paves the way for future innovations. For instance, 8.1.1.2. Tools for integrating the the measurement of the environmental footprint generated by new products or materials is always supplemented by a eco-design approach detailed LCA, investigating issues of particular relevance (in For each innovation and development project, the different line with objectives such as weight reduction or lower energy components of eco-design – the presence of substances of consumption). concern, recyclability, the environmental footprint and interior It also provides a more in-depth understanding of the air quality – are systematically checked by the designer using environmental choices of an entire industry. Faurecia is therefore an eco-design checklist. If necessary, an in-depth study may heavily committed to developing and using LCA in liaison with be carried out (life cycle analysis for an innovation that aims to automakers and auto sector partners as the means of gaining reduce weight, VOC and odor tests, etc.). a shared understanding of environmental challenges. 88 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 Faurecia and sustainable development Faurecia and the environment 8 8.1.2.

In 2016, Faurecia decided to strengthen its commitment to protecting the environment by setting up an Environmental Committee, led by the Industrial Strategy department, comprising the Customer Relations Director, the three HSE Business Group Directors, Purchasing, Strategy and Innovation, Communication, Risk Management and Loss Control departments. This committee meets monthly and aims to deal with environmental issues in a cross-cutting manner. It enabled the launch of a dialogue, directly linked to its environmental responsibility, with the Group’s external stakeholders. The aim was to update the materiality analysis carried out in 2015 and to set up an environmental breakthrough plan by 2017. The key performance indicators of this plan will be presented and discussed by the Environmental Committee on a quarterly basis.

They represent no less than 25% of the total quantity of fibers used by the Group. Wood A Spanish site, belonging to the Faurecia Interiors Business Group, producing interior wooden parts uses waste generated by the furniture and pallet industry as raw material. (1) To make the data more reliable (see Independent Verifier’s Report in 2015), a detailed analysis was carried out at 22 sites representing 80% of the total amount of metal materials purchases from the Business Group concerned. Five other sites underwent a detailed analysis of their metal consumption. The corrections made had an impact on the overall data. The 2016 data therefore cannot be compared with the 2015 data. (2) Kenaf is related to jute. Its spiny stems, 1 to 2 cm in diameter, are often, but not always, branched.

Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2016, on: c the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Faurecia; c the justification of our assessments; c the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at December 31, 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: c Note 2.1 to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting principles applied to calculate the capital gain on the sale of the Company’s Automotive Exteriors activity to Plastic Omnium and the accounting treatment of assets held for sale and discontinued operations, in accordance with IFRS 5. We verified the appropriateness of these principles, their correct application and the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in that Note. c Your Company performs impairment tests on goodwill at each reporting date and also assesses whether fixed assets show any indication of impairment, based on the methods described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding cash flow forecasts and assumptions applied by your Company. We also verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Note 10. Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 237 10 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements c Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements concerning corporate income tax specifies that deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. Our work consisted in verifying that this method had been correctly applied and reviewing the forecasts and assumptions supporting the probability of recovering these deferred tax assets. c As part of our assessment of the accounting principles used by your Company, we verified the methods used to capitalize and amortize development costs. We also verified the recoverable amount of these assets and the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III Specific verification As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

On the recommendation of the Management Committee on February 1, 2017, the Board of Directors meeting of February 8, 2017, reviewed the extent to which these quantitative criteria had been met: c as regards the operating income, the Board of Directors formally noted that 141% of this initial quantitative target had been achieved; c as regards free cash ﬂow, the Board of Directors formally noted that 140% of this second quantitative target had been achieved. As a result of these two achievements, 140.4% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached; this entitles to quantitative variable compensation of €561,600 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed.

This agreement was authorized by the Board of Directors on April 13, 2016.

Terms and conditions These plans include: c a defined contribution plan relating to salary brackets A and B with total contributions representing 1% on bracket A and 6% on bracket B of the compensation without any contribution by the beneficiary. In 2016, Faurecia paid €7,337.04 in respect of these contributions; c a defined benefit plan with the following terms and conditions: c minimum seniority: five years at the time of retirement, c progressive increase of potential entitlement in relation to seniority and compensation: potential entitlement increases each year by 1% of salary bracket C, c reference period taken into account to calculate entitlement: seniority as of December 18, 2006, c entitlement calculations relate to salary bracket C only (i.e., between four and eight times the French annual social security ceiling), c the reference compensation taken into account at the time of retirement is the average of the annual bracket C compensation received over the past three years.

At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors confirmed that Patrick Koller, who no longer has an employment contract with the Company, will remain a beneficiary of these two plans after July 1, 2016 in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. Furthermore, in accordance with Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Code of commerce as amended by the French Act No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 (the Macron Act), the Board of Directors decided to make Patrick Koller’s right to the defined benefit plan subject to the following performance condition, linked to his annual variable compensation: c in the event that the variable compensation objectives are achieved at 80% or above, an additional 1% of the potential rights (limited to salary bracket C) will vest for the period in question; c in the event the variable compensation objectives are achieved at less than 80%, the increase in the rights will be reduced in proportion to the level at which the objectives were achieved (for example, an objective achieved at 30% would lead to a 0.30% increase in the potential rights).

Set up following a decision by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 11, 2015 and modified by a unilateral decision made by the Chief Executive Officer on July 4, 2016, this plan was intended for members of Faurecia’s Executive Committee who have an employment contract with the Company, either in progress or suspended, or hold a corporate office in France, and have served on the Executive Committee for a minimum of three consecutive calendar years as from the implementation of this plan or the date they joined the Executive Committee. Terms and conditions Faurecia guarantees beneficiaries of the plan an annual pension determined according to the Company’s operating income and budget approved by the Board of Directors according to the following formula S Xi*R, where: c R is the annual reference compensation; c Xi is the entitlement for each year of seniority (i) equal to: c 3% if the operating income for the year is strictly more than 105% of the budgeted operating income, c 2% if the operating income for the year is between 95% and 105% of the budgeted operating income, c 1% if the operating income for the year is strictly less than 95% of the budgeted operating income. Operating income for the year Y is defined based on the income statement as of December 31, Y approved by the Board of Directors in year Y+1 and the initial budget for the year Y approved by the Board of Directors in the year Y-1. Each year, the Board of Directors therefore decides how much should be granted, following the approval of the financial statements. In respect of 2015, the Board of Directors decided at its meeting of April 13, 2016 that the pension for the financial year would be equal to 3% of the reference compensation of each beneficiary in France. The potential individual rights of Patrick Koller at December 31, 2016 are as follows: Potential Reference compensation annual rights Total potential annual rights Maximum potential rights as of December 31, 2016 for 2016 as of December 31, 2016 (all Faurecia plans) Seniority conditions Three calendar years on the Executive Committee as of €1,469,290 3% 6% 25%* January 1, 2015 * Combined with eight times the annual social security limit. No payment was made to Patrick Koller in respect of this plan during the financial year ended December 31, 2016. Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company The Board of Directors has justified the agreement as follows: “These plans, which are subject to performance conditions, are part of a long-term strategy to retain senior directors and the Chief Executive Officer and encourage closer involvement in the Group’s results.” 1.2.3 Severance pay Nature and purpose At its meeting of July 25, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a severance pay package for Patrick Koller. Terms and conditions This indemnity is subject to the following conditions: i. Severance pay would be due to Patrick Koller in the event that he is removed from office as Chief Executive Officer at the Company’s initiative, except in the event of serious or gross misconduct; ii. No indemnity would be due if Patrick Koller resigns or retires; iii. The payment of this indemnity is subject to the following performance conditions: a. achieving positive operating income over the three financial years prior to the end of Patrick Koller’s term of office as Chief Executive Officer, b. achieving positive net cash flow over the three financial years prior to the end of Patrick Koller’s term of office as Chief Executive Officer; 336 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports 12 iv. The severance pay package would be equal to 24 months of Patrick Koller’s reference compensation (fixed compensation and short-term variable compensation) if the two conditions set out above are met over the three financial years in question, which in practical terms amounts to meeting six criteria; v. Should one of the six criteria not be met, the severance pay package would be reduced by one sixth and therefore could be equal to zero if none of the six criteria are met; vi. Should Patrick Koller’s term of office as Chief Executive Officer be less than three years, the severance pay calculation would be the same, but the number of criteria would be adjusted to take into account the actual duration of his term of office. Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company The Board of Directors has justified the agreement as follows: “This commitment, which is subject to performance conditions, is part of a long-term strategy to retain the Chief Executive Officer and encourage closer involvement in the Group’s results.” AGREEMENTS AND COMMITMENTS ALREADY APPROVED BY THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Agreements and commitments approved in previous years In accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Code of commerce, we were informed that the following agreements and commitments, approved by the Annual General Meeting in previous years, remained in force during the year ended December 31, 2016. 2.1 Deﬁned contribution pension plan (Article 83 of the French Tax Code) and deﬁned beneﬁt pension plan (Article 39 of the French Tax Code) for all Group employees in France Person concerned Yann Delabrière, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until June 30, 2016.

INDEPENDENT VERIFIER’S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the COFRAC (1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the Statutory Auditors of the company Faurecia, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2016, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the “CSR Information,” pursuant to the provisions of the Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the Company It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce), in accordance with the protocols used by the Company (hereafter referred to as the “Criteria”), and available on request at the Company’s headquarters. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the Article L. 822-11 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Responsibility of the independent verifier It is our role, based on our work: c to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information); c to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria; Our verification work was undertaken by a team of 6 people between September 2016 and February 2017, for an estimated duration of 10 weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the Order of May 13, 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission. 1. ATTESTATION OF PRESENCE OF CSR INFORMATION Nature and scope of the work Interviews with the management of relevant departments allowed us to obtain an understanding of the Company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the Company’s activities and related to its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes. We have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). (1) Scope available at www.cofrac.fr. Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 343 12 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports In the absence of certain consolidated information, we have verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in Article R. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). We verified that the CSR Information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-1 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce) and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-3 of the French Code of commerce (Code de commerce). Conclusion Based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above we confirm the presence in the management report of the required CSR Information. 2. LIMITED ASSURANCE ON CSR INFORMATION Nature and scope of the work We undertook around 10 interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments in charge of the data collection process and – when relevant – responsible for internal monitoring process and risk management in order to: c assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards; c verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices. For the CSR Information which we considered the most important (1): c At the level of the parent company, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report; c At the level of the representative selection of entities that we selected (2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 15% of the total workforce and between 15% and 36% of the quantitative environmental information. (1) Social Information: • Indicators (quantitative information): total headcount and breakdown by contract, absenteeism rate, total number of trainings, work accidents frequency rate (with and without days lost). • Qualitative information: employment (gender and geography, hiring and terminations, women proportion in executives headcount), labor organization, absenteeism, labor relations (social dialogue organization, collective agreements), health and safety, work accidents (frequency and gravity), training policies, diversity and equality of treatment and opportunities (measures undertaken for gender equality, measures undertaken to improve gender equality, antidiscrimination policies and actions), promotion and respect of the ILO core conventions (freedom of association, anti-discrimination policies and actions, elimination of forced labor and child labor). Environmental and societal information: • Indicators (quantitative information): the percentage of production sites certified ISO 14001, the number of sites certified ISO 14001, raw material consumption and its ratio per turnover unit, energy consumption and its ratio per turnover unit, GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2 and their ratio per turnover unit), emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds, the quantity of waste produced and its ratio per turnover unit, waste distribution per disposal type, the percentage of suppliers that have been assessed following CSR criteria. • Qualitative information: general environmental organization, training and information delivered to the employees regarding environmental protection, the resources dedicated to the prevention of environmental risks and pollution, measures undertaken to prevent, reduce or remediate air emissions (emissions of volatile organic compounds), circular economy (waste generation prevention, waste recycling and disposal, measures undertaken to improve energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy), climate change (the significant emission sources for GHG generated by the activities of the society, especially for the use of services and goods produced by the society, the adaptation to climate change), importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in the purchasing policies and the relations with suppliers and subcontractors; importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in the purchasing policies and the relations with suppliers and subcontractors, loyalty of practices (measures to prevent corruption). (2) Faurecia Clean Mobility BG: North America Division, including the sites of Silao and Queretaro (Mexico), and the Fradley site (United Kingdom); Faurecia Interiors BG: South Europe Division, including the sites of Mouzon and Hénin-Beaumont (France); Faurecia Seating BG: Banbury site (United Kingdom). 344 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2016 Combined General Meeting of May 30, 2017 Reports 12 For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the Company. Eventually, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information. We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgment allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. Due to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated. Conclusion Based on our work, we have not identified any significant misstatement that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken together, has not been fairly presented, in compliance with the Criteria.
