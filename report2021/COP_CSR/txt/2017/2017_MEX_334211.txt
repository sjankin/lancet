Grupo Bimbo · 2016 Integrated Annual Report · 3 IN MEMORIAM With sadness and profound gratitude for his legacy, we mourn the passing of Don Lorenzo Servitje Sendra, one of the Company’s founders, on February 3rd, 2017, at the age of 98. Grupo Bimbo was founded in 1945, by Don Lorenzo, Jaime Jorba, José Mata, Jaime Sendra and Alfonso Velasco. The Company began with ten vehicles, one brand, four products and 38 associates, the first of whom was his brother Roberto Servitje. Don Lorenzo was Manager, CEO, and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Grupo Bimbo. He left his management position and sat on the Board from 1980 until 1994; he continued to be an inspiring presence for the Company thereafter, until his passing. He had a great love for Mexico and for every country where we have operations. He always considered that each country has great opportunities and people capable of achieving success. Grupo Bimbo still promotes the values and Philosophy that Don Lorenzo instilled over 70 years ago. We will always remember him as a great man, leader and source of inspiration.

This means that our 40,000 people learn, assimilate knowledge and later share it with their workmates.

Since One of the Objectives for Sustainable Growth that concerns us is Education. The the beginning of the year, we integrated the team with representatives from experience Grupo Bimbo has had throughout its existence is that true change is every organization and functional areas. We managed to have eight meetings generated when people have knowledge, they know how to apply it and when with the leaders of each region with great results. this knowledge constantly evolves. This effort consolidated a structure for the GB University which was divided in Academies and these, in turn, in Schools. The seven current Academies classify and safeguard the knowledge of the general knowledge subjects at the University. In a traditional university, they would be equal to Faculties. Each one of the Academies consists of Schools, which are the fields that form the subject. These schools are managed by specialization areas, which define the syllabus and contribute with the content of the 40 areas we currently have at this stage. Grupo Bimbo · 2016 Integrated Annual Report · 85 The main Academy of the GB University is called Grupo Bimbo Academy. Through it, we impart general knowledge of our Group such as our Founders’ philosophy, which is undoubtedly the heart and soul of our company. The scope of the GB University was also extended: we incorporated a new e-learning platform that allows data capture and therefore standardization and measurement of indicators. The system also allows coordination of actions throughout the Group and attending specific requirements, as well as detecting violation of defined standards. Most important, we can now know the educational trajectory of our associates, which is relevant to understand each one’s preferences and needs according to function and professional profile. In the near future we will be able to know precisely the amount invested in the programs moving thus towards integrated information, that is, financial and non-financial data in one and only report. The strategy that we defined towards 2020, allowed the integration of a new trend in the way of imparting learning: gamification. Gamification attracts people to knowledge through brief, ludic spaces of interaction that increase its retention. In 2017, we will keep on exploring the media and the ease for accessing relevant knowledge and contents from personal devices. In addition, we will seek to obtain the commitment of associates, their work areas, and the company itself so that all acquired knowledge is applied towards obtaining favorable results and new skills for transformation and improvement.
