Group Sustainability Report 2016 C.P. Group Sustainability Report 2016 91 SOCIAL IMPACT Government statistics show that over 20% of the Thai population are still classified as living in poverty. Furthermore, those working in agriculture are twice as likely to be living in poverty because of land rights issues, access to education and technology, as well as economic disadvantage. At the same time, the agricultural sector is faced with an aging labor force as the younger generation moves towards other industries. Thailand’s workforce as a whole is aging and as this trend continues, the older generation will become increasingly dependent on those still in the workforce. Compounding this issue is the growing economic gap between the wealthy and the poor, particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and the disabled. Small businesses are regarded as the economic and social foundation of the country. At Makro, we strive to support them and enable them to operate sustainably. We are committed to their development through a range of projects that teach management skills to SMEs throughout the country. Mrs. Suchada Ithijarukul Chief Executive Officer Siam Makro PCL 92 C.P.

Group Sustainability Report 2016 C.P. Group Sustainability Report 2016 99 HEALTH & WELL-BEING The food industry faces an increasing number of challenges as consumer expectations increase and trade regulations become increasingly stringent. At the same time, the supply chain has become more complex, and it has become more complicated to manage both food safety and quality. According to the World Health Organization, Thailand is suffering from the impact of noncommunicable diseases such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes, all of which are primarily driven by diet and lifestyle factors. In addition, Thailand’s Ministry of Education reports that Thai children up to primary school age are experiencing the effects of malnutrition with 13% underweight, 12% suffering from stunted growth, and 14% suffering from obesity. Food companies must therefore strive to enhance quality and traceability throughout the value chain, investing in research on how to meet consumer needs and advising consumers about nutrition, especially for customers in the high-risk and vulnerable groups. Ensuring food safety and traceability and developing healthy products are both a challenge and an opportunity for food companies. We look at every detail, ensuring quality throughout our production process. We have always been dedicated to creating value through innovation, with a strong focus on research and product development. This represents our most basic responsibility towards our customers.

When viewed from an economic perspective, these issues are estimated to cost Thailand up to 11% of GDP or THB 1.5 trillion. Such problems are felt on an economic, social and political scale. Education has been highlighted as a major challenge for Thailand and for other countries around the world as it is crucial for equitable development. Improving educational standards in Thailand and around the world will require multistakeholder commitment encompassing: families, schools, communities, organizations as well as the government sector. C.P. Group is committed to collaborating with all sectors to help build a functional and sustainable educational ecosystem. We want to create a system that is studentoriented, and that is fair and equal. We want to aid schools by encouraging engagement with all sectors and creating opportunities for collaboration.

The private sector, which is responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions through the products and services it provides, has a significant role to play in keeping global warming within internationally agreed limits. Thailand, as a signatory of the Paris Agreement, has set a target to reduce emissions by 20-25% by 2030. Helping the country work towards this target is a priority for C.P. Group. Despite the challenges, we see opportunities for growth in the fight against climate change.

Group Sustainability Report 2016 133 WATER STEWARDSHIP As agriculture, industrials and tourism grow, so does the demand for water. Water supplies are becoming increasingly unpredictable, and we are seeing more and more challenges related to this including droughts, floods and issues with water quality. Globally, over 660 million people struggle to access clean water, and this has broader implications for socio-economic development, food safety and public health. The World Economic Forum has stated that water crises are becoming a global threat, and that they will only increase in frequency over the coming decades. According to the World Bank’s 2011 report, Thailand’s status as an agricultural economy means that it is even more vulnerable to water shortages, as water demand is expected to increase by 35% over the next 20 years. More than 70% of our water usage is for irrigation and food production. As such, water shortages are a critical risk for our business. Improving our agricultural and food production processes to use water more efficiently is a challenge for us. It is also an important opportunity for C.P. Group in our drive towards sustainability. Water is a vital resource for our agriculture and food businesses. We combine 3 separate steps in our water management process: a comprehensive risk assessment, developing innovations to increase efficiency and conservation projects.

Group Sustainability Report 2016 149 RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT Creating the right balance between economic growth, social development and environmental conservation requires a shared commitment between companies and their partners throughout the supply chain based on open collaboration and transparency. Research shows that the impact of certain industries such as agriculture, food, telecommunications and retail tend to appear upstream1, so it is important to ensure that collaboration is taking place at all stages within the supply chain. Success in this regard is only possible if we ensure that we are working with business partners who share C.P. Group’s values and understand their responsibility to manage risk and mitigate their impact. We recognize that stakeholders throughout our supply chain are an essential component in the growth of our business. We are therefore committed to developing the economic, social and environmental capabilities of everyone with whom we conduct business.’ Mr. Somchai Kungsamutr President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Feed Ingredients 1 Please refer to The Tenth Annual State of Green Business 2017 published by Trading Business Group Greenbiz and Trucost; also available for download at https://www.greenbiz.com/ report/state-green-business-2017 150 C.P.

Group is committed to collaborating with business partners to work jointly towards our goal of responsible supply chain management. We developed the policy and relevant procedures to promote responsible business operations in accordance with the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). This policy and procedure forms the basis of our supplier assessment. The assessment addresses 4 aspects, as follows: PRODUCT PROCESS • Quality and Safety • Environmental management Promote Engagement, • Traceability • Efficiency enhancement and business innovation Build Capacity, and PEOPLE Enhance Capability of PERFORMANCE Business Partners • Child labor • Compliance with laws and regulations • Forced labor • Risk management • Fair treatment with respect and dignity • Transparency C.P.

C.P. Group is committed to supporting and collaborating with business partners in developing their capabilities, competitiveness, as well as their understanding of social and environmental responsibilities. Farmers are RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN at the heart of our food businesses and it is of great MANAGEMENT importance that we work closely together as we have for almost a century. Since 2014, C.P. Group has piloted and supported the implementation of responsible supply chain management in the Agro-Industrial and Food business group by providing training to procurement staff. We then distributed the policy to over 7,300 business partners in 13 product groups during 2015 to 2016. Over 97% of critical suppliers have already signed to acknowledge the policy. Additionally, critical suppliers of raw materials for animal feed, food ingredients, condiments, and food packaging groups have conducted a self-assessment on sustainability, enabling them to systematically review and assess sustainability risks in their own operations. In 2016, the Agro-Industrial and Food business group developed a supplier sustainability protocol to serve as a guideline for third party audits, which will commence in 2017. We have also created an online supplier sustainability self-assessment in 3 languages Thai, English, and Vietnamese to ensure coverage for both domestic and international business partners in different product groups. We expect this to be implemented as part of our new supplier selection tools from 2017. 154 C.P. Group Sustainability Report 2016 C.P. Group Sustainability Report 2016 155 PART OF OUR COMMITMENT Partnership with Farmers We want to ensure that the food we produce is safe, so our Seeds, Fertilizers and Plant Protection Products business group made it a priority to share knowledge on food safety with farmers. We communicated with farmers about overusing pesticides, safe harvest periods, and contamination in the packing process. Our planting experts provided farmers and entrepreneurs across the nation with information about good agricultural practices. Vegetable and Fresh Fruits Business Partners C.P. Group’s Retail and Distribution business group launched the Makro Quality Pro Project in 2008. We collaborated with public and private organizations to define a strategy to raise the quality of agricultural products to meet international standards. This helps provide safe foods for consumers, enhances the livelihood of farmers, and raises awareness about environmental conservation. We focus on developing an integrated control system to ensure agricultural product quality, which encompasses standardized processes for production, quality control, harvesting, maintenance, transportation and distribution at Makro. Currently, agricultural products permitted to use the Makro Quality Pro label include Kinnaree watermelons, Gros Michel bananas, Dutch papayas and honey mandarins. Rice Business Partners As the price of Thai rice fell and rice farmers struggled with declining incomes, C.P. Group’s Int ernational Trading business group launched a project to support jasmine rice farming. We introduced repurchasing contracts that enabled rice farmers to have a higher, more stable income. The project depends upon providing education about best practices for jasmine rice farming. The scheme was piloted in Sisaket province and was later extended to Ubon Ratchathani, Amnatcharoen, and Yasothon provinces. In addition, we encourage our farmers to obtain the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP+) certification from the Rice Department, as it helps to promote quality unmilled rice in the market. This enabled farmers to sell their products at a higher price, thereby raising their income and contributing to sustainable development.

We did this by benchmarking reports written by CPG and its peers to ensure that sector specific issues were included for comparability. We also tested the filters used in determining material issues to evaluate whether CPG makes informed business decisions that may create opportunities which contribute towards sustainable development. • Auditing CPG’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or misLloyd's Register Group Limited, its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Limited (LRQA), and their statements in the Report.
