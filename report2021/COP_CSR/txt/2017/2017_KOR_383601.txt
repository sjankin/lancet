Message Over the past half century, LH has contributed in raising the quality of life and development of national economy by striving for stability of housing welfare and efficiency of developing land. With our vision “Better Place to Live and Happy Housing with LH” we are playing the leading role in carrying out tasks, as well as concentrating our ceaseless innovation effort in strengthening business foundation based on creativity, integration and collaboration, and also restoring reliability. We particularly believe 2016 was a year we took LH’s sustainability to the next level. Following 2014 and 2015, we have decreased debt burden by KRW 6.8 trillion, collected KRW 25 trillion, the largest ever, and reached net profit of KRW 2.2 trillion to further enhance business structure. In addition, we have successfully executed tasks such as Happy House Project, New Stay Project, and Pangyo Valley. We have also put effort in securing future growth power to make a remarkable advancement in establishing Housing Management Support Center, promoting export of Smart City and executing a new urban regeneration business model. We thank all our stakeholders for always supporting us so that LH could go through the heavy seas of uncertainty to fulfill our mission for people and society. 2017 will be a year of bigger change and challenge. With the establishment of an aspired new government, policy change is expected which could affect LH’s medium and long term business direction. Domestic and foreign risk is also escalating due to continued household debt issue, economic slowdown, international interest rate increase and fear of rising reinforcement. During the rapid changes of business environment, LH will accelerate in reinforcing business competency and risk management to fulfill sustainable housing welfare and local·urban development. We will focus our business resources in carrying out the new government’s public tasks such as expanding rental house supply, urban regeneration new deal program, enhancing balanced development, Smart City construction. In order to make this happen, we will make assurance of boosting financial soundness and securing suitable sites. Furthermore, we will increase credibility through ethical management and improved customer service, and will strive for protection and creation of environmental value. In order to do that, we believe it is important to listen attentively to our stakeholders’ diverse opinions and communicate. Based on LH’s philosophy of sharing, engagement and coexistence, we promise to give our utmost effort for the value creation and co-development of our stakeholders. We hope this report serves as a communication channel to genuinely deliver our performances and efforts for LH’s sustainable business and ask for your continued interest and support. Thank you.

APPENDIX CDM Projects Since the registration of the Pyeongtaek Sosabeol Renewable Energy Project in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) as the first land development district in the world, we have continuously developed CDM projects and registered them in the UNFCCC to earn carbon credits. In September 2011, we developed the greenhouse gas reduction through photovoltaic distribution in public rental housing complexes into CDM projects and completed the registration of “Korea Renewable Energy System Program CDM for Multi-unit Housing” in the UNFCCC in December 2012. Unlike a one-time project, the Program CDM allows individual projects using the same process to be registered in the UNFCCC. As a result, we expected to secure approximately 180,000 tons of carbon credits thanks to photovoltaic distribution projects we are undertaking: these carbon credits are equal to planting about 61 million pine trees.Currently, follow-up task such as carbon credit issuance and additional registration of CPA under Program CDM are in progress. The profit raised from CDM projects are being reinvested to related R&D. In 2016, we expanded the use of renewable energy, such as solar energy, to integrated energy supply facility and rental complexes and as a result acquired 9,000tCO2. The Certified Emission Reduction from the UN forthe supply of solar power, the first ever in the building category in Korea.
