i.:r-36 R UN GlobalCompact Communication on Progress Petroleum Geo-Services ASA Statement of continued support August zLth,2oL7 To our stakeholders, I am pleased to confirm that PGS reaffirms its support to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. ln this annual Communication on Progress, we refer to our Corporate Responsibilitv report 2016. We have aligned our CR (Corporate Responsibility) reporting process with the annual financial reporting structure, which means that this CR report is summarizing activities and key figures from the year 2016 We would also like to add the CR information on the PGS website https://www.pes.com/responsibilitv/ as part of the COP reporting, as this information provides an overview of how PGS defines CR work, and what topics we include under our CR umbrella. The CR report 2016 and the CR web paees form together the 2016 COP report, as they supplement each other. We commit to share this information with stakeholders through our primary communication channels, and this is done as part of the overall annual reporting communication.
