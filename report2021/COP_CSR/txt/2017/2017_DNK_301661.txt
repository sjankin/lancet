Mette Duedahl Høyer Chief Sustainability Officer We quantify these indicators so that we can produce traceable, wholesome food. But just as importantly, we do it to create evidence-based feedback between how we farm, and how our farms thrive. In September 2014, Ingleby signed the UN Global Compact Charter, and the current Hans Henrik Koefoed report serves as our second Communication on Chief Executive Officer Progress Report.

We promote diverse crop rotations to help build nutrients, control pests and weeds, limit erosion and to foster carbon sequestration. Our crops Our main row crops are wheat, corn, barley and soya. Other row crops include canola, sorghum, sunflower and rye as well as beans, fodder crops, oats, potatoes and peas. Our seed production includes carrot, clover and grass seed. We also produce the following horticulture crops; avocados, blueberries, broccoli, table grapes, onions, stevia and pistachio nuts. In addition, we are testing potential new horticulture crops such as organic bananas, kiwifruit, and cacao. 14 INGLEBY CSR REPORT 2015/16 15 Caring for the soils 2 Caring for the advantageous for our farming system and soil health over the long term. millisoils We define and monitor our soil’s qualities metres per year in relation to its ability to support crop Good soil, together with our human growth.

Turning The mild climate and even-spread rainfall in Tasmania, combined with our access to irrigation water, allow our 3,500 dairy cows to graze outside 365-days a year on grass pasture. They produce around 20 million litres of milk annually. We have two dairy parlours on the property, both are equipped with the latest technology. This enables our dairy team to manage cow productivity, health, comfort and well-being. into MILK All our cows are artificially inseminated, and we use sexed semen to increase the number of heifer calves born. Bull calves cannot be used in milk production, instead we raise them on-farm for beef production. We care for our calves in our calf-rearing facility. Here they can socialise with each other in a healthy environment, where they receive milk with the right composition and high quality. Clovelly's effluent system is state of the art. It separates the solid and liquid waste. The liquid waste is applied back onto the pasture through our irrigation system. The solid waste is composted before it is also applied back onto the pasture to help improve the soils. Dairy cows, Clovelly, Tasmania.
