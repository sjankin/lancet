Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2016 11 Chairman’s comments Some years, the outside world makes its presence felt more than others. 2016 was such a year. If we are talking about politics, the US election and Brexit were obviously among the most important events. Turning to agriculture, it can be said that both the world market for dairy products and the relatively large stocks of grain have affected us farmers in Sweden. During the year, Lantmännen has developed into an increasingly important partner for Swedish agricultural entrepreneurs. With the array of expertise, breadth and strength we have in our Group, Lantmännen contributes towards thriving and internationally competitive farming. A question I was asked during the year was what enables LantThe positive developments in the Agriculture Sector continmännen to develop so positively. I think the question is both ued throughout the year. In a market affected by increasingly challenging and interesting.

One “ launch I would like to mention is our digital tool LM2, which has every possibility to simplify the farmer’s daily life and business. Only a company like Lantmännen, with its entire breadth, can offer such a comprehensive digital offering! I am both pleased with and proud The Machinery Sector has presented significantly better of the financial development in all results this year, despite the turbulent market for agricultural Sectors in 2016 – this strengthens machinery. The major changes in progress at suppliers and dealers in Sweden definitely strengthen our strategy to offer Swedish farming and helps us on the more brands and establish a strong presence throughout the path towards the goal of becoming a country. I believe that Lantmännen Maskin’s forward-looking leading player in the grain value chain investment in a parts warehouse in Malmö will definitely in the Baltic Sea region. benefit Swedish agriculture for a long time. Swecon has contributed again with good results. Construction machinery is an important business for Lantmännen, particularly now that many large construction projects have been started. While gearing up the Group and developing Lantmännen, Developments in the Energy Sector have been very there is also a healthy caution when expanding and making good, particularly due to the opportunities for Lantmännen acquisitions.

Continuous strategic work is in progress in order to meet the development and secure a strategic position for the future. Varying growth in Lantmännen’s main markets Weaker global growth is the external factor that has the greatest impact on Lantmännen’s main markets in the short and medium term. Slower global demand for food and raw materials, combined with an increased rate of production from the world’s agricultural companies, leads to lower prices, with increased competition as a result. This is most noticeable in the sector for agricultural machinery, where manufacturers and dealers are competing for an increasingly small market. Growth in Lantmännen’s main markets does not follow the same patterns.
