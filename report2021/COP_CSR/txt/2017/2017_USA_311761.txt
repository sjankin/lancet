Assessment, Policy and Goals Criterion Technology is committed to the health and safety of our environment and community. Proper disposal and storage of chemicals is taught and enforced. Criterion continues to enforce its recycling program and has identified new materials to recycle. In January we began developing procedures for regrinding and reusing some of our plastic scrap and hope to report on that progress next year. Implementation Our policies, work instructions, product specifications, insurance booklets and job descriptions are maintained electronically through the company intranet and we encourage employees to print on both sides of paper sheets. We have a closed loop water system for our injection molding process allowing us to reuse water. We recycle paper, plastic, aluminum and other metals, corrugated cardboard and scrap materials. Recycling bins are placed throughout our facility and employees are encouraged to use them for all recyclable materials. Our heating and air system is programed so that it does not run excessively when the building is unoccupied. Chemicals are disposed of and stored according to state and federal regulations. Our skylights reduce the need to use lights throughout the production areas. Measurement of Outcomes All recycled materials are tracked throughout the year. This has allowed us to monitor progress and set goals for improving our programs. The graphs below compare our past 3 years of recycled materials. In 2014 our acrylic and polycarbonate production waste was again reduced which in turn reduced the amount of those materials recycled. We continue to become more efficient managing the amount of plastic material being wasted in the production process. Our increased ABS quantity was due to an increase of products produced with ABS. In 2015 our Production Manager and Process Engineers have reduced scrap during production with changes in processing and assigning dedicated machines to run our different materials, with dedicated machines we have less opportunity for material to cause any scrap related issues. This has reduced the available scrap and at the beginning of 2016 we have partnered with another manufacturing company that is using our scrap acrylic as purge, they are currently picking up several gaylords of Acrylic per year. During 2015 we have been using Nylon as purge material and find that using the scrap material has lowered our need for the virgin material and reduced waste. Currently in 2016 we are still continuing to grind the nylon scrap and use it as purge material. Recycled Plastic 25000 20000 15000 Pounds 12266 2014 10000 2015 4901 2016 5000 0 690 0 0 Misc. Plastic Acrylic Polycarbonate ABS Nylon Material Type In 2014/2015 we were successful at decreasing our paper consumption despite the fact that we are still printing instruction manuals in house. We were also able to increase the amounts of paper, co-mingle and corrugated cardboard recycled through an increased effort of employee awareness. In 2015 we implemented Electronic travelers and Daily shift reports to again reduce our paper consumption. The daily shift reporting project was completed in January 2015. Our project on electronic travelers was completed in July 2015. In 2016 we have been using the Electronic Shift Reports and Travelers for the past year, we have cut our usage in Â½ and we are still looking for new areas to go paperless.
