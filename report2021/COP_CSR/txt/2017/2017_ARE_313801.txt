FSI is founded on the conviction that the adoption of ethical recruitment practice is imperative, both from a human rights perspective and a business one. FSI has developed an ethical manpower recruitment model, which ensures that all personnel are protected from paying any fees and from exploitation frequently associated with the international recruitment sector. FSI was founded with the aim of bringing international best practice to the recruitment and management of migrant workers from the developing world, where the widespread practice of bonded labour is still very real. The company’s ethos is centered on the principle that investing in people through ethical recruitment processes of the highest standards promotes vital human rights, which in turn, enhances productivity for businesses and naturally aligns its practice with the Global Compact principles.
