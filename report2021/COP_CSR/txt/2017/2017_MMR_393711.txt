Executive Summary The E-Guard Environmental Services has carried out this Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) in August and September 2014 for the proposed Sanctum Inle Resort hotel at the plot number (38), Maingthauk plot, Maingthauk village, in Inle Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, east bank of Inle Lake, Nyaungshwe Township, Taunggyi District, Southern Shan State, Union of Myanmar. Sanctum Inle Resort Company Limited which will invest MMK 10,000 million on the proposed hotel project is 100% local investment, aiming to carrying out construction and operation of hotel services at the above-mentioned address. In accordance with the paragraph 19 of the terms and conditions of the MIC permit, dated 9thApril 2014, the Sanctum Inle Resort Company Limited has to submit the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) report together with Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to the Environmental Conservation Department (ECD), the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC). Thus this IEE including EMP was prepared and submitted in conformity with the provisions of Myanmar Environmental Conservation Law, 2012 and general guidelines promulgated by the Environmental Conservation Department (ECD) of MONREC. The proposed hotel site is located at the Inle Wildlife Sanctuary. Main power source of the hotel is electricity from the national grid with two backup generators for emergency use. Proposed hotel project consists of three main steps, from environmental conservation point of view, construction, operation of hotel services and decommissioning of the hotel after its lifespan. The construction phase will take 24 months including 6 months of preliminary survey. Operation of hotel services will take 50 years and can be extended for another two times after which the hotel is supposed to be dismantled. The hotel project has planned to use and install upto-date machines and equipment during construction and operation phases. The hotel shall abide international norms and standards, Myanmar Hotels and Tourism Law and other related laws, rules and regulations of relevant ministries. The proposed hotel project has planned to create job opportunity for the local people up to 250 and other people from the region who can improve their professional skills and make themselves valuable human resources in hotel and tourism industry, through its capacity building process. In all phases of the project, a few low impacts are observed whereas no significant impacts and unsustainable situations are identified. Only (29) non-significant environmental impacts are found out. During the construction phase, there is a low significant impact for discharging sewage and litter into the Inle Lake. Mitigation measures are to practice NO littering and discharging sewage into the Inle Lake policy, having alternative proper waste management system such as waste collection, segregation and proper disposal. During the operation phase, there is an environmental impact with low significant which is water resource depletion due to domestic water consumption from the tube well. Mitigation measures are installing water meter 5 Initial Environmental Examination and water saving equipment for control of water use. There is also low significant environmental impact due to discharging of sewage and litter to the nearby Inle Lake which must be mitigated by adopting no waste discharge to Inle Lake policy, installing sewage treatment plant and developing proper waste segregation and final disposal system. During the operation phase, there is a potential discharge to environment such as detergent, liquid chlorine/tablets, cleaning agents due to the use of chemical products for cleaning, laundry, swimming pool and Spa. This must be addressed by using secondary containment to avoid accidental leakage and spill and a wise choice of environmental friendly products (e.g. phosphate free detergent). In addition, there is a low significant impact which is noise and atmospheric emission due to transportation of delivered supplies and visitors to hotel which must be taken care of by conducting regular noise and air monitoring survey, use of proper PPEs and regular boats engine maintenance. Regarding health and safety impacts, there will be a numbers of risks such as car/boat accidents during transportation, use of equipment and machines, probable electric shock hazard, fires and safety hazards such as falls from height, slips, trips and falls, falling objectives, manual handling, repetitive strain injuries etc… during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases. There are preventive measures already planned to reduce the risk of fire and also the machines to be provided are new with modernized technology including machine guards. Therefore the probability of accidents and electrical shocks are low. There are a number of actions to be done to mitigate the risks such as providing safety awareness training, first aid, free medicine, transport to the nearest hospitals in case of emergency, and personal protective equipment such as safety gloves, helmets, goggles, earmuffs etc. There will be one Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Coordinator appointed for the following program strategy of “Plan, Do, Check, Act” for potential health, safety and environmental issues. It is expected that the proposed project have only minor impacts on Physical, Biological and Socio-economic Environment. All of the impacts are local in nature and can be easily mitigated through adequate mitigation measures and regular monitoring during the Construction, Operation and Decommissioning Phases of the project. The EMP is prepared to address these potential impacts through appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring measures. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which has designed as an environmental management and health and safety framework for all three phases of Sanctum Inle Resort hotel is prepared in chapter 9. The environmental management practices, procedure and responsibilities are well defined here in to fully comply with the existing environmental policies, laws, rules and instructions of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. This plan can be divided into four parts as follows; Environmental Management Plan (EMP) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) 6 Initial Environmental Examination Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) Environmental Management Plan (EMP) identifies the activity, objective, mitigation and enhancement measures, estimated cost and responsible person or unit. Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) has to find out environmental concerns, management activities, timing, cost and responsible person and unit. The main purpose of Corporal Social Responsibility (CSR) plan is to secure social well-being of the hotel guest, employees and their family members, better community living and transparent and friendly relationship with neighboring communities. Opinions, feedbacks, desires and needs of local people recorded in public hearing/public consultation meetings are well addressed and incorporated in the formulation of EMP and CSR. Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP) identifies the biodiversity management area, objective, management activities, timeframe, cost estimate and responsible person or unit so as to ensure the protection of biodiversity resources used by the hotel. This IEE has, in brief, systematically and scientifically explored all possible positive and negative environmental impacts of the proposed hotel project and identified the monitoring and mitigation measures on negative impacts which could be happened in three phases. 7 Initial Environmental Examination စီရင္ခစ ံ ာ ကက်္းခက ်ဳ္ ကန်ီး်ဳတ္ဝန္းကကင္္ိင္ရာ္န္းစစ္စခင္းကိိ္းစ်ဳိ္ ျ ာင္စိာမ္တစမန္မာျိိင္ငံ

Introduction As mentioned in the paragraph 19 of the terms and conditions of the MIC permit, the IEE report has to be submitted to the Environmental Conservation Department (ECD), the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC) in order to get the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC). This report describes the findings of Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of Sanctum Inle Resort hotel to be constructed and operated at the plot number 38, Maingthauk plot, Maingthauk villageat the east bank of Inle Lake falling in the Inle Wildlife Sanctuary, Nyaungshwe Township, Taunggyi District, Southern Shan State by Sanctum Inle Resort Company Limited. The aim of this report is to identify the major environmental impacts which can occur during construction and operation phases of the hotel project with the provision of effective measures to reduce the adverse impacts, if any. In addition, it also reveals daytoday safety, health care, social welfare management and biodiversity management plans to be implemented by the proposed hotel throughout its lifespan. 2.1. Background History of Inle Lake The Inle Lake, the second largest fresh water lake in Myanmar, is situated at an altitude of 884 m above sea level in a N-S striking graben zone than 100 km long. The N-S striking mountain chain in the West (East of Heho) rise about 270 m and those in the East (Taunggyi) about 400 m above the level of the Inle Lake. It is about 23 km long and 6.4 meter wide. It depth varies considerably between the dry season (up to 4 m) and rainy season (up to 7 m). The mean surface temperature of the very clear water was 21.7 ̊C towards the end of dry season, and the bottom temperature was 20 ̊C (ANNANDALE 1923). The lake is renowned for its beauty and serenity, and has been attracting visitors for hundreds of years. It is a site of two famous pagodas, Phaung Daw Oo and Ah Lo Taw Pauk, which date back 800 years, as well as many pagodas and stupa fields in the lake environs. Inle is one of three key tourism destinations in Myanmar, alongside Mandalay and Pagan, and attracts over 250,000 visitors annually, including both international and national visitors on pilgrimage. The Pagoda festival in October is a major draw-card, and the culture of Intha people is of particular interest, with the unique leg-rowing fishermen, and the floating garden agriculture (hydroponic cultivation) as well as artisan crafts of silk, weaving, silver smiths and lotus cloth. However, the Inle Lake and its catchment area have been experiencing severe environmental and physical degradation due to several human, natural and anthropogenic factors. As a result, the submergence area which was once 257.03 km2 (2005) has shrunk to 239.83 km2 (2010). The deepest lake of the part measured at 6.6m is now a mere 3.9m deep; and the shallowest part once 3.9m is now 1.9m deep. The lake is elliptical in shape. Nowadays, the north south axis is approximately 18 km and east west is approximately 5 km in length. The nearest airport is Heho 12 Initial Environmental Examination which is approximately 50 km from Nyaungshwe and 30 km south west of Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State. The water surface area of Inle Lake was known to be around 271 sq.km; its length from north to south was 57.94 km and its breadth from west to east was 12.88 km. A survey of the lake dimensions conducted by the Survey and Land Records Department in 2007 revealed that the lake area had decreased at an alarming rate. The total lake area was reduced to 163.17 sq.km, of which only 62.16 sq.km remained as open water surface area. Of the remainder, 38.85 sq.km was floating agriculture garden. 33.67 sq.km wild floating vegetation and peat marshes, 7.77 sq.km human habitats and 20.72 sq.km of land based agriculture on land that had encroached into the lake. The length from north to south measured only 17.7 km and its width from west to east a mere 6.44km, indicating that the loss of total lake area was 106.19 sq.km; the decrease in length was 24.14 km and width 6.44 km. The deepest part of the lake, which was once known to have been 6.1 m, is now a mere 3.66 m; and the shallowest part, which was once around 3.66 m, is 1.83 m. The reasons for the shrinkage of lake and its becoming shallower are mainly attributed to the upstream soil erosion, and general watershed issues, coupled with the impact of floating gardens. The Inle Lake Wildlife Sanctuary was established in November 1, 1985 by order of the Socialist Government for fuller legal protection of native and migratory birds and biodiversity conservation in general, with the extent of 247.48 square miles. The Wildlife Sanctuary Warden’s office was established at Nyaungshwe in 1990. It is the world renowned and has been designated as an ASEAN Heritage Site. In 1998, Inle Lake was named as one of the representatives of the Earth’s 200’s most valuable eco-regions and declared as one of the fresh water biodiversity hotspots by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC). Its connection to the Saga Lake and Mobye reservoir makes it’s into a wetland spreading over a length of 100 km. The lake is also home to the revered PhaungDawOo Pagoda and Inthar people residing at the stilt house on the lake, famous for their tradition of rowing boats with leg. Inle Lake is home to nine indigenous fish species including the locally priced Inle cypris (the inle carp, locally known as “ngaphein”) Sawbwa genera that are endemic to Inle Lake and are not known to be found in any part of the world. There are 16 subspecies that thrive in the inflows of streams that discharge into the lake. The lake also provides one of the large fishery resources within the Shan State, supporting livelihoods of a large human population living at the lake and along its fringes. Inle Lake with its associated wetlands supports a wealth of biodiversity and provides important habitats for migratory water birds within the East Asian Flyway from Siberia to Australia. The eastern Sarus crane is also endemic to the Inle region. Inle Lake also serves as a habitat for a wide diversity of native and migratory bird species. A 10.36 sq.km area on the northern fringe of the Sanctuary area has been demarcated as a Bird Preservation Area, where around 25,00030,000 birds consisting of about 270 species, both native and migratory species, congregate during the cold season months. There are 527 tree species, 12 water plant species, more than 270 bird species, 43 fish species, 3 tortoise species, 93 butterfly species, about 30 reptiles and 217 orchids recorded by Environmental and Wildlife Conservation division, Forest 13 Initial Environmental Examination Department. According to the Criteria of the International Union for Conservation of NatureIUCN’s list of vulnerable species; seven bird species (including the Sarus crane) that inhabit Inle Lake, are listed as being threatened with extinction. 3. Scope of the IEE study In the scope of this study, its includes the identification of proposed project plan, installation of facilities and equipment, water treatment, wastewater management, firefighting, operation of hotel services and its requirements, health, safety and corporate social responsibility measures of proposed hotel and analyzing and each component from environment, safety and health care point of view. Full consideration of the potential impacts of the performances in all three phases of project: construction phase, operation phase and decommissioning phase has been properly included and carried out in this study. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) describing comprehensive measures to reduce the unwanted and adverse impacts is attached in this report based on potential environment, safety and health impacts findings. The E Guard Environmental Services based in Yangon has contracted with the and Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd in order to conduct the study taking full responsibility and send an E Guard specialist team in which environmental, health, safety, and social experts are included to perform necessary field measurements. This team has carried out preliminary scoping, field survey, assessment and analysis of project activities and compilation of this report. A field observation using checklist, quantitative and qualitative data collection was carried out by interviews and discussions with responsible persons of Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd in August and November 2014. Secondary data collection was necessarily carried out in order to obtain bio-physical, environmental, climatic and socio-economic information concerning with the proposed hotel site and its surrounding. Baseline environmental data was collected using up to date measuring devices by which evaluation was conducted on any significance of potential impacts in December. And suitable mitigation measures on those impacts were identified to be able to put under acceptable limits which is extremely important because the proposed hotel site is totally located in Inle Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. E Guard Environmental Services met local communities living near the proposed hotel site and carried out public consultation process creating a chance to local public and related stakeholders to express their opinions, suggestions and needs during IEE and EMP formulation of the project. 14 Initial Environmental Examination 4. Review on Existing Environmental Protection Laws and Regulations The Environmental Conservation Law (2012) is the major governing law and the Environmental Conservation Department (ECD) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC) are the prime governing bodies of the law enforcement. In addition, the Constitution (2008), national Environmental Policy (1994), Environmental Conservation Rules and Regulation (draft) and The Protection of Wildlife and Protected Areas Law (1994) are also included to be abided by in the process of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and initial environmental examination (IEE). The above-mentioned existing national laws, rules and regulations of the Union of Myanmar are to be abided by the project proponents/investors on mitigating negative environmental impacts that are compiled and presented in Table 1. It is equally important for this project proponent (Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd.) which shall also comply with Myanmar Hotel and Tourism Law (1993), regulations and the Social Security Law (2012).

Figure 1: Google Map of Sanctum Inle Resort Hotel 26 Initial Environmental Examination Figure 2: Layout Plan of Sanctum Inle Resort 27 Initial Environmental Examination Figure 3: Landscape of Sanctum Inle Resort 28 Initial Environmental Examination 5.1. Type of the Project The Sanctum Inle Resort Company Limited of the Republic of Union of Myanmar proposed its investment of 100% local on building Sanctum Inle Resort hotel, with the authorized capital of 20,714.90 million MMK, on 6.01 acre leased land, at plot number 38, Maingthauk plot, Maingthauk village the east bank of Inle lake falling in Inle Wildlife Sanctuary, Nyaungshwe Township, Taunggyi district, Southern ShanState. The main objective is to construct and operate international standard hotel with the lease of maximum period of 50 years followed by extending another 10 years two times. 5.2. Requirement of Investor The investors have to properly submit this Initial Environment Examination (IEE) report as a preliminary environment impact assessment on the proposed hotel carried out by third party (E Guard Environmental Services) in order to be reviewed and made comments and suggestions by the Environmental Conservation Department (ECD) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC). 5.3. Location of the Proposed Project Sanctum Inle Resort hotel is located at near Maingthauk Village, Nyaungshwe Township, Taunggyi District, Southern Shan State, Union of Myanmar, at the coordinates of 20° 34.275 N and 96°56.611 E covering the total area of 6.01 acre, falling in the Inle Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. The hotel area is 100% on the land. The hotel is quite close to Inle East Reserved forest in the east. Floating gardens and vast area of marsh land can be viewed in the west side, about 150 meters, from the hotel. A main road starting from Nyaungshwe to Loikkaw, Kayar State passes through east side of the compound of the proposed hotel providing easy access to Nyaungshwe, Shwenyaung, Heho and Taunggyi. Figure 4: Location Map of the Proposed Project Area 29 Initial Environmental Examination 5.4.Present Status of the Hotel At present, Sanctum Inle Resort hotel construction work is underway as the land lease agreement has been agreed with Forest Department, Ministry of Environment and Environmental Conservation Department (MOECAF) for initial 50 years. Soil test, site cleaning, fencing, transformer and power cable installation collection of construction materials and equipment are being carried out. A guard house and a store have been constructed inside the project site and security guards are assigned. Construction of tube well and wastewater treatment plant, staff dormitory, laundry, store, transformer and generator house are being carried out on this land. 5.5.Project Components Construction Phase Activities The investor has planned to build, 1 main building, 10Bungalow typed hotel rooms, 1 office, 2 staff houses, 1 laundry building, 1 Spa, 5 villas, 1 building for General Manager, 1 generator house and 1 Jetty with pergola on total leased area within 24 months period right away after 6 months of land preparation period. A tube well is drilled for drinking and washing. A swimming pool is planned to be built near the Spa. Construction division of Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd will take care of constructing all buildings. All building materials are wood and brick. Hotel buildings are planned to be equipped with up-to-date electrical and communication system, Master Antenna Television (MATV) system, fully addressable digital fire alarm system (fire extinguishers are to be kept in all buildings.), water supply and sanitation system and air condition and ventilation system. A jetty will be built so as to provide easy transportation for guests and visitors. Water Supply Development The main water supply is from tube well. This well water is pumped to the water treatment facility that is housed in the service support center located in the hotel compound. The AMD water treatment system is installed so as to meet the requirements of Nyaungshwe Township Municipality. The treatment media for this treatment plant is sand, activated carbon and liquid chlorine. The treated water is to be stored in the overhead distribution tank and supplied nonportable water for garden, firefighting, W/C units and laundry. This water treatment system is available in appendix 5. Site Waste Management A considerable amount of organic refuse (vegetation) would be generated during site clearance activities. To the greatest extent possible the soft material (leaves, shoots, etc.) would be separated and composted on site for later reuse during the landscaping phase. Harder and woody material (tree trunks, branches) would be stockpiled and removed from the site by a waste contractor. During construction, temporary toilets will be provided for use on the site. 30 Initial Environmental Examination Material Transportation Site clearance and construction of the hotel will require transportation of materials to and from the site and this will generate a significant amount of traffic, especially trucks, on the main road. This will exacerbate traffic congestion in the area along the transport routes and potentially cause a deterioration of air quality due to dust and exhaust fumes. These are issues that can be mitigated to some extent as discussed below in section 9.1. Wetland Protection The developer is aware of the ecological role of wetlands as 100% of the hotel area has been fallen in Inle Wildlife Sanctuary and for that reason these wetland area of the project site will be protected. It is intended that the existing trees will be maintained and restored as much as the original state and the floating marsh will be incorporated as a special feature in the landscape design. The details of this are to be worked out. The measures of wetland protection are discussed in section 9.1. Employment It is estimated that approximately between 700 and 1000 persons (skilled and unskilled) will be employed during construction of the resort. Operation of Hotel Services Throughout its lifespan, Sanctum Inle Resort hotel has a plan to offer services mentioned below; 1. Hotel room for guests (Bungalow _5 Buildings, 2 Stories_5 Buildings, 3 Stories_5 Buildings and Main Building) 2. Restaurant, Bar, Room Service and Meeting Room 3. Conferences/Workshop 4. Swimming pool 5. Shows/parties/gatherings/wedding receptions 6. Travel Excursions, Boats and communication 7. Spa, Yoga and Fitness Center 8.

This will involve scores of vehicles movements in addition to the traffic caused by hotel staff, suppliers, and local visitors. The entrance to their sort has been designed to facilitate easy exit to and from the main road and to prevent traffic congestion at the entrance. Water Demand The total estimated demand for water by the resort during full operation is 5,000 gallon per day (1,500,000 gallon per year). Electricity Supply and Fuel Demand The electricity supply during full operation will be from the national grid. There will be two standby (500 KVA) generators for backup in case of power cut. The total estimated demand for fuel for boats, vehicles and generators is Diesel 7,200 gallons, Petrol 500 gallons and Lubricants 2,000 gallons per year. Solid Waste Management Solid waste generated at the site will primarily be domestic in nature (paper, plastics, packaging, waste food, etc.). This will be collected on a regular basis by a township municipal committee. The hotel operators are willing to institute waste segregation and recycling procedures at the resort and the extent to which these can be effectively executed will be examined. In order to reduce the usage of portable plastic bottles, recyclable glass water bottles are used for the complimentary water in the hotel rooms. Used beer cans and soft drink bottles are reused in the restaurant so as to reduce volume of waste. No plastic bags are allowed to use in the boutique. Sewage Treatment and Effluent Disposal The sewage treatment plant (STP) to service the demands of the resort is built on land west of the hotel compound. The sewage treatment plant (AME 300) which is the aeration activated sludge technology is installed. The function of treatment system is to pump out grey and black water into the equalization tank. The effluents coming out from equalization tank is sent to aeration tank and then send to sedimentation before it is discharged to environment. The treated effluent will meet Nyaungshwe Township Municipality requirements and the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry. The effluent, which is treated to wastewater quality standards that meet Environmental Conservation Department requirements, will be pumped back to the resort for use as irrigation for the grounds. The process flow of sewage treatment plant AME 300 is attached in appendix 4. 36 Initial Environmental Examination Fire Management The firefighting facilities such as fire hose reel, fire extinguishers, fire blanket are installed at strategic places at the resort. The fire drill is planned to organize regularly at the resort. An emergency evacuation plan is developed so as to quickly response in case of fire accident. This emergency evacuation plan can be found in appendix 6. In addition, all rooms and offices are equipped with smoke detectors. The kitchen also has heat detectors which are connected to the addressable fire panel located at the reception area and it is manned 24 hours. Resource Conservation Technology It is the intention of the developers to employ resource saving methods and technologies. Someof these are listed below. Rooms  Air conditioning savings A/C will switch off automatically once the guest left the room. A/C self-adjusts to the minimum when no presence of person is detected in the room.  Use of fluorescent bulbs  Lights will switch off automatically when there are no people inside the room.  Water tank in toilet will use water saving device 3/6 liters per flush.  Faucets will be of low water consumption.  Guests will be encouraged to reuse towels as part of the ecological laundry policy,thereby saving water and detergents.  Use of biodegradable soaps in rooms.  Power saver installed Hotel  Reuse of treated sewage effluent for irrigation of the grounds.  Residual warm water from the A/C system will be reused to warm up the running water.  Use of environmental friendly (phosphate free) detergents in the laundry.  All outdoor areas will be provided with electronic switching devices to ensure that lightsare turned off during daylight hours.  Widespread use of low consumption fluorescent bulbs. 37 Initial Environmental Examination 5.6.

The project site is situated on eastern bank of Inlay Lake, lying on western side of Nyaungshwe – Nampan motor road, about 11km south of Nyaungshwe. Nyaungshwe Township share the borders with Taunggyi township in the north, Taunggyi and Sesaing townships in the east, Pehkon township in the south and Kalaw and Pinlaung townships in the west. The proposed resort area 1.25 ha is totally situated inside the boundary of Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. In general, the area is a narrow valley between hills in the east and Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary in the west, with average elevation of 884 m above sea level. Dominant forest type of the area includes low Indaing and hill forests. Landscape is beautifully dotted by hills, sporadic forests, shifting cultivation sites, paddy fields, small scattered villages, Inlay Lake with floating islands, hotels and resorts. The Red Earths and Yellow Earth soils (Acrisol) are the most dominating soils of the land area. The Shan Plateau is about completely covered with these soils. The Yellow Earths occur on the level lower slopes and they occupy a relatively small area, changing the Red Earths down the slopes. The Red Earths have a very deep profile having the texture varying sandy and silty to silty clay loam and with good structure. They are well drained and easy to plough. However inside the unique wetland ecosystem of Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, Gley Swampy Soil is dominant with seasonally inundated grass/ marsh lands. There is no major river or stream passing through the area. The Inlay Lake, seasonally average about 19 km long, 8.0 km wide and 3.6 m deep and its tributaries is the only natural water collection site of the area. The total area of its drainage basin is 3700 km2 and is a major source of hydro electrical power for southern Myanmar, specifically for Law-Pi-Ta hydroelectric power plant. Nyaungshwe is the common entry point to the area. It is 430 miles away from Yangon by car. Shwenyaung train station which is about 10 miles north of Nyaungshwe is 320 miles away from Yangon by train. Shwenyaung to Nyaungshwe is about 10 miles by car. Nearest airport is Heho Airport and it is about 14 miles from Nyaungshwe by car. 41 Initial Environmental Examination Figure 6: Sanctum Inle Resort Hotel and Surrounding Area Climate: Myanmar’s climate is greatly influenced by the tropical monsoon circulating system and it also effect the Shan Plateau. It has three distinct seasons; summer, rainy, and winter seasons. Nyaungshwe has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cwa). Temperatures are comfortably warm throughout the year, although the winter months (December–February) are milder and nights can be quite cool. It is commonly believed that the local weather is one of the nicest in the whole country. The average annual high temperature is 24.6°C and average annual low temperature is 13.8°C. The average annual rainfall of the area is 1,555 mm. The driest month is January with almost no precipitation. Most precipitation falls in August, with an average of 330 mm. The warmest month of the year is April with an average high temperature of 29 °C. In January, the average low temperature accounts only 7 °C and it is the coldest month of whole year round. The difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is about 325 mm. The average high temperature varies during the year by 7 °C.The best time of the year to visit the area is during September and October.The summer of 2010 was registered as very high temperatures, dropping the water level of the Inlay Lake to the lowest in nearly 50 years. 42 Initial Environmental Examination Air Quality: The ambient air quality measured at the perimeter of the proposed project area can provide some indication of the air quality within the project area. The range of various pollutant levels measured at the perimeter of the proposed project during the month of August are presented in Table 6 below.

Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary is a wetland sanctuary and located in Nyaungshwe, Pinlaung and Peh Kon Townships of Southern Shan State. The proposed resort is situated in the Territory of Nyaungshwe Township. The Sanctuary was established in 1985 and designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003. It recently covers an area of 556 km2. Inlay 47 Initial Environmental Examination Lake, situated in the heart of the Sanctuary, covering average water body area of about 88 km², with significant geographical conditions is the second largest fresh water lake of Myanmar. The objectives of Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary are: • To conserve and protect wetland ecosystem; the natural vegetation, wetland birds and fresh water fishes of the Sanctuary • To conserve geological features and scenic beauty of mountain areas • To conserve Inlay watershed and maintain water resource for Law-Pi-Ta hydroelectric power plant • To conserve and educate the local people in traditional floating agriculture practiced by In lake-dwellers • To upgrade the Sanctuary so as to promote ecotourism Total 255 woodland birds, 90 wetland birds, 59 fish species, 3 turtle species, 94 butterfly species, 25 amphibian and reptile species and several plant species including 184 orchid, 41 wetland tree species, 11 bamboo species, 527 medicinal plant species and 12 algae species are recorded in this wetland sanctuary (FD, 2014).It is also home for different ethnic groups, namely Intha, Shan, Pa Oo and Da Nu. There are altogether 281 villages situated inside the Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, 262 villages in Nyaungshwe Township territory, 3 villages in Pinlaung Township territory and 16 villages in Pehkon Township territory. The unique traditional style of leg rowing, fishing, floating market, floating vegetation, boat racing, and handicrafts of Intha are amazing for all. 48 Initial Environmental Examination Inle Lake view from the boat Floating vegetation at Inle Lake Birds at Inle Lake Dwindling population of Inlecypris (Local name Nga-Phein) Vulnerable species Cirus crane found at Inle Lake Figure 9: Ecological Resources in Inlay Lake 49 Initial Environmental Examination Table 11: Ecological Resources and its Existing Conditions Ecological Resources Existing condition Protected areas Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary established in 1985 and designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park in 2003, covers an area of 556 km2. It is an ecotourism, mainly bird watching and birding site. In the core area, a two-storey bird watching house was established by the Forest Department Forests East Inlay Reserved Forest, 218 km2 West Inlay Protected Public Forest, 142km2 Total forest area 360 km2, about 25% of the whole Nyaungshwe Township area of 1,452 km2. Dominant forest types are low Indaing forest and hill forest Major tree species of the forests are teak (Tectona grandis), Coral (Erythrina crista), Kusum Ceylon oak ( Schleichera oleosa), Emblic myrobalan (Emblica officinalis), Chapalish (Artocarpus calophyla), Civit (Swintonisa floribunda) and Pine (Pinus spp.) The common mammals found in these forests are Barking Deer (Muntiacus Rafinesque), Asiatic Jackal (Canis Aureus), Pangolins (Manis Pentadaetyla), Common pulm civet (Paradexurus hermaphrodites) and Common Otter (Lutra lutra). Fisheries, aquatic biology The Inlay Lake, seasonally average about 19 km long, 8 km wide and 3.67 m deep and its tributaries constitutes a significant wetland ecosystem in the area. The total area of its drainage basin is 3,700 km2 and is a major source of hydro electrical power for southern Myanmar, specifically for LawPi-Ta hydroelectric power plant. Native aquatic plants include pondweed, coontail, bladder wort, stone wort, muster grass, and elephant grass. Pondweed is used as a food source by both people and fish. Elephant grass, known locally as Kaing is important in the structure of floating island for agriculture, as well as weaving mats. Water hyacinth, known as Baeda, is useful for floating land. Five fish families inhabit Inle water. They are mainly carp, catfish, murrel and also an endemic cyprinid. Intha fishermen 50 Initial Environmental Examination harvest the carp with conical net stretched over wood and bamboo frames. A variety of harpoons are employed to spear fishes. The Inle carp, known as Nga-Phane plays an important role in the food supply to the area people. Wildlife Inle is rich in birdlife. 254 bird species have been recorded there. Highlights would be rare Jerdon's Bushchat, Whitetailed Stonechat, Collared Myna, Black-collared Starling, rare Sarus Crane, Glossy Ibis, Ferruginous Pochard, Spot-billed Duck, Garganey, Pheasant-tailed Jacana, Black-winged Stilt, Sandpipers, Sooty-headed Bulbul, Crimson Sunbird, Clamorous Reed Warbler, Red Avadavat and Yellowbreasted Bunting. And also breeding or roosting colonies of Little, Cattle, Intermediate and Great Egrets, Chinese Pond, Indian Pond and Black-crowned Night Herons, Vinousbreasted, Black-collared, Chestnut-tailed and Asian Pied Starlings, Collared, Jungle, White-vented and Common Mynas would be seen in this Myanmar (Burma) ecotourism, birds watching and birding site.

Township economy is traditionally based on agriculture (including ﬂoating garden agriculture inside the Inlay Lake), fishing, forestry and cottage industries. Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary, established in 1985 and later in 2003 designated as an ASEAN Heritage Park is the second largest fresh water lake in Myanmar and one of the best eco-tourism sites of the country. It is internationally famous for its unique wetland ecosystem, geological features and scenic beauty of surrounding mountains. The traditional living style of indigenous ethnic groups namely Intha, Shan, Pa Oo and Da Nu such as one leg-rowers, fishing with conical net stretched over wooden and bamboo frames, floating market and floating agriculture added its attractions. Exploration the life styles and cottage industries (such as traditional weaving and silver smith) of villages in the region by boat is a great pleasure and regular trip for most of the visitors. Experience of interacting with endemic people, including Padaung tribes who continue the practice of ringed neck is of special and exciting moment for both local and international visitors. Inle may be visited all the year round, but the best time for migratory birds and trekking activities is from November to May. In addition to observation of rare birds, aquatic plants and animals, butterflies and doing trekking, visitors can also pay homage to historical pagodas, such as Phaung Daw Oo, Alowdaw Pauk, Shwe In Daing, Taung Do around the lake and many other pagodas on the surrounding hills. The ceremonial Phaung Daw Oo Festival, which lasts for almost three weeks, is closely followed by the Thadingyut festival of lights. Intha and Shan turn out in their best clothes in great numbers to celebrate the Buddhist Lent. Traditional boat racing, with dozens of leg-rowers in Shan dress in a team on each boat, is a famous event during the PhaungDawOopagoda Festival. This unique situation has led to significant development of hotel and tourism infrastructure. In combination with government’s democratic transition policy, many small and large privately owned hotels and tour operations have arisen in the area during the past few years. Roads are being improved, nearby Heho airport is being extended and local shops are flooded with consumer items of both local and foreign, thus increased job opportunities for local residents. There are about 40 hotels and resorts already developed in and around the Inlay Lake and the number increased to nearly 100 for the whole Nyaungshwe Township. Construction of new Inlay Hotel Zone,on 620 acres (2.5 km2) of land between Kanbe and Chaungpa villages, 15 miles south to Nyaungshwe, on the east side of NyaungshweNampan-Loikaw Road is being underway.In brief, Nyaungshwe/ Inlay/ Heho basin is a potentially booming and vibrant area for ecotourism investors from all around the world. On the other hand, due to growing population, unsustainable means of land utilization and agriculture, poor living conditions, declining of watershed forests, erosion and siltation, the lake is getting narrow and consequently threatening 54 Initial Environmental Examination the existence of whole ecosystem including local communities. It is urgently required to work together in harmony among government, local people, investors and NGOs-INGOs, to keep the lake and its ecosystem clean, pleasant and sustainable and to prevent against any environmental disturbances. Transportation: There have been relatively good high-way connections to Nyaungshwe from major cities of the country such as Taunggyi, Mandalay, Naypitaw and Yangon. Nyaungshwe is 690 km away from Yangon and 330 km away from Mandalay by car. Shwenyaung train station which is about 16 km north of Nyaungshwe is 514 km away from Yangon by train. Shwenyaung to Nyaungshwe is about 16 km by car. Nearest airport is Heho Airport and it is about 22 km from Nyaungshwe by car. Daily flight services are available from Heho airport to major cities of the county particular Yangon and Mandalay. Yangon and Mandalay international airport is the main entry points for most of the foreign visitors coming to Heho/Nyaungshwe/ Taunggyi area. Public transport bus lines and taxi services are also available in the town. Electrical Power Source: Within NyaungshweInlay area, including new Inlay Hotel Zone, electricity is mainly supplied from the National Grid arranged by the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP) and Myanmar Electricity Power Enterprise (MEPE). As new power supply plans and projects are being under way, there is a great tendency for improvement of power supply in the area in the near future. Currently, local people and businesses including hotels/resorts used to keep backup generators in case of power dropouts. 6.4. Social and Cultural Resources Population and Communities Nyaungshwe, a small town about 3 kilometers north of Inle Lake is administratively belongs to Taunggyi District, Southern Shan State of Myanmar. The township is composed of eight wards in the town and 444 villages. According to 2014 census report, whole population of Nyaungshwe Township is 188,602, with a population density of 129 per square kilometer. Original local communities have settled in the area since time immemorial and most of them are farmers, fishermen, traders, businessmen and small and median enterprise owners. Few of them work as government staff, military personnel and company/NGOs staff. There are also some new comers from other parts of the nation mostly related to hotel and tourism business, NGOs and INGOs. Nyaungshwe is the tourist hub for visiting Inle Lake and Inlay Lake Wetland Sanctuary. It consists of one main thoroughfare with numerous side streets and a few parallel roads. The main street has numerous shops, several restaurants, a few stupas, travel agencies and a market. The town serves as a marina for the numerous long boats carrying tourists into the lake. The lake itself is located a few kilometers south through a river channel. 55 Initial Environmental Examination There are about 40 hotels and resorts in and around the Inlay Lake and total about 100 in wholeNyaungshwe Township. Construction of new Inlay Hotel Zone, on 2.5 km2 of land between Kanbe and Chaungpa villages, 24 km south to Nyaungshwe, on the east side of NyaungshweNampan-Loikaw Road is being underway. Most of the hotels/ resorts in and around the Inlay Lake are constructed in large compounds and far form settlement areas. Manmade water ways are usually constructed by developers to get boat access form Inlay Lake to lake-side hotels/resorts passing through seasonally inundated grass/ marsh land. Nearest settlement areas of the proposed Sanctum Inle Resort site are Maingthauk Village about 0.81 km north with a population of (255) and Pay-pin-inn village about half mile south west with a population of (211). Health Facilities Nyaungshwe Township Government Hospital, 25 bedded is the nearest public hospital from proposed resort site. In addition, there is a government health center in Maingthauk village only about half mile north of resort site. There are also private/NGO clinics in Nyaungshwe town and most of large villages. Local communities still rely on traditional Myanmar and Shan herbal medicines and a number of traditional medical experts and their clinics are also found in the area. The nearby towns of Sesaing, Pehkon, Kalaw and Pinlaung also have public township level hospitals. In serious/emergency cases, local inhabitants used to go to Taunggyi and take treatments at Taunggyi General Hospital and many other private hospitals. Education Facilities Education level of the local residents is relatively low. There are altogether 239 basic education schools in the township mostly run by the Ministry of Education, 4 high schools, 21 middle schools, 213 primary schools and 1 monastic school. Primary education is accessible for most of the inhabitants, but access to middle school and high school education is still limited for many young people living in small villages. Nearest education center to the proposed Sanctum Inle Resort site is Maingthauk village high school. There is no college/university level education center in Nyaungshwe Township. After matriculation, most of the students who want to get higher education have to go to large cities such as Taunggyi, Mandalay and Yangon. As the township has developed together with eco-tourism business, more and more pre-primary schools and child-day-care centers are being appeared in towns and villages as well. 56 Initial Environmental Examination 7. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures The development of this project could necessarily bring changes in the local environment in terms of physical, biological and socio-economic aspects. The impacts generated are both beneficial as well as adverse. Based on the analysis of environmental baseline information and activities that are to be performed by the project, the possible environmental impacts are identified. Most of the identified impacts have been quantified to the extent possible on the value judgment. Each of the environmental issues has been examined in terms of their current condition, likely impacts during construction and subsequent operation and abandonment phases. The impacts have been predicted in terms of environmental impact and business impact of the proposed project activities. The impacts on the environment from various activities of the project can be categorized as follows: Impact on Environmental Resource  Impact on Air Quality  Impact on Noise Levels  Impact on Surface and Ground Water Quality  Impact on Soil/Land use extent Impact on Ecological Resources  Impact on Terrestrial Habitat and Biodiversity Impact on Human Environment  Health and Safety  Socio-economics  Security Waste Disposal  Solid waste disposal  Liquid waste disposal  Sanitary waste disposal 7.1. Impact on Environmental Resource Impact on Air Quality: It can be anticipated that a certain amount of dust particles be generated by earth moving activities during building construction such as bungalow, dining room, kitchen, power generator house, staff dormitory etc… and during offloading of earth materials. This situation will be worst during the drying season and during the afternoon when the trade winds 57 Initial Environmental Examination are most prevalent. Given the relative remoteness of the site, airborne particulates should not pose a hazard to residents in the vicinity or downwind of the construction site. The occurrence of dusting is periodic and short-term lasting for the duration of the construction activity.This impact on air quality can be mitigated by spraying water during the construction phase of the excavated areas especially during dry condition. Controlling speed and operation of construction vehicles could also reduce dust pollution. In the operation phase, emission of dust particles, CO2, SO2 and other greenhouse gas is due to transportation of delivered supplies to hotel by vehicle movements. This emission can be minimized by doing regular vehicles maintenance. Impact on Noise Level: During construction phase, the use of heavy equipment during site clearance and building construction works will inevitably generate noise, which may create a nuisance for nearby residents. Although annoying, this negative impact will be short-term (limited to the duration of the construction works) and is not considered to be a significant threat to the health or wellbeing of humans. Distance will help to ameliorate noises. In addition, construction activities that generate disturbing sounds should be restricted to normal working hours. Employees operating that generate noise should be equipped with noise protection gear. In the operation phase, it is noted that the section of the eastern main road is presently being upgraded and it is unlikely that the additional traffic induced by Sanctum Inle Resort Hotel will cause any undue congestion in the near term. During the decommissioning phase, there will be noise impact due to demolishing activities of hotel buildings and other facilities. However, this impact will be short-term. Impact on Surface and Ground Water Quality: During site preparation and construction phase, inadequate provision of toilets for use by workers can lead to ad hoc defecation in secluded areas on the site, thus creating of unsanitary conditions and sources of fly infestation. Improper disposal of leftover food and other domestic forms of construction garbage could lead to littering of the site and pollution of adjacent of Inle lake water. The improper siting of stockpiles and storage of sand, gravel, cement, etc., at the construction sites could lead to fine materials being washed away, during heavy rainfall events, into the drainage system and ultimately into the adjacent Inle Lake environment. This would not only represent a waste of materials but would also contribute to turbidity and sedimentation with consequent negative impacts on inshore Inle lake water quality and possibly the ecology of the wetland environment. Hazardous and flammable materials (e.g. paints, thinner, solvents, diesel etc.) improperly stored and handled on the site are potential health hazards for construction workers and spilled chemicals would have the potential to contaminate soil and inhibit plant growth in localized areas. It is anticipated that refueling or maintenance of large vehicles will take place on the 58 Initial Environmental Examination construction site and therefore there will be a requirement to store fuel and lubricants in a safe manner on the site. Safe storage areas should be identified and retaining structures put in place prior to the arrival and placement of material. During the operation phase, spilled chemical used for laundry service such as detergent, solid/liquid chlorine, pesticide would have the potential to pollute soil and water quality of Inle Lake. Hazardous chemicals (e.g. fuels) is stored in separate secured tanks in the generator house which is restricted to authorized personnel only and spill response kits are standby at the area. Impact on Soil and Land use extent: The construction of the resort will involve the erection of permanent concrete structures on what is essentially a green field site. This will result in a loss of the options for alternative land use and thus represents an irreversible commitment of land resources. The loss of optional uses for the wildlife sanctuary land in the future is considered to be a negative impact. In order to mitigate this impact, trees and plant will be conserved as much as possible on completion of the construction phase. Vegetation clearance, road construction and excavation works related to construction of the hotels and buildings will expose soils in the affected areas leaving them vulnerable to erosion by surface run-off and ultimately threaten adjacent Inle lake waters with high turbidity and sediment deposition, a negative consequence. The flat topography of the site would tend to reduce erosive surface flows and the threat of turbidity should exist only for the duration of construction works before landscaping and drainage works are put in place that would reduce the susceptibility to soil erosion. Ultimately, it is the wetland habitat that would be adversely affected by prolonged levels of high turbidity. Mitigation means will be to phase site clearance to the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the area of exposed soil at any given time, to re-cover exposed soils with grass and other appropriate species as soon as possible. Exposed soil will be temporarily bund and redirect flows from heavy runoff areas that threaten to erode or result in substantial surface runoff to adjacent Inle Lake waters. 7.2. Impact on Ecological Resources Impact on Terrestrial Habitat and Biodiversity: The clearing and removal of trees and vegetation during entrance road construction and the development of the resort will result in the loss of a significant part of the existing forest and, as a consequence, a reduction of habitat for wildlife species. In particular, the main concern relates to the loss of habitat for endangered and endemic species, especially the Sarus crane. Noise, vibrations, and intrusive activities related to construction works also will tend to scare away any animals remaining on the site after vegetation clearance. It is anticipated that low ecological impact would occur due to short term construction period. In order to mitigate these impacts, the original and natural forested condition of the site would be maintained and restored as much as possible. Site clearance should be carried out in a manner that retains the large trees while the building footprints are pegged out. Where possible bird 59 Initial Environmental Examination feeding trees should be retained and used in the landscaping of the resort properly. All construction workers and persons on site must be given specific instructions not to harm small animals including snakes but allow the animals to retreat into the forest. All construction contractors should be exposed to the environmental management plan and sensitized to the environmental issues. Detailed biodiversity management plan is available in section 12. 7.3. Impact on Human Health and Safety: Being a project of hotel/resort services, health, hygiene and safety of hotel employees and contractors is the most priority factor for Sanctum Inle Resort hotel. The developer, Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd believes that commitment on health and safety of its guests and employees is the most important parameter to make its business a great success. Hygiene, health and safety accidents and injuries such as cuts and amputations, electric shock, thermal burns, crushing injury from material handling/ falling objects or vehicle operation, fire hazards, headache and sickness due to poor ventilation or noise and small injuries due to slips and falls could happen during the construction, operation and dismantling phases as well. To avoid or minimize health and safety risks, Sanctum Inle Resort Company limited has carefully designed resort layout and safety plan in accordance with both Myanmar and international norm and standards of a 4-star hotel/resort. The plan includes assembly area, alarm system, first aid boxes, fire extinguishers, fire hose reels, sidewalks, escape routes, emergency exits, daily housekeeping and cleaning services on guest rooms, toilets, cafeteria, bar, kitchen, all public places (lobby, lounge, swimming pool, spa, reception etc.) and even outdoor greening and landscaping. Resort buildings will be designed and constructed in careful consideration of physical stability, structural load capacity, proper ventilation, lighting, fire prevention, sanitation and general safety issues, and shall comply with all relevant health and safety requirements, mainly issued by the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry and Ministry of Hotels and Tourism. To ensure and monitor the health and safety standards of the resort, one Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) coordinator is to be appointed. Regular trainings/instructions regarding safety aspects such as utilization of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements, guidelines for machine safety, guidelines for housekeeping/lighting/electricity, guidelines for sanitation/hygiene, guidelines for first aid and fire and emergency evacuation drill are to be given/imposed to all employees. Notice, warning and caution announcement or signs will be released to all guests and employees as necessary in accordance with basic health and safety guidelines for hotel/resort management as mentioned detailed in chapter 11, EMP of this report. For the health and emergency medical care of all resort guests and employees, the first aid kits will be kept ready at all public places of the resort and a limousine shall be kept 24-hour standby to send the injured guests/employees to the nearby hospitals or clinics within the few minutes, in 60 Initial Environmental Examination case if it is required. Regular medical checkups for employees will be provided and 6 monthly medical checkups will be given to catering personnel. In case of fire, all the guests and employees shall be evacuated systematically and as soon as possible. In cooperation with Nyaungshwe Township government fire brigade, fire drills shall conduct regularly and thirty young resort employees shall be trained and organized as volunteer firefighting group. Fire alarm system, fire hoses, fire extinguishers, escape routes and emergency exits shall be inspected regularly and followed by proper maintenance as necessary. To prevent electric shocks and hazards, two electrical maintenance staff (handyman) shall be assigned under engineering department to do regular inspections and take preventive measures. To prevent injuries and accidents caused by operating of machineries, proper Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as safety gloves, helmet, goggles, earmuffs etc., are to be provided as necessary. Poor housekeeping can be a contributing factor causing injuries, infections and illnesses leading to accidents and injuries such as slips and falls, falling objects, fires and property damages. To avoid/mitigate this, a housekeeping department with a manger and total strength of 26 experts and employees shall be developed to carry out regular and proper housekeeping, monitoring and prevention measures. Socio-economics: The proposed hotel/resort project is a100% investment by a Sanctum Inle Resort Co., Ltd. Total authorized investment plan of the company for resort project is MMK 10,000 million. Upon completion of construction and installation of necessary equipment, Sanctum Inle Resort Com., Ltd aims to operate international standard four stars lake side resort for maximum 70 years, inside the vicinity of internationally known ASEAN Heritage Park of Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. This investment aims to contribute development of hotel and tourism business in the area and to boost local employment opportunities and consequently the socioeconomic development of local communities. During the 2-year construction phase, local technicians and general workers will be employed, estimated average about 50-100 labors per day. In the operation phase of maximum 70 years, hotel needs to employ maximum 145 employees (technicians, experts and workers) of all Myanmar nationals, out of which more than 70% will be local inhabitants. By working together with and by getting trainings from experienced managers, experts and technicians of Sanctum Inle Resort Com., Ltd, local inhabitants will get opportunities to improve their skills in hotel and tourism business and thus contribute the capacity building of local citizens. Similar job opportunities as construction phase will again happen in dismantling phase. In addition, after tax exemption period of first 5-year, hotel shall pay income tax (25% of gross operating profit) and commercial tax (5 % of total revenue) to the Government of the Republic of 61 Initial Environmental Examination the Union of Myanmar. Therefore, the proposed investment shall bring long-term opportunities for socio-economic development of local communities and the nation as a whole. Security: The need for security can never be overemphasized whether personal or for property. During construction, security is very important in any site. This ensures that materials are in order. It also controls movement within the site especially for the intruders who might be injured by the materials and other hazardous features available within the site. Security is also of paramount importance during the operational phase of the project such as: Enclose the site using suitable walls to beef-up security and to control movement as proposed in the design and employ security guards who must always guard the site/property and document movements on the site/ property Strategically install lighting as well as security alarms 7.4. Waste Disposal Solid Waste Disposal: Construction and decommissioning activities contribute to increased solid wastes including stones, wood, glasses, plastics, containers, metal rods, pieces of iron sheets, sharp objects (nails) etc.. These wastes will be collected and empty day to day basis to avoid any undesirable working condition and environmental impacts. Based on their different waste types, these solid wastes will be collected and segregated in their dedicated rubbish bins, and regular and proper disposal will be done in accordance with Nyaungshwe Township Municipality guidelines. In the operation phase, major solid wastes will be generated form daily room cleaning, kitchen, bar, restaurant, cafeteria, souvenir desk, reception/office and staff quarters. Different kinds of solid wastes, such as tissue paper, food residues (organic wastes), glasses, tins, bottles, packing materials, stationeries, damaged/expired devices or appliances and other miscellaneous will be generated every day. All these solid wastes will be collected separately in standard garbage bins based on their types and wet and dry status. Disposal of these collected wastes shall be done in accordance with Nyaungshwe Township Municipality guidelines, in such a manner to avoid the creation of health risks and to maintain proper sanitary conditions in and around the resort area. Various waste such as solid wastes and effluents will be generated during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases. Solid wastes generated will be segregated according to the figure. 62 Initial Environmental Examination Fig 11: Composition of Waste generated by the Hotel The waste bins and waste containers will be placed at the premises of each department. These organic/inorganic wastes will be collected and stored at the temporary waste storage area at the project site. And then, these wastes will be recycled, or placed at local land fill for disposal within the project site.

It has planned to use readymade, pre-cut, pre-designed materials in construction. No liquid waste with significant extent and adverse impacts on surrounding environment is expected in construction and decommissioning phases. In addition, to avoid unnecessary crowd, dirt, wastes (including liquid wastes) and smell inside the resort area, developer has planned to construct tube wells and water treatment plant, staff dormitory, laundry, store, transformer and generator houses and car parking on its purchased land, situated outside of the boundary of Inlay Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. The resort shall also establish standard maintenance house for vehicles, machines and equipment and oil and lubricant storage facility on the land outside of resort site. Machines, equipment and vehicles maintenance and handling of oil and lubricants shall carry out with special care by trained technicians and experts to avoid any kind of oil, fuel and liquid wastes contamination into the surrounding environment particularly into the Inlay Lake. During the operation phase, all resort guests and over 100 employees will use toilet facilities, kitchen, bar, restaurant, cafeteria, swimming pool and washing machines in daily basis. Two different types of liquid wastes are expected, used water (grey water) and swear form toilets. All the used water (grey water) which may include cleaning agents, disinfectants, and linen washing agents will be collected through separated channels or pipe lines into waste water treatment plant. Proper treatments will be given there before discharge in accordance with Nyaungshwe Township municipality guidelines. To ensure zero contamination or seepage by toilet wastes, resort will use two types of toilet waste management system: three-step septic type toilet system for the main entrance building which is planned to construct on higher ground and bio-tank sewer disposed system for cottages on lower ground. Bio-tank system will contain 3 different steps/chambers of clean-up mechanism, in the first chamber the sewer coming from toilets will be disinfected using microbio-organisms, second chamber will work as sludge sedimentation tank and last chamber with evaporation funnel will store the liquids. Detailed design and function of the Bio-tank is attached as appendix4. Special cautions and regular monitoring shall be taken to make sure that the septic tanks and bio-tanks are not overloaded. Resort shall also comply with Nyaungshwe Township municipality guidelines for proper disposal of all liquid wastes to avoid any contaminations and hazards by wastewater and sewages into the Inlay lake and wetland ecosystem. Resort design also include to conserve all existing trees of the area and to conduct pleasant landscaping for recreation on all remaining areas (about 2 acres) of the resort site. The biological engineering techniques will be applied using grass, bamboos, step by step hedgerows vegetation and evergreen tree species to keep the resort area clean, fresh and green, and also to prevent sedimentations and waste water seepages into the Inlay Lake. 65 Initial Environmental Examination Fig 12: Layout Plan with Rainfall Runoff Streams and AME 300 Fig 13: Photos of Sanctum Inle Resort 66 Initial Environmental Examination 8.

Distinguished guests and participants! The purpose of today meeting is to inform the concerned people about the potential environment and social impacts, the mitigation measures and the monitoring programs of the hotel projects which are already completed and are being under construction. 105 Initial Environmental Examination With regard to the presentation presented in this meeting, suggestions and opinions from the participants will also be taken. I would like to explain a little bit about the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) process. IEE is the mandatory process to be implemented so as to know the potential impacts related to the projects. In order to perform the nation’s development, it is crucial to establish the international standard hotels for the development of hotel and tourism sector of the country. When constructing these hotels, we will have the benefits of the development of the nation, the employment opportunity for the local communities and the development of the tourism industry. In addition, environment could be impacted because of these projects activities. These projects are to be constructed in accordance with the international regulations and the existing environmental conservation laws which have been promulgated by the government in order to consider potential environmental impact in the business and investment. Therefore, I would like to request all the participants to give constructive suggestions so as to minimize the environmental impacts when performing nation’s development works. Thank you. Explaining the objectives of conducting environmental impact assessment by DawSein Ma Ma, Director Environmental Conservation Department, Taunggyi: I would like to present the environmental policy, strategies, laws and procedures regarding the Initial Environmental Examination of 12 hotels in today meeting organized by third party. If we conduct a business, there is a prerequisite activity to be conducted by a business person. We must follow the existing law. If not, action will be taken. According to article 14, Environmental Conservation Law, a person causing a point source of pollution shall treat, emit, discharge and deposit the substances which cause pollution in the environment in accord with stipulated environmental quality standards. When performing development for the country, it is necessary to minimize the environment and social impact as low as possible. The monitoring programs are to be performed in line with article 15 and to follow up the action in accordance with the instructions provided in article 16 of environmental conservation law. In order to monitor, control, manage, reduce or eliminate environmental pollution, on-site facility of controlling equipment shall be installed or used. According to article 54 of Environmental Conservation Rule, the business would carry out the environmental impact assessment for his plan, business or activity and submit the environmental impact assessment report to the Ministry. In accordance with article 55, the environmental management plan is to be submitted to the Ministry and the environmental impact assessment is to be conducted by a qualified third person or organization accepted by the Ministry. In article 57, the Ministry shall determine and decide, after making scrutiny, whether or not the third party person or organization is suitable to carry out the environmental impact assessment. The initial environmental examination shall include the detailed description of the project, details of the project proponent, Term and conditions of the third party organization who will conduct the environmental impact assessment, description 106 Initial Environmental Examination of the project environment, the potential environmental impacts, public consultation and information disclosure, the mitigation measures, conclusion of initial environmental examination, the environmental management plan (EMP), resource and responsible personnel to conduct EMP and funding for this environmental management plan implementation,. I will explain in details the environmental impact assessment process. Presenting the implementation works of hotel projects by U MyoThet Tin, Consultant (Social) of E Guard Environmental Services Co., Ltd: He presented the location, area and the facts about the project. Explanation of Initial Environmental Examination by U Tin Aung Moe, Director E Guard Environmental Services Co., Ltd: He explained about the location, area and the plants and animal species of Inle Lake Wildlife Sanctuary. He discussed in details about the adverse and positive environmental impacts during construction, operation and abandonment phase of 12 hotels projects and the employment opportunities in order to fulfill the requirement of the staffs of 12 hotels. He also mentioned the air quality, noise, water quality, pollution, health and safety of guests and employees, socio-economics, sewage system due to wastewater disposal. Monitoring and mitigation measures to minimize the environmental impacts are also highlighted. He explained about the biodiversity management plan developed for the hotel projects. In order to appear the responsible eco-tourism society in and around of Inle lake hotels, he highlighted the need of consensus effort by the 12 hotels in the environmental conservation. Questions and Answers by the participants: (Q) U Win Myint, Minister, Shan state provincial government: When did the land lease agreement for hotel construction sign and how much is the rate? Regarding the environment, I know that the duration is between 30 and 50 years. Therefore 70 years is too long. It needs to be reevaluated. The date of contract should be informed to the local community in a transparent manner. (A) DawTheingi Win, Director, and Amata Hotel: The contract has been signed with Forest Department at the registration office, NyaungShwe Township. According to the MIC regulation, the duration is 50 years. It is extendable up to 2 terms maximum. Each term has 10 years. (A) Daw Tin Tin Yee, Managing Director (ANN Heritage): Our hotel has signed the contract since 2002. The condition of permit for 12 hotels is not the same and the year of contract as well. Permit which requires prior submission is granted only after going through several scrutiny and approvals made by the Ministry of Hotel and Tourism and MIC. (Q) U AungKyi Win, Provincial Parliament Representative, NyaungShwe Township: There is neither Inle Lake authority nor Inle Lake protection law. Although 12 prohibitions rules are adopted and implemented, if the authority allows the area as a special economic development 107 Initial Environmental Examination region, there is no opportunity for the local people. Why do Hotels receive permission while local people are prohibited to extend land area? Local people should have this opportunity. (A) Daw Tin Tin Yee (Ann Heritage): Hotel and Tourism Department reevaluated the situation and issued the permit due to the fact that accommodations are inadequate for the visitors. This may be because of the necessity of the state and the hotel and the tourism industry as well. (Q)One local residence: We are glad that donations are provided by the hotels. As far as I know, local people are to be informed about the initial environmental examination of the project according to MIC regulation. Is there such program or not? Donation is just for the charity or for the community development? If it is for the community development, it is one time event during 50 years? E Guard said that existing trees are to be conserved and replanted. Where are the locations to conserve and replant those trees? How hotels will do to restore the damaged environment? (A) U Tin Aung Moe, Director, E Guard: Information is not provided to local people due to the fact that these hotels received permissions very early. The present-day Hotels have to inform to the local people. In addition, environmental management plan are to be developed. There is a section in EMP mentioning to perform local development and national development. There is a Corporate Social Responsibility program in the EMP. Therefore, donations are not once for all events. There will be such event in the future. By doing landscaping in the areas where the hotel land is connected to the Inle Lake, the environment will be conserved one way or another. (Q) Suggestion from one local residence: How can we observe the donations? For those hotels which have total 20 or 30 acres of land should implement community forestry (CF) plantation. (A) Daw Tin Tin Yee (Ann Heritage lodge): If the authority provides the community forestry, we are ready to implement. (A) DawKhinHtwe Than, HR and Admin Manger (Pristine Lotus): We have plans to coordinate with the organizations from neighboring villages. We have donated poles for floating land which worth 7 million kyats. It is still ongoing. For CSR programs, the monthly funds are spared to support the nearby villages. We have collaboration with Irrigation department for the floating land. We have planned to collect garbage to have a clean environment. (A) U AungKoKo, General Manger (Villa Inle): Existing trees are maintained. You can come and check. Our hotel is constructed based on nature. (Q) U Win Naing, Pe Pin Kone Village, MaingThuak Village: There are frequent disputes on land. Compensation is settled with Aureum Palace hotel. It is a mess that floating lands are abandoned. How can we solve it? I would like to know how Asia Green is cleaning the water way? 108 Initial Environmental Examination (A) Dr. U TunAung (Shan state, Parliament Representative-1): Only one EIA and SIA should be conducted for all Inle Lake hotels. Wastewater from hotels is being discharged in the NyaungShwe creek. Therefore, I would like to suggest that hotels should take responsibility. Hotels should improve the transportation. I would like to know that legal actions are immediately taken for the discharged? Why there are only 12 hotels and not all the others? (A)Daw Tin Tin Ye (Ann heritage Lodge): This is because permission granted by Forest Department and MIC is not the same. (A) U ThetTun, Chairman, Innthar Literature and Civilization organization: Regarding Land ownership and Land registration, Authorities and concerned department are to be officially informed and defined the area. (A) U KyawZawHla, Township General Administration officer, we will send our team to measure the land due to bank erosion issues. We are doing everything after thorough scrutiny. (Q) U ThetTun, Chairman, Innthar Literature and Civilization organization: we would like to know the contact phone number. (A) DawSein Ma Ma: Legal actions can be taken if the discharged are from the hotels according to article (14) of Environmental Conservation Law. (A) U Tin AUng Moe: Suggestions are recorded and will be presented. The approved IEE report will be accessible to interested parties and general public through Township Admin office, ECD office, Yangon Region and MOECAF Naypyitaw office. 109 Initial Environmental Examination 12. Biodiversity Management Plan Biodiversity is essential for human life. It provides human society with many important benefits and services. These services are collectively termed as environmental services. They are 1) provisional services: food, fresh water, fuel and materials, 2) regulating services: climate regulation, flood control, disease regulation and water purification, 3) cultural services: aesthetic, spiritual, educational and recreational benefits and 4) supporting services: biomass production, soil formation, nutrient cycling and provision of habitats. Although biodiversity is providing these valuable services, human activities are causing tremendous damage to ecosystems and species around the world. There are a number of reasons for the overall loss of biodiversity that we now face, including climate change, habitat conversion, invasive species, overexploitation and pollution. A hotel impacts biodiversity at each stage of its life cycle, from planning through to closure. At the construction state, impact is determined by the size and location of the area cleared for development and where construction activities are taking place, the choice of construction methods, the sources and amount and type of materials, water and energy used to build the hotel, the location of temporary camps for construction workers, inadequate storage facilities for construction materials, the amount of construction waste that has to be disposed of, and other types of damage such as surface soil erosion or, compaction caused by construction activities or disruption of natural water flows and drainage patterns. In the operational stage, a hotel’s impact comes mainly from the energy, water, food and other resources that are consumed in running the hotel, by the solid and liquid wastes it produces, by the way its grounds are managed, and by the direct impacts of its guests. In addition, regular renovation and replacement of furniture, appliances and facilities can cause impacts through purchasing choices and increased waste generation. Using energy and water more efficiently, using organic and sustainably produced food, reducing, treating and disposing of waste appropriately, making sustainable purchasing decisions and managing gardens with natural-style plantings can all help a hotel to reduce its adverse impacts on biodiversity. Similarly, a hotel’s relationship with host communities not only affects the sustainable operations of the hotel but also the use of environmental resources by communities themselves. Biodiversity resources are used in every area of a hotel, from restaurants to guest rooms to gardens. The following action plan has been developed to mitigate the biodiversity impacts caused by hotel. 110 Initial Environmental Examination Table 20: Biodiversity Management Plan Biodiversity Management Management Activities Frequency Cost Responsible Management Objectives /Timing (USD) Person/Unit Area Hotel Seeking sustainable Internally: restaurants sources of food  Avoid purchasing species that are locally, Continuous No extra Sanctum Inle supplies, especially of regionally or globally depleted, except from observation cost Resort Hotel endemic fish, sustainable sources.

Hotel can also green its roofs and walls, which will also have a positive energy savings effect.  Encourage wildlife in the hotel grounds. For example, consider creating a wildlife garden, or in small urban spaces provide suitable nesting places for birds and nesting boxes and/or grow plants attractive to butterflies. Where possible, set aside land as natural areas or reserves; even small areas can be valuable for wildlife.  Work with local wildlife experts to ensure that hotel lighting does not adversely affect wildlife, particularly if the hotel is situated near sensitive wildlife sites. Use lighting equipment that minimizes the upward spread of light near to and above the horizontal (e.g. by using cowlings that direct light downwards). Locate lights to reduce stray light and glare to a minimum; away from buildings, luminance should not exceed five candela per square meter (Cd/m2).  Use sound insulation and reduce noise at source, to limit disturbance to wildlife.  In partnership with public authorities and local organizations  Consult with local conservation organizations, universities or botanical gardens in the design of a biodiversity-friendly garden or hotel grounds.  Develop explanatory signs on the various species, in partnership with local conservation organizations.  Engage local teachers, conservation organizations, universities or botanical gardens 117 Initial Environmental Examination in developing nature trails and biodiversity edutainment (education + entertainment) activities for children and their families, e.g. a game to explore and discover different aspects of biodiversity in and around the hotel.  Encourage use of local indigenous species and incorporation of wildlife areas in gardens and public areas.  Support programs to eradicate alien invasive species.  Support the development of local biodiversity businesses, such as indigenous tree nurseries, and incorporate the products of these businesses in your supply chain.

The main aim of the study is to identify the major environmental impacts due to implementation of the project activities in all three phases (construction phase, operation phase and decommissioning phase). The primary and secondary data were used to assess the environmental impacts. The potential environmental impacts were assessed in a comprehensive and scientific screening procedure. The report has provided a full picture of all potential environmental impacts associated with proposed hotel, and recommended suitable prevention and mitigation measures. The results after scoring evaluation of significant environmental impacts can be summarized as follows: Table 21: Summary of Impacts Significance Level of Significance No. of Impacts Positive Impact 4 No Significant Impact 29 Low Impact 6 Significant Impact Unsustainable Situations There will be positive impacts as the proposed project will generate local employment opportunity to enhance their capabilities and work skills. As a result, their socio-economic conditions will be improved. Because of the hotel business, government will also benefit a certain amount of revenue. After replanting and landscaping are carried out, soil cover of the resort will be rehabilitated and habitat will be restored. In all phases of the project, a few low impacts are observed whereas no significant impacts and unsustainable situations are identified. Only (29) non-significant environmental impacts are found out. For construction and decommissioning phases, all non-significant impacts recorded are minor or no significant environmental impacts such as dust particles dispersion, noise, waste generation, water pollution and potential health and safety impacts on employees such as accidents. All these impacts are minimal, short term, limited to the site and controllable. Evaluation results show that there are non-significant environmental impacts on operation phase. However, there is environmental impact with low significant which is water resource depletion due to domestic water consumption from the tube well. That must be addressed by installing water meter and water saving equipment for control of water use. There is also low significant environmental impact 123 Initial Environmental Examination due to discharging of sewage and litter to the nearby Inle Lake which must be mitigated by adopting no waste discharge to Inle Lake policy, installing sewage treatment plant and developing proper waste segregation and disposal system. During the operation phase, there is potential discharge to environment such as detergent, liquid chlorine/tablets, cleaning agents due to the use of chemical products for cleaning, laundry, swimming pool and spa. This must be addressed by using secondary containment to avoid accidental leakage and spills. In addition, there is a low significance impact which is noise and atmospheric emission due to traffic/vehicle movement during loading and unloading of supplied goods which must be taken care of by conducting regular noise and air monitoring survey, use of proper PPEs and regular vehicle maintenance. Regarding health and safety impacts, there will be a numbers of risks such as car accidents during transportation, use of equipment and machines, probable electric shock hazard, fires and safety hazards such as falls from height, slips, trips and falls, falling objectives, manual handling, repetitive strain injuries etc… during the construction, operation and decommissioning phases. There are preventive measures already planned to reduce the risk of fire and also the machines to be provided are new with modernized technology including machine guards. Therefore the probability of accidents and electrical shocks are low. There are a number of actions to be done to mitigate the risks such as providing safety awareness training, first aid, free medicine, transport to the nearest hospitals in case of emergency, and personal protective equipment such as safety gloves, helmets, goggles, earmuffs etc. There will be one Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Coordinator appointed for the following program strategy of “Plan, Do, Check, Act” for potential health, safety and environmental issues. It is expected that the proposed project have only minor impacts on Physical, Biological and Socioeconomic Environment. All of the impacts are local in nature and can be easily mitigated through adequate mitigation measures and regular monitoring during the Construction, Operation and Decommissioning Phases of the project. The EMP is prepared to address these potential impacts through appropriate mitigation, management and monitoring measures. Based on possible impacts figured out, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), Biodiversity Management Plan (BMP), Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Plan together Environmental Monitoring Plan are prepared and attached in this IEE, as a comprehensive and collective solutions for environmental management, biodiversity/ecology protection and enhancement, health and safety and corporate social responsibility framework for all three phases (construction, operation and decommissioning) of Sanctum Inle Resort. The EMP, BMP and CSR, presented as major institutional requirement, aim to minimize or offset the potential environmental and ecological impacts generated by resort’s activities, to provide maximum occupational health and safety and to ensure better community living. The environmental management, biodiversity management and monitoring practices, procedures and responsibilities are comprehensively expressed here to get full compliance with the existing environmental policy, laws, rules and instructions of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. 124 Initial Environmental Examination In conclusion, it can be verified that No adverse or harmful impacts of any significance are expected by proposed Sanctum Inle Resort. A full scale Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) shall be done if necessary, based on comments and suggestions made by ECD after reviewing this IEE. The following recommendations have been made for efficient and effective implementation of environmental conservation, biodiversity/ecosystem management, health and safety, social responsibilities measures throughout the lifespan of the proposed resort. Follow the comments and suggestions made by ECD after reviewing this IEE report Once EMP is approved by concerned authorities, strict implementation is essential For full and proper implementation of
