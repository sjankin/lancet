Then sales personnel work with internal planning and design departments as well as cost estimation departments to create proposals that will satisfy those customers. 2 Planning and design CSR Report 2017 We develop a basic plan for each plant that will satisfy the customer’s needs. For local governments, we propose a basic plan for the plant that conforms to the purchase specifications that the ordering agency has provided. The purchase specifications indicate the conditions and level of performance required by the local government, for example in terms of the amount and type of waste it wishes to process, site conditions, and waste-fueled power generation capacity. Engineering coordinators spec out incinerators and waste heat boilers along with other systems in order to satisfy those conditions and performance requirements and determine how the equipment will be laid out at the facility. Feature: Striving to Coexist with Local Communities 3 Cost estimation Business Development We calculate the costs associated with all equipment and systems that will be installed at the plant up until the facility’s completion based on the basic plan and finalize a quotation to submit to the customer. Order receipt We propose the plan developed through the collaboration of sales, planning and CSR Initiatives design, and cost estimation coordinators to the customer. For local governments, this proposal is submitted during the bidding process. If our proposal outshines other companies’ proposals and satisfies the customer, we will receive an order for the project. CSR Activities for the Future Corporate Governance 4 Plan implementation and detailed design Once we have received an order, we transition to detailed design work to facilitate Human Rights and Labor Practices the construction of the plant. We conduct a detailed study of equipment specifications and layout based on the plan and design and then proceed to finalize associated details. At this stage, specialists from a variety of fields, including The Environment combustion technology, exhaust gas treatment, and electrical control systems, work together to create the detailed design. Fair Business Practices 5 Manufacture and procurement Consumer Issues We manufacture equipment and systems whose specifications have been finalized at our factories using a strict quality control system and place orders with a variety Participation in the Community of specialized equipment manufacturers. Contribution to Society 6 Construction work and commissioning We commence the civil and foundation work, construct all plant buildings, install equipment and systems, and manage the project until the plant is fully operational. Key considerations include efficient site operations, thorough schedule and cost Financial Data management, and management of safety and quality at the site. Acceptance During the commissioning work, it is confirmed the constructed plant is capable of safe operation. Once the performance test is completed successfully, the acceptance of the plant can be made. 7 After-sales service Once the plant has been handed over to the customer, we provide periodical inspections and maintenance to prevent problems and keep the plant operating safely over the long term. In addition to inspecting and repairing systems for which inspections are legally mandated, we inspect and repair equipment deterioration and damage that accumulates over time. In addition, we complete large-scale renovation work in response to changes in applicable laws and customer needs. 15 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2017 Feature: Striving to Coexist with Local Communities DBO projects ① Kurume High Trust Co., Ltd.

We have delivered more than 370 biomass boilers to customers overseas, and we have an especially extensive track rapid urbanization, and there have been reports of the adverse effects of burying waste as-is on living conditions, including record since 1959 of delivering boilers fueled by bagasse (fiber remaining after sugarcane is crushed) in Thailand, where we soil pollution and fires, especially in developing nations. These countries have embarked on initiatives to resolve waste have a local subsidiary. Takuma has supported the Thai sugar industry for many years. processing issues, but the fact remains that they require even more sophisticated waste processing diagnostic expertise, As the feed-in tariff program becomes increasingly well established in various industries, a growing number of customers advice, and guidance. in Thailand are looking beyond simply gaining a source of power for plant operation and instead opting to construct boilers Takuma has deep experience and an extensive track record that together make it a market share leader in waste with the goal of using 10 MPa/520°C class boilers that operate at comparatively high temperature and high pressure levels to incineration and processing equipment in Japan. The photograph below depicts a plant that we delivered in Beijing, China, actively generate electricity for resale to boost their income. In this way, demand for this type of boiler facility is expected to but in fact we have delivered plants in nine overseas countries and regions, including China and the UK. Our Lakeside Plant in continue to grow. the UK and our Gaoantun Plant in Beijing have earned a high level of praise and trust from their respective customers, for Under these conditions, we look forward to helping supply environmentally friendly power from biomass, particularly in example due to the facilities having achieved continuous operation for more than 8,000 hours a year. Southeast Asia, by accommodating demand not only in Thailand, but also in neighboring countries such as Indonesia and We look forward to taking advantage of our extensive experience to closely exchange information and engage in Vietnam with reliable technology and fine-grained customer service based on our extensive experience in the field. partnerships with local stakeholders as we offer optimal proposals that meet the full array of needs using technological capabilities in which we have great confidence. Apart from plant construction, numerous issues must be addressed in order to resolve waste processing problems, Business including methods for collecting and sorting waste, awareness-raising and environmental education, and consensus-building with local residents. While it takes time to resolve each of these in turn, we are confident that it is precisely by cooperating Development Electricity with such initiatives that we can best provide safe, stable plants that inspire pace of mind on the part of people in their host Steam countries and communities.

Provide the community with information on the activities of Takuma to preserve the environment. Factories that make sugar produce large quantities of residue from sugarcane, the raw material used to make sugar. Sugarcane is crushed into a pulp, and sugar is extracted in about million a mill. The remaining fiber is called bagasse and can be used as boiler fuel. The steam produced is used as the plant’s heat source, and any remaining steam is used to tons! CO2 reduction achieved by generate electricity that is utilized to operate the plant and, if any remains, sold to the Takuma’s biomass power electric power company.

For chips example, even though CO2 is emitted if wood waste products are activities based on an environmental management system established to comply with international standards. Our group Palm Energy incinerated, when trees grow again, they absorb CO2 to offset the companies Nippon Thermoener Co., Ltd., Takuma Technos Co., Ltd., and Dan-Takuma Technologies Inc. have also acquired Bagasse kernel emissions from incineration, so there is no increase in CO2 in the ISO 14001 certification. shells atmosphere. By using the heat produced by incinerating biomass to generate power, the amount of power generated using fossil fuels Biomass-fueled power can be reduced, and this contributes to decreasing CO2. generation boiler In 1 year, CO2 reduction from waste incineration plants Garbage, or waste, is an important source of energy.

In Europe and the Americas, waste incineration plants are often called Energy from Waste (EfW) plants, and recovering energy from garbage has become the norm.
