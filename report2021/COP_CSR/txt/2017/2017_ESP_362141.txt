This positive performance of revenue was accompanied by a 43% year-on-year increase in EBITDA, which amounted to 30 million euros. This gave an EBITDA margin of 7.5%, also as a result due of the new EPC projects and the strategic alliances referred to above. In 2016, Valoriza posted revenues of 908 million euros, 19% higher than in 2015. This growth was 1. Chapter fuelled by the Multiservices businesses (+28.5%), Environment (+10.9%) and Water (+16.8%).

Sector Overview 2. Sector Overview 2.1. The International Economic Environment 2016, both at a global 2016, both at a global level and in general terms, has been characterised by an improvement in the outlook for economic level and in general growth, thanks to the good performance of the world’s major terms, has been economies: United States, Japan, Canada and the majority of the euro area and EU countries. Both the U.S. Federal Reserve and the characterised by an European Central Bank continued to provide monetary stimulus 2016 Integrated Report improvement in the policies during the year, though the USA has raised interest rates for the second year running. On the other hand, emerging countries’ outlook for economic economies continue to suffer, with commodity prices failing to growth, thanks to the recover, aside from oil, which spiked sharply compared to 2015. Oil’s recovery has led to prices beginning to rise once again, after good performance the falls experienced in the last few years. of the world’s major In 2016, the United States recorded growth of 1.6% in GDP, economies compared with 2.6% the year before. This slowdown is due in part to lower household consumption (2.7% in 2016 vs. 3.2% in 2015); a fall in non-residential fixed investment; and a reduction in national and local government spending. As expected, at the end of the year the Fed once again raised its policy rate by a quarter of one point, to the range of 0.50%-0.75%, on the back of the recovery in prices and employment levels during the year. At least three interest rate rises are forecast for 2017. With regard to employment, 2016 was another good year, with 2.16 million new jobs created, reducing unemployment to 4.7% (vs. 5% in the previous year), its lowest rate for nine years. In terms of inflation, government figures show that 2016 closed with an increase of 2.1%, compared to 0.7% the previous year, largely due to the major increase of 5.4% in energy prices in the year. Turning to China, according to the government’s own data, GDP rose Sacyr by 6.7% in 2016, down 0.2% on 2015, and the lowest rate in the last 25 years. The steady downturn in the second-largest global economy has been confirmed for the third year running, as the export-based growth model runs out of steam. 32 2.1. The International Economic Environment The economic performance of euro area countries was also very uneven in 2016. Although Eurostat has not published its definitive GDP figures, and in many cases the data we have is provisional, we can confirm that the euro zone as a whole grew 1.7%, compared with 1.6% the previous year, nearing pre-crisis levels but still much lower than the world’s other economic powers. In the European Union as a whole, however, there was growth of 1.9% in the year, compared to 1.8% in 2015. With regard to the economic forecasts for future years, the European Commission expects growth of 1.6% in the euro area in 2017 and of 1.8% in 2018, while growth of 1.8% is expected for the European Union as a whole in both years. Year-on-year inflation in the eurozone, according to data provided by Eurostat, was 1.1% in 2016, compared to 0.2% the previous year. 2. Sector Overview 33 2.2. The Economic Environment in Spain The Spanish economy, measured in terms of GDP, grew by 3.2% in 2016, the same figure as recorded the previous year. This is the third year of positive growth, following six years of contraction. In terms of the trade balance, 2016 set a new record for the export of goods, which reduced the trade deficit by 22.4%, down to 18,754 million euros. Thanks to the competitiveness of our economy, and the 2016 Integrated Report depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar, exports rose by 1.7% to 254,530 million euros, whilst imports fell by 0.4% to 273,284 million euros. The European Commission’s forecasts for Spain in 2017 and 2018 are fairly encouraging in all key components: In 2017, it expects an increase of 2.7% in GDP, and of 2.4% in 2018, mainly due to increased domestic demand as a result of employment growth. Exports should also continue to grow thanks to the improved competitiveness of the Spanish economy. Regarding the unemployment rate, levels of around 17.7% and 16% are expected in 2017 and 2018, respectively. As regards the labour market, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) reflects an increase of 413,900 jobs last year, 2.29% more than in 2015. The unemployment rate was 18.63% for active population vs. 20.9% in 2015. As for Social Security, 2016 closed with an average enrolment of 17.85 million employees, representing an average increase of more than 540,655 enrolees compared to the figures for the previous year, the biggest increase since 2006. Turning to prices, inflation in Spain for 2016 was 1.6% compared to 0.09% in 2015. Sacyr Spain’s main stock index, the IBEX-35, ended with losses for the second year running. The last trading session of the year closed at 9,352.10 points, a loss in the year of 2.01%. The index was down 7.06% in 2015. In Spain, real investment amounted to 9,323.63 million euros in 2016, a 1.6% increase on the previous year. Despite the measures taken by Spanish public authorities to adjust and contain spending, the Ministry of Economic Development is still implementing the new Infrastructure, Transport and Housing Plan (“PITVI”) introduced at the end of 2012. The new plan is expected to remain in place until 2024. 34 2.2. The Economic Environment in Spain 2.

Performance of the Sacyr Group in 2016 2016 Significant Events Some of the most significant events that took place during the year are as follows: a) Panama Canal 2016 Integrated Report On 31 May 2016, the GUPC consortium, led by Sacyr, completed the works to design and construct the third set of locks on the Panama Canal, a basic component of the Panama Canal expansion programme; the most ambitious engineering feat of the twenty-first century and one of the biggest challenges ever in terms of infrastructure, placing Sacyr at the very forefront of the civil engineering world. The new Panama Canal was officially inaugurated and opened for business on 26 June 2016, with the passing through of the first “post-panamax” ship, i.e. larger vessels than those able to use the old Canal. The event was attended by more than 25,000 people, including 2,400 guests, from 62 international delegations, including Emeritus King of Spain, Juan Carlos I and numerous presidents, vice-presidents and prime ministers from a multitude of countries and international organisations. There is no doubt that this work has been a great triumph of technology and innovation, and has involved the creation of a new interoceanic thoroughfare; one where the world record shipping toll has been charged. All of this has been possible, thanks to the efforts, high quality and diligent work of Sacyr and the other shareholders in GUPC, which has made them one of the construction companies with the greatest international projection. Sacyr The GUPC consortium is currently involved in maintenance of the new Canal, in compliance with its contract. The claims submitted by the consortium in relation to the There is no doubt cost overruns on the project are awaiting the ruling of the DAB (Dispute Adjudication Board), an independent technical body that this work established within the framework of the agreement between has been a great Grupo Unidos por el Canal (GUPC) and the ACP (Panama Canal Authorities), and, ultimately, the final ruling on all the claims by the triumph of technology ICC’s Arbitration Court in Miami. This is a long and complex process, and innovation which is not expected to be concluded in the near future. 58 3.4. Performance of the Sacyr Group in 2016 b) Stake in Repsol In 2016, Sacyr made an early repayment of 885 million euros of the debt associated with its stake in the oil company, reducing, at that date, the outstanding loan principal to 769 million euros. This early repayment was possible thanks to the 317 million euros received in June from the final part of the sale of Testa to Merlin Properties; the 533 million euros obtained from the two derivative instruments on 50 million Repsol shares (40% of the stake), arranged on 4 October and 14 December; and the dividends received during the year from the Repsol stake.

KWh/year avoidable ▶▶ Implementation and operation of energy-efficient solutions. emissions detected ▶▶ Monitoring and control of energy variables. ▶▶ Total guarantee of refuelling and breakdowns. ▶▶ Investment and installation of high-efficiency equipment and renewables. Energy audits according to RD 56/2016 In Sacyr’s energy services contracts, 21,878.50 GJ of energy was saved in 2016, in comparison with the baseline, thus avoiding the emission into the atmosphere of 2,975.22 TnCO2. This saving results from efforts in relation to lighting, and in the switch in heating fuel and ACS, and in mechanical facilities and those of regulation and control (scope 1 and scope 2). G4-EN7 G4-EN19 The purpose of the energy audits carried out by Sacyr Group in 2016, was to analyse the operation of the facilities, in order to develop action aimed at improving the organisation’s energy management and energy saving, thereby enabling it to contribute to the EU’s energy efficiency targets. 17 audits were undertaken, with possible savings of 6,038,869 kWh per year being detected, which in turn would mean a reduction of emissions into the atmosphere of Sacyr 1,676.54 TnCO2. G4-EN6 110 4.1. Sacyr’s commitment to the fight against climate change In addition, among other actions to improve energy efficiency, the following were undertaken: ▶▶ Changes in lighting, with lighting and technology being subdivided. ▶▶ Replacement of installations such as fan coils and transformers. ▶▶ Adjustments and reduction of the energy contracted. ▶▶ Replacement of vehicles using fossil fuels with those powered by electricity. Average emissions have remained stable in relation to our vehicle fleet, with an increase of 0.18% from 122.44 g CO2/km in 2015, to 122.66 g CO2/km in 2016. This very minor rise is due to an increase in the number of industrial vehicles in the fleet compared to passenger cars. Emissions of the Sacyr Group Direct emissions arise from sources that Sacyr owns or controls and result from the consumption of fuel needed to carry out its business.

As part of its commitment to sustainable construction, and in accordance with the Sustainable Development Goals to make cities increasingly more sustainable, more integrated and safer, Sacyr has for many years worked on construction projects which require LEED and BREEAM accreditation. Currently, there are two projects which are being built in line with LEED certification: the “El Marqués” Regional General Hospital in Querétaro (Mexico) and New Lodge Sacyr (Rota-Spain); two others works are being constructed under BREEAM certification: the Prevention Centre at the Airbus Group factory (Madrid) and the University of Ulster (Northern Ireland). In addition, in 2016 the Rota control tower base work received the LEED Silver certificate. G4-CRE8 Sacyr has continued to extend the scope of its energy management system in 2016, to include the organisation’s new activities and facilities. Having an Energy Management System enables an organisation to discover and take advantage of its energy efficiency potential, whilst at the same time achieving cost savings and contributing significantly to climate and environmental protection by reducing GHG emissions. 116 4.1.

Sacyr’s commitment in this regard is through a number of sustainable mobility actions, which include greater control of business trips and authorisation procedures, encouraging the use of videoconferencing rather than travelling to meetings, employee awareness, etc. Currently, Sacyr continues to develop a sustainable mobility and transport model which includes all of the actions that the company already undertakes and also identifies new initiatives to help cut emissions. In 2016, Sacyr continued to follow its technological infrastructure development plan, which started in 2015 and will allow us to be more efficient and competitive. The projects relating to the installation of a corporate Wi-Fi network, the installation of videoconferencing systems, replacement of work equipment, etc., which were implemented last year in the main work centre and countries where the company operates, both nationally and internationally, were incorporated in other centres and countries during 2016. These measures translate into a greater use of audio and 4. Environmental Value videoconferencing equipment and more energy-efficient equipment that will contribute to reducing our overall energy consumption and, therefore, our carbon emissions. These mobility and infrastructure measures are linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, with the aim of developing sustainable, resilient and quality infrastructures. Somague continues to maintain its good practice in sustainable mobility at work, through the use of a shared bus. This initiative enables its employees to travel from various points in Lisbon to Linhó (Sintra), where it central headquarters are located. In 2016, due to a drop in the number of passengers using this service, the routes were reorganised and reduced from the three existing in 2015, down to two. Three routes were created and combined in such a way so as to optimise transportation based on the employees’ place of residence. In 2016, an average of 25 employees were transported per day and the use of this daily transportation service avoided the emission of 72.75 tonnes of CO2. 117 2016 Integrated Report Sacyr Integration of the São Francisco river, Brazil The environmental impacts related to the transport of products and other goods and materials are not considered to be particularly significant in the context of the Sacyr. Most of this type of transportation is carried out by suppliers, and they are given a best practices code which covers the main environmental impacts of transport identified by Sacyr. 118 119 4.

At Valoriza Agua, aware of this fact, we ensure that all of our actions include cleaning, maintenance and the incorporation of modern remote control systems; discharge into the urban sewer and collector network; as well as systems for the pre-treatment of wastewater required for better purification. 125 4.2. Water Wastewater treatment Wastewater from towns, crops and industry contains toxic elements that, if discharged directly into nature, would contaminate it and destroy the environment. 2016 Integrated Report Valoriza Agua closes the water cycle with its treatment in water purification plants before returning the water to nature. The wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) built or operated by Valoriza Agua in cities such as Madrid, Puertollano or Murcia are capable of efficaciously treating a total of 890,000 m3/day. In the ICW were purified in 2016, 55,703,179 m3, in addition to having only pretreated 21,765,448 m3. The most important milestones in 2016 included: ▶▶ General sanitation and treatment infrastructure work in the Arroyo de La Reguera (Madrid) basin, with a capacity of 80,000 m3 per day. ▶▶ Project to execute and carry out WWTP work in Arroyo Quiñones (San Sebastián de los Reyes) in order to treat 45,700 m3 per day. ▶▶ Project for the building and expansion of the Puertollano WWTP in order to treat 30,000 m3 per day. Reuse of treated wastewater Treated wastewater is an essential component for the efficient use Sacyr of water resources and sustainable development. We are working in Valoriza Agua on implementing new treatment processes, through our R&D+i department, for the effective development of technologies applicable to water reuse and regeneration, always seeking to optimise existing procedures and improve upon cutting-edge technologies. In addition, the technology developed by Valoriza Agua for wastewater treatment plants dovetails perfectly with the specific needs for water from field drainage, with solutions that make it possible to reuse wastewater for agriculture and golf course irrigation, thus contributing to environmental protection and water 126 conservation. What is more, the environmental-surveillance plans we make guarantee the monitoring and control of the effect of our facilities on the environment. In the management of the IWC have been regenerated in 2016, 1,211,465 m3. How we manage wastewater 4.2. Water The majority of Sacyr’s activities generate liquid effluents, and the outlet into which they are discharged depends on the generation process and the location of the facility. Most commonly they are discharged into the public sewage network and authorised public water outlets, and coastal areas. The wastewater is analysed systematically and according to an established plan in order to verify that all applicable legal requirements as well as those set forth in the related permits are met, thus ensuring the quality of the waste.

In order to do this, the Group follows lines of action which consumption encourage the use of recycled materials, the choice of the most environmentally-friendly products, processes and suppliers and the and production efficient use of natural resources, reducing the generation of waste 2016 Integrated Report patterns through policies of prevention, reduction, recycling and reutilisation. These action are in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and with the 12 goal relating to responsible production and consumption in particular. In addition, through its environmental strategy, Sacyr promotes the transition to a circular economy, where it is aimed to keep products, materials and resources (water, energy, etc.) in the economic cycle for as long as possible, thereby reducing the generation of waste. This economy is based on the principles of recycling and reutilisation of waste and by-products, ensuring that these re-enter the production cycle as raw materials. The variety of Sacyr’s activities involves the use of a wide range of materials and the consumption of the most significant of these, by business area, is shown in Table I of Appendix V G4-EN1.

In addition, the Sacyr Group has adopted a Comprehensive Risk Management System. With regard to the treatment of human rights risks, the risk maps (operational and criminal) have identified all the existing risks (which are managed through the control procedures established to mitigate them), among which also Include those related to human rights in the performance of the company.

They must integrate legal compliance with regulations, obligations and the requirements in the concession contract with the interests of the affected groups in the project’s area of operation as well as their contribution to the region’s sustainable development in the context of full respect for human rights. In line with this challenge and as a socially responsible company, we have drawn up a Social and Environmental Responsibility Plan (SERP), which orchestrates our contractual social management programmes with the environmental demands of road projects and our Comprehensive Management System. This plan is aimed at implementing the best organisational practices to generate economic, social and environmental performance based on responsibility, ethics and transparency. Sacyr We have drawn The SERP integrates the corporate social responsibility elements defined in international standards such as the Equator Principles, up a Social and ISO 26000, GRI standards, AA 1000 accountability standard and the Environmental Sustainable Development Goals.

Risks Risk Management and Anti-Corruption G4-2 G4-45 Due to its considerable international presence, the Sacyr Group carries out its activity in a number of sectors, social and economic 2016 Integrated Report environments and regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, the company is exposed to a variety of risks related to the businesses and sectors in which it operates. Sacyr has established a comprehensive and ongoing risk management system, organised by business units and support areas at corporate level, and has a sound policy in place to efficiently identify, evaluate and manage risks in order to reasonably guarantee the efficiency and effectiveness of operations, reliability of information and compliance with legislation. The Group’s Risk Control and Management Policy, approved by the Board of Directors, establishes the scope, values, principles, governance model and basis for the operation of the Comprehensive Risk Management System for the control and management of risks inherent to the activities of Sacyr. The Comprehensive Risk Management System is structured around a Risk Committee supported by an independent and specialized Risk Management and Control Department, supervised by the Audit Committee with the support of the Internal Audit Department, guarantees the involvement and the commitment of the Board of Directors and senior management in the group’s risk management. The process begins Sacyr with a preliminary The Risk Committee is the most senior body responsible for Sacyr’s Risk Management and Control System and for all decisions risks identification associated therewith in all business units. It is designated by the and assessment that, Company’s most senior executive and its functions include providing support to the Board in making critical decisions, establishing risk given the changing tolerance levels and defining and promoting the risk culture across nature of the the organisation.

The Internal Audit Department, which reports directly to the Sacyr Group’s Chairman and is supervised by the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee, systematically evaluates the efficiency of risk identification, control and management procedures. The Department prepares an annual Internal Audit Plan which is subject to approval by the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee. G4-47 The Group’s risk control and management policy is developed 6.5. Risks through a Risk Analysis Regulation specific to each business area that allows: ▶▶ Facilitate key business decision making by establishing a systematic and structured way to control and manage critical risks throughout all the projects life cycle. ▶▶ Describe and structure the process of risk analysis in several stages: planning, identification, evaluation, treatment, monitoring and control. ▶▶ Establish the distribution of responsibilities during the analysis process. ▶▶ Define scaling in decision making according to defined risk and acceptable risk tolerance level. The Group is exposed to various risks inherent in the different activities, countries and markets in which it operates. The 6. Governance Integrated Risk Management System integrates, into the previous policy and regulations, the main fiscal and operational risks grouped into different categories (business environment, regulation, brand and reputation, human resources, operations, financial, information for decision-making, technology and information and good governance systems) to ensure that risks are properly identified, assessed, managed and controlled, and regularly reported to the various committees and committees involved in key business decision-making. 213 2016 Integrated Report Sacyr 214 Area transit maintenance Dublin, Ireland 6.5. Risks At the operational level, the Comprehensive Risk Management System is structured in six stages: ▶▶ Planning: In this stage the system management tools are activated and those responsible and risk owners are designated throughout the project life. ▶▶ Identification: at this stage, activities are carried out to identify sub-risks and critical risks associated with each key decision. ▶▶ Evaluation: at this stage, activities are carried out to assess, 6.5. Risks according to the scales defined, to filter and prioritize the risks and critical sub-risks of the project. ▶▶ Treatment: at this stage the activities carried out are aimed to the implementation of Mitigation Plans that seek to reduce or eliminate risk exposure before and after exceeding the maximum tolerances. ▶▶ Follow-up: this stage identifies new risks and measures the evolution of existing ones, assesses the effectiveness of the Mitigation Plans implemented, calibrates tolerances and scales for risk assessment, and implements Contingency Plans in If the defined tolerances are exceeded. ▶▶ Control: this stage includes the activities carried out by the Risk Control and Management Division throughout the life of the projects, in order to capture lessons learned for the continuous 6. Governance improvement of the System and its management. 215 6.5. Risks Risk Management and Control Activities in 2016 Over the last five years, due to the international economic crisis, there have been major changes to the scope and likelihood of occurrence of the various risks. Therefore, throughout 2016 we focused on updating existing risk maps and creating new consolidated Group risk maps, 2016 Integrated Report as well as a new criminal risk map. For this reason, our efforts during 2016 have focused on the effective implementation of the Risk Analysis Regulations specific to each business area covering the entire life cycle of the projects, updating the existing risk maps and the preparation of the Group’s consolidated risk map and consolidation of the criminal risk map. Furthermore, high-level risk maps have been updated independently of risk maps for the various businesses, and we can use these as tools to manage risks associated with new regulatory frameworks; supervision of internal control over financial reporting by the Audit and Corporate Governance Committee, and the impact on the Company of Spain’s new Criminal Code, under which legal entities are held criminally liable for any offences committed. In general, the Sacyr Group has monitoring plans for the main risks, which include impairment testing of all its non-financial assets at the end of each reporting period. To a greater or lesser extent depending on the business area, the Sacyr Group is exposed to the risks discussed below, in particular to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, and more so to interest rate fluctuations than to changes in exchange rates. Sacyr As regards credit risk, the Group is exposed through its operating activities, basically trade receivables, and its financing activities. Customer concentration risk is mitigated by the Group’s diverse customer base, backed by public sector bodies. The underlying borrowings that require the greatest degree of hedging against interest rate fluctuations are project financing loans and those associated with specific assets, because of their exposure for longer periods of time given the terms involved and the strong correlation with the cash flows of the projects. 216 The Sacyr Group intends to continue expanding its business into other countries, which carries expansion risk as it involves markets in which the Group does not have the same degree of experience as it has in its current markets. Each business unit performs an assessment with customers before entering into any contracts, which includes a study of their solvency. During the life of its contracts, it monitors its receivables on an ongoing basis and reviews recoverable amounts, recognising impairment as necessary. 6.5. Risks To deal with liquidity risks, the Group has identified probable scenarios through monitoring and control of the annual budget and daily updates of its cash flow forecasts, enabling it to take decisions early. Factors that help mitigate liquidity risk include recurring cash flow generation by the Group’s core businesses and the Group’s ability to sell assets. The asset rotation strategy allows the Sacyr Group to unlock value from the maturity of top-quality investments and manage the liquidity raised in an attempt to enhance its competitiveness and profitability. Regarding demand risk for concession projects, the Group has measured the recoverability of the investment by continuously reviewing its valuation models based on trends in traffic and the economic growth outlook for the market where each concession operates. The Group has implemented control systems to adequately identify, quantify, evaluate and remedy all these risks, in order to minimise or 6. Governance eliminate the consequences. The Group also takes out and renews insurance policies. The Group seeks to serve society in all its business areas by applying a sustainable and profitable business model that adds value for all stakeholders through innovation, technological progress and excellence in delivery. 217 6.5. Risks Regulatory Compliance Risks According to the Sacyr Code of Conduct, compliance with the law is one of the basic ethical principles underlying the conduct of the Sacyr Group and its employees. The Code stipulates that the Sacyr Group is committed to reliable and respectful compliance with all 2016 Integrated Report legal obligations to which it is subject in any country in which it carries on its business. Compliance with the various regulations is mainly supervised by the Regulatory Compliance Unit, in coordination with the Internal Audit Department (which has had a specific regulatory compliance department since 2008), and in exercising its functions it may also request the collaboration of other bodies, departments, areas, people or companies of the Group. Other organisational areas, including the Quality and Environmental Department and the Occupational Health and Safety Service, also help guarantee respect for prevailing legislation in the corresponding activity areas. In view of the high volume of the Group’s activities and its diverse and complex nature, claims occasionally arise in respect of the supply and use of products and services or other causes derived from the different regulatory and sector regulation environments applicable to Sacyr subsidiaries. These claims are processed accordingly, and are either accepted or challenged by the Group. The number of claims is not significant in respect of the Group’s overall activity. Sacyr The Sacyr Group is committed to reliable and respectful compliance with all legal obligations to which it is subject in any country in which it carries on its 218 business. Other Risks In addition to the aforementioned regulatory compliance risks, the Group’s Risk Management and Control Policy also establishes control and communication mechanisms for a number of other risks, including the following: ▶▶ Risk of inadequate adaptation to the environment or market in which the Company operates. 6.5. Risks ▶▶ Risk of inadequate management of aspects relating to corporate responsibility and sustainability, as well as the corporate image. ▶▶ Human resources risks: positioning, training, flexibility, dependence on key personnel, work climate, etc. ▶▶ Risk of inadequate information for the decision-making process ▶▶ Technological and information system risks: network management, physical and programme security and integrity of information. ▶▶ Money laundering prevention. 6. Governance In addition to the aforementioned regulatory compliance risks, the Group’s Risk Management and Control Policy also establishes control and communication mechanisms for a number of other risks. 219 6.6.
