We understand our role in climate change and we are prepared to improve our standards on a daily basis. Considering the foregoing, our fifth sustainability report projects our effort in the continuous improvement and responsibility in our processes. During the year 2015 the energy industry was immersed in macroeconomic changes that significantly determined the way in which we interact in the management of hydrocarbon blocks. Given the context, the medium and long term approach was oriented towards the development of those projects that require less intensity in capital investments and that generate greater cash flow, always maintaining that the vision and premise for success rests in the continuity in the exploration, as well as in the objective and careful selection of new opportunities developed in a sustainable context at an environmental and social level. The challenges and new perspectives meant for our organization changes of corporate nature and in our attitude towards the management of changes. Thus, reconsidering new strategies to mitigate the economic impacts derived from the decrease in the price of hydrocarbons, allowed for our company to continue. In addition to the foregoing, we focused in optimizing work teams, operational costs and from a technical point of view, in the development of the gas potential at our blocks, allowing us to look with confidence into the future.

At Omega Energy we have more than a decade of experience in generating value and facing these challenges, reaffirming the long term nature of our business. We have accomplished this by adapting to the low price environment and restructuring our expansion plans, developing the production of gas as a fundamental source of our financial sustainability, restructuring our short and long term debt and highlighting our projects that represent long and medium term cash flows and sustaining the success of our activity. Our greatest impact lies in the continuity of the exploration activities, with an objective and selective selection of assets that add and replace our reserves P1, P2. Our priorities include operational excellence, field to reach cost optimization, which translates in more profitable barrels. We also highlight that we have worked for our employees and their safety, as well as for the communities, their environment and for a real plan to reach the transition to cleaner energy that is available to all. We are proud of the construction of our first gas pipeline and its importance for the Valle de Sogamuxy, a significant corridor for the economy of Boyaca. Also, at our facility located in the United States we work in the production of second generation Ethanol, avoiding the competition with the production of food to generate energy. Our biggest bet is still the Sub-Sahara region with our OML 110 project in Nigeria, were we are developing business convinced of the oil potential of the country and the great opportunities of one of the most dynamic and important economies in Africa. We are enthusiastic about the signature of the Paris Agreement on climate change and we have made efforts to a transition towards the production of more reliable and sustainable energy, with less impact for our planet.

By the year 2011, three wells were drilled and during 2012, BOYACÁ five more wells were drilled. As of 2013, a stratigraphic well CASANARE drilling campaign was developed in order to identify and evaluate potential shallow reservoirs. This campaign validated the continuity of findings of heavy shallow crude and a great potential for hydrocarbons at the block. From December 2013 until November 2015, the Omega Energy exploration group has made a strict seismic interpretation META with monitoring of reprocessing, giving as a result reliable maps and supporting the location of the prospects and of two development wells. The foregoing enabled the UNITED STATES definition of the extension of the Corrales Field.
