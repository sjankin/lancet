A pump is then used to remove the water from inside the structure. The resulting difference in water pressure inside and outside of the structure (suction) fixes the skirt to the seabed, establishing a robust foundation that can support large wind turbines up to 120 m in diameter. Business Overview This technology does not require large equipment, just a pump for installation, and noise and vibration also present no issues. It is cost effective and easy on the environment as the structure can be completely removed by simply reversing the installation process by injecting water into it. We pioneered the development of skirt suction technology in Japan. CSR Water ▽ Sea level pumped out Pipe Penetration Upper dome Corporate Governance ▽ Seabed Suction Skirt Skirt Suction Corporate Data Underwater Inspection Robot “Diag” This underwater inspection robot can go underwater for long periods of time using wired remote operation at depths up to 100 m, beyond the range of divers using compressed air, whose maximum depth is roughly 40 m. Its high-vision camera and image analysis technology also enable sharp images to be taken even in murky water. The robot uses AQUAJUSTER* technology that curbs impact from water currents, enabling it to remain still in the water and capture images of subjects from directly in front of it. Applications for the robot will likely include inspections of dams and other infrastructure, underwater ­construction, and investigations in times of disaster. * Obayashi’s proprietary technology to control the direction of the suspended load under­ water by using the gyro effect, wherein rotating a physical object makes its position ­resistant to disruption. AI for Recognizing Construction Progress from Photos This AI has been trained using images of building materials through deep learning to automatically recognize progress on construction. The AI does this by estimating the materials being used from photos of construction taken during the execution of work. It can be used to save labor in verifying progress on work in new ­housing complex construction, for instance where engineers would otherwise make daily rounds to each unit to confirm progress. We are currently ­verifying the accuracy of AI-equipped tablets in recognizing progress on interior construction in housing complexes.

Moreover, the outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board Otake members freely exchange opinions among themselves on a regular basis. This exchange of information and opinions (Outside Director) enables lively discussions at the Board of Directors. The recently announced Obayashi Group Medium-Term Business Plan 2017 is highly commendable as it aims to improve corporate value while maintaining sound and transparent management. To achieve these goals, I intend to proactively advise management on how to diversify earnings sources Corporate Data in particular. Since it is also important to deploy cutting-edge technologies, especially those developed by the Obayashi Technical Research ­Institute, I will focus my attention on technology development. Shinichi For the Company to develop sustainably, it needs to promote strategic and innovative initiatives such as actively incorporating rapidly evolving ICT, significantly improving productivity and creating construction business models, as well as Koizumi continuously reviewing its corporate governance structure. I will use my accumulated knowledge and experience from (Outside Director) many years in overseas operations and from building alliances with leading companies inside and outside Japan to proactively offer objective advice through dialog with the Board of Directors and top management. I will focus on various important matters for management, such as creating strategic business alliances and aggressively developing business around the world while thoroughly managing risks. I aim to contribute to the improvement of corporate value at Obayashi. Yasutaka I understand that outside Audit & Supervisory Board members rely on the experience and knowledge they have gained in many organizations to perform their oversight duties in corporate management from an outsider’s viewpoint.

Obayashi’s wonderful corporate culture has its roots in integrity in building, with a customer-first approach, and development of people, which arises from that. This corporate culture is a source of pride and confidence, and I hope it will be passed down to the next generation. Hiroshi I mainly keep an eye on the financials from the standpoint of a specialist, leveraging my experience monitoring companies from the outside as a Certified Public Accountant. However, I consider that corporate governance is functioning Murao effectively and that businesses are being managed in a balanced and healthy manner.

Meetings of the Board of Directors involve lively exchanges of opinions, as well as questions and answers. I consider the Company’s meeting bodies to be effective overall. I believe the securing of adequate profits while monitoring risks and compliance and maintaining the trust of all stakeholders will ultimately lead to improvement in corporate value. Hiroshi I sincerely believe Obayashi’s corporate governance system is properly, effectively, and autonomously functioning, thanks in large part to the strong awareness of governance among all employees. That said, efforts must be constantly made Yokokawa across the organization to raise sensitivity to risks and compliance.

To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 72 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements OBAYASHI CORPORATION For the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 1. Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the accounts maintained by OBAYASHI CORPORATION (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Companies”) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, and are compiled from the consolidated financial ­statements prepared by the Company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan. Certain amounts in the prior year’s financial statements were reclassified to conform to the changes made for the latest fiscal year. 2. U.S. Dollar Amounts The accounts of the consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in Japanese yen by rounding down to the nearest million. The U.S. dollar amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were translated from the original Japanese yen into U.S. dollars on the basis of ¥112.19 to US$1, the rate of exchange prevailing at March 31, 2017, and were then rounded down to the nearest thousand. These U.S. dollar amounts are not intended to imply that the Japanese yen amounts have been or could be converted, realized or settled in U.S. dollars at this or any other rate. 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (1) Scope of consolidation and application of the equity method The Company had 88 subsidiaries at March 31, 2017. The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 included the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Investments in all affiliates (26 companies for 2017) are accounted for by the equity method. (2) Business year for consolidated subsidiaries Certain foreign consolidated subsidiaries (33 companies) have a fiscal year that ends on December 31. The consolidated financial statements were prepared based on the financial statements as of the same date. Necessary adjustments for consolidation were made on significant transactions that took place during the period between the fiscal year-end of the subsidiaries and that of the Company. Consolidated subsidiaries other than those referred to above have the same business year as the Company, which ends on March 31. (3) Goodwill Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 5 years. However, goodwill that is not material is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Differences between the cost and underlying net equity of investments in affiliates accounted for by the equity method are immaterial and charged or credited to income as they occur. (4) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gains and losses from translation are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The balance sheet accounts of the foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Differences arising from the translation are presented as foreign currency translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. (5) Cash equivalents All highly liquid investments, generally with a maturity of three months or less when purchased, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and are so near maturity that they represent only an insignificant risk of any change in value are considered cash equivalents. 73 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 To Contents (6) Short-term investment securities and investment securities About Obayashi Corporation Securities are classified into two categories: held-to-maturity and other securities. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. (7) Inventories Business Overview Real estate held for sale, costs on uncompleted construction contracts, costs on real estate business, inventories for PFI and other projects and costs on other business are all stated at cost determined by the specific identification method. Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost determined by the first-in first-out method. The net book value of inventories in the balance sheet is written down if the net realizable value declines. CSR (8) Property, plant and equipment The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries mainly calculate depreciation by the declining-balance method, while straight-line method is applied to the buildings excluding building fixtures, acquired on or after April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and other non-building structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries mainly apply the straight-line method. The useful lives and residual values of depreciable assets are estimated mainly in accordance with the Corporate Corporate Governance Tax Law. (9) Intangible assets Intangible fixed assets are amortized by the straight-line method. Computer software for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 5 years. Corporate Data (10) Leased assets Depreciation of leased assets under finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased assets to the lessee is calculated by the straight-line method over the lease period with a residual value of zero. (11) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on the historical experience with respect to write-offs for the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and based on an estimate of the amount for specific uncollectible accounts for the Companies. (12) Provision for warranties for completed construction The provision for warranties for completed construction is provided to cover expenses for defects claimed concerning completed work, based on the estimated amount of compensation to be paid in the future for the work completed during the fiscal year. (13) Provision for loss on construction contracts The provision for loss on construction contracts is provided at the estimated amount for the future losses on contract backlog at the balance sheet date which will probably be incurred and which can be reasonably estimated. (14) Provision for stock payments for directors The provision for stock payments for directors is provided for stock award debt based on predetermined regulations for awarding stock, which is prepared for future awards of the Company shares to its directors and executive officers. (15) Provision for loss on real estate business and other The provision for loss on real estate business and other is provided for the estimated losses to be incurred in liquidating real estate and restructuring the real estate related business. (16) Provision for environmental measures The provision for environmental measures is provided based on an estimate of costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) waste, which the Company and its domestic subsidiaries are obliged to dispose of by the Act on ­Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 74 (17) Retirement benefits In calculating retirement benefits obligations, the benefit formula method is used to allocate expected retirement benefit payments in the period until the end of the current fiscal year. Actuarial differences are amortized commencing in the following year after the differences is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods (5 years to 10 years) which are shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees. Prior service cost (PSC) is amortized by the straight-line method over a period of 10 years which is shorter than the average remaining years of service of the employees, while PSC of certain subsidiaries is expensed as incurred. (18) Derivatives and hedge accounting (a) Method of hedge accounting Hedging instruments are valued at fair value and accounted for using the deferral method of accounting. The monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, for which foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge the foreign currency fluctuations, are translated at the contracted rate if the foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. The interest rate swaps, which qualify for hedge accounting and meet specific matching criteria, are not remeasured at market value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is charged to income (short-cut method). (b) Hedging instruments and hedged items To hedge foreign exchange risks related to the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and projected future foreign currency transactions, foreign exchange forward contracts and non-deliverable foreign exchange forward contracts are employed as hedging instruments. To hedge the interest-rate risks related to loans payable, interest rate swaps are employed as hedging instruments. (c) Hedging policy The Companies utilize derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of hedging future risks of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates in accordance with internal rules. (d) Assessment of hedge effectiveness Hedge effectiveness is not assessed when substantial terms and conditions of the hedging instruments and the hedged transactions are the same. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness is omitted for interest rate swaps as they meet certain criteria under the shortcut method. (19) Recognizing revenues and costs of construction contracts Revenues and costs of construction contracts of which the percentage of completion can be reliably estimated are recognized by the percentage-of-completion method. The percentage of completion is calculated at the cost incurred as a percentage of the estimated total cost. The completed-contract method continues to be applied for contracts for which the percentage of completion cannot be reliably estimated. Revenues from construction contracts and the related costs of the overseas subsidiaries are mainly recorded on the percentage-of-completion method. (20) Revenues and expenses associated with finance lease transactions Sales and cost of sales are recognized upon receipt of lease payment. (21) Consumption taxes Consumption tax and local consumption tax are accounted for under the tax-exclusive method. (22) Income taxes The Companies apply deferred tax accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of income taxes by the asset/liability method. Under the asset/liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. (23) Consolidated taxation system The Companies adopted the consolidated taxation system. 75 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 To Contents 4.

Financial Instruments (1) Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The Companies raise funds by borrowing from banks and issuing commercial paper or corporate bonds. Also, the Companies restrict temporary excess fund management to highly secure assets, time deposits and other short-term investments. The Companies use derivatives in order to avoid the risks, fluctuations of particular assets and liabilities, and fluctuations of interest rates. The Companies do not use derivative transactions to gain short-term profits or for speculative purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments related risks and risk management “Notes receivable, accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded monetary claims” and “Accounts receivable—other,” which are operating receivables, are exposed to the credit risk of customers. In order to mitigate the risk when orders are received, the Companies conduct a strict screening and determine project plans so that potential risks are minimized. Short-term investment securities and investment securities mainly consist of stocks. While short-term investment securities and investment securities are exposed to market risk, the Companies monitor market prices of these securities. “Notes payable, accounts payable for construction contracts and other,” “Electronically recorded obligations” and “Deposits received,” which are operating liabilities, are due within one year. “Short-term loans payable,” “Long-term loans payable,” “Commercial paper” and “Bonds payable” are used for operations or capital investment. “Nonrecourse loans” are used for enterprise funds related to particular PFI ­projects and other. The floating rate loans are exposed to fluctuation in interest rates. In order to hedge against the interest rate risks and fix the payment of interest, the Companies utilize derivative transactions (interest rate swaps) for each contract of certain long-term loans payable. Regarding the evaluation of hedge effectiveness, it is omitted by the judgement of the short-cut method because the interest rate swaps meet the certain criteria under the short-cut method. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 82 The transactions of derivative financial instruments are carried out in accordance with the Companies’ internal rules, and the status of the transactions is reported regularly to the Board of Directors. The Companies trade derivative transactions with major financial institutions and therefore consider there is no credit risk underlying those transactions. While operating debt and borrowings are exposed to liquidity risk, the Companies manage the risk mainly by ­preparing quarterly and monthly cash management plans. (c) Supplementary explanation of fair values of financial instruments Notional amounts of derivative transactions, disclosed in “(2) Fair value of financial instruments,” do not indicate market risk in derivative transactions. (2) Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments as of March 31, and any differences.

The carrying value is the same as fair value. Notes and accounts receivable from completed construction contracts and other and Electronically recorded ­monetary claims The carrying value of the items that will be settled within a year approximates fair value.

Short-term investment securities and investment securities The fair value of stocks is determined based on quoted market price and the fair value of debt securities is determined based on either quoted market price or prices provided by financial institutions making markets in these securities. Information on securities classified by holding purpose is disclosed in Note 13 “Securities.” Accounts receivable—other Since “Accounts receivable—other” is settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable for construction contracts and other, Electronically recorded obligations, Short-term loans payable, Current portion of nonrecourse loans, Current portion of bonds and Deposits received Since these accounts are settled in a short period of time, the carrying value approximates fair value. The carrying value is the same as fair value. Bonds payable The fair value of bonds issued by the Company is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of bond and current credit risk. To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 84 Long-term loans payable and Nonrecourse loans For fixed rate loans, the fair value is based on the present value of the total principal and interest discounted by an interest rate to be applied if similar new loans were entered into. For floating rate loans, since the market interest rate is reflected in the interest rate set within a short period of time, the carrying value is the same as the fair value.

Segment Information (1) Segment information (a) Overview of reportable segments The reportable segments of the Companies are components for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resource ­allocation and to assess performance. The Building Construction, Civil Engineering and Real Estate Development divisions at the Company are responsible for strategic planning and business development of the building construction, civil engineering and real estate development businesses, respectively. Business operations of the building construction and civil engineering divisions are classified geographically with headquarters and each branch as separate operating units and evaluated individually. The Company’s subsidiaries are also evaluated on an individual basis. The building construction and civil engineering businesses are segmented based on domestic and overseas areas. The Companies therefore have five reportable segments: “domestic building construction,” “overseas building ­construction,” “domestic civil engineering,” “overseas civil engineering” and “real estate.” The overview of each reportable segment is as follows: Domestic building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas building construction: Execution of building construction contracts and related businesses outside Japan Domestic civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses within Japan Overseas civil engineering: Execution of civil engineering construction contracts and related businesses ­outside Japan Real estate: Purchase, sale and rent of real estate properties, development of land parcels and related businesses To Contents OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 94 (b) Accounting treatment for net sales, income (loss), assets, liabilities and others by each segment The accounting methods of the segment are substantially the same as those described in “3.

Subsequent Event Tender Offer for Shares of Obayashi Road Corporation The Company resolved at its board of directors’ meeting held on May 10, 2017 to acquire the common shares (“Common Shares”) of its consolidated subsidiary, Obayashi Road Corporation (“Target Company”) (listed on the First Section of Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (“TSE”) under the Securities Code Number of 1896) through a tender offer (“Tender Offer”) with respect to all of the issued shares of the Target Company (excluding the Common Shares already owned by the Company and treasury shares owned by the Target Company; hereinafter the same) for the purpose of making the Target Company a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. (1) Purposes of the Tender Offer The Company concluded that the Company’s making the Target Company its wholly-owned subsidiary will enable the Company’s group to “prepare the way for the future.” This is because it is considered that doing so will contribute to an increase in the degree of freedom in management of the Company’s group through factors including: avoiding a future conflict of interests among the parent company and minority shareholders that may be caused by listing of both the parent and the subsidiary; speeding up the decision-making for the group’s management strategy; and enabling the further enhancement of compliance at the Target Company through measures including the development and operation of a more effective compliance system under the initiative of the Company. Also, it is considered that the Company’s making the Target Company its wholly-owned subsidiary will be extremely beneficial for increasing the Target Company’s corporate value through enhancement of the management base of the group and improving business efficiency of the entire group. This will enable the Company to share know-how, promote technological development, increase production capacity, increase competitiveness through the centralization of salesrelated information, and effectively allocate human, financial and management resources within the Company’s group, among others. 101 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2017 To Contents (2) Outline of the Target Company About Obayashi Corporation (a) Company name Obayashi Road Corporation (b) Location 8-8, Sarugakucho 2-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo (c) Title and name of representative Hitoshi Hasegawa, Representative Director (d) Contents of business Conducting paving work, civil engineering work, building ­construction and other relevant work under contract as well as business relating to these and others Business Overview (e) Stated capital 6,293 million yen (56,099 thousand U.S. dollars) (f) Date of incorporation August 26, 1933 (3) Overview of the Tender Offer The Company owns 18,746,521 shares (holding ratio: 41.67%, the value is rounded to the second decimal place by CSR rounding up the digit that is five or greater) of the Common Shares, which are listed on the First Section of TSE, and pursuant to the substantial control criteria, the Target Company is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. In the Tender Offer, no maximum or minimum number of shares to be purchased has been set. Therefore, all of the shares offered for sale in response to the Tender Offer will be purchased. Further, because the Company’s purpose is to make the Target Company its wholly-owned subsidiary, if all of the issued shares of the Target Company cannot be acquired through the Tender Offer, the Company plans to carry out a series of procedures (demand for sale of shares Corporate Governance or share consolidation) to make the Company the sole shareholder of the Target Company in order to acquire all of the issued shares of the Target Company. (a) Number of shares to be purchased Number of shares to be purchased: 26,243,052 shares Minimum number of shares to be purchased: — shares Maximum number of shares to be purchased: — shares Corporate Data (Note) The number of shares to be purchased shall be the number of shares (i.e., 26,243,052 shares) that is calculated by the Target Company’s total number of issued shares as at March 31, 2017 (i.e., 46,818,807 shares) less the number of treasury shares held by the Target Company (i.e., 1,829,234 shares) as of the same date and the number of the Common Shares held by the Company (i.e., 18,746,521 shares). (b) Tender Offer period From May 11, 2017 through June 21, 2017 (30 business days) (c) Tender Offer price 940 yen (8 U.S. dollars) per one common share (d) Purchase price 24,668,468,880 yen (219,881,173 U.S. dollars) (Note) The “Purchase price” is an amount calculated by multiplying the number of shares to be purchased (i.e., 26,243,052 shares) by the Tender Offer price per share (940 yen). (e) Commencement date of settlement June 28, 2017 (f) Financing method The Company’s own fund As of May 10, 2017, the Common Shares are listed on the First Section of TSE. Because the Company has not set a maximum number of shares to be purchased through the Tender Offer, the Common Shares may be delisted pursuant to the criteria for delisting provided by TSE, depending on the result of the Tender Offer, after following prescribed procedures. Even if such criteria is not met at the time of the completion of the Tender Offer, if it is decided that a series of procedures to make the Company the sole shareholder of the Target Company will be conducted after the completion of the Tender Offer, the Common Shares will fall under the criteria for delisting and will be delisted after following prescribed procedures. After delisting, the Common Shares may no longer be traded at TSE. Until the expiration of the Tender Offer period on June 21, 2017, the Company has purchased 21,693,435 shares of the Common Shares. As a result, the Company owns 40,439,956 shares (holding ratio: 89.89%) of the Common Shares.
