Plusenergy buildings are characterized by on average generating more energy than its inhabitants spend. We kept on our policy, that no employee is provided with an own company car. The company owns one car that is at everyone’s disposal for business purposes. In exchange, PTC provides Bahncard50 a German Rail loyalty card that offers a 50% discount to all travelling employees. Travels within Europe are therefore mainly undertaken by train.
