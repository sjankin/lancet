As in the previous reporting period, we have received independent external audits for our 2016 report in the issues of energy consumption, carbon dioxide emission, water consumption, training hours, employee breakdown, recruited employees, quitting employees, senior management, occupational health and safety, and total amount of waste by type.

Sincerely, Cevdet Alemdar CEO ABOUT BRİSA (G4-17) 4 A corporation of Bridgestone Corporation, the world’s largest tyre manufacturer, and Sabancı Holding, Brisa is the leader of the Turkish tyre industry. The first product of Brisa, which was established with the initiative of Sabancı Holding and its partners in 1974, was the Lassa brand tyres we started manufacturing as of 1978. In 1988, when the company was named Brisa with an equal partnership realized between Sabancı Holding and the worldwide tyre industry leader Bridgestone Corporation, our leadership journey full of successful initiatives was also started.

Following our first National Quality Award in 1003, we also became the first Turkish company to win the “European Quality Grand Prize” in 1996 thanks to our exceptional performance in business excellence. In 2010, we bought the American based rubber coating company Bandag's Turkey operations from Bridgestone’s European subsidiary Bandag AG, thus extending our family and contributing to both extending the lifetime of tyres and protecting the environment, by providing cost benefits for the transportation with our diversified service portfolio.

We are also importing Firestone brand agricultural tyres, Kinesis brand forklift tyres, and Bridgestone brand motorcycle tyres to offer on the domestic market. While offering this product portfolio to the domestic market through more than 1,300 authorized sales points all across Turkey, we are also delivering our products produced under the brand Lassa with the manual labor of Brisa workers to vehicles owners at almost 580 sales points with a signboard in more than 60 countries.

The share of our Consumer Tyres products with a Wet Grip label value of “C and over” in our sales portfolio: 83% Our customer satisfaction rate: 93.56% Over 1,300 Sales Points with a signboard in Turkey 41,940 man*hour of training for 9,678 participants as part of Brisa Academy training programs We reduced the weight of land transportation in our logistics operations by 55% as against the year 2008. Our Rate of Local Supply: 40.7% CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY DURING PRODUCT LIFECYCLE At Brisa, our product responsibility understanding is based on a managerial approach involving the whole product lifecycle, from the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing to the end user. In this regard, we carry out improvement activities in relation to product safety, we rely on internationally accepted quality standard and management systems in the production stage, and we introduce our products to the market with the highest safety standards. We work to offer fuel efficient and safe tyres with low noise level; we act with the purpose of creating high value added for our customers. The production facilities of Brisa hold ISO TS 16949:2009, ISO 9001:2008, TS EN ISO 9001:2008, TS EN ISO 10002, OHSAS 18001:2007, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, ISO14001:2004, ISO14064-1:2006 and ISO14046:2014 management systems certifications. The accurate and transparent information of our stakeholders regarding our products constitutes one of the essential requirements of our approach in both customer health and safety and responsible marketing. Within the scope of the Tyre Labeling System, our primary reference in this regard, which entered into force in 2012 within the framework of the law of harmonization code of the European Union, tyre performance is evaluated under 3 main criteria, namely fuel efficiency, wet grip and exterior noise. While we fully support these criteria, which reflect 30% of tyre performance in terms of environmental responsibility and driving safety, we also inform our customers regarding other significant criteria. We focus on many parameters in the areas of economy, safety and comfort with the mission of providing vehicle owners with a balanced performance. Instead of product information works that emphasize a single performance criterion, we provide information that will allow 17 drivers to opt for tyres that are suitable for their driving habits and the road and climate conditions they use their vehicles in. In addition to all these information works, we also regularly inform the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization regarding the raw materials we use in production in accordance with the Regulation Concerning the Inventory and Control of Chemicals. In the reporting period, there were no cases of noncompliance with regulations and voluntary rules regarding product and service information and labeling. Wet Gripping Wet gripping represents a significant indicator in terms of our performance in the area of traffic safety. In accordance with our responsible marketing understanding, we transparently share information regarding this parameter, which is significant for reducing traffic accidents during winter months, on all our product labels. We consistently increase the share of our products with a label value of “C and over” for this parameter in our sales portfolio.

The manufacture of RFT tyres, which can travel safely for at least 80 km at 80 km/h even when flat, previously imported by Brisa from Bridgestone plants abroad, was started at Brisa’s İzmit plant as of the year 2016. RESPONSIBLE VALUE CHAIN PRACTICES We do not limit the strategies and practices we develop in order to enhance our social, environmental and economic performance with our own operations; we regard our 18 sustainability approach as our main point of reference in the management of our value chain. We disseminate our sustainability understanding throughout all the components of our value chain; we support the sustainable development of our customers, business partners, and suppliers. We rely on communication mechanisms that all our stakeholders within our value chain can use to communicate their expectations and participate in decision making processes; we ensure the enhancement of our performance in this regard through effective audit activities. Customers We execute efficient customer management practices in order accurately identify the needs and expectations of our customers and to provide solutions that create a difference; we look for ways to enrich customer experience. We both fulfill the requirements of our customer oriented business manner and create a difference in our sector through practices aiming for customer experience to end the same way, that is in satisfaction, always and everywhere and to ensure its continuity. We manage the practices we implement in accordance with our customer management model under the titles of Store, Call Center, Online, and Communicational; we ensure the standardization of customer experience through quality service. With our Customer Contact Points application, through which we regularly communicate with our customers, we support and inform them throughout the product lifecycle. We record, analyze and prioritize the suggestions and opinions of our customers through our Customer Application Management System, thereby producing solutions. We have improved our performance indicator for the guarantee examination and response time for our products, in relation to customer complaints about our products, by 99.8% since the year 2009, and we realized it as 5.4 days. Also in the reporting period, we have conveyed photo responses to 99.9% of our customers as part of our tyrespecific personal photo letter writing practice. Since 2009, we have been regularly conducting a consumer satisfaction survey aiming at measuring the service and quality performance of Brisa dealers and determining the customer satisfaction level for our products and services. In the reporting period, our customer satisfaction level was determined as 93.56%, with an 8.4% increase as against the previous period, in consequence of the survey conducted with the participation of 18,475 people. 19 Customer Satisfaction Survey (%) 93,5 84,0 83,7 86,1 86,3 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Brisa Call Center constitutes one of the primary communication mechanisms through which we acquire customer feedbacks. We identify points of improvements regarding our products and services based on online surveys, focus group studies and the experience maps of our websites; we consistently improve our performance in this regards by making action plans. We design our customer management practices in accordance with our approach of innovation and we actualize exemplary processes that will improve customer experience. We carry out exemplary works and applications aimed at enhancing customer experience at our Model Store, which was designed as a training hub for employees of Brisa and of its business partners to improve retail experience; we provide solution suggestions for our business partners. We continued to increase the number of our Otopratik stores, which we designed in order to improve tyre buying experience through product diversity that meets customer expectations, efficient sales and service processes and technological infrastructure. We opened our 40th Otopratik store, which we actualized with the concept of “perfect customer experience”, in Istanbul. Through the Profleet fleet management model, which we developed in order to gather fleet management solutions under a single roof, we provide our customers with sustainable solutions to manage their operations with minimum cost. With the model, while we provide product and mechanical service support for our customers, we also allow them to regularly report training, budget, central billing, consultancy, road assistance, inventory management, online programs, and all other services and to save on these expenses. Through our Profleet services, which were observed to increase tyre lifetime by 15% on average as well as ensuring 5% of fuel savings according to the latest measurements, we have saved our customers approximately 400 million TL in total, to date. In the reporting period, we launched the eighth link of our sales and service chain for heavy commercial vehicles, ProPratik, in Hatay. With Propratik, we sell and service all tyre, battery, spare part and accessory needs of heavy commercial vehicles, while we provide support to drivers for efficient and safe driving. 20 Business Partners The sustainable development of our dealer network, which constitutes our most important connection with our consumers and plays a vital role in our business success, is among both our business and sustainability priorities. In this direction, we realize various training practices in order to increase our dealers’ competences, we monitor their business and sustainability performances through effective audit mechanisms, and we lend an ear to their expectations through the bidirectional communication mechanisms we put in place. Over 1,300 Sales points with signboard We carry out periodical trainings under several headings in order to support the sustainable development of our dealers. In this scope, we design and conduct trainings aimed at both our dealers and their employees under the roof of Brisa Academy. As Brisa Academy, our fundamental purpose is to ensure the creation of difference in customer experience by sharing our accumulation and experience with all our shareholders. In this regard, in 2016, we provided 41,490 man*hour of training to 9,678 participants, with a 26% increases as against 2015. Also during the reporting period, we provided at least four on-site trainings a year (three trainings for early accomplishers) for 45 of our business partners whose customer satisfaction evaluation score is below the average for Turkey, through Brisa Academy trainers. In consequence of the trainings, we have improved the customer satisfaction scores of our relevant business partners by 10% on average. New Generation at Work at Brisa We maintained the “New Generation at Work” program, which we launched to promote the institutionalization of family companies among our business partners and their introduction to the understanding of sustainable management, in the reporting period. With the certificate program, we designed for the second and third generation family members of our business partners in cooperation with Akbank and Sabancı University Executive Development Unit, we introduced the future generations of our business partners to Brisa and allowed them to have novel experiences. The second term of the certificate program implemented under the roof of Akbank Family Companies Academy was completed with a high level of participation and success. “Dealer Development Projects” constitute another part of the series of practices we put forth in order to support the sustainable development of our dealers. In addition to the projects we developed in this scope, we also share the results of our customer satisfaction surveys with our dealers and we support them in identifying points of improvement. We listen to our dealers’ expectations at meetings we hold with them; we acquire significant feedbacks for both our business and sustainability strategies through working groups we organize. 21 Thanks to the “New Generation at Work” program I attended in 2016, first of all I had the opportunity to see our own workplace through a corporate lens and to clarify the steps to be taken through accurate analyses. It was really beneficial for us in terms of applying our current knowledge and new things we learned about institutionalism at our workplace. I would like to thank Brisa, which has greatly contributed to the growth and development of our workplace, for this productive training and consultancy service. I believe all other business partners need to benefit from this program. Işılay Ümit Tuna Oto Tuna In the reporting period, we launched the “Dealer Council” platform in order to listen more closely to our business partners and to exchange opinions. We plan to maintain the practice we actualized for our wholesale, consumer and commercial dealers with regular intervals. Also in the reporting period, we continued to promote the agriculture fair attendance of our business partners in the agricultural products segment. World of Brisa: Sharing the Journey, Sharing the Future With the meeting held in the reporting period with the theme “World of Brisa: Sharing the Journey, Sharing the Future”, we brought together over 500 of our business partners with our employees. At the meeting, where we communicated the successes of Brisa in 2015, factors that will impact the industry in the future and the priorities of Brisa to our dealers, Brisa managers shared their presentations about Consumer Products Sales & Marketing, Commercial Products Sales & Marketing, and Retail Business and Service. Responsible Supply Chain Practices As a company that aims at disseminating its sustainability understanding throughout its value chain, we attach importance to the social, environmental and economic performances of our suppliers, we actualize a series of communication, training and audit activities characterized as responsible supply chain practices. With our ever-expanding supply chain, we constantly contribute more to the economic development of our operational geography; we set an example for our business partners in our supply chain through works we carry out under the headings of human rights, employee rights, occupational health and safety, business ethics and environmental impacts. Purchasing At Brisa, we collaborate with suppliers who respect the society and environment, we prefer institutions that are sensitive towards climate change, conduct energy efficiency works, provide their employees with healthy and safe workplaces and respect basic human rights when selecting our suppliers. We promote the social, environmental and economic performances of our suppliers who adopt our sustainability understanding, thereby ensuring improvement in our operational processes and achieving mutual benefit. 22 In 2015, we have composed the “Brisa Responsible Purchasing Policy” in order to cooperate with our stakeholders in our value chain with regard to sustainability management and to enhance sustainability awareness among our suppliers. In accordance with our policy, we expect our suppliers to adopt our approaches in the issues of human rights, employee rights, occupational health and safety, business ethics and environmental impacts. We demand suppliers whom we determine to be noncompliant to present a remediation plan in order to ensure compliance with the policy. We end our commercial relationship with suppliers that do not conform to the compliance process or fail to realize the remediation within the allotted time, thereby ensuring the compliance of our suppliers with our policies. We aim to establish a system for our suppliers to confirm that they have read and understood our Responsible Purchasing Policy, in the forthcoming reporting period. You can access detailed information regarding Brisa Responsible Purchasing Policy at http://www.brisa.com.tr/kurumsal/sorumlu-satinalma. Within the scope of the Supplier Acceptance Evaluation System we engaged in the reporting period, we subject supplier candidates to evaluation in terms of their compliance with our purchasing policy and we cooperate with suppliers that pass the evaluation. We ensure that relevant companies approve of the purchasing conditions before the purchase takes place, we inform them of our expectations in a transparent and effective manner. In the reporting period, 30 of our existing suppliers were evaluated within the system, while 5 new suppliers were added to our supplier pool in result of evaluations. Our Supplier Portals are the primary communication mechanism we have formed for our stakeholders in our supply chain. At the portals, that were established for the purpose of achieving effective and transparent communication, SA-Etik Business Ethics Principles, Brisa Environmental Policy, Brisa OHS Policy and Responsible Purchasing Policy, Business Excellence Policy, Information Security Policy and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy documents are available for suppliers’ access. A significant portion of the raw materials we consume in our production processes only exist at certain parts of the world. Pursuant to our local supply policy, we conduct localization works for import-dependent raw materials, we look for ways to increase our contribution to the national economy. We have increase our raw material localization rate, which was realized as 4% in 2011, to the level of 11% in 2016. Also in consequence of our localization efforts, we have increase our local supply rate, which was realized as 38% in 2014, to the level of 39.9% in 2015, and 40.7% in the reporting period. Supplier Audits Periodical supplier audits have an important place among our responsible supply chain practices. We continuously improve the social, environmental and economic performance of our supply chain and we accompany their sustainable growth through audit practices designed separately for our raw material suppliers and suppliers from whom we purchase 23 machine, equipment and service, which we carry out in accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO TS 16949 quality standards. During the audits in the reporting period, no current or probable negative environmental impact was identified in our supply chain. All companies, from whom we purchase more than six raw material shipments during a half year, are evaluated by our Purchasing, Technology, Quality Assurance, Occupational Safety and Environment departments at the end of the half year, within the context our Supplier Management System and Supplier Quality Scoring Standards. The results of these evaluations as well as opportunities for improvement are shared with our suppliers and the remedial actions planned by our suppliers are monitored. At the end of every year, we review the total performance of our suppliers throughout the year on the basis of half year evaluation results and the raw material related quality problem records of our suppliers and we identify the best performing, most in need of improvement, and audit candidates among suppliers. In result of this annual evaluation, we share their areas of potential improvement with our suppliers and we form our annual supplier audit plan. Besides, we reward our best performing suppliers with a “Thank You Letter”. In this reporting period, we subjected 32 raw material suppliers to yearend evaluations, rewarded 4 suppliers with “Thank You Letters” for their outstanding performance, and determined various areas of improvement for 19 suppliers and shared with them. The surveys filled out by relevant Brisa employees regarding suppliers, from whom we procure machine, equipment and services, are evaluated by our Internal Purchasing Department. We consider suppliers, who exceed 0.1% of non-raw material purchases or 50 item orders annually, within the scope of the annual evaluation system. In the reporting period, 158 suppliers, from among 856 suppliers we cooperate with, were evaluated through a total of 858 surveys filled out by 233 members of staff and scores calculate by the system. We have rewarded our ten best performing suppliers with thank you letters, and our best supplier with a thank you plaque. Also in the reporting period, three suppliers were subjected to audits within the framework of ISO 27001 Information Security Standard. In the reporting period, there was no supplier whose contract was terminated due to noncompliance with basic human rights or business ethics principles. A Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Self-Evaluation Form is sent to global suppliers once every year by Bridgestone and is requested to be filled out by the supplier. As part of this practice we carry out in cooperation with Bridgestone, 9 of our raw material suppliers from Turkey were evaluated by Brisa in the reporting period and submitted to Bridgestone Global System. 24 Subcontractor Approach The criteria of respect for basic human rights, legal compliance, and conformance to our business ethics principles constitute the basis for our subcontractor approach. In line with this approach, which we take as basis for selecting the subcontractor companies we will cooperate with, we carry out communication, training, and audit activities aimed at our subcontractors. We make an effort for employees of subcontractor companies to achieve healthy, safe and dignified working conditions; we monitor the accident free performance of the companies. We also inform subcontractor employees about our organizations and processes in accordance with their position, task and responsibilities; we provide them with trainings in the areas of occupational health and safety, professional-technical equipment, and environment. Environmentally Friendly Logistics Operations In accordance with our sustainability approach, which considers the whole lifecycle of our products and services, we engage practices that will minimize the environmental impacts of our storage and distribution operations. We prioritize seaway and railway transportation, which have less environmental impact, in our logistics operations; we consistently decrease the weight of land transportation in all our operations. We choose optimal locations for our warehouses to ensure more transfers with less fuel consumption; we also extend the use of electric forklifts in our warehouse operations to reduce our emission amount. In the reporting period, we carried out 67% of our logistics operations by seaway, and 6% by railway, while we reduced the weight of land transportation by 55% as against the year 2008. Also in the reporting period, we have reduced our carbon emission rate per trip for our domestic shipment distribution operations by 1.4% as against 2015, in consequence of the route optimization works we carried out. GENERATING AND DISTRIBUTING MORE ECONOMIC VALUE As a result of our understanding of being a responsible producer, we generate values for our stakeholders in different fields and we share these values with them. One of these is the economic value we generate. Besides the financial value generated in consequence of our operations, we also create value through our investments, projects and products. While the annual combined growth rate of BRISA shares processes at Istanbul Stock Exchange in the last 5 years was realized as 10%; during the same period, Istanbul Stock Exchange index has decreased by 0.02% and the industry index has increased by 6.7%. Brisa Share Close (as of 12/31) 8,73 7,47 4,22 6,18 4,04 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 25 We continued the works for our new production facility being built in Aksaray, whose works were started in 2014 and which is planned to be engaged in 2018, during the reporting period. With our investment, we will provide direct employment opportunities and positively contribute to the current deficit through the achieved additional capacity. Brisa, a worldwide brand, will both reduce its own costs and contribute immensely to the economy of Aksaray in particular, and of Turkey in general, by investing in Aksaray which is geographically located in the middle of our country and has easy access to airports and ports. Besides causing a spike in the commercial activities of suppliers operating in the region of the investment, it will also be a role model for supplier companies with its corporate structure. In addition to Brisa’s high level of confidence in its suppliers and employees, we see in their practices that their control mechanisms are equally rigorous. As we witnessed in the process of investment, the importance attributed to product and service quality, the value attributed to occupational safety and especially employee health, the sensitivity towards the subsistence of suppliers, the emphasis on fairness in commerce will contribute to the development of the culture of investment, as well as the development of the regional economy. Atila Bora Akın Koçak Elektrik / Finance Manager In 2016, 134.5 million USD worth of investment was made in relation to the second plant being established in the Aksaray Organized Industrial Zone. The total amount of investment made for our Aksaray plant to date is 183.6 million USD. In the reporting period, we obtained 310 million USD in investment finance, of which 150 million USD from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and 160 million USD as syndicated loan awarded by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Corporate Banking unit. We will be using this financing for our second plant investment, whose construction in Aksaray Organizad Industrial Zone is ongoing, and other general needs. At the same time, we will cooperate in the coming days with EBRD to develop technical and professional training programs in order for the youth to acquire beneficial skills that can meet the needs of the industry. Brisa, who has invested in Aksaray, the prominent industrial hub of the last years, will profit both the regional economy and the national economy, as international company. Especially for local companies like ourselves, the effective trainings they provide in issues such as occupational safety, employee health and environment will allow us to improve and provide better services. I would like to thank Brisa for their contributions in our development. Ramazan Koçak Koçak Elektrik / Company Owner The seismic isolators, which we have introduced to the market as of 2015, prevent loss of life and property by providing high earthquake resistance and vibration damping in buildings where they are applied. Bridgestone seismic isolators, which are manufactured from rubber and metal raw materials with superior technology, are used in many areas including 26 hospitals, road structures, research and information centers, as well as residential buildings of differing elevation. In ten years, 312 million TL was contributed to the national economy by means of end-of-life tyres collected from the market. With regard to the collection of worn out tyres that are turned into floor covering for children’s parks and artificial turf for football fields, as well as being used as fuel in the cement sector, we act with the awareness of our responsibility as Brisa. In this regard, we support the process of collecting, in compliance with regulations, and recycling of worn out tyres for the benefit of the environment and economy carried out by Tyre Industrialists Association (LASDER). As of the reporting period, we started to locally produce some products we used to import. Our size 6 LM001 and size 6 T001 products are now being manufactured in our country. In 2017, various sizes and patterns under the roof of our Dayton brand will start being manufactured locally. We can now produce these sizes, that are among the most popular on the market, within our body, we are therefore proud to have increased our contribution to the national economy.

Our most important objective for the forthcoming years is to work for increasing the number of ideas shared by our coworkers and to contribute to a sustainable environment and economy by implementing their ideas. Tuğçe Kurtoğlu Internal Purchasing Expert – Brisa Innovation Team Member since 2014 Working at a company that aims for the integration of innovation in all its processes both excites me and makes me feel proud. As members of the innovation team, while contributing to the management of innovation processes, we both put forth our own ideas and support the development of our coworkers’ ideas. I believe we are making a significant contribution to our future through environmentally friendly projects that we will implement in line with the sustainability approach, one of the primary concerns of our team.

DIGITALIZATION As Brisa, we are in the course of a transformation from an industrial company into an innovation company. As a natural result of our innovation culture and sustainability approach, we are integrating our systems and processes with digital platforms to ensure the accurate, efficient and reliable use of information through our digitalization works. With these works, which allow us to make more efficient use of company resources, to develop new business models, to design innovative products and services, to form unique customer experiences, we lead our sector and we create value added for our stakeholder through analytical and mobile solutions. TPMS Application As part of the application, a device is installed on the valve to send the pressure and temperature of the tyre. Vehicle information, device information, and the ideal pressure of the vehicle tyre is entered in the TPMS application. This device sends the tyre pressure and temperature data of the vehicle every time the vehicle passes through TPMS towers. Whenever data is received, the system calculates the tyre pressure in terms of temperature and compares to the desired pressure. If the level of pressure is higher or lower by more than 10%, identified company representatives are sent an email and text message. Through our digitalization works, we both constitute innovative and efficient channels for stakeholder participation and achieve operational excellence. We encourage the mobile use 29 of Brinsan Integrated Human Resources portal, which was established to provide our employee with fast and secure access to human resources data.

An Environmental Impact Report was prepared in order to be able to control the probable environmental impacts of our operation in the construction stage and production phase; impacts were analyzed and measures to be taken were identified. Our facility is not located on natural protected areas identified by national or international agreements, special environmental protection areas or RAMSAR (Convention on Wetlands of International Importance) areas. We started works for protecting biodiversity and species with the plot allotment. In this regard, 3,500 saplings were planted in our facility plot as of 2016 yearend. In this way, approximately 1,680 tons of CO2 emission was prevented. ENERGY AND EMISSION MANAGEMENT The effects of climate are becoming increasingly apparent in different ways with each passing day. The business world also bears great responsibilities in combating climate change. With the awareness of this responsibility, we consider the efficient use of energy to be one of the cornerstones of our business manner. Mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts caused by our production activities is among our strategic targets. In this regard, we conduct systematic 33 activities monitored by our senior management. Practices regarding climate change are reflected on the business strategies of Brisa takes place in two stages. In the first stage, Bridgestone Group Environmental Committee identifies global policies regarding climate change with the coordination of the Global Management Platform; these policies are then shared with strategic business units and it is ensured that they are internalized and implemented by companies. Whereas in the second stage, detailed implementation plans are prepared on the national scale with regard to the policies identified by Bridgestone Group Environmental Committee and realizations are periodically monitored and reported. Besides these practices, we also closely follow national and international studies about climate change and their results to actively evaluate their impacts on our business processes. We also contribute to the development of national policies in this regard. We have completed certification works for the verification of our activities aimed at reducing climate change impacts and greenhouse gas emissions as well as our performance by an accredited institution, in 2016. In this regard, we were entitled to receive ISO 14064 Verification of Greenhouse Gas Emissions certification including the year 2015. The efficient use of energy is part of our sustainability understanding, as well as our operational strategy. In this context, we attach great importance to ensuring energy efficiency through regular review and evaluation works. Brisa Museum and Academy In the reporting period, we provided 42% of the lighting power of LEED Gold certified Brisa Museum and Academy buildings from solar panels. In this regard, we have prevented greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 17,742 kWh of energy produced. Total Energy Consumption (Index GJ/production ton, Base: 2008=100) 95 91 91 90 88 87 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Target X14 We increased our energy savings through Efficiency Projects fourteen-fold compared to 2008. 34 Energy Savings Achieved Through Efficiency Projects (Cumulative Index GJ/production ton, Base: 2008=100) 1477 1400 1313 1222 1086 968 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Target Our total energy consumption in 2016 increased by 2.28% as against the previous reporting period. The main reason for this increase is the malfunction in the facilities of our supplier of steam power, which is among our direct energy sources, requiring us to instead generate steam power within our own processes. In comparison with the base year of 2008, our energy use during the reporting period has decreased by 10%. We have also reduced our indirect energy consumption by 2.33% as against the previous reporting period. In the reporting period, we have achieved 1.7% of energy savings in comparison to the previous reporting period by means of projects we actualized in relation to electricity and steam consumption. We have achieved a fourteen-fold increase in the amount of savings we ensured, as against the year 2008. As Brisa, we aim to reduce our greenhouse gas emission per production unit by 25% in comparison with the year 2005, by 2020. As of 2016 yearend, we have realized this target by 21%. Since there is a decrease in our total emissions, because of the decrease in production volume there is an increase in emission density in the reporting period. 35 Total Carbondioxide Emmission (Scope 1 & Scope 2) (ton CO2-e/production ton) (Index, Base: 2008-100) 96 93 89 90 91 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 We have prevented the release of 1,814 tons of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases by means of the energy efficiency projects we carried out in 2016. “Turkey Climate Disclosure Award” By reporting regularly since 2011 and publicly in 2015, we became one of the five companies in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) in Turkey. In 2016, we were deemed worthy of the “Turkey Climate Disclosure Leadership Award” for the second time. In 2016, we were entitled to receive a leadership award with our “A-” score on the platform where the global and national averages are at the level of “C (awareness)”. This result indicated that Brisa is executing a successful operation to manage climate change and that it fulfills its responsibilities in terms of sustainability through emission mitigation works. In the reporting period, we carried out 67% our logistics operations by seaway and 6% by railway, while we reduced the share of land transportation by 55% as against the year 2008. In result of the route optimization works we conducted also during the reporting period, we have reduced our carbon emission rate per kilometer in our domestic transportation and distribution operations. EFFICIENT USE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND LESS WASTE The sustainability of our business is directly related with the responsible and efficient management of natural resource use. This understanding is also significant with regard to the mitigation of the environmental impact of our operations. For this reason, we evaluate the environmental impacts that will arise during and after the use and consumption of our products in the design stage with a proactive approach, taking care to use raw materials with no pollution or health risks. We make effective and efficient use of natural resources thanks to our improvement and awareness raising works. 36 Within the framework of our sustainability approach, production in harmony with nature, effective resource management, and works for reducing our corporate water footprint constitute the main approaches that are emphasized. In this direction, targets were set for water withdrawal in 2020. By 2020, we aim to have reduced our water consumption by 61% as against the year 2008. In this direction, we are carrying out efficiency projects within the scope of our environmental management practices. Since 2008, the integration of water management in our business strategies was ensured and the amount of withdrawn underground water at this concentration was reduced by 49% in volume. In this way, a total of 2.4 million USD worth of savings was achieved between the years 2008 and 2016. In order to have an entirely consistent, accurate and transparent verification process harmonized with operations when achieving targets, the amounts of underground water withdrawn between the years 2012 and 2016 were verified according to the Assurance Audit Standard (GDS 3000) within the scope of the Sustainability Report, and the amounts of underground water withdrawn between the years 2012 and 2016 were verified according to ISO 14064 Water Footprint Standard by independent audit institutions. Risks and opportunities were analyzed within the framework of the sustainability approach with the “Water Scarcity Footprint Report” prepared as required by ISO 14064 Standard, thereby forming the long term water management policy of the company. Total Well Water Usage (m3) 530.738 490.120 443.755 438.486 453.517 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 In consequence of the practices enacted within the context of reducing the amount of withdrawn underground water for household and industrial use, we achieved a 7.5% decrease as against the previous reporting period. As of the end of the reporting period, we exceeded the global target as Brisa, reducing our water withdrawal amount by 49% in comparison with the year 2008. 37 Our Water Footprint Performance As Brisa, we reported to the CDP Global Water Report, which we applied in the previous reporting period, at the executive level with a performance score of “B” on the platform where the global average is “B (executive)” and the national average is “C (awareness)”. Sustainable Business Awards We were deemed worthy of an award in the category of Water Management with our “Project for Mitigating the Underground Water Drawn at Brisa Izmit Facilities”, at the “Sustainable Business Awards” organized for the third time this year by the Sustainability Academy. We treat the wastewaters generated in consequence of our processes at a biological treatment facility and we discharge them to the Izmit Water and Sewer Administration collector. As part of this process, we observe and track the compliance of our facilities through periodical measurements we conduct. As part of our works aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of our operations, the issue of waste management has a special significance. In this regard, we actualize integrated waste management practices; we take into consideration environmental risks that will occur during the use and consumption of our products in the designing stage and we take care to use raw materials free of contamination and health risks. In relation to waste management, we switched to the “Zero Waste” practice in our Izmit facilities on December 1, 2015. As part of this practice; • We are not sending any solid waste from our plant to waste fields, • We are reusing the solid wastes generated at our facilities, • Recycling them, • Recovering them. As of the beginning of 2016, we have achieved our zero-waste field target and we maintain works at preserving this target. 38 Hazardous Wastes (ton) 761 661 672 680 640 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 WWF Green Office Program Certificate Green Office Practices are carried out by World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) to ensure savings and improvement at offices. Institutions participating in the program systematically evaluate their office resources, determine savings criteria and design an environmental management system for their offices within this framework. In the reporting period, we maintained the works we started within the scope of the Green Office Program in 2014, carrying our successful practices further by qualifying to receive WWF Green Office Certificate. In addition to projects aimed for the efficient use of essential needs, such as water, electricity and paper, at offices, we reduced our organic waste amount by 17.5% as against the year 2014. In consequence of the improvement and renovation works we carried out, we prevented the use of 900 1.5 L pet bottles and 1,054 plastic demijohns, thereby reducing our plastic waste amount by 928 kg. By replacing plastic cups with glass cups at our Izmit plant cafeteria, we achieved 21 tons less of plastic waste. With the engagement of the e-Books module on Brisa Academy Training Portal, the printing and distribution of training materials were discontinued. In this way, approximately 60,000 A4 size paper sheets were saved. “With its original Green Office hero, logo, manifesto, screen saver and short film, Brisa team had very warm internal communications. Cooperating with them was very enjoyable for us, as they took preventions that set an example for other Green Offices with their innovative ideas. Reducing the amount of waste sent to sanitary landfills, especially the mitigation of the amount of organic waste per person by 23% within a single year, and the reinforcement of the recycling system were very significant gains from our viewpoint. In the forthcoming period, we are expecting new improvements in other areas from the Green Office team, in accordance with the philosophy of Kaizen.” Arzu Balkuv Projects Director WWF-Turkey 39 We support the process of collecting, in compliance with regulations, and recycling of worn out tyres for the benefit of the environment and economy carried out by Tyre Industrialists Association (LASDER). In this regard, we ensured the collection and recycling of 87,000 tons of tyres during the reporting period. In accordance with Packaging Waste Control Regulations, we ensure that a certain ratio of the packaging materials of marketed products are collected and recycled through the agency of Environmental Protection and Packaging Waste Recovery and Recycling Foundation (ÇEVKO). In this regard, we contributed to the recycling of 3 tons of packaging waste in the year 2016. RESPECT FOR BIODIVERSITY While conducting our operations, we avoid processes that might have a negative impact on biodiversity. In this regard, we act in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations in the implementation of our new investments. We ensure that risks that might arise are audited and evaluated by accredited institutions. Relevant studies show that no protected areas where biodiversity might be harmed are located on or near the operation field of Brisa. In the reporting period, the “Turnalar Hep Uçsun” (Let Cranes Fly Forever) project, which Brisa is conducting in collaboration with WWF-Turkey (World Wildlife Foundation), completed its third year. Works carried out within the scope of the project in the Çukurova Delta where 95% of some 10,000 cranes spending the winter in our country take shelter are as follows; 30 villages were visited in the region and 2,000 crane education booklets were shared with primary school students. Awareness works were carried out at various places in the region, such as schools, hunters’ associations, village coffeehouses. ‘Ancient Friends of Çukurova: Cranes’ signboards provide information about cranes to visitors at three different points. The project team regularly comes together with public servants, hunters, farmers and children to conduct meetings for the protection of cranes and supports them to protect cranes. In the reporting period, significant findings were acquired regarding the current status of cranes through observation studies, various public awareness raising works were carried out aimed at the local community, and crane observation activities were organized with students at Yumurtalık Lagoon in the Çukurova Delta, as part of the project. 40 https://www.facebook.com/wwfturkiye/videos/10155972189752802/ ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES We make an effort for our products and services to be “environment friendly” by taking into consideration the environmental impacts of products during and after use.

I can characterize the attitude of Brisa family, of which I have been a member for over one and a half years, towards occupational health, safety, and environment as one of the most significant experiences in my six-year long working life. Brisa, which has a philosophy that ensures the emphasis placed on the occupational health and environment approach is conveyed from the highest level to the lowest level, by creating awareness not only among its own staff but also reflecting this to its partners, maintains its position as an important institution in this regard. The privilege of being part of a culture that continuously invests on occupational health, safety, and environmental sensitivity and sincerely makes this into its first priority is truly inspiring and enjoyable. I wish the future to bring us an accident free, healthy, and environmentally sensitive business life and working environment and that this awareness survives through generations. Tolga YÜKSEL Development Engineer (Brisa Aksaray) BRİSA-MEC (Manufacturing Education Center) Brisa-MEC is an organization that was established to develop and implement training programs aimed at enhancing the basic skill levels and awareness of our Technical Group employees. We provide our employees with trainings in 6 essential areas at our Manufacturing Education Center. In addition to these basic trainings, Team Leader Development trainings with the coordination of the Department of Human Resources, as well as extra trainings arising from needs are also provided to our employees at our center. We provide our employees with a 26-hour training in 8 headings, such as occupational safety, fire and disaster prevention, as part of our standard training program aimed at raising awareness among our blue-collar employees. We aim for all our blue-collar employees to have received the trainings within the scope of the Standard training program by 2018 yearend. In the reporting period, we provide 49,191 person*hours of training to 12.848 person (including subcontractor employees) Together with the 1,268 man*hour of Suru-Raku and 3S trainings we provided to 317 employees during the reporting period, 100% of all our employees have completed these trainings. In the reporting period, we have provided training for 813 employees within the context of “Occupational Safety Simulation” trainings, which were developed in 2014 with the purpose of raising awareness among our blue-collar employees regarding risks in the areas of occupational safety and production, thereby ensuring that 54% our employees have received this training in total. We aim to increase this figure to 100% in the forthcoming reporting period. 51 Since I started working in the Baking Department at Brisa six years ago, I have worked at various positions. During my work life, the words I heard most frequently were “Work Safety”. Also, during these six years, the activities that I appropriated, cared about and contributed most were Work Safety activities. In this regard, the occupational safety simulation, disaster prevention, work safety, 3S trainings offered by BRISA-MEC, and the KY trainings at the plant; RA, 8 Basic Rules, Similar Incident, etc. activities improved my safety awareness at work and in my social life, allowing me feel more secure against potential risks. In this regard, work safety indisputably comes first in the order of importance. Even though it has become a lifestyle for me to, question the risks before starting to work whatever I am doing, engage in work after having secured myself and others around me, implement all these gains and the knowhow I have developed in work safety, I am aware that it is of vital importance that these are conveyed to future generations and that this is my professional and social duty. I support all the systems and activities developed by Brisa in this area and I contribute to their improvement with my suggestions. Yasin KÖKYAR Baking Operator We do not limit our Occupational Health & Safety practices with Brisa employees. We assume a similar responsible approach against subcontractors / suppliers, visitors and interns operating in our field. As of the year 2015, a majority of subcontractor employees have become Brisa employees. These works, which were previously being conducted by subcontractor companies, are being performed under the roof of Brisa following the given date.

In accordance with this understanding, we regularly make evaluations in consideration of the views and feedbacks of our employees in relevant issues. With the awareness that our employees are the most important component of the successes we achieve, we take the rights of our employees into consideration to the utmost degree. Business Relations and Union Rights We respect our employees’ basic rights emanating from constitutional and international agreements, and we make a maximum effort to completely fulfill the responsibilities we bear.

Business Ethics Approach Our business ethics rules are a significant advisor in our decisions and activities. We conduct our operations respecting human rights and workforce principles in accordance with the guidance of SA-ETIK “Business Ethics Rules”. In line with our principle of “Providing Equal Opportunities for People under Equal Conditions”, we provide equal opportunities for our employees in all processes throughout their working life. We do not tolerate any form of discrimination; we take careful precautions in our processes. 53 We continued the Employment and Awareness Projects as well as the Support Projects, which we started in 2013 by becoming a signatory of the United Nations Equality at Work Declaration, this year and we expanded our solution seeking to also include our value chain in accordance with this understanding. We wanted to gather our works, such as Safe Drive Techniques and various other trainings we provide for our women employees, “Design the Work You Love” workshop realized for our women executives and special social responsibility activity for Women’s Day, as well as all works we shall further actualize aimed at women under a brand and visualize it. We also maintained our programs that contribute to Women Designing the Future and our Equality at Work journey, in the reporting period. We inform our employees regarding our Business Ethics Rules by publishing them on the internal communication portal, distributing printed booklets to all employees and realizing information trainings. Every year, we update the information of our employees regarding business ethic rules through the e-learning program and we renew their commitment to business ethics rules with the “Business Ethics Compliance Declaration” they fill out.

We create shareable values through activities we carry out in accordance with our understanding of “social responsibility conscious management”; we contribute to social, cultural and economic development with projects we design and implement in light of our sustainability understanding. We act in light of principle of maintaining good relations with the local community in all our projects, we take the expectations of all our stakeholders, primarily local communities, as basis. As a prominent player in the tyre industry, we actualize pioneering practices in the issue of traffic safety, which closely concerns our sector; we take part in projects that will contribute to sectoral practices. We produce long termed projects that generate value in the fields of education and sports. We also provide support for projects carried out by H. Ömer Sabancı Foundation, besides these projects we conduct with our own resources.  We measured the tread depth and air pressure of 40,000 vehicles and adjusted them with the Bridgestone “#Emniyetimiziçin2dk” (#2mn4oursafety) project.  We traveled to 156 villages in 21 provinces, and gave productive sustainable agriculture practices training to around 3,000 farmers with “Tarım Sağlamsa Gelecek Sağlam” (Strong Agriculture for a Strong Future) Project.  40 women employees who participated the Safe Drive Techniques Training received their Ministry of National Education approved certificates.  We continued to support public enterprises and NGOs.  We hosted 1,632 people at Brisa Museum, in 2016 alone.  We won 124 medals at national and international competitions with Brisaspor.  We completed the second term of the “New Generation at Work” program with high attendance and success. CONTRIBUTION TO TRAFFIC SAFETY As a responsible producer, we consider the issues of tyre safety and traffic safety to be our primary responsibilities, we support our product safety works with social projects enhancing traffic safety awareness. As one of the pioneering institutions of the industry that became signatories of the “Responsibility in Traffic Movement Declaration”, we carry out practices such as awareness activities aimed at different stakeholder groups and tyre safety inspections we conduct for traffic safety, thereby fulfilling our responsibilities in this field. Bridgestone “#Emniyetimiziçin2dk” (#2mn4oursafety) With the Bridgestone “#Emniyetimiziçin2dk” (#2mn4oursafety) campaign we launched in 2013, we carry out inspection and awareness raising activities regarding tyre the issues of tread depth and tyre pressure, which are critical for safe driving. The expert teams of Bridgestone get together with drivers in areas, such as gas stations and ferryboat piers, where the density of vehicles is high to measure their tyre tread depth and tyre pressure. We advised vehicle owners whose tyre tread depth was below the safe limit to renew their tyres as soon as possible and we appropriately pumped air into tyres with low air pressure, thereby raising awareness of road safety. Through the works we performed at IDO piers and 56 OPET stations in 7 different provinces during the year 2016, we have reached out to approximately 40,000 people. Safe Drive Training for Women Drivers We aim for our employees to keep their vehicle safe in case of danger and to adjust ideally to road and traffic conditions with the Safe Drive Techniques Training, which we developed for our women employees and realized in cooperation with Intercity. Within the scope of the project we engaged in 2015, 45 women employees benefited from the training and received their Ministry of National Education approved certificate, during the reporting period. “Tarım Sağlamsa Gelecek Sağlam” (Strong Agriculture for a Strong Future) with Lassa With the “Tarım Sağlamsa Gelecek Sağlam” (Strong Agriculture for a Strong Future) project, which we launched with our Lassa brand with the mission of offering value to farmers, we provide our farmers with free consultancy services regarding agricultural good practices, efficient vehicle use, and safe driving. We have included consultancy services in the field of sustainable agriculture practices, in accordance with the needs of farmers, in the project, which we started in 2013 with the practice of free reflector mounting aiming to prevent accidents that occur because trailers are not distinguished in the dark. We come together with farmers through collaborations with agricultural cooperatives and activities such as “Lassa Köy Yollarında” (Lassa on Village Roads); we conduct awareness raising activities through the agency of agricultural engineers. As part of the project, we have directly reached out to around 3,000 farmers in 156 villages in 21 provinces and we provided farmers with information and consultancy services regarding efficiency practices in agriculture and agricultural economy in accordance with the variety of produce in their regions at every stop of the practice, during the reporting period. While we provided our farmers with trainings about ways to prevent traffic accidents and safe driving, we continued our product and service works to offer robust and durable agricultural tyres protecting the soil. We provided nearly 20,000 farmers with information about sustainable agriculture practices and mounted more than 12,000 reflectors to date, as part of the project. CONTRIBUTION TO SECTORAL PRACTICES As one of the leading player of the tyre industry, we design projects that will contribute to the sustainable development of our sector; we actualize effective practices in various areas ranging from women’s empowerment to the development of the value chain. Not only do we actively participate in national and international initiatives formed by public institutions and nongovernmental organizations, we also strive for the generalization of our sustainability understanding across our sector through activities based on information, accumulation and experience sharing. New Generation at Work at Brisa We maintained the “New Generation at Work” program, which we actualized for the purpose of promoting the institutionalization of family companies among our business partners and their introduction to the sustainable management understanding, in the 57 reporting period. With the certification program, we designed for the second and third generation family members of our business partners, in cooperation with Akbank and Sabancı University Executive Development Unit (EDU), we introduced the future generations of our business partners to Brisa and provided them with the opportunity to have new experiences. The second term of the certificate program implemented under the roof of Akbank Family Companies Academy was completed with a high level of participation and success. Heroes of the Customer We are producing projects that will promote the strong presence of women professionals in the tyre industry and add value to their lives under the roof the Women Designing the Future platform with our vision of “designing the future of travel”. With the “Heroes of the Customer” practice we engaged in the reporting period, we started a Customer Experience Expert certificate program aimed at women employees working at the stores of our business partners. With this program, which aims to contribute to the personal and professional development of women professionals in our sector, we have both added a new one to our works for women’s empowerment and actualized a practice that will contribute to the development of our sector. I can say that the trainings we received at Brisa Academy have transformed my perspective on my job. I have understood once again the significance of our job, the importance of offering the right product to vehicle users. I was informed regarding the significance of customer satisfaction in the continuity of institutions and how teamwork brings success. I believe these trainings should be maintained and all employees should benefit from them. I would like thank the Brisa Academy family, who made it possible for me to become more ware about my own profession, for all their efforts. Saime Yıldırım Kerim Ticaret Within the context of the program offered in three modules at Brisa Academy, content and information in a wide range of subjects including basic tyre training, retail training, store management, innovation, sustainability, team work, and customer satisfaction, aimed at ensuring the best customer experience and sectoral development are offered.

My self-confidence was also boosted. I learned how to find solutions for problems through effective communication. By also sharing what I learnt with by teammates at the workplace, I also contributed to my company. These opportunities offered to us by Brisa Academy had a significant influence on our customers recommending us to others and the extension of our customer portfolio. I would like thank the Academy for providing us with these opportunities. Fatma ŞAFAK Kerim Ticaret 58 Our Sustainability Hero Betül Demirel from Dalita OtoPratik!
