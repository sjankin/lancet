most senior decision maker of the organization Dear Readers, FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft is among the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide and still improves every year in economic, social and environmental fields. FAI stands for individual mobility for its customers and sustainable solutions at the same time. FAI is one of the 10 largest operators in General Aviation in Europe and the largest business jet operator in Germany. FAI’s 21 jet aircraft include three Bombardier Global Express, five Bombardier Challenger 604, ten Learjet 60, two Learjet 55 and one Learjet 35. In 2016 FAI recorded an operational income of approximately € 75 Mio. Besides the headquarters at Albrecht Dürer Airport Nuremberg (EDDN), FAI operated satellite offices in Dubai, Miami and Moscow, as well as line stations in Kabul (until June 2016), Baghdad (until December 2016), Entebbe (until June 2016), Bamako and Dakar. On August 17, 2016 ground was broken for FAI’s third hangar at Albrecht Dürer Airport Nuremberg. The new hangar, known as Hangar 8, represents an investment of € 7 Mio. and will increase FAI’s hangar floor by another 4.500 m², bringing the total usable space of the facility to 13.500 m², representing one of the largest carbon neutral FBO’s in Europe. Hangar 8 was fully operational from May 2017 on. In October 2016 we have been awarded a one-year public tendered contract to operate two Learjet 60s out of Algiers, the capital of Algeria. The aircraft will be used for multi-purpose missions including both passenger transport and medevac services. This latest win underlines our company’s capabilities on African continent which has already included operations with aircraft based in Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Mali. Since 2005 FAI is an active member of the United Nation’s Global Compact. This membership reflects FAI’s efforts in economic, social efforts and ecological areas. Corporate responsibility and the reporting of corporate responsibility strategies and programs at FAI continue to be a work in progress. While initiatives and programs, as well as progress from year to year are discussed, we recognize the need to report quantifiable metrics and targets, in particular as they relate to our social performance and economic impact. These are a lot of goals to reach for FAI and we are willing to reach and improve them every year. Please follow us on our way. With kind regards Dr Siegfried Axtmann Chairman and CEO ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 4 UN Global Compact statement of continued support Since July 2005 we are an active member of the UN Global Compact and make a continuous effort towards sustainable development of our company.

The Company is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of four (4) executive members. The Executive Board is responsible for all decisions regarding economic, environmental and social impacts. G4-18 Method for defining report content and differentiation of aspects Process for defining the report contents and aspect boundaries: In order to define the material aspects and boundaries of the report, we used as a foundation the quick check of the sustainability software 360report. In the first step, we evaluated the data base in the GRI stakeholder survey of the sector air transportation (primarily passenger air transportation), in order to take the size of FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft into account. In the second step, we adapted the materiality matrix using an initial selection of indicators and aspects. This adaptation as well as the selection of relevant indicators are based on the contribution of the Executive Assistant to Chairman and were carried out in consultation with Members of the Board. Once the materiality was defined, 360report answered and worked on the questionnaires. This was done in close collaboration with the staff of Human Resources, Operations, Accounting as well as other staff members and the experts from 360report. Aspects and indicators, whose materiality was classified as low or very low and were not taken into consideration in this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 13 G4-19 Identified material aspects G4-20 / G4-21 Material aspects and aspect boundaries within and outside the organization Significant aspects and boundaries of the aspects within and outside the Company: The first analysis is based on the assumption that all as “material” classified aspects for the entire company located in Nuremberg are of importance. Regarding the communication with the stakeholders it is important to us to continuously improve our annual Communication on Progress. In addition, we have been reporting to our shareholders for many years pursuant with the IFRS financial reporting standards. G4-22 Effect of any restatements of information provided Our organization has previously reported on sustainability issues. Compared to the previous Sustainability Report there are changes in the presentation of information. FAI-rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft has published a sustainability report in previous years.

SPECIFIC STANDARD DISCLOSURES Category: Economic G4-DMA Disclosures on Management Approach “Economic” As a leading provider of ambulance flights, VIP-Charter, aircraft management and maintenance we are challenged by our clients’ future-oriented solutions for sustainable individual mobility. According to our conviction to act responsible and the combined social acceptance this creates increasingly the condition for each enterprise to be economically successful, now and in the future. Thus, we understand sustainable management as an investment in our future capabilities. This requires that solutions for social and entrepreneurial challenges are identified at an early stage. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 17 Economic Performance G4-EC1 Direct economic value generated and distributed (EVG&D) Direct economic value generated and distributed For determining taxable income our Company uses accruals based accounting method recorded as revenue and expenditures in the income statement. As a result of the internal data management system previously used, the economic business figures required by GRI G4 were not yet available in this format. We will adjust the system to be able to generate these business figures in the near future in the appropriate format. The EVG&D cannot be allocated by national, regional or market level. The reason being that the percentage of local supply options depend on routes flown in the air and therefore fluctuates significantly in order to be able to report fixed percentages. G4-EC2 Chances and risks due to climate change Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organization's activities due to climate change We have not yet verified the risks of natural disasters due to climate change for our business activities. We assume no strong hazard due to our geographical location. FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft does not operate in the classic energy-intensive industries, however, ranks among a growing sector with raising greenhouse gas emissions: Air-transport CO2-regulations apply for all aircraft operators according to European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for intra-European Economic Area (EEA) flights. Due to the “Stopping the Clock”-decision for international flights from/to the EEA, the EU-ETS is temporarily suspended until the international Civil Aviation Organization ICAO shall have developed and adopted a global model for the regulation of international aviation emissions. However, we are affected indirectly by climate changes, as we have to pay for higher energy and raw material prices, which in turn result in higher demands on energy management. Nevertheless, we have a CO2 strategy, which is explained in more depth in the environment section of this report. We are unable to provide information on a systematic and database-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change. G4-EC3 Coverage of the benefit obligations Coverage of the organizations defined benefit obligations Our organization does not have a pension scheme for employees. Currently there is no plan to introduce a scheme. All fixed employees are covered by the German Social Security System which includes a pension scheme. As provided by law, FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft contributes 50 percent to all contributions of the employees into this pension scheme, up to the social security contribution ceiling. Market Presence G4-EC5 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft wages are based on the employees’ ability, engagement, job performance and commitment. There is no gender bias regarding pay scale and everyone is paid above minimum wage. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 18 Indirect Economic Impacts G4-EC7 Infrastructure investments and services supported Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services supported We have made the following investments in infrastructure or services during the reporting period. Table 18: Investments in infrastructure or services supported Description Previous needs analysis performed Type of investment Cost in Euro Duration Alexander v. Humboldt Stiftung yes Monetary donation 3,000 one time Nürnberger Tafel yes Monetary donation 5,000 one time Leon Heart Foundation yes Monetary donation 5,000 one time In 2016 we decided that one of our donations shall be of benefit to the Leon Heart Foundation. The Leon Heart Foundation supports children and teenagers in social and medical services all around the world. The foundation’s goal is to leave traces and a lasting help in: medical supply, restoration and repair, rising of therapy rooms and rooms to play as well as the access to education. In 2016 other donations were made as well. For Example to the Tafel Nürnberg , a service organized by the city of Nuremberg for the ever growing population of low income households. The Tafel Nürnberg allows families in need to collect perishable and non-perishable foods in order to provide healthy food choices to their families. The current or expected impact on communication and the local economy due to our involvement is: The foundations we support with our donations were founded to give help to those who really need it. Procurement Practices G4-EC9 Spending on local suppliers Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of operations Our company does not have a specific policy determining that locally-based suppliers shall be given preference. It is currently not planning to introduce such a policy either. Even with such policy in place the main suppliers for aircraft parts and services are the United States, France and the UK. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 19 CATEGORY: ENVIRONMENTAL G4-DMA Disclosures on Management Approach EN (Environment) Sustainability has many facets. From environmental protection to aid for people in need, social commitment is firmly anchored in the philosophy of FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft. We contribute our part and consider ourselves proactive corporate citizens. We are especially engaged in regions which are relevant to us and our business activities. For example our annual CO2 emissions project aims to be a reliable partner for that particular community for years to come. Due to the CO2 emissions offset-project, our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. This important step is our contribution to environmental protection. Following our Code of Conduct , we commit ourselves to act responsible towards our environment for generations to come. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 20 Materials G4-EN1 Materials Materials used by weight or volume In the following we enter information regarding to: Operating supplies.

FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft is one of the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide. The supply of services we offer is surely an exposure for the biodiversity in the nearby protected areas. Although we try our best to minimize the environmental damage, we will not be able to dispose it completely. We can't do much against the turbine exhausts our aircrafts produce, for patients must be brought home and pilots must absolve their training flights. But we do have other methods to save the environment like producing our own electricity, waste separation or investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. There are no apparent dangers to the biodiversity for the locations listed in Table 29.

The project consists of 45 plus 20 wind turbines each with a capacity of 2.3 MW. The project will generate 507 MWh/year, which is delivered to the national grid. The electricity produced will be exported to the regional state electricity authority Tai-Power. Therefore the emission reductions from the project activity will come from the avoidance of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use at the national electricity grid. Being a renewable electricity project not only will there be a reduction of CO2 but also of greenhouse gasses (GHG). Previously projects in Mali and Turkey (Gold Standards as well), were chosen for our contribution for 2013 2014 and 2015.

The 273 tons of “municipal waste, including separately collected fractions (WCN 20)” is by far the largest amount of waste and consists of waste which has been disposed of as residual waste and paper from the offices, kitchens, etc. Unfortunately, no exact figures are available concerning the amount and composition. Therefore, the daily volume of around 6 bags with a volume of 240 litres each, composition and hence the weight is an estimate. National and local regulations are exceeded by our company and annually we continue to keep waste to minimum. G4-EN24 Significant spills Total number and volume of significant spills In the organization there have been no incidents in which environmentally harmful substances have been released. Products and Services G4-EN27 Mitigation of the Environmental Impacts of Products and Services In our organization there are no initiatives taken to reduce the environmental impact of products and services. The initiatives taken by FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft have been described before. There are no other additional initiatives other than continuously keeping our impact on the environment at a minimum. Transport G4-EN30 Environmental impacts of transport Significant environmental impacts of transporting products and other goods and materials for the organization’s operations, and transporting members of the workforce The environmental impact of air transport is: >15,103,917 litre Kerosene >70.80-86.30 Decibel (Noise). Basis of the indicators is the main line of business of the company: Air transport within the ambulance flight operations and charter flight operation. There is unfortunately no limitation of transport to be expected with regard to travel of the crew. The main work of the company is, however, in the field of air ambulance operations avoiding empty leg flights. We try, in terms of ambulance flight operations, to achieve a continuous fulfilment of tasks per aircraft through optimal aircraft planning. The aim is, when arriving at the destination of a patient, to enable the admission of another patient at the same destination in order to minimize the environmental and economic impacts of potential additional flights. Criteria to determine the significance of environmental effects are: On the one hand capacity utilization of ambulance aircraft with the analysis of the transport routes of the patients and on the other hand the compliance with standards during take-off and departure of all aircrafts according to the “Noise Abatement Procedures” to reduce noise pollution. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Report 2016 FAI Sustainability Report 2017 33 Supplier Environmental Assessment G4-EN32 New suppliers screened on the basis of ecological criteria Due to the wide scope of the supply chain and the associated complex data we are not able to estimate the impact other supplies have on the environment at this point of reporting. Our hope for the future is that all suppliers we are using will conform to the Global Compact list of requirements. G4-EN33 Negative environmental impacts in the supply chain Significant actual and potential negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken Our organization has not yet reviewed any supplier in relation to significant actual and potential negative effects on the environment. We have not currently planned such a project. Environmental Grievance Mechanisms G4-EN34 Formal grievance about environmental impacts Number of complaints about environmental impacts filed, addressed, and resolved through formal grievance mechanisms In our organization, there is a formal complaints procedure in relation to environmental impact. We respect and observe environmental protection requirements pursuant to legal guidelines. Our employees are trained regarding the urgency of these tasks. In our company there is a formal complaint procedure concerning environmental impact. This is possible via an anonymous complaint box next to the human resource department.

All colleagues regardless of position, nationality, gender, or age are treated equally by upper Management and the executive Board. We want to attract and retain the best employees. We therefore provide them with secure and attractive jobs. Beyond the fixed and variable salary components we offer additional benefits such as holiday payment equal to one month’s salary, payments to employee’s savings scheme and various insurance services. Key decisions affecting the employees and the employment are taken by the management board. The responsibility for the successful implementation lies in both human resources as well as in specialized departments. Appreciation and team spirit are important fundamental principles of cooperation in our organization. We are convinced that good teams are more than the sum of their individual parts. A strong sense of “we” is the basis for our sustainable business success.

We, at FAI rent-a-jet Aktiengesellschaft believe this not to be true. Human rights belong to everyone and affect all aspects of our lives. The right to be treated with dignity, respect and fairness. In the workplace human rights include the right to a safe work environment and the right to fair and equal remuneration. Human rights obligation is particularly evident in our investment decisions and the selection of business locations. Our employees have the possibility to anonymously and confidentially communicate on violations of human rights via our Human Resource Department, which then investigates these accusations and takes the necessary measures to counter any and all abuse.

We operate in many different markets, which are characterized by diversity. Due to our multiannual local presence in these markets we are able to perceive an overview of the population's social situation. However, due to our international operations the support is not only important to us beyond the German. We are committed to local projects in Nuremberg as well as other projects throughout Germany. The basis of fair competition is to comply with legal standards also and especially in view of human resources. Corruption distorts competition and causes damage to the company. The corporate image is the basis for a healthy but growing corporate development and is essential for further development. Our employee's remuneration is above the regional benchmark. The exploitation and the abuse of our staff will never be tolerated nor have they ever been part of our business philosophy. Due to the fair remuneration the susceptibility of the individual employee to corruption is minimized. Our Code of Conduct, which is published on our website (www.fai.ag), underlines our commitment to zero tolerance on corruption. Local Communities G4-SO1 Engagement with local communities Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs Our organization has no formal programs or systematic procedures for involvement with local communities, impact assessment or development programs.
