K-C also routinely encourages employees to report concerns to anyone in management with whom they feel comfortable as part of its compliance culture. Such claims, no matter how received, are thoroughly investigated. Kimberly-Clark commits to respect all human rights by having a policy commitment to do so, engaging in ongoing human rights due diligence and having processes embedded in our business to remediate human rights impacts. A foundational component of our remediation process is the myriad of formal and informal grievance mechanisms in our business. Our formal grievance mechanisms include those provided via our Code of Conduct: 1. Formal process which allows anyone around the globe to report a concern around compliance with our Code of Conduct. 2. Annual acknowledgment ‚Äì Annually we ask Kimberly-Clark employees to acknowledge they have read and understand our Code of Conduct and understand that they have an obligation to raise concerns regarding violations of the Code. 3. Corporate Social Compliance Audits ‚Äì We conduct over 100 audits of key suppliers annually. As a part of this activity we review a given supplier‚Äôs compliance with our Corporate Social Compliance Standards and local wage, hour and payroll laws. These audits include a random sampling of supplier employee interviews. 4. Consumer Reporting ‚Äì Users of products around the globe may report concerns via toll-free calls or via the Internet. 5.

In line with our Essentials for a Better Life vision, we strive to address issues like reducing our carbon footprint by understanding how it affects all aspects of our business ‚Äì from regulatory complexity to cost implications to environmental and social concerns. To manage and reduce the GHG emissions from our operations, we have developed a corporate-wide GHG inventory of the three major greenhouse gases. These are Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N20). Using the right Global Warming Potential Multipliers, these three types of emissions are combined and expressed into a single indicator called Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2e). All the GHG emissions reported internally and externally are expressed in Metric Tons of CO2e. Following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) issued by the World Resources Institute (WRI). All the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party entity to provide limited assurance of its accuracy and completeness. Moving forward as part of our next-generation goals aligned with Sustainability 2022 strategy, Kimberly-Clark set a goal of reducing GHG absolute emissions from manufacturing by 20% from a 2005 baseline. The three strategies considered and dimensioned as tools and drivers to deliver GHG reductions are the following: 1. Execution of rapid payback energy conservation/efficiency improvement projects and energy best practices adoption. 2. Deployment of behavior based LEAN energy transformation in all Kimberly-Clark manufacturing facilities worldwide, as a tool to implement a facility energy management system; funded in three fundamental pillars: a) Mindset, Behaviors and Capabilities; b) Management Infrastructure; and c) Operational Systems. 3. Execution of alternative energy projects including renewable energy such as biomass boilers, cogeneration plants and renewables such as solar and wind fueled electricity. Kimberly-Clark has been tracking its GHG emissions since 2005. The GHG emissions reduction progress has been 16.8% from 2005 to 2016.

Our sourcing processes seek to balance responsible sourcing standards and support for local supplier options while optimizing total delivered cost inclusive of material cost and transportation. As a result, a significant amount of purchases are made with local suppliers where possible, while recognizing that some purchases must be made where suppliers are available on a global basis.

These GHG emissions represent a reduction of 16.8% from the baseline year of 2005; driven by the update of the CO2e emission factors in our sustainability database and the reduction in GHG from the execution of energy conservation projects and best practices adoption, the implementation of LEAN Energy and the start-up of alternative energy projects in North America and Latin America. Great progress in GHG emissions reduction in 2016 versus the previous year 2015 was achieved by some specific business sectors and regions: K-C North America registered 8.1% reduction, while Global K-C Professional showed 10.2%; these two were mainly driven by the update of the emissions factors reflecting a cleaner electricity grid in the United States. Latin American Operations reduced GHG emissions by 3.6% and Asia Pacific (APAC) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) showed 1.5% reduction in GHG each. ‚Äì‚Äì Kimberly-Clark was officially recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) with the prestigious Climate Leadership Award under the category of Excellence in GHG Management (Goal Achievement), recognizing Kimberly-Clark for publicly reporting and verifying organization-wide greenhouse gas inventories and achieving publicly-set aggressive greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. ‚Äì‚Äì The reduction of GHG absolute emissions reported at the end of 2015 from the 2010 baseline of 7.2% is equivalent to 1.4% per year, which is considerably higher than the 1% per year proposed by the CDP, WRI and WWF Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (SDA) model for our industry sector.

We planned and performed our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance standard 2008 (AA1000AS). We were engaged to provide an AA 1000 Type 2 assurance, which covers evaluation of adherence to the AA1000 AS assurance principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. We also reviewed the reliability of specified sustainability performance information to a moderate level of assurance. In addition as criteria for our assurance work we used the GRI 101 Foundation guidelines which set out the Reporting Principles for defining report content and quality and the ISO standard 14064-3: Greenhouse gases Part 3: Specification with Guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. Our work was conducted between March and May 2017 via meetings, telephone discussions and email correspondence with staff responsible for managing, collating and reporting Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs Sustainability Report. We also reviewed supporting evidence and data collection systems to substantiate the data and claims relating to energy, water and waste performance information. The information and presentation of data within the Sustainability Report is the responsibility of Kimberly-Clark. This statement is the responsibility of WSP and represents our independent opinion. The intended users of this statement are the readers of the Kimberly-Clark Sustainability Report and it is intended for this statement to be read in its entirety. Our assurance team has the appropriate experience and competency to complete this assurance engagement. WSP has a Quality Management System (QMS) which is certified to BS EN ISO9001 under which all our work is managed. The WSP Assurance team is not working for Kimberly-Clark beyond what is required of this assignment. Methodology for Adherence to the AA 1000 accountability Principles and GRI We tested, on a sample basis, the processes and management practices used to adhere to and evaluate adherence to the Accountability Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness which form a key part of the AA1000AS. The GRI Reporting Principles of ‚Äòstakeholder inclusiveness‚Äô and ‚Äòmateriality‚Äô for defining report content are very similar to the AA1000AS principles. In addition, we also tested adherence to the GRI Reporting Principles of ‚Äòsustainability context‚Äô and ‚Äòcompleteness‚Äô and to the GRI Reporting Principles for defining report quality of accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. Evidence gathering for evaluating adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and the GRI Reporting Principles included: ÔÇ∑ Understanding and testing the processes used to adhere to and evaluate adherence to the AccountAbility Principles and the GRI Reporting Principles. ÔÇ∑ Inquiring of management, including senior management at executive and functional levels, and of relevant management responsible for the day to day management of sustainability, about the effectiveness of processes used to adhere to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles and the GRI Reporting Principles. Our scope included reviewing the Kimberly-Clark sustainability strategy and procedures and processes for identifying and engaging stakeholders. 58 Kimberly-Clark 2016 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) ÔÇ∑ A review of the output of Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs 2016 materiality review and strategy based updates and how the AA1000 inclusivity principle has been addressed. ÔÇ∑ Observing and inspecting management practices, process testing and evidence gathering across the organization on a sample basis. ÔÇ∑ Collecting and evaluating documentary evidence and management representations that support adherence to the principles. Methodology for Assurance of Sustainability Performance Data Under the AA1000AS standard as the umbrella standard, WSP‚Äôs review of specific sustainability performance data used ISO14064-3 as a guideline. Currently there is no assurance guideline specifically for water, waste, or energy. Therefore, WSP has applied the principles from ISO14064-3 to the Greenhouse gas emissions, water, waste, and energy assurance. The performance data review has been conducted to a limited level of assurance including evaluation of the adequacy of the collection, processing, consolidation and internal reporting of data. The WSP inventory and management system review consisted of a desktop review of supporting data and an output of the 2016 inventory and data files from the Kimberly-Clark internal sustainability data management system. WSP Opinion On the basis of the work conducted nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Sustainability Report does not meet the principles, content and quality requirements of AA1000AS for a Type 2 Moderate Level of Assurance and the GRI Reporting Principles. WSP has found no evidence that Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs 2016 GHG, energy, waste and water inventory is not materially correct, is not a fair representation of the corresponding data and information or has not been prepared in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We have made the following findings and conclusions with respect to the AA1000 (2008) principles and the GRI Reporting Principles, and without affecting our assurance opinion, we have made some recommendations for further work. INCLUSIVITY ‚Äì The participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability Kimberly-Clark has systems in place for internal and external stakeholders to participate in the development of the organization‚Äôs response to sustainability issues. Kimberly-Clark engages regularly with a range of internal and external stakeholders including: employees, customers, consumers, investors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), industry groups and suppliers. Kimberly-Clark is active within the industry network to collaborate and understand best practice and drivers for managing sustainability issues for their industry. Stakeholder participation is also encouraged across all regions and sites through the network of sustainability coordinators. It is our opinion that Kimberly-Clark shows commitment to being accountable to those whom the organization has an impact on and who have an impact on it. The 2016 materiality assessment process has helped in recording the links between stakeholder participation and the determination of Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs sustainability issues. The 2022 Sustainability Program is publically communicated through the website and via stakeholder meetings throughout the year allowing the opportunity for engagement in relation to the Sustainability Program. Stakeholder‚Äôs information needs have been used to inform the content and structure of the Sustainability Report. Page 2 of 6 59 Kimberly-Clark 2016 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) It is considered that the process for responding to specific local stakeholders could be more formally documented and communicated to ensure that local issues as well as global sustainability issues are appropriately addressed. SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT Does the report present performance in the wider context of sustainability. The Kimberly-Clark Sustainability report is presented with reference to broader sustainable development conditions. The Sustainability 2022 strategy is to create environmental, social and financial value and to pursue long-term change. The priorities of the strategy have been identified with reference to Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs direct activities as well as its value chain and considerations to geographic contexts are made where appropriate. This is relevant for example in relation to water consumption where twelve water stressed areas have been identified as a focus for improving water efficiency. MATERIALITY ‚Äì Determining the relevance and significance of issues that are material to sustainability performance Kimberly-Clark completed a sustainability materiality assessment in 2016. The materiality assessment process was used to identify the issues which have been presented in the 2016 Sustainability report. This materiality assessment followed a clear process for identifying business risks which was informed by engagement with stakeholders, societal and peer-based norms, financial considerations and policy based performance. We understand that Kimberly-Clark intends to repeat this process in the next couple of years as a review to ensure ongoing determination and prioritization of its material sustainability issues. This will be important to ensure that any changes in stakeholder interests and expectations are documented and used to drive the future focus areas for the sustainability strategy and for future Sustainability reports. It will be important for the materiality process to show application and integration on an ongoing basis across site, regional and group levels of the organization. Consideration should be made to producing regional materiality matrices in addition to the global materiality matrix to ensure that regional variations can be documented and addressed as appropriate. RESPONSIVENESS ‚Äì An organization response to stakeholder issues that affect its sustainability performance Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs principal external communication for sustainability issues is the Sustainability Report which is made available on the Company website. The report provides stakeholders with a clear explanation of changes in the organization throughout the year, and reports on performance on all the key material issues. Regional Sustainability reports are also produced in some regions. These use the Sustainability 2022 framework and data collected on the internal sustainability data management system but these reports are not subject to the same level of internal assurance as the global report. Kimberly-Clark also communicates with employees on a variety of sustainability issues through team meetings, email communication, noticeboards and the intranet. In addition, Kimberly-Clark responds to sustainability requests from customers and other stakeholders as they arise. An approval process for the development of the Sustainability report has been established by Kimberly-Clark and evidence was provided that this process was being followed and was adding value to the assurance of the reporting development and sign off. Page 3 of 6 60 Kimberly-Clark 2016 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) It is recommended that consideration is made to providing additional on line sustainability data and information which could be used to increase the frequency of reporting beyond the annual reporting cycle. Completeness Does the report include coverage of material topics and their boundaries, sufficient to reflect significant economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to enable stakeholders to assess the reporting organization‚Äôs performance in the reporting period? The Sustainability report includes information relating to all of the identified material topics relevant to Kimberly-Clark activities during 2016. Global coverage of information is provided relating to activities, products and services of Kimberly-Clark as well as impacts resulting through the value chain. Accuracy ‚Äì Is the reported information sufficiently accurate and detailed for stakeholders to assess the reporting organization‚Äôs performance? Data is provided to support qualitative statements where available and the accuracy of data is audited internally before it is presented in the Sustainability Report. Assumptions and techniques used for estimation are included as part of this review process. Balance ‚Äì Does the reported information reflect positive and negative aspects of the reporting organization‚Äôs performance to enable a reasoned assessment of overall performance? The Sustainability Report presentation is considered to be balanced. Performance information is presented to show year on year comparison and the achievement or otherwise towards goals set. Clarity ‚Äì Does the reporting organization make information available in a manner that is understandable and accessible to stakeholders using that information? The Sustainability Report is considered to be presented in an easy to read format with the appropriate use of tables and diagrams and stories to help present information. It is noted that future reports are likely to be translated into four different languages which is to be encouraged to aid accessibility of the report to a wider audience. Comparability ‚Äì Are reported data selected, compiled and reported consistently and in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyze changes in the organization‚Äôs performance over time, and that could support analysis relative to other organizations? The Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards, Core level which are best practice benchmarks which allow for comparison relative to other organizations on a year by year basis. Reliability ‚Äì Is the report information gathered, recorded, compiled, analyzed in a way that it can be subject to examination, and that establishes the quality and materiality of the information? Use of a robust data management platform helps reduce the risk of data inaccuracies and improves consistency in data management and reporting across Kimberly-Clark‚Äôs global operations. The information and data in the report is subject to rigorous internal audit review. The internal audit Page 4 of 6 61 Kimberly-Clark 2016 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) process together with the external assurance of the Sustainability report and specified reporting information using a recognized best practice standard ensures that the report can be relied upon. Timeliness ‚Äì Does the reporting organization report on a regular schedule so that information is available in time for stakeholders to make informed decisions? The information in the report clearly indicates the time period to which it relates and this is presented alongside data from previous years to aid comparability of data year on year. All of the new information in the report relates to the calendar year 2016. Reliability of Specified Performance Information We have evaluated the systems and processes used to collate and report the GHG, energy, water and waste performance data for 2016 and have been able to obtain an AA1000:2008 moderate level of assurance in respect of the data which is reported in the Sustainability Report. This level of assurance is equivalent of a limited assurance under ISO 14064-3. The findings of the assurance engagement provide confidence in the systems and processes used for managing and reporting sustainability performance information. Data trails selected were identifiable and traceable, and the personnel responsible were able to reliably demonstrate the origin(s) and interpretation of data. The internal sustainability data management system compares data entries against a band of expected values to flag significant anomalies in the data. Kimberly-Clark collects the specified performance data monthly and quarterly reviews by the Kimberly-Clark Sustainability Corporate team enables data to be analyzed more frequently and as a result Kimberly-Clark can more actively identify data anomalies and improvement opportunities for sites not meeting their improvement goals. A few errors in the reporting of waste, water or energy were identified during the assurance exercise; however these did not have a material impact on reporting at Kimberly-Clark Group level. All errors were corrected prior to the Sustainability Report being published. Recommendations for Kimberly-Clark to consider implementing for future reporting in order to further improve its GHG, Waste, and Water inventory process are outlined below: ÔÇ∑ Kimberly-Clark currently holds its mobile emissions constant based on a past estimate due to data access issues. Transition to the internal sustainability data management system allows capture of mobile fuel use, so WSP recommends updating and calculating mobile emissions on an annual basis as part of its new goal period. ÔÇ∑ Reporting of office waste is new for 2016. Only actual data is reported for office locations. Some facilities are missing waste data. WSP recommends estimating office waste for locations where actual waste data is not tracked. ÔÇ∑ Kimberly-Clark currently has not applied any supplier specific emission factors. WSP recommends approaching large suppliers of electricity to obtain supplier-specific emission factors for future market-based calculations. ÔÇ∑ Scope 3 Product Transport. Currently, only the CO2 value is calculated for intermodal shipping based on fuel consumption. Mileage data is available, so WSP recommends calculating the CH4 and N2O associated with its Intermodal shipping and reporting a CO2e value. Page 5 of 6 62 Kimberly-Clark 2016 Sustainability Report INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT (Continued) ÔÇ∑ Kimberly-Clark has a documented inventory management plan that delineates the identification, quantification and reporting of GHG emissions. However, this document has not been updated and does not include the processes for waste and water identification, quantification, and reporting. As a best practice, WSP recommends updating this document on an annual basis and adding waste and water.
