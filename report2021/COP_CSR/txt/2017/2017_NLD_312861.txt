Description of policies, public commitments and company goals on environmental protection. • Rotra uses its key position by converting its policy into concrete actions and results and in doing so actively contributes to a sustainable society in which people, planet and profit go together. Rotra is strongly committed to providing sustainable service and by means of its Rotra Academy, communicates this awareness to all its employees and externally by our Rotra Newsletter, social media and our website. • Implementation • Description of concrete actions to implement environmental policies, address environmental risks and respond to environmental incidents. • Rotra's green policy dates right back to the 80s of the past century. Rotra developed its first trailers for train transport (Hupac Transport) to Southern Europe; currently still hundreds of trailers are leaving by train on a monthly basis. In the early 80s Rotra developed the first volume combinations; the first vehicle to pass the LZV (Long Heavy Vehicle)-test in the Netherlands in 2004 was a Rotra-roadtrain! In 2016 we added 2 new roadtrains (i.e. Ecocombi’s) to our fleet. In recent years Rotra has fulfilled its pioneering role in sustainable logistics by introducing trucks running on alternative fuels. After taking into use Europe's first truck on ethanol in 2007, the first clean Econic natural gas truck was introduced in the Benelux in the summer of 2009. In 2011 Rotra introduces trucks on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) and LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas). In 2016 we have taken in use 4 new trucks on LNG (9 trucks in total) especially for the shipments within the Netherlands and Belgium. In the summer of 2010 Rotra provided its 5000m2 large Automatic Bicycle Warehouse (ABW) in Doesburg with solar cells. By using this renewable, environmental friendly, energy Rotra establishes an annual emission-reduction of over 48.000 kgs CO2! In 2014 Rotra started the construction of its own container terminal at its premises in Doesburg. Rotra expects to handle 5.000-10.000 containers yearly and therefore saves up to 194 truck-loads from Rotterdam/Antwerp to Doesburg v.v. by road weekly. The terminal has bene taken in use January 2017! With this environment-friendly alternative for the increasing congestion by road Rotra establishes, besides extra service to our customers, a substantial CO2-emission reduction. Within this project Rotra has built a filling station at its terminal, which will be used for the filling of LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) for both trucks and 5 barges as clean and quiet alternative for fuels such as diesel. The first multimodal inland LNG-station in Europe. Rotra believes in LNG as the clean, quiet and safe fuel for the future and supports with this initiative the sustainable use of the multimodal transport chain. The project is supported by the European Union with a contribution from its TEN-T program. December 2015 this project has been finished and has gained a lot of (media-)exposure. In 2017, Rotra is working on the development of AGV’s (Automatic Guided Vehicles) together with various organizations (DAF Trucks, Twente University, TNO, Port of Rotterdam etc.) in order to make transport more sustainable, efficient and safe. However, as it is impossible to reduce the CO2-emission to zero and Rotra's ambition is 100% climate neutral transport, we would like to tackle the residual emission with our clients. Therefore, we offer our clients the possibility to transport 100% climateneutral together with Rotra. With our product Rotra Green Footprint we collect shipments worldwide 100% CO2-neutral and deliver them at their destination. We can do this by compensating the CO2-emission, in cooperation with the Climate Neutral Group (www.climateneutralgroup.com), with investments in sustainable energy projects. • Measurement of outcomes • Description of how the company monitors and evaluates environmental performance. • Rotra has been awarded the Lean&Green Award for its sustainable strategy. The environmental performance is measured by the objectives stated by the organization of this award > 20% CO2 reduction in 5 years of time. The Rotra Group compensated 677.404kgs CO2 in 2015 with the product Rotra Green Footprint. This is more than 5 times we compensated the year before. We hope we can continue this positive trend in cooperation with our esteemed clients and partners. In 2017 Rotra will be awarded The Green Award > with our own Container Terminal we are capable of facilitating sustainable innovative transport and therefore will be Green Award member from now on. In addition we will give a discount on our services to all other Green Award 'winners'/participants. 6 Anti-Corruption • Assessment, policy and goals • Description of the relevance of anti-corruption for the company (i.e. anticorruption risk-assessment).
