In 2016, Fibria reached a volume of 51% of local purchases in the regions where it operates. Tangible and intangible aspects are among the criteria for choosing a supplier. In addition to cost and quality, we analyze its human and social and environmental development practices. We share knowledge, our challenges, and dilemmas, and we evolve together. Our most recent project, which is under development, P2P COMPANY is to implement a supply chain management strategy that includes social and environmental criteria in its various phases. In order to identify opportunities and risks, we increased touch points in our customer base. Fibria understands Approximately 30% of the purchase volume its value chain and its role as more of a P2P business is with suppliers that have been working (people to people) than a B2B business (business to with Fibria for more than 14 years. business). For this reason, the company invests in relationship, transparency, and interactions between people. APPROVAL The supplier approval processes continue to evolve at Fibria. Our assessment criteria considers aspects such as social and environmental risks, labor rights, alignment with our forest management practices, and respect for the environment. In 2016, a total of 306 suppliers were approved. PORTFOLIO SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT Social and environmental criteria are already applied in the procurement analysis across Currently, Fibria has approximately 340 contracts with Fibria's operations; however, at different significant suppliers, which represent approximately BRL stages and standards, nevertheless without 4 billion.
