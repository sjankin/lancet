As a first step in formulating DIC108, DIC revised The DIC WAY to better reflect social imperatives, to create a simple, clear message, in line with which the Group will continue to promote efforts aimed at enhancing corporate value and achieving sustainable growth. The DIC WAY Mission Through constant innovation, the DIC Group strives Mission to create enhanced value and to contribute to sustainable development for its customers and society. Vision Vision Color & Comfort by Chemistry Spirit Spirit Drive, Integrity, Dedication, Collaboration, Harmony The DIC WAY, which represents the fundamental management philosophy of the DIC Group, comprises three elements: Mission, Vision and Spirit. Our Mission defines what the DIC Group ultimately aspires to be. Mission: Enhanced values we strive to create are ‚Äúdignity and trust,‚Äù ‚Äúcustomer satisfaction‚Äù and ‚Äúharmony with society.‚Äù Our Vision defines the broad direction in which the DIC Group‚Äôs business must advance to achieve our Mission. Vision: This is set based on our history, corporate culture and the competency instilled into DIC Group employees. Our Spirit sets out the specific principles of conduct that DIC Group employees should always honor and which should serve as their guideposts in order to achieve our Mission, including Spirit: encouraging our employees to think and judge matters on their own before taking action. In addition to our three founding precepts of ‚ÄúDrive,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntegrity‚Äù and ‚ÄúDedication,‚Äù in light of the demands of the times we have added ‚ÄúCollaboration‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù DIC Report 2016 7 The DIC Group‚Äôs Sustainability Program In recent years, the need to achieve sustainability in a manner that takes into account, among others, the environment, ecosystems and socioeconomic issues, including global warming and the depletion of natural resources, has gained increased recognition worldwide. Today, the DIC Group promotes a variety of sustainability initiatives worldwide and works to maintain an accurate grasp of social imperatives pertaining to ESG-related issues. The DIC Group launched its corporate social responsibility (CSR) program in fiscal year 2007, identifying multiple key themes as a framework for its efforts. Having further clarified the overall direction of its sustainability-related initiatives, effective from fiscal year 2014 the Group changed the designation used across its program from ‚ÄúCSR‚Äù to ‚Äúsustainability,‚Äù which it feels is more appropriate for a globally active corporate entity. Corporations today are expected to operate in a manner that shows concern for the global environment and conforms with global business rules. Basic Sustainability Policy The DIC Group is dedicated to conducting its business while retaining a strong commitment to five key concepts: preserving safety and health, ensuring fair business practices and respect for human rights, maintaining harmony with the environment and advancing its protection, managing risks, and creating value for society through innovation. DIC Group employees will continue working to deliver the value that its stakeholders‚Äîincluding its customers, suppliers, local communities, shareholders and investors, and employees‚Äîexpect, showing ingenuity and a sense of responsibility. The Group itself will strive to remain an organization that contributes to sustainability for society and the global environment by capitalizing on its businesses to achieve unfaltering growth, thereby enhancing its own sustainability. Sustainability Framework and Themes To foster concrete CSR measures, in fiscal year 2007 the DIC Group examined social imperatives, the activities of other companies and key relevant materials, including the results of a survey conducted by the Keizai Doyukai (Japan Association of Corporate Executives). Based on its findings, and to ensure the compatibility of such measures with its operations, corporate organization and functions, the Group identified 12 key themes as a framework for implementing its CSR program. Subsequently, the Group partially revised these themes in response to changes in the external environment and the progress of its efforts. Today, the Group‚Äôs sustainability framework comprises 11 themes. +DYLQJUHRUJDQL]HGLWVTXDOLW\DVVXUDQFHIUDPHZRUNWRIXUWKHUUHLQIRUFHFDSDELOLWLHVHIIHFWLYHIURP¬øVFDO\HDUWKH*URXS separated ‚Äúquality,‚Äù formerly part of ‚ÄúEnvironment, safety, health and quality,‚Äù out as an independent theme and is promoting a variety of tailored initiatives.

DIC Report 2016 9 Branding Having positioned 2016 as the inaugural year of its new branding program, the DIC Group is implementing a broad range of systematic, forward-looking measures directed at both internal and external stakeholders. As a first step, the Group pondered the question of what value it brings to its customers and what role it is expected to play. This process led to the establishment of a new brand slogan, which conveys the value that the Group brings to its customers, and to the articulation of three corporate values. Brand slogan Based on the Group‚Äôs ‚ÄúColor & Comfort by Chemistry‚Äù management vision, the new brand slogan was chosen because it clearly and concisely conveys the value that the DIC Group brings to its customers and because its suitability for global use will encourage greater brand awareness across the Group. ‚ÄúColor & Comfort‚Äù expresses the DIC Group‚Äôs desire to help create a society that adds rich color and comfort to people‚Äôs lives. Looking ahead, the Group will work to communicate the message of its new brand slogan in a consistent manner to both internal and external stakeholders. Three corporate values Making it Colorful DIC helps make life colorful Innovation through Compounding DIC brings innovation to society through its core compounding technologies Specialty Solutions DIC draws on its expertise and comprehensive strengths to offer solutions The DIC Group has summarized the value that it brings to stakeholders in the form of three corporate values, which the Group‚Äôs employees and executives will remain keenly aware of and incorporate into their actions and the proposals they make to customers.

Chairman and General Manager Hideki Inouchi With a population of over 1.3 billion, the People's Republic of China is seeing a sharp rise in purchasing power. The standard of living of the middle class is greatly improving, as is clearly illustrated through the tourist shopping sprees we hear so much about. Meanwhile, the problem of overproduction in the Chinese economy is a major issue, which has been particularly apparent in such sectors as cement, steel and coal. Economic growth is slowing, and this year‚Äôs National People‚Äôs Congress adopted a GDP growth target of between 6.5% and 7.0%‚Äîfar lower than the double-digit growth seen in recent years. What this tells us is that although overall growth is slackening, there are latent needs. If we can capture these needs, the PRC is still a market in which robust growth can be expected.

Through these efforts, we aim to contribute to the achievement of DIC108‚Äôs targets.

Social Today‚Äôs core inkjet technologies‚Äîaqueous, solvent and UV-curable‚Äîperform perfectly well across a wide variety Imperative of products and applications. However, there are fundamental pros and cons with each chemistry. Being waterbased, aqueous inks have strong environmental credentials, provide a wide color gamut, offer excellent resolution and are relatively inexpensive. However, printheads require increased maintenance, substrates need to be coated, which can cost more, and agueous inks require lamination in order to be suitable for outdoor use. UV-curable inks have superb media flexibility, offer high durability and can adhere to both uncoated stocks and other challenging materials such as vinyl, glass and wood. They cure almost instantly, enhancing image quality, reducing energy consumption and improving productivity. On the downside, UV-curable inks have a limited color gamut, the structured ink film produces a noticeably raised finish, and they need greater care in handling and transportation. Solvent inks produce exceptionally durable finishes that are ideal for demanding outdoor applications. Nonetheless, the VOCs released as the solvent evaporates require a ventilated environment, making these inks the least environment-friendly option. They are also difficult to handle in a single-pass printer architecture, owing to the rate of evaporation at elevated temperatures and the inability to exercise inactive nozzles during printing. In an ideal world, inkjet users want a solution that combines the characteristics of aqueous and UV-curable inks while at the same time providing consistent high-quality output with an extended color gamut. Such a hybrid composition would deliver odor-free prints, provide excellent adhesion to a wide range of media, and offer enhanced resistance and high flexibility. It would also be environmentfriendly, with a reduced film weight, and have low migration properties. Sun Chemical‚Äôs Sun Chemical addressed this imperative with the introduction of Aquacure, a functional aqueous technology Response combining water-based and UV-curable solutions. Comprised of 60‚Äì90% water, Aquacure inkjet inks deliver the positive print characteristics of a water-based ink, including low film weights, lack of odor, and an impeccable health, safety and environmental profile. The UV-curable component provides the ink‚Äôs versatility and durability, as well as ensuring reliable jetting through the printhead. Aquacure technology delivers adhesion to a broad range of media, offers superb flexibility and has an extensive color gamut. The technology delivers significant advantages in the graphics sector, but can also achieve migration limits and compliance for primary food packaging in combination with the appropriate press design. Unlike 100% solids UV-curable inkjet inks, Aquacure can produce low film weights similar to those in conventional print processes. VOICE from the DIC Group Business Director, Digital, Sun Chemical Corporation Peter Saunders Aquacure provides a look and feel that converters and brand owners demand. This newly developed aqueous chemistry offers functionality that digital printers have wanted from water-based technology and will have a positive impact on both well-established and emerging inkjet market segments. Most importantly, Aquacure uses between 70‚Äì80% renewable materials, is hazardand odor-free, and is compliant for low migration packaging. Aquacure provides a look and feel that converters and brand owners demand. To date, tests involving key manufacturers have proven to be highly successful.

In fiscal year 2015, the Group conducted Responsible Care audits at 13 domestic Group companies. The audits were equivalent to those for parent company sites. It also conducted regular safety and environment audits at nine DIC sites and four DIC Graphics sites to strengthen collaboration between domestic Group companies and verify Responsible Care activities. Similar efforts are also under way at overseas Group companies. Audits have become more stringent every year. Fiscal year 2015 saw Responsible Care audits at 14 companies in Greater China and three in the Republic of Korea (ROK).

We have expanded the deployment of ESH management systems at companies, previously limited to Japan, to DIC Group companies overseas, and have enhanced benchmarks to facilitate objective comparisons. In ESH audits, we encourage improvements by verifying self-assessments from third-party perspectives. Group companies have clearly progressed solidly over the past few years in terms of awareness and behavior. We look forward to working with colleagues across the Group to set ever-higher targets and respond to society‚Äôs expectations.

Examples of Recent Initiatives Publication of the Guidebook for the Universal Color Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set The DIC Group is actively involved in R&D in the area of color universal design (CUD), as well as in expanding public awareness and understanding of CUD‚Äôs importance. In November 2013, the Group‚Äîin cooperation with the Japan Paint Manufacturers Association, the Industrial Research Institute of Ishikawa and the Color Universal Design Organization and under the supervision of the University of Tokyo‚Äîpublished the Guidebook for the Color Universal Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set. In developing this color set, participating organizations capitalized on their particular expertise in color vision characteristics to verify and adjust proposed colors, a process that facilitated the creation of a set of colors that are relatively easy to distinguish regardless of ability to see colors and can be reproduced using printing inks, coatings and digital imaging devices. At AIC 2015 TOKYO, the midterm meeting of the International Colour Association (ACI), held in May 2015, the DIC Group gave a presentation on collaborative research on CUD Guidebook for the Color Universal Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set and printing inks involving Chiba University, the Central Research Laboratories and DIC Color Design, Inc., and introduced the Color Universal Design‚ÄìRecommended Color Set. Research with Chiba University focused on the color appearance of red printing inks, frequently used to print warnings and other important information on packaging for, among others, food products and pharmaceuticals. Researchers created a number of red spot color inks consisting of several base inks and prepared printing samples on various substrates, which they asked colorblind individuals to evaluate for redness and discriminability on a black background under differing illuminance levels. The results of evaluations AIC 2015 TOKYO were announced at AIC 2015 TOKYO.

105 Third-Party Verification The DIC Group commissioned SGS Japan Inc. to conduct third-party verification of its data for greenhouse gas emissions, discharge of industrial waste and number of occupational accidents (including number of accidents leading to workdays lost). DIC Report 2016 106 Third-Party Opinion Regarding DIC Report 2016 Once again this year, I had the honor or reviewing the DIC Report. The section on DIC‚Äôs new medium-term management plan, DIC108, made a particularly strong impression, clarifying how the Company positions its various businesses by outlining four distinct business initiatives, which are to expand businesses that will drive growth, pursue opportunities for strategic investments (M&As, etc.), rationalize operations in mature markets and create next-generation businesses. I sensed a shift in the Company‚Äôs focus toward building business Counselor, The Japan Research Institute, Limited models that respond to social imperatives. Eiichiro Adachi I would like to offer a few suggestions for enhancing reporting sustainability initiatives, as well as disclosure. In his current capacity, Eiichiro Adachi conducts industry research and assesses corporate First, I would like to see the Company further deepen its awareness of both performance from the perspective of social opportunities and risks. Page 8 outlines 11 key sustainability themes. Of course, responsibility. He also provides financial some of these themes contain elements that will serve as opportunities for the institutions with corporate information for socially responsible investing (SRI). A member creation of new businesses, while others contain elements that indicate a need of the Market Evolution and Corporations in the for strict risk management. Overall, the report leans more toward the former. A 21st Century working group organized by the Keizai Doyukai (Japan Association of Corporate bit less attention devoted to initiatives would make it possible to identify factors E xecutives), Adachi was involved in the with the potential to restrict businesses or harm competitiveness and ensure preparation of The 15th Corporate White Paper adequate pertinent disclosure. Also, on page 33 the Group‚Äôs 22 materiality on ‚ÄúMarket Evolution‚Äù and CSR Management: Towar d B u i l d i n g I nt e g r i t y a n d C r e at i n g categories are too general, and as such it is rather difficult to ascertain what the Shareholder Value. He also served as a national Company views as particularly important. I propose that DIC narrow these down expert for Japan to the ISO 26000 working group. further, based on its awareness of social imperatives, to create more concrete categories that align better with the unique attributes of the Group‚Äôs businesses and strategies. Second, I would like to see a significant increase in the disclosure of initiatives in overseas markets. The DIC Group includes 143 companies overseas, with 61.7% of consolidated net sales and 56.3% of consolidated operating income accounted for by operations outside Japan. Nonetheless, the report features examples drawn overwhelmingly from its domestic operations, as a result of which it is not easy to form a clear understanding of the Group as a whole. If there are circumstances hindering efforts to promote the sharing of information, perhaps consideration should be given to the idea of publishing site reports in various regions. Third, I would like to see the Company strengthen its environmental measures. Minimizing the impact of operations on the environment is a particularly critical challenge for manufacturers of chemicals products. At the COP21 climate summit held in December 2015 in Paris, participating countries adopted the Paris Agreement, which reconfirmed an existing goal of limiting the increase in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius from preindustrial levels. With countries and regions seeking to move away from the idea of a carbon-constrained future and to promote decarbonization, we are seeing the implementation of diverse measures around the world. From the information on pages 52 and 57, it would appear that the efforts of DIC Group companies This third-party opinion reflects my view of in Japan and overseas to reduce CO 2 emissions have leveled off. From the the sustainability initiatives and information information on page 63, we see that efforts to realize reductions in emissions disclosure of the DIC Group, as understood from reading this report, from my perspective of chemicals into the environment have also come up short. Moreover, there as an individual who provides corporate are no indications that the Group is seeking to replace chemicals that are information to financial institutions to assist SRI. It is not intended as a comment on necessary for operations or chemicals in products with alternatives that have whether or not the information herein has less of an environmental impact, or other factors that would give readers a more been measured and calculated accurately to comprehensive understanding. In the next edition of DIC Report, I hope to see conform to commonly accepted standards for the preparation of environmental or other further progress in the disclosure of such important information. reports or a judgment on whether the report covers relevant important matters in full.
