PRODUCTS | 23 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue HEALTH, NUTRITION & AWARENESS Why It Matters Our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — guides how we think about nutrition and health. It is our North Star amidst today’s dramatically shifting food landscape. As a key voice in the food industry, we must ensure that our products are relevant and meet the expectations of our nutrition-savvy consumers, who are increasingly demanding healthier and fresher food with minimal artificial ingredients and processing. It is imperative for Campbell to stay abreast of changes in food and nutrition to better understand how we can provide our customers with the healthy food they desire and thus identify the opportunities we have for growth. In 2016, the food world continued to shift in unprecedented ways. These changes are reshaping the way food is grown, made, marketed, sold and consumed. In turn, an evolving food and nutrition landscape is fundamentally altering the way we think, talk and act about our products. We know that if we don’t evolve with these trends, we will not be able to thrive as a food company. Some of the trends influencing our food and nutrition strategy are: Rise in Chronic Diseases According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, rates of chronic diseases related to poor-quality diet and physical inactivity have increased, with half of all U.S. adults having one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity. Heightened Consumer Interest in Fresh and Healthy Foods Consumer interest in health and wellness is growing as they recognize the role diet plays in health and well-being. They are demanding healthier, more “real foods,” which we believe is food made with recognizable and desirable ingredients. Consumers are increasingly seeking fresh, natural or organic products and those made with ingredients they recognize. They are telling us to avoid artificial preservatives, colors and flavors and are seeking products with vegetables, whole grains and other components associated with good health. Intersection of Health and Technology We refer to the increased fusion of health and technology as society becoming “wired for well-being,” and it will have a profound impact on consumers’ food choices. People will soon make decisions about what to eat or what PRODUCTS | 24 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products not to eat based on individual needs. Consumers are already leading “quantified lives” — tracking their activities and fitness through “wearables” that measure aspects of their overall health. The emerging trend in this area is biomonitoring. We’re seeing it in health care and medicine, and it is only a matter of time before it impacts the food industry. In the future, consumers will no longer wonder about the “right food” for them because bio-sensors will scan their metabolism and recommend the “right” diets. Our consumers are also increasingly using digital tools to shop and share their opinions about food. People love to socialize about the food they cook, shop for and eat. They take photos of their food and share, like and comment on their friends’ experiences through social media. This creates interesting opportunities for Campbell that we’re actively exploring. Consumer Demand for Greater Transparency Consumers today are savvy and have greater expectations of food companies to disclose how and where their food is made, which ingredients are used and how those ingredients are produced and sourced. In its 2015 Global Annual Review, PwC cited food integrity and transparency as one of four colliding megatrends, noting: “High profile contamination, adulteration and fraud incidents in the US, Europe and Asia have eroded public trust in the food industry, raising consumer awareness of food quality and ensuing safety risks. There is growing demand for higher quality food and transparency of food ingredients, origins and production processes, especially among the world’s growing urban middle class.” How We Manage Evolving food trends and a consumer demand for transparency influenced us to take a step back and give our nutrition strategy a refresh. In FY2015, we outlined our new corporate Strategic Imperatives, which included expanding our business in the areas of packaged fresh and well-being. To help meet our new Strategic Imperatives, we implemented a major restructuring of the company. By reorganizing our business to prioritize food categories rather than regions, health and well-being became even more embedded into our products and overall corporate responsibility strategy. We will continue to accelerate growth in our Campbell Fresh division and expand into new categories in the packaged fresh category, as evidenced by our acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. We aspire, with this new approach, to make Campbell even more synonymous with real and better-for-you foods in the future. Moving forward, Campbell will continue to evolve its health and wellness strategies and policies to reflect these consumer demands. Currently, we are doing this by: • measuring our progress; • expanding our healthy product portfolio; and • engaging and educating our consumers. PRODUCTS | 25 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Our Progress In order to ensure that our products reflect the latest vegetables, whole grains, and other food components or nutrition science and consumer demands, we lean on the nutrients under consumed in the diet. expertise of our nutrition and health experts, stakeholders and partners to find better-for-you product solutions.

Since then, we’ve made progress on this journey, and in FY2016 we outlined how our real food philosophy is changing the way we think about our food and setting the standard for transparency in the food industry. We are documenting our progress toward moving away from BPA lining, MSG, high fructose corn syrup, artificial preservatives,1 and flavors. We are also working to source antibiotic-free chicken, remove artificial sweeteners and eliminate other ingredients that consumers do not want. Not only are we removing ingredients from our foods that consumers don’t want, but we are also gearing up to make commitments around including more foods they DO want in FY2017. Extending Our Packaged Fresh Options We continue to grow our better-for-you portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2015 we acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet, another milestone in our efforts to increase our presence and sales in the packaged fresh category. Garden Fresh Gourmet makes the number-one branded refrigerated salsa in the U.S., along with hummus, dips and whole grain tortilla chips. This acquisition is helping to reshape our portfolio toward faster-growing categories. Garden Fresh Gourmet’s on-trend products will allow the Campbell Fresh division to expand in the deli section of the grocery store perimeter and will complement our strong presence in the produce section. This is the latest in a series of moves we have made in response to increased consumer interest in foods focused on health and well-being, first with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms followed by the acquisitions of Plum and Garden Fresh Gourmet. Committed to Labeling GMO Foods Campbell believes in the consumer’s right to know what is in their food, which is why we announced our commitment to labeling our U.S. products which use ingredients derived from genetically modified crops in FY2016. We believe that GMOs are safe, as the science indicates that food derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. Campbell is committed to printing clear and simple language on the labels of our U.S. products which use ingredients derived from genetically modified crops.

PRODUCTS | 30 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue TRANSPARENCY Why It Matters The food industry is in the midst of revolutionary change. Changing demographics, socioeconomic shifts and digital connectivity are forcing the industry to adapt and evolve. One of the most pervasive shifts is around transparency. Consumers are seeking transparency in all areas of their lives, driven by an inherent distrust in large institutions. This distrust has been accelerated by digital connectivity where information and debate are available in one click. For the food industry this translates into consumers’ desire to know what’s in the food they buy, where it is made and how the food is produced. A new generation of consumers is seeking food that better aligns with their values, and is authentic, natural and wholesome. And, they expect a level of transparency at each step of the supply chain — from farm to table. Campbell believes that providing easy access to this information builds consumer trust — something we have invested in doing for nearly 150 years. In this new era of transparency, we are on a journey to be open and honest about our business and earn the trust of a new generation of consumers. How We Manage In this changing environment, Campbell’s Purpose — our commitment to labeling our U.S. products which use Real food that matters for life’s moments — serves as ingredients derived from genetically modified crops, our North Star. It is a filter we apply to strategic decisions removing artificial colors and flavors from our recipes, and informs the way we engage with our consumers. It and transitioning to non-BPA packaging are all a part of has also been a guiding factor in identifying strategic this journey. It has also inspired us to look at our recipes imperatives that we feel are key to our success, one of and use more of the ingredients people tell us they want, which is transparency. We have made a commitment to and less of those they would prefer to avoid. As part of set the standard for transparency in the food industry. our efforts, we have also launched a website where We are doing this by engaging our consumers in we are open about the ingredients we use and the conversation that allows us to address the issues that choices we have made. are most meaningful to them.

The decisions we have made with regard to GMOs have not been because we dispute the science behind GMOs Campbell’s purpose-driven commitment to setting a or their safety. The overwhelming weight of scientific new bar for transparency in the food industry led us to evidence indicates that GMOs are safe and that foods take a big step in FY2015 by sharing with our consumers derived from crops using genetically modified seeds are what goes into our food, how we make our food and not nutritionally different from other foods. Ingredients why we make the choices behind the ingredients used derived from these crops are in many of our products in our food. The impetus for these decisions followed and we will continue to use them. We also believe that extensive consumer research about what they wanted technology will play a crucial role in feeding the world. to know about food. Our intent is not to be perfect, but For us, it is simply a matter of transparency. rather to strive continuously for an open exchange of information so consumers can make the most informed Facts Up Front choices possible for themselves and their families. We collaborated with the Grocery Manufacturers The centerpiece of this new direction has been the Association and the Food Marketing Institute to introduction of a website — www.whatsinmyfood.com — provide consumers with a voluntary and uniform “front where consumers can access a wide range of information of pack” labeling scheme, Facts Up Front. We place about our products, and have questions and concerns icons on the front of products displaying their calorie addressed in one easily accessible place.

Our decision was guided by our Purpose, rooted in our consumer-first mindset, and driven by our commitment to transparency — to be open and honest about our food. We believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business. Responsible Labeling GMO Labeling One of the most hotly debated topics within the issue of transparency in the U.S. is the labeling of GMOs. An overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers today believe that they have the right to know what is in their food and we agree. That’s why, in FY2016, we formally announced our support for the enactment of federal legislation in the U.S. to establish a single mandatory labeling standard for foods derived from GMOs. PRODUCTS | 32 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue FOOD SAFETY & QUALITY Why It Matters Food safety is receiving unprecedented attention in the marketplace and in the public policy arena today. It is easy to see why: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that about 48 million people, or one in six Americans, suffer from food-borne illness every year; 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. Yet foodborne illnesses are largely preventable. Food safety and quality are assumed requirements for any major food company in the industry today. It is a given that we will dedicate every resource to ensuring that our consumers are protected from foodborne illnesses, allergens or other health and safety concerns. We know that if we aren’t diligent in our food safety processes, there are significant financial and reputational implications that could be devastating. How We Manage We closely monitor our product safety throughout the We have a long history of regulatory compliance, as well entire value chain — from the moment ingredients are as quality standards and policies that are industry-leading harvested on the farm to the minute finished products and global in approach.

After a recall, Campbell implements an in-depth root-cause analysis to take the necessary corrective actions. PRODUCTS | 34 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue RESPONSIBLE SOURCING Why It Matters As a global food company, we have the responsibility to ensure that the way in which we source our ingredients is both sustainable and ethical. We understand that our supply chain is key to delivering uncompromising value to our customers and consumers. We continuously seek to enhance the quality of our products and brands, not only by the ingredients we use, but also by working with suppliers who meet our responsible sourcing standards. Understanding and mitigating the environmental, economic and social risks within our supply chain is necessary to ensure our products are produced in a responsible manner. By incorporating responsible sourcing practices, we are able to mitigate negative impacts to the environment; realize economic savings; improve supplier relationships; reduce social, reputational, environmental and financial risks; and ensure long-term resiliency. How We Manage Our strategic approach for managing our evolving supply As a result of the findings from our materiality process, chain is focused on ensuring our products are crafted we identified the need to further enhance this strategy with care with inputs that are ethically and sustainably and put additional resources in place to address the sourced. Our Procurement Sustainability strategy focuses increased expectations of both our internal and external on the following key areas: stakeholders. This year, we activated against that need and appointed Campbell’s first Director — Procurement • Understanding and Managing Risks; Corporate Responsibility to develop and implement a • Engaging Our Suppliers; holistic responsible sourcing program. • Setting Expectations; and • Managing Performance. PRODUCTS | 35 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Understanding and Managing Risk Our supply chain risk management process consists of three parts: risk identification, risk analysis and risk mitigation. We’ve assessed “hot spots” within our supply chain related to sustainability issues and are proactive with our suppliers to address key issues. We are currently implementing a new risk analysis model that includes environmental sustainability, financial, supply and human rights risks associated with our product categories. Currently, our most important risks are associated with the rising cost of raw materials, impacts to climate and deforestation, brand and reputational damage, business disruption, regulatory challenges and supply chain interruption. We have embedded value chain risk mapping as part of the overall purchasing manager’s category strategy. When a Campbell buyer develops their strategy for an ingredient or raw material, we consider sustainability as part of the value-added opportunity. Supply chain mapping also gives us a holistic view of our entire supply chain and shows areas of opportunity to collaborate with suppliers to improve functionality and sustainability, while Managing Performance driving cost savings. We are currently revamping our Supplier CSR Engaging Our Suppliers Scorecard to capture environmental performance metrics, as well as social responsibility efforts, to better One of the key elements of our strategy is to partner understand the policies and practices of our supply and collaborate with our suppliers to better understand base.

PLANET | 41 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet Material Issue SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL Why It Matters The rising global population and accelerated global development and resource use require that companies implement holistic approaches that achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. Sustainable business models incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests. They drive corporate innovation for sustainability and help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes. Companies that adopt this approach aspire to grow their businesses while also reducing their environmental footprints. As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of quality food and beverages, with growers and production facilities around the globe, we understand the necessity of being good stewards of the environment. Reducing the resources we use and having an environmental management system in place help us to mitigate the impacts of climate change, better manage compliance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The risks of not doing these things can be detrimental to a manufacturing business and can impact profitability and reputation. How We Manage Our commitment to the environment is manifested through footprint — defined as water and GHG emissions per our sustainable business model strategies, which include tonne of food produced — by 50 percent. As we've worked understanding risks, setting goals and measuring progress toward this goal, we’ve integrated strategies throughout against those goals. We make the biggest impact for our global business operations to ensure the widest our consumers, customers, employees and shareholders possible impact.

From FY2009 PLANET | 46 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet Material Issue SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE Why It Matters A common bumper sticker in rural areas of the U.S. reads “No farms, no food.” Agriculture is indeed the root of our company and products. For nearly 150 years, Campbell has worked closely with farmers to source high-quality ingredients for our nutritious and flavorful products. In recent decades, the growth of the global middle class and overall global population has translated into unprecedented demand for agricultural products, placing increased pressure on land, water and agriculture inputs. It is material to our company to invest in the efficiency of agricultural supply chains to ensure their resilience in an often volatile global economy. Agricultural science also indicates that, for most food products, the farm is where many significant environmental impacts are incurred. Often, crop irrigation is the largest contributor to a food product’s water footprint, and fertilizer production and use is the largest contributor to its GHG footprint. In 2016, a CR materiality assessment confirmed the importance of agriculture sustainability to Campbell, with a high percentage of stakeholders indicating its relevance. Large retail customers have also identified agriculture sustainability as being of critical importance to price and supply resiliency, as well as to meeting customer expectations. “I’ve spent a lot of time at different forums, and sustainable agriculture is the next big thing that food companies are working on. There’s a big shift happening. Customers and a desire for transparency are drivers, but as food companies we also realize that sustainability of supply reduces risk in today’s world. There’s a growing realization that agriculture represents the largest impact on natural systems, yet we need agriculture to survive. We’re starting to see a lot of organizations express an interest, for the first time, in improving farming practices. I see sustainability programs as a way to communicate to the world the progress that growers have made and the environmental benefits that come from efficiency.” Dr. Dan Sonke, Director, Sustainable Agriculture PLANET | 47 2017 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet How We Manage Our Sustainable Agriculture Program encourages Campbell Procurement and other industry-wide efforts responsible and resilient agriculture systems to protect regarding strategic ingredients such as poultry, beef, dairy the long-term viability of the farms and ecosystems from and flour.

The number of Campbell growers using drip irrigation has almost doubled in the last five years, with 69 percent of Campbell’s tomato acres currently using this type of irrigation. Using our 2012 baseline data, we are seeking to increase that number by identifying drip-irrigation opportunities across geographies. By showing individual growers how their water use compares to local/state averages, we ultimately want to help them move toward more efficient irrigation practices. In 2014 and 2015, some of our tomato farmers and our carrotgrowing operations at Bolthouse Farms were able to secure drought grant funding from the state of California to implement water-saving technologies, while also reducing GHG emissions.
