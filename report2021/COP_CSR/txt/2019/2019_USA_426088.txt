Emissions from the usage of diesel generators form a minute percentage of our emissions (see Chart: Percentage Breakdown of Emission for FY18). We strive to adhere to the laws and regulations relevant to our operations including those related to environmental management. During the reporting period, there were no instances of monetary or non-monetary sanctions for As of FY18, we were able to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions per employee by 36% from our baseline year non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the environment. of FY13 from 1.62 MTCO2eq to 1.03 MTCO2eq. This was due to energy saving measures implemented throughout the year as well as a decrease in emission factors. Emissions factors for India decreased from 960 to 820 and emissions factors for Sri Lanka decreased from 720 to 690. In order to further reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, future goals include purchasing renewable energy to offset 10% of our total energy consumption. Goals and Targets In FY18, we included data from our operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe in air travel Description Target Year calculations (as these regions account for the bulk of our air travel). As a result, emissions from air travel increased Medium Term Reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 40% 2030 from 4,600.569 MTCO2eq in FY17 to 10,364.512 MTCO2eq in FY18. Due to this increase, Scope 3 emissions now Long Term Reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 70% 2050 account for 46% of our emissions. Measures to reduce the impact from business air travel include the use of audio and video conferencing. Measures to reduce impact from road travel include the use of an automated system to track and manage shuttle services, the use of optimized transport routes, and where possible, the use of hybrid vehicles for transporting employees. 43 44 Energy Waste [302-3] [103-2, 306-2] In FY18, approximately 54% of our emissions were generated from the use of electricity in our offices. We initiated As a digital engineering company, e-waste is a large component of the byproduct from our operations. We have a our energy management program in April 2008. Strategies for energy optimization include space and server program in place to hand over e-waste to a certified vendor for recycling. We work with relevant state authorities consolidation use of building management systems (BMS) and use of energy efficient products. In 2012, we to ensure e-waste is handled in a responsible manner. For example, we are one of 14 companies to sign an MOU implemented an initiative to convert the lighting systems in the technology centers to LED. Now, LED lighting has with the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) of Sri Lanka to properly and effectively manage e-waste. We were been adopted as our standard lighting and will be used for all new spaces. In FY18, much of the significant energy also the first IT company in Sri Lanka to receive a scheduled waste management license from the CEA. savings were obtained through conversion to LED lighting at our newly acquired facilities. For example, approximate energy savings at Navallur and Hyderabad Capital campuses were 351.60 GJ and 882.97 GJ respectively. Another source of waste from our operations is paper. We have reduced paper usage through several measures such as duplex printing and purchasing farmed paper. All departments are encouraged to use paperless forms, Due to the above measures, we achieved a 24% reduction in per employee energy consumption over our baseline notifications, and reports wherever possible. Waste paper is handed over to a certified vendor for recycling. year of FY13. The intensity of energy consumption per employee reduced from 187 kWh in FY13 to 143 kWh in FY18. We also initiated activities for limiting the use of and recycling plastics. For example, Virtusa Sri Lanka established a collection point for polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. The bottles will be donated to a recycler that provides Water environmentally friendly monofilaments and yarn for cleaning tools and fabric manufacturers worldwide. In addition, food service providers in the cafeteria have been advised to use alternatives to plastic bags. [303-1, 303-2, 303-3] As a services company, our operations are not water-intensive. Water is used mainly for drinking, hygiene, facility operations and landscaping. However, we seek to be responsible in our water consumption, especially since we have operations in locations that face water stress. Water is obtained mainly from ground water, private suppliers and the municipal water supply. As such, we believe that our operations do not affect water sources significantly. The water management data provided in this report is for six of our technology centers in India and Sri Lanka and does not include drinking water, which we do not target for reduction. In F18, per employee water usage increased by 1.52% from 0.66kl in our baseline year of FY13 to 0.67kl in FY18 However, when compared to per employee water usage in FY17 (0.69kl), this was a decrease of 2.9%. Total water used in FY18 amounted to 108,217.96kl. Strategies for water management include more efficient water usage in facilities maintenance and creating awareness among employees about conserving water. At present, we are able to recycle waste water only at company owned facilities and not at rented spaces. In FY18, 47,460kl of water was recycled, which amounted to 44% of our total use. The Hyderabad Campus also has rain water harvesting facilities with two tanks of 50kl and 75kl. 45 46 Emissions Data Energy Data [305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 305-5] [302-1, 302-3, 302-4] 1.80 200 1.60 180 187 1.62 1.50 160 1.40 154 1.34 1.35 140 146 1.20 140 140 143 1.26 120 1.00 1.03 100 0.80 80 0.60 60 0.40 40 0.20 20 0.00 0 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY13 FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 Graph: Energy Consumption (kWh per employee) 0.01 2% 14% 46% 54% 84% Diesel fuel Renewable wind Non-renewable Scope 1: Fuel (Diesel) Scope 2: Grid power Scope 3: Business air travel and road travel Percentage Breakdown of Emissions for FY18 (Metric Tonnes CO2e) Chart: Percentage Breakdown of Energy for FY18 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 FY14 FY13 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 FY14 FY13 Scope 1: Fuel (Diesel) 166.808 412.151 102.981 71.51 44.38 350.12 Fuel consumption from nonrenewable sources diesel 2,251.304 5,562.503 1,389.869 965.106 598.932 4,697.784 Scope 2: Grid power 15,137.908 192,82.219 11,830.786 9,487.94 9,341.69 9,317.55 fuel Scope 3: Business air travel and road travel 12,832.642 6,781.382 4,616.684 2,503.73 2,171.01 2,340.24 Electricity from renewable 12,609.409 12,696.167 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 Total GHG emissions 28,137.358 26,475.752 16,550.451 12,063.18 11,557.08 12,007.91 sources wind Table: Total Direct and Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Weight (Metric Tonnes CO2e) Electricity from non76,573.979 73,807.182 52,392.633 45,066.290 43,493.400 43,580.916 renewable sources Total energy consumption 91,434.692 92,065.852 53,782.503 46,031.396 44,092.332 48,278.700 FY18 FY17 FY16 FY15 FY14 FY13 Table: Direct and Indirect Energy Consumption in Gigajoules Emissions from air travel 10,364.512 4,600.569 3,006.880 1,302.65 1,922.54 2,115.21 Emissions from road travel 2,468.130 2,180.813 1,609.804 1,201.08 248.47 225.03 Total Scope 3 emissions 12,832.642 6,781.382 4,616.684 2,503.73 2,171.01 2,340.24 Table: Breakdown of Scope 3 Emissions (Metric Tonnes CO2e) 47 48 Spreading the Green Message Carbon Zero Challenge Water Data Virtusa sponsored the Carbon Zero Challenge hosted by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) [303-1, 303-3] jointly with Industrial Waste Management Association (IWMA), in collaboration with the U.S. Consulate General, Chennai.

While in high school, Jerry started a program in his hometown to feed the homeless and those less fortunate on Thanksgiving. For more than 40 years, Jerry’s program served food to thousands during the holiday season. To honor Jerry and to continue his spirit of giving, we created Virtusa Gives Back – a program to help feed the hungry during Christmas. The local food pantry closes for two weeks every December, and many families go without food during this time. So, Virtusans and their family members packed grocery bags for 120 local families to help bridge the two weeks’ gap. We will continue to run it every year. 69 70 Global Compact Principles GRI Content Index GRI STANDARD DISCLOSURE PAGE OMISSIONS Category UNGC Principle Section and Page GRI 101: Foundation 2016 Principle 1: Businesses should • Our Sustainability Framework (page 15) GENERAL DISCLOSURES support and respect the protection • Labor Standards and Human Rights (page 55) 102-1 Name of the organization 7 of internationally proclaimed human Full details available at: Human Rights rights; and 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services 8 http://www.
