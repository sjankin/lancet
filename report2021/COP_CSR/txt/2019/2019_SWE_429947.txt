SUSTAINABILITY Communication on Progress Elfa Group “ We should all be proud of what we do ” and how we do it As we recognize that Elfa is an integral part of society and that what we do, goes beyond our operations, it was logical for us to sign the UN Global Compact. Accordingly, the 10 principles are integrated into Elfa’s business strategy, policies and procedures, and we are driving awareness and action in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030. Of the 17 SDGs, we have chosen to focus on four, which Elfa can impact more; • SDG 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls • SDG 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all • SDG 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns • SDG 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels During fiscal year 2018 Elfa stepped up its efforts to develop and improve our work in support of UN Global Compact. To name but a few; Elfa’s code of conduct was rolled out, the ten principles laid down in the UN Global Compact were implemented, and a communicationand training plan was created to raise awareness and dialogue concerning the matter of ethics and fair dealing. With that, we dare to say that during the year Elfa made significant progress and is today well equipped to continue making further improvements along these lines. Please read more in the sustainability report for fiscal year 2018, where we go deeper into our business philosophy of treating employees, customers, dealers and the societies in which we operate with respect and dignity. You also find a description of practical actions Elfa has taken to implement the ten principles in each of the four areas; human rights, labour, environment, anti-corruption.

Accordingly, our efforts in this area form an important part of Elfa’s strategy and comprises four main areas; environment, health, human rights and anti-corruption. During fiscal year 2018 Elfa stepped up its sustainability efforts. To name but a few, Elfa’s Code of Conduct is rolled out, the ten principles laid down in the UN Global Compact are implemented, and we have created a communicationand training plan to raise awareness and dialogue concerning the matter of ethics and fair dealing as well as implemented environment management schemes at all manufacturing sites. With that, we dare to say that during the year Elfa made significant progress and is today well equipped to continue making further improvements along these lines. This report follows Elfa’s fiscal year and covers the period 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. Elfa’s Sustainability Report encompasses Elfa International AB and its subsidiaries. As signatory to the UN Global Compact, Elfa will submit this report to the UN Global Compact as its Communication on Progress Report 2018. 4 Elfa’s mission is to create space in everyday life with ingenious storage soluABOUT ELFA tions. Something that has become possible with the ingenious ideas we have developed since 1948, when Arne Lydmar founded Elfa. Ever since then, we have been embracing the challenges of everyday life by offering individual, clever solutions for big and small storage needs. Since 1999 the company has been owned by The Container Store, the USA’s largest storage products retail chain. The Container Store is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Today Elfa has three factories and eight sales companies in Europe. The group reported turnover of approximately 1 105 MSEK in the 2018 fiscal year and by the end of fiscal year 2018 the group had 513 employees. At Elfa we take pride in our culture and core values to focus on our customers, ONE Elfa care about innovation, act in a professional manner, believe in humanitarian Our core values values and to share a holistic approach.

Our position on the Our product range includes both flexible storage solutions and made-to-meamarket and key sure sliding doors – all in sustainable, functional design of the highest quality. differentiators Elfa’s key differentiators are: • Customized solutions – by which we mean that we provide space smart solutions created to fit individual needs • Durable products – by which we mean that, with products of outstanding quality and timeless appeal, Elfa provides a storage system that lasts a lifetime. • Ingenious design – by which we mean that Elfa’s products are recognized by its simple and functional design • Reliable business partner – by which we mean that with a long history, solid knowledge of storage, financial strength and various patents Elfa allows long-term business relationships 5 The main objectives of Elfa’s engagement in sustainability are to reduce the SUSTAINABILITY company’s impact on the environment and resource consumption, to steadiAT ELFA ly improve working environment as well as to raise awareness and dialogue concerning the matter of ethics. Areas covered by Elfa’s sustainability work are environment, health, human rights and anti-corruption. The ultimate responsibility for sustainability rests with Elfa’s Chief Executive Officer, and the issues are regulated via a number of policies, of which the most important are: • Environmental Policy – Outlines the ways in which Elfa strives to reduce environmental impact at all stages of our products’ life cycle: from product development and production to waste and recycling of products and packaging. • ONE Elfa – Expresses our values: we are customer focused, innovative, professional, humane and holistic. • TCS Business Code of Conduct and Ethics, Elfa Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct • Meal and Entertainment Policy • Work Environment Policy • Policy of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion To assure progress and compliance with policies, performance for main asTargets and KPIs pects of sustainability is measured against key indicators, which are reviewed in this report. These KPIs will be followed up on a quarterly basis by the Group Management team.

Elfa therefore aims to continually improve the environmental performance of the projects, products and services, in order to reduce the environmental footprint of our business. This means to • Develop products with long life cycles and which consume minimal natural resources • Develop products using materials that can be recycled and reused • Evaluate, analyse and reduce our impact on the environment at all stages of our products’ life cycles • Work systematically to reduce energy consumption within our business • Work systematically to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances in our products • Set requirements for suppliers, sub-contractors and transport companies regarding compliance with legal requirements in environmental legislation and chemical restrictions as well as additional environmental requirements and environmental targets from the Elfa group Elfa strives continuously to reduce environmental impact at all stages of our SUSTAINABLE products’ life cycle from product development and production, to waste and PRODUCTION recycling of products and packaging. We comply with applicable environmental legislation and pay attention to the environment in accordance with other requirements and regulations. Elfa’s environmental work therefore includes continuous risk assessment of the business and a preventative approach. The performance indicators that are used to observe developments include energy and water consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and waste. 8 Use of chemicals is an important part of manufacturing of Elfa’s products. Responsible handling They are used both as building blocks in our products and in the different of chemicals manufacturing processes. Without control, the use of chemicals can harm the environment and can also be hazardous for the health of customers and employees. Adding to this, violating environmental legislation and in particular legislation regarding the use of chemicals can lead to long lasting and costly legal processes. Elfa maintains good control over and clear procedures for the use of chemicals in our own systems. We are constantly working to replace chemicals that may be harmful to people or the environment with less harmful alternatives. Elfa also maintains control of what is contained in the products we sell, and in this respect, we strive to constantly reduce our negative impact on the environment or harmful effects on health. We therefore have procedures for ensuring that the chemical content is below the limits specified in REACH (the EU’s chemical legislation) and Proposition 65 (chemical legislation in California, USA), among other things. This is assured by analysing our products according to standardised test methods and through written declarations from our suppliers. Over 95% of the group’s environmental impact, in the form of energy and waEnergy, water, ter consumption, carbon dioxide and waste, derives from our three manufacCO 2 and waste turing facilities: • Elfa Sweden AB (ESAB) – Västervik, Sweden • Elfa Doors AB (EDAB) – Mullsjö, Sweden • Elfa Manufacturing Poland (EMP) – Koszalin, Poland Elfa strives to reduce the environmental impact of the group as a whole and has therefore implemented a number of group-wide policies and activities. Up until today we measure and set targets for the three manufacturing facilities, but our aim is to do the same for all offices within the group. We have limited our measurements so far to measuring “gate to gate”, and we use the calendar year.

As a result of the energy mapping process (EKL) that was carried out in 2016, a number of measures were implemented such as ventilation control, which contributed to this reduction in energy consumption during 2017. No further investments in energy efficiency has been made during 2017 and 2018, which is why, when taking into account the volumes, energy consumption per production unit has stayed more or less unchanged 2018 vs 2017. 9 WATER CONSUMPTION FACTORY 2015 2016 2017 2018 2018 (m3) (m3) (m3) (m3) vs 2017 Total 8 327 8 201 6 623 7 012 6% ESAB – Västervik 5 859 5 775 4 262 4 605 8% EMP – Koszalin 1 901 1 923 1 851 1 890 2% EDAB – Mullsjö 567 503 510 517 1% In 2018 the water consumption increased by 6% for the group. This increase derives primarily from a problem we had in 2017 when our steel suppliers changed oil, which polluted our washing system. The problem was resolved in December 2017, but the solution entails that we need to stir the water more, leading to vaporization and a higher demand on refilling. However, the solution we have in place meets requirements on product quality and increase the CO 2 EMISSIONS FACTORY 2015 2016 2017 2018 2018 (tonnes) (tonnes) (tonnes) (tonnes) vs 2017 Total 1 440 2 036 1 990 2 063 4% ESAB – Västervik 0 523 510 517 1% EMP – Koszalin 1 440 1 508 1 476 1540 4% EDAB – Mullsjö 0 5,2 3,9 5,8 50% CO2 emissions increased by 4% in 2018, due to a change of the mix, from electricity to gas and district heating, which have higher CO2 emission than electricity from renewable sources. There are two main reasons for the changed mix. One is the increase of operating hours in ESAB’s washing station, which is heated with district heating. The other reason is that when EDAB went from shrink film packaging to stretch foil wrapping, more heating was needed in the hall as the shrink film oven was removed. 10 WASTE AND RECYCLING Overall there was a 3% increase in waste. While iron, wood and combustible accounted for the largest increase, hazardous waste decreased the most. However, the greater part of the waste from Elfa’s manufacturing operations is either recycled or is used to recover energy. According to Stena Recycling, the company handling waste from the manufacturing sites in Sweden, 83,9% of our waste is recycled, 15,5% goes to energy recovery and 0,6% to deposit.

Solving our problems in the washing process during end of 2017 and fine tuning the process during 2018 have resulted in significant reduction of hazardous waste. Steel waste derives from our manufacturing, in which the raw material is shaped into its final form. Wood waste derives primarily from worn-out load carriers (pallets) that can no longer be used.

It has significantly increased the sheet metal production leading to more waste from cutting and stamping operation. Despite the fact that the increased volumes of Avera entailed increased painting operations, EMP has managed to reduce the hazardous waste from the painting operation.

During 2017 solid wood from pallets and other packaging support was added to the statistics, which explains the increase 2017 and 2018. 11 Elfa strives to reduce environmental impact at all stages of our products’ life Sustainable cycle: from product development and production to waste and recycling of product life cycle products and packaging. DURABLE PRODUCTS To reduce our environmental impact, it is important that products last as long as possible: i.e. they must be of high, consistent quality. We are also ensuring long term customer usage of our interior products as we make sure that all new developed products are fully compatible with older products. For instance, the Elfa hang standards have been exactly the same since the 1950s. We offer customers a warranty that lasts for ten years covering material and production faults in interiors and sliding doors. ENVIRONMENTAL Elfa Doors AB (EDAB) is ISO 14001:2015-certified and work is ongoing to MANAGEMENT SYSTEM have Elfa Sweden AB (ESAB) and Elfa Manufacturing Poland (EMP) ISO 14001:2015-certified in FY20. SUSTAINABLE SUPPLIERS Elfa steadily strives to establish a proactive collaboration with its suppliers in the promotion of lawful, professional, and fair practices that integrate the respect for human rights, safe work place, business ethics and the environment. Further clarifications and easy to use guidelines were therefore made in Elfa’s Supplier Code of Conduct. The Code sets out the minimum standards of business behaviour expected of Suppliers, who must have processes in place to monitor and maintain these standards. The updated version of the Code will be rolled out in fiscal year 2019 and we strive towards having at least 85% of the suppliers of direct material signing the Code. In addition, Elfa qualifies all new suppliers of direct material by requiring a “self-assessment” in which questions on sustainability is integrated. Before final approval of a supplier, the self-assessment is followed up via a visit to the supplier. Elfa also performs audits of existing suppliers of direct material according to an audit schedule. The aim of this is to ensure that suppliers are still qualified to supply Elfa. In 2018 6 audits were performed on new and existing suppliers of direct material. 12 Our engagement in a good, sustainable working environment is outlined in SUSTAINABLE our Working Environment Policy and the indicators we work with include sickWORKING ness absence, staff turnover and risk analyses.

The company tracks overall sickness absence and short-term sickness absence and reports this for each legal unit. One risk with a high sickness absence is that it creates stress among the other co-workers. Sickness absence at Elfa is relatively high in the manufacturing facilities. However, we are actively working towards reversing the trend and reduce sickness absence. The activity plan includes for example early actions in case of repeated short-term absences and rehabilitation investigations when there is a risk the absence will be more than 60 days. And, we are focusing strongly on health factors such as skills development/the ability to grow with the job, clear organisation and work management, visual targets and being seen. There are challenges in regard to absence at our factory in Poland and one risk with a high sickness absence is that it creates stress among the other co-workers. Short-term absence is relatively common, and we continuously follow people up individually to support any rehabilitation needs. Our longterm target is to have short-term absence of no more than 3% R12 by 2023. Our work on reducing the sick rate includes job rotation, transfers, ergonomic investment and work environment investment in the form of sound insulation and heating control. We prioritise preventive healthcare work, and offer activities such as access to a gym, swimming pool and massage, among other things. OVERALL SICKNESS ABSENCE FY18 Note: Over the year, short-term absence at Elfa Norway AS was 2,64%, but because the figures for Elfa Norway AS couldn’t be broken down by month, these are not included in the chart above. 14 By the end of fiscal year 2018 Elfa as a group had 513 employees. As an emOrganisation and ployer, Elfa strives for a balance of skills including internal talent and external employment expertise, and we note that the balance of skills currently fulfils the company’s strategy as desired. We use recruitment agencies to handle increases and decreases in production rates at our manufacturing facilities. This provides security for Elfa’s employees, the majority of whom are permanently employed full-time.

Elfa’s systematic work in regard to the work environment includes actively Risks and risk striving to meet high-level work environment targets, continuously performing management risk assessments and analysing and handling with risks in the business. This work also includes working with 5S and continuous improvements on a daily basis. Risk observations, incidents and accidents, are systematically reported, analysed and handled. In Sweden this is handled via the web-based tool called TIA. In our view, risk observations are an important factor in preventing accidents. NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS WITH ABSENCE FY18 Number of accidents per company in fiscal year 2018, with absence from work 15 At Elfa we take pride in our culture and core values to focus on our customers, RESPECT FOR care about innovation, act in a professional manner, believe in humanitarian HUMAN RIGHTS values and to share a holistic approach. Also, because we recognize that Elfa is an integral part of society and that what we do goes beyond our operations, we signed the UN Global Compact, in 2018. Accordingly, the 10 principles are integrated into our business strategy, policies and procedures and we are driving awareness and action in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030. The SDG is a set of 17 goals and we have chosen to focus on four of the goals, Sustainable which we can impact more: Development Goals SDG5 • We respect and value differences is a guiding principle Achieve gender equality at Elfa, and we therefore have a zero-tolerance policy and empower all women regarding all forms of offensive treatment, harassment and girls and discrimination. • We put requirements on Suppliers to sign and align with the Supplier Code of Conduct SDG8 • We strive towards ensuring fair dealing, combating corPromote sustained, ruption, creating a fair, healthy and safe workplace and inclusive and sustainable ensuring zero tolerance regarding all forms of offensive economic growth, full and treatment, harassment and discrimination productive employment • We put requirements on Suppliers to sign and align and decent work for all with the Supplier Code of Conduct SDG12 • We strive towards reducing the environmental impact Ensure sustainable at all stages of our products' life cycle: from product consumption and producdevelopment and production to waste and recycling of tion patterns products and packaging. • We work systematically towards reducing or eliminating the use of hazardous substances in our products. • We have an environmental management system in place at all three manufacturing sites and the site in Mullsjö (EDAB) is certified according to ISO 14001:2015 • We put requirements on Suppliers to sign and align with the Supplier Code of Conduct SDG16 • The group's business and ethical guidelines are laid Promote peaceful and down in the TCS Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, inclusive societies for Elfa Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct. In sustainable development, these documents, we make clear that we must always provide access to justice comply with the respective country's applicable bribery for all and build effective, legislation and anti-corruption laws, as well as related accountable and inclusive conventions on bribery and corruption. institutions at all levels Our efforts comprise to make for equal value and rights of all people, to ensure fair, healthy and safe workplaces, to have a sustainable and precautionary approach to environmental challenges in manufacturing, to steadily strive for sustainability in all product and packaging development to put requirements on our suppliers and partners. And so, it follows from our core values and from signing the UN Global Compact that we recognize the benefits of diversity, equity, fair dealing and we always treat one another with respect. 16 Our business philosophy of treating employees, customers, dealers and the Codes of Conduct societies in which we operate with respect and dignity is expressed in our codes of conduct. TCS CODE OF BUSINESS TCS Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which all employees at TCS and CONDUCT AND ETHICS Elfa are required to sign, makes clear the basic and fundamental values and business philosophies about treating employees, customers, vendors, our communities, all stakeholders, with respect and dignity. ELFA CODE OF CONDUCT Elfa Code of Conduct, which applies to all Elfa employees, is a guide designed to help all Elfa employees to connect with our values and provide expectations for our everyday behaviour. The Code is where we find direction on how to conduct ourselves as Elfa employees when we interact with each other, our customers, the communities in which we operate and other stakeholders. It is the place to start when we face an ethical dilemma, and it provides information on who to contact when we have questions or concerns. SUPPLIER CODE OF The Supplier Code of Conduct, which applies to our suppliers, make clear how CONDUCT to establish a proactive collaboration with our suppliers in the promotion of lawful, professional, and fair practices that integrate the respect for human rights, business ethics and the environment. The Code is based on fundamental compliance principles such as the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact with the aim to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and to Elfa’s core values of being customer focused, innovative, professional, human and having a holistic approach. Respecting and valuing differences is one of our guiding principles, and Elfa Preventing has a zero-tolerance policy regarding all forms of offensive treatment, harassharassment and ment and discrimination. offensive treatment To prevent and combat all forms of harassment and offensive treatment, we therefore carry out continuous training, work on managerial issues, charting and analyses. There are also clear rules as to how the employee, manager and company should react if anyone is affected. The employer bears ultimate responsibility for the work environment, and it is always the line manager who bears the main responsibility for preventing harassment and violation of human rights. That said, Elfa employees have a duty to respond if a work colleague’s rights are violated at work. It is difficult to deal with harassment and insulting treatment, and the option of external assistance is therefore available to ensure an impartial judgement and provide trust in the process. 17 18 Bribery and corruption distort the market, interfere with free competition, and COMBATING violate laws that carry significant penalties for the companies and individuals CORRUPTION involved. This means that there can be no sustainable development unless we tackle corruption. Elfa is therefore engaging in Sustainable Development Goal number 16, which includes commitments to fight corruption, increase transparency, tackle illicit financial flows and improve access to information. The group’s business and ethical guidelines are laid down in the TCS Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and in the Elfa Code of Conduct, where the latter reads: “Elfa does not participate in or endorse any corrupt practices, including offering or accepting kickbacks, bribes, excessive gifts or hospitality, or facilitation payments – directly or indirectly, such as through a third party. We will not accept suppliers, vendors or partners that offer bribes and we will take necessary action if such actions are uncovered. At Elfa we want to ensure independence in our business relation decisions, therefore Elfa employees may not offer or receive gifts or excessive entertainment.” To ensure Elfa, at all times, conduct business ethically, fairly and in compliance with respective country’s applicable bribery legislation and anti-corruption laws, as well as related conventions on bribery and corruption, we are carrying out complete educational actions throughout Elfa. In addition, we have made clear that all Elfa employees are responsible and accountable for reporting suspected or known misconduct. Ways of reporting a concern are communicated via the intranet, in our Code of Conduct and in the educational material. During 2017 we have worked to strengthen the integrity of both our customPersonal integrity ers and employees. New policies, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance commitment, have been adopted and the system of authorising access to personal data processed by Elfa has been reviewed and tightened up. 19 20
