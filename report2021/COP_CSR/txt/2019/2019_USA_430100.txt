We have met or are making steady progress toward five of our six 2020 footprint reduction goals. However, the sixth goal, reducing our waste-to-landfill, is an ongoing challenge and priority, and in this report we share some of what we’ve learned along the way. Those lessons are the basis of our determination to keep striving to reduce waste in the company’s own processes and within the industry. Our next set of long-term goals, with a target date of 2030, will be based on science and informed by where the world needs us to be, as a leader in addressing the most critical issues, local and global. We aspire to be a netpositive company, where the positive impacts of our people and products far outweigh the negative impacts. We’re engaging a wide range of stakeholders in the process of identifying the right aspirations and setting ambitious and measurable goals. All Owens Corning employees share the goal to ensure this is a company whose actions make a positive difference to the world and inspire our many stakeholders to be part of our journey. Through this report and our website, we are proud to report our progress and reflect on our opportunities as a sustainable enterprise.

This includes relationships with unions, work councils, and employee associations around the world. The specific language and scope of our labor agreements vary from site to site. All are structured to recognize the importance jointly placed upon the commitment to health and safety as guiding principle and core value for both Owens Corning and our workers. In all our facilities, employees are trained to understand, appreciate, and mitigate risk in the interest of their own safety and health, the safety and health of those around them, and of the organization overall. NOTICE PERIODS FOR OPERATIONS CHANGES The company uses a variety of methods, including its global intranet site, email communications, and leadership meetings with team members, to ensure that workers are informed of operations changes. Owens Corning provides at least the minimum notice required, which varies by local legislation and collective bargaining agreements in the regions where we operate. In many jurisdictions, our union and self-represented employees enjoy similar notice periods because of strong employee relations and labor practices, as well as applicable regulations.

In 2018, we recorded an average of 13 training hours per employee+, focused on both quality and quantity of development beyond basic compliance training. Nearly 2,000 employees (about 10% of our total population) joined us through acquisition and were not added to our system, and granted LMS access, until December 2018. Any training this employee group received prior to this time occurred outside of our LMS. Moving forward, we have adjusted our annual goal to be as follows: an average of 20 hours of training for our primary workforce and 10 hours of training for our nonprimary (salaried) workforce. Separating these targets makes sense, as the two populations have different needs for regular education and typically receive their training in different ways.

Owens Corning Chief Sustainability Officer Frank O’BrienBernini discussed this concept in his opening remarks. The keynote speaker, Frank Sesno, former journalist, author, and director of George Washington University’s School of Media and Public Affairs, added another element in his own address: “Let’s all shut up and listen.” Sesno focused on the importance of asking the right questions and listening for answers, for what is left unsaid, and noting things such as facial expressions and body language. Sesno stressed the importance of asking strategic questions about the sustainability journey in terms of risk, success, and challenging the status quo. “Ask yourselves and the people Frank O'Brien-Bernini discusses Owens around you for creativity, in thought, in what you can do, in Corning's progress in sustainability. what you’re doing as a team,” he said. In his opening remarks, O’Brien-Bernini explained, “We’re trying to get so much done in our company right now. We can change the conversation, perhaps, and maybe change the trajectory of the world by asking the right question at the right time of the right person.” The summit was attended by employees, customers, and suppliers, and broadcast and recorded for all Owens Corning employees.

At Owens Corning, we are on a “march to zero” – zero accidents, zero defects, zero losses. Our ultimate goal is to achieve perfect production at all our global manufacturing plants. To achieve this ambitious goal, we have adopted a systematic approach called Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). TPM is a comprehensive management system focused on proactive and preventive activities to maintain, operate, and improve production and to foster a culture of safety and zero losses. TPM includes eight pillars: ■■ Training and development: Skills assessments identify gaps, and training and sharing of best practices improve skills in a practical and safe way. ■■ Autonomous maintenance: By empowering teams to prevent or fix problems, we slow the deterioration of equipment and processes, and drive cultural and behavioral change. ■■ Focused improvement: By identifying and quantifying losses throughout the plant, we can focus on prioritizing how the losses will be eliminated and assign the right resources to these tasks. ■■ Planned maintenance: Combined with autonomous maintenance, planned maintenance enables us to be more proactive. ■■ Early management: Eliminating losses and abnormalities in the design and development of new equipment, processes, and products reduces the time between development and launch and lowers lifecycle costs. 2018 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | DIFFERENCE DRIVEN | 75 O P E R AT I O N A L E X C E L L E N C E Total Productive Maintenance ■■ Quality maintenance: Establishing and maintaining optimal equipment conditions helps prevent quality defects. ■■ Office and administration: Activities that increase the quality, usefulness, and timeliness of information for internal and external customers lead to real improvements and align administrative resources with performance needs. ■■ Environment, health, and safety: Combining corporate PHOTO CREDIT: Sharla Cochran | Granville, Ohio, U.S. environmental, health, and safety (EHS) programs with Taken on Rarotonga in the Cook Islands TPM activities furthers the culture of safety among all employees.

Programmatically, this is achieved via a comprehensive and rigorous focus on exposure control and a classic approach to employee health screening, where appropriate. As a result, there are no worker groups with a high incidence of occupational disease. We also work to understand and control exposure to hazards that might cause injury, including stress and noise. Safety procedures are in place for specific hazards, including handling chemicals or hazardous substances. We use a risk ranking system based on the frequency of Prith Gandhi (Toledo, Ohio) and Paul Wei exposure, how severe an injury could be, how likely an (Shanghai, China) tour a facility. incident is to happen, and the level of controls currently being utilized.

In 2018, the plant implemented a new briquette production line designed to reuse certain types of waste. Creation of the line resulted in the addition of 12 jobs and the reduction of more than 7,000 tons of waste. Employees at the plant see this waste reduction success as just one element of a larger sustainability strategy. Paroc participates in activities that support environmental safety and protection in the Tver region. The business even advises the Commissioner for Human Rights of Tver Region’s social program, which advocates for residents’ environmental rights. “We constantly seek to increase the level of ecological awareness of our employees,” said Natalya Desheva, the Izoplit environment and industrial safety manager. “Just this year, we have organized several events including tree Ivan Baranovskij (Vilinus, Lithuania) is part of the plantings, days without a car, and community work days.” Paroc stone wool insulation team.

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF OUR QUARRIES Our quarries extract industrial rock from the earth. In contrast to many traditional mining operations, all rock sourced from our quarries is used in some capacity. Leveraging operational control, we ensure that our quarries generate zero stone waste by having solutions in place for all variants of stone sourced from the quarries: ■■ Fine granules that are not directly relevant to stone wool production are either sold into the glass industry, used in construction, or compacted into briquettes, which can then be inputs for stone wool production; ■■ Usable stone is sent to our manufacturing sites to create stone wool; ■■ Rock that is not suitable for stone wool, known as “country rock,” is used to provide infrastructure for the quarry, to shore up sediment embankments, and as aggregate material for building projects. In addition to managing stone waste, we manage the soil and water impacts of our quarries. When a quarry is developed, topsoil is moved but kept onsite. Most of the topsoil becomes a part of the landscape again, with grass and trees growing in. Trees can be planted intentionally, but also come in naturally over time. Some of the topsoil PHOTO CREDIT: is used as filler in quarry infrastructure. Jim Hill | Denver, Colorado, U.S. The developed quarry also becomes a gathering point for rainwater from the surrounding region. Water that collects in the quarry is regularly monitored, tested, and pumped out to nearby sources.

Strategy and Approach Owens Corning has policies and procedures in place to ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, and that enable the company to meet its high standards for corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous country-specific, regional, and local laws and regulations relating to the presence of hazardous materials, pollution, and protection of the environment, including emissions to air, discharges to water, management of hazardous materials, handling and disposal of solid wastes, and remediation of contaminated sites. Owens Corning applies an environmental management system based on the principles of ISO to all manufacturing facilities. The management system also helps us track progress toward our 2020 sustainability goals, which require significant global reductions in environmental impacts beyond compliance. In 2018, the environmental management system (EMS) for approximately 35% of our locations was certified to ISO 14001, which accounts for 43% of our employees.

António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary-General: Owens Corning is proud to be a member of the Global Compact, and I am pleased to once again confirm our commitment to the ten principles. As the attached report illustrates, Owens Corning’s commitment extends beyond simply making our products and operations sustainable. By building broad objectives of sustainability into the way we do business, we seek to balance economic growth with social Owens Corning World Headquarters progress and environmental stewardship. This work resonates deeply with the One Owens Corning Parkway sense of purpose that Owens Corning employees share: our people and our Toledo, Ohio 43659 419.248.8000 products make the world a better place. To help bring that purpose to life, we are engaged in a continuous effort to advance the same principles that are articulated in the Global Compact. Our sustainability strategy incorporates those principles and is driven by our company values, which guide the way we interact with our communities as well as our customers, suppliers, and colleagues. Through the lens of that strategy, Owens Corning has evaluated the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and identified several that are material to our business and on which we believe we have direct impact through our core business competencies. We also identified those where we can have influence, either directly or indirectly. For those aligned with our material issues, we are already underway with active programs and reporting. This work is included in our report. Many of Owens Corning’s sustainability efforts have been recognized by organizations that evaluate our progress against high standards and industry benchmarks. For example, for the sixth consecutive year, Owens Corning earned distinction in 2018 as one of the world’s most sustainable companies – within 1 percent of the top score globally – from sustainability investment specialist SAM. This year, Owens Corning was also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the ninth straight year, and ranked as the Building Product industry leader for the sixth consecutive year. In 2018, Owens Corning’s key achievements include a percentile ranking score of 100 in all three dimensions of the Index – social, economic, and environmental. The company also earned a perfect score in the following criteria: Materiality, Climate Strategy, Environmental Reporting, Recycling Strategy, Water Related Risks, and Social Reporting. 2018 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | DIFFERENCE DRIVEN | 221 APPENDICES Appendix E — UN Global Compact Communication on Progress In addition to recognition from Dow Jones and RobecoSAM, in 2018 Owens Corning earned a position on CDP’s “A List” for climate change and received an “A-“ score for water. Our actions were further recognized by our placement on Corporate Responsibility Magazine’s annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the third consecutive year, moving up from 25 to 3. Owens Corning became a member of the Health is Everyone’s Business Action Platform of the UN Global Compact in 2018. The ambition of the Action Platform is to make health everyone’s business, where SDG #3 is a corporate goal and leadership aspiration among businesses across all sectors. Owens Corning provided best practice information on our Healthy Living Platform and was interviewed by Duke University, which gathered and analyzed the state of corporate actions for wellness and well-being. We also introduced the SHINE organization to the ongoing work. The group is working toward providing a guide for corporations to use to approach health as an integrated part of their business goals and to go beyond the immediate occupational health actions to meet the goals of SDG #3. The company’s latest Sustainability Report, attached, provides details about our progress and current efforts in areas related to the ten principles of the Global Compact and more.

SCS Global Services’ (SCS) responsibility was to carry out a moderate level of assurance on the report in adherence to AccountAbility’s Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness. In addition, SCS conducted an assurance on the reasonableness of a subset of the material performance information provided in the Owens Corning 2018 Sustainability Report. Scope The scope of SCS’ work included Owens Corning’s global operations. A Type 2 Assurance Engagement was performed to evaluate Owens Corning against the AA1000 Principles to a moderate level. In addition, SCS provided assurance on the reasonableness of specific performance data. For 2018 Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and energy use, a high level of assurance was conducted. A moderate level of assurance was performed for 2018 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the following 2018 performance data: water usage, waste streams, specified air pollution emissions (particulate matter 2.5 microns or less, NOX and SOX), key social performance indicators, and 2018 progress towards 2020 sustainability goals included in the Report. Standards SCS performed the assurance of the Owens Corning 2018 Sustainability Report against the AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008). In addition, SCS evaluated the Report against the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards for reporting. Specific performance data were assessed utilizing internationally recognized standards including:  ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information  World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), March 2004 along with Scope 2 and Scope 3 Guidance  ISO 14064-3:2006 Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of GHG assertions Assurance Team and Methodology Our team was comprised of Tina Sentner, Dr. Gerard Mansell, Tavio Benetti, Inna Kitaychik, Vincent Katharua, and Neil Mendenhall with qualifications available online and upon request. SCS’ Assurance Team undertook the following summarized activities:  Reviewed Owens Corning’s materiality processes and systems for stakeholder engagement;  Tested mechanisms by calling and interviewing staff and contractors responsible for collecting and responding to stakeholder concerns;  Reviewed and analyzed material performance data collected at the corporate and site-levels to identify any material misstatements or process calculation errors; Version 1-0 (May 2018) | © SCS Global Services Page 1 of 3 2018 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | DIFFERENCE DRIVEN | 225 APPENDICES Appendix F —Assurance Statement  Conducted on-site interviews of management and staff at Owens Corning’s Headquarters and a sample of international sites; and  Reviewed the Sustainability Report for material misstatements and its alignment to the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Limitations SCS conducted extensive interviews with management and staff, reviewed data, and performed limited recalculations based on internationally recognized sampling techniques. This process enables us to conclude that the Report is assured to a moderate level which reduces the risk of our conclusions being in error but does not reduce it to zero. Conclusions Based on the methodology and activities performed we have found that Owens Corning is adhering to AccountAbility’s Principles (2008 Version). A summary of our conclusions and evidence in support of these conclusions follows: Inclusivity: Owens Corning has effectively integrated stakeholders into the development of their products and processes as a strategy to improve performance. In 2018 Owens Corning crossed a milestone and now has more facilities and employees outside of the United States than it does inside. Going forward Owens Corning will need to take extra care to engage regional stakeholders outside the US and understand their concerns. SCS performed more on-site assurance activities abroad this year with a focus on facilities in China to affirm adherence to this Principle. Materiality: Owens Corning’s materiality assessment and matrix was not updated for the 2018 reporting year but is slated for an update by 2020 when they will finalize their new sustainability goals. The assessment team looked at the impact of acquisitions made in 2018 and the processes Owens Corning used to evaluate the impact of adding new operations. Because the new plants were largely similar to existing facilities and the acquisition of Paroc, in particular, included years of experience reporting on sustainably there was substantial evidence of operational alignment and a reasonable justification for not updating the material issues this year. However, recommendations below include agreed improvements for succeeding years. Responsiveness: SCS reviewed a number of mechanisms in place for capturing information from stakeholders and responding to their concerns. These mechanisms were found to be effective and responsive. Evidence was available to show how reported information was acted on in a timely manner. The assurance team conducted on-site interviews and reviewed key systems to determine that this Principle is being met. Our review of the management systems, data and calculations regarding Owens Corning’s reporting of 2018 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste, air pollution, social performance indicators and 2018 progress towards 2020 sustainability goals were assured at a moderate-level and no material errors or misstatements identified in the final draft chapters of the report. Owens Corning’s reported 2018 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and energy use was assured at a high-level and can be considered reliable. In addition, Owens Corning’s Report was found to conform to GRI Standards. 2018 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | DIFFERENCE DRIVEN | 226 Version 1-0 (May 2018) | © SCS Global Services Page 2 of 3 APPENDICES Appendix F —Assurance Statement Observations & Recommendations All identified errors and material observations were satisfactorily addressed prior to the publication of this Report. SCS recommends, however, that future stakeholder identification, outreach, and materiality analysis be more regionally focused to better identify and address regional material issues and be more responsive to local stakeholders. This will be of increasing importance with the growth of Owens Corning’s international operations. Independence SCS Global Services is an independent and internationally accredited conformance assessment body. All members of the assurance team were internally reviewed to ensure they were free from conflicts of interest. SCS has no financial dependence on Owens Corning beyond the scope of this engagement and a limited number of independent assessments and product certifications it performs annually.
