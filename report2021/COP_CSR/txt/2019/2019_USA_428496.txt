OCTOBER: Fires ignited the United States’ Southern California region, charring over 280,000 acres and destroying over 1,000 structures. 2 3 OUR STORY OF RESILIENCE Resilience is a key pillar in the services we provide our clients and the goals we are pursuing in our own sustainability efforts. While every organization and situation merits its own unique assessment of resiliency considerations and requirements, we believe there are a few, often overlooked principles that bring significant value to every resiliency discussion: IMAGINATIVE, WIDE-RANGING THREAT ANALYSIS; MASSIVE, BOUNDARY-JUMPING PARTNERSHIPS; AND LONG-TERM, HOLISTIC INTEGRATION OF RESILIENCY INTO ALL STRATEGIC PLANNING. In this report, we share some of our experiences responding to the natural disasters of 2017. We highlight some of our most innovative thinking about building a more resilient world. And we describe some of the inspiring work of our own employees who are taking the concept of resilience to heart and bringing solutions to projects and communities all across the globe. 4 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS RESILIENCE IS KEY TO BUILDING A BETTER WORLD.

The Category 5 hurricane raised havoc, downing power lines, destroying homes, knocking out transportation and limiting access to clean water. Building resilience into our institutions, our infrastructure, our systems and our communities has never been more important. This goes beyond standard risk assessment and mitigation planning. It requires a willingness to imagine the unimaginable and create defenses that can weather their occurrence. THE CRISIS HIGHLIGHTED THAT BUILDING RESILIENCE INTO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEMS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CRITICAL.

From oceans and deserts to small villages and vast cities, and to the people in those communities and the resources on which they depend, our changing world impacts everything and everyone.
