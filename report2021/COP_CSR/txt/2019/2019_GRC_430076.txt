(the Airport Company or AIA) Financial Statements for its 23rd financial period. The present report refers to these statements as well as to any supplementary information necessary or useful for the statements’ appreciation and approval by the General Assembly, according to the proposal of the Board of Directors. Year 2018 has been marked by the developments on the 20-year extension of the airport’s concession term. The Airport Company submitted its final financial offer in August 2018, and on this basis, the concession extension received the approval from the competent national and European authorities before the year-end. Furthermore, the Airport Company signed the required financing agreements with a consortium of banks for the payment of part of the consideration for the concession extension. The concession extension finally became effective in February 2019, following its ratification by the Hellenic Parliament and the concession consideration was paid to the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF) three business days after the effectiveness of the concession extension in line with the contractual time limits. This historic achievement concludes a very lengthy process, opening at the same time a new horizon and development potential for the Airport Company. Focusing now on the developments in the aviation business, in 2018, the global aviation industry continued to demonstrate a successful course, with consumers benefiting from lower travel costs and additional routes, despite uncertainty around global geopolitical developments and issues such as Brexit and rising trade wars’ related tensions. On a global level, airlines achieved healthy profitability with net profit margins in 2018 estimated at the level of 3.9%, according to International Air Transport Association (IATA), while Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPKs) increased overall by 6.5%1. Airport Council International (ACI) also reports strong traffic rise on the global scale at 5.8%2, whereas in Europe, passenger traffic posted an average growth of 6.1%3. Non-EU airports led the way of growth in passenger traffic (+8.3%), while EU airports also achieved a robust increase (+5.4 %), with gains in the first months of the year being somewhat limited due to air traffic control disruptions, airline strikes and consolidation. Focusing on AIA, in 2018, traffic achieved a high performance in terms of passenger traffic (24.14 million passengers) and of flights (217,094 flights) reaching its historical top. International travellers proved once again to be the main growth driver with an increase of 13.8%, while domestic passengers also presented a healthy rise by 5.6%. In terms of nationality, foreign residents significantly increased their travelling in 2018, vis-à-vis a slower rise of Greek residents’ travelling. In 2018, the Airport Company presented healthy results and recorded Profit Before Tax of €239.7 million, increased by € 39.9 million compared to 2017. Growth in operating revenues due to traffic development was essentially reflected in the Company’s profits, since the cost base was kept at low per passenger levels. In view of the Airport Company’s payment of the Consideration for the extension of its concession period (effected in February 2019), no dividend to the shareholders is proposed. The sections that follow, depict in more detail the developments in 2018. 1. Traffic Highlights With 24.14 million passengers in 2018, the Airport Company delivered a historical top performance which exceeded prior-year levels by 2.4 million (+11%), of which 2 million are attributed to growth of the international market by 13.8%. The domestic market also presented a healthy rise of 5.6%. Foreign residents achieved a strong growth of nearly 20%, while Greek residents showed small growth vs. 2017 of only 1%. The growing appeal of Athens as a popular destination, supported by the joint and coordinated relevant actions of the Airport Company with stakeholders from the airline and tourism industries, is clearly reflected in the dynamic growth of the O&D passengers by 14%. Still, transfer passengers’ traffic demonstrated a robust 1 (source: IATA Economic Performance of the Industry end year 2018 report) 2 (source: ACI Worldwide Airport Traffic Report March 2019) 3 (source: ACI Europe Press Release Feb 2019) 2 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM growth of (+10%). Regarding developments in international passenger traffic per region, it is important to note that all regions enjoyed a healthy growth which was supported by the significantly enhanced airport’s route network coupled with a robust passenger demand. The top 5 international destinations are all within Europe, being with ranking order: London, Larnaca, Rome, Istanbul and Paris, while in the domestic front Thessaloniki, Santorini, Heraklion, Rhodes and Chania. During 2018, eight new airlines launched operations to/from Athens and 24 new international routes were introduced, further expanding the airport’s route network. In 2018 Athens was directly connected with scheduled services with 154 destinations-cities, 121 of which international (including 21 non-European) in 53 countries, operated by a total of 65 carriers. In the same year, 23 LCCs offered services to 75 airports worldwide (compared to 56 airports in 2017). Overall, the number of flights to/from Athens International Airport during 2018 amounted to 217,094 (+10.8%), the highest ever performance, with the previous best performance recorded in 2009 (210,147). Both domestic and international flights grew substantially in the year under review, at the level of 10.6% and 10.9%, respectively. The 2018 summer period reached its highest peak ever on the 30th of July, with 99,500 passengers (busiest day ever) and 890 aircraft movements (exceeded only by the busiest departure day following the 2007 Champions League final, which had recorded 923 aircraft movements). Finally, with regards to cargo, similarly to the country’s overall economic growth reflected by GDP growth close to 2% in 2018, cargo volumes rose slightly albeit steadily for the fifth consecutive year and reached 92.57 thousand tonnes representing an overall annual increase of 3.1%, propped up by further gains in exports, which have been surpassing imports for seven years in a row. 2. Business Highlights AIA’s business highlights for the year 2018 are presented hereunder: 2.1 Airport Operations Airside Capacity The Airport Company provides all aviation related infrastructure at the airport and supervises ground operations provided through the rights granted to contractors. The Airport Company ensured smooth and efficient operations throughout 2018 and maintained its non-coordinated status with regards to slots. Even in periods of high traffic and aircraft parking stands’ high demand during the summer period, requirements were adequately addressed through thorough planning and per case operational arrangements. However, delays related to Air Traffic Control (ATC) capacity in the Greek FIR and Athens Terminal Area were registered at times. The airport’s runway systems can accommodate a traffic of up to 50 million annual passengers thus, during 2018, the Airport Company has repeatedly raised the issue of the runway systems’ underutilization at peak traffic hours by ATC. Relevant notifications were given to the Governor of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority (HCAA) and Eurocontrol, with the aim to waive capacity restrictions imposed at local level by the Air Navigation Services Provider. As a result, several working groups were formed with the participation of all stakeholders, which resulted in the proposition of short and long-term measures for the increase of the ATC operational capacity. The resolution of the issue remains in progress. With regards to the airside parking capacity, in order to cope with the demand surge which was experienced in the summer of 2018 for ground stay and apron parking by General and Business Aviation aircraft, and the higher number of home-based aircrafts and night-stops, a “Prior Permission Required” operational process was initiated for the General and Business aviation flights, which proved an effective traffic management tool. Operational Compliance & Development This year was a significant one as it included the implementation of the annual Safety Action Plan for addressing effectively the continuous growth of operations on the airside, without compromising the safe and resilient operating environment. On Crisis Planning & Emergency Management, ten emergency exercises in total were carried out at AIA, including the annual full-scale emergency exercise “Aircraft Accident on Airport”. 3 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Following the late 2017 aerodrome certification conversion as per EASA, in accordance with the stipulations of the Commission Regulations4, EASA underwent an oversight audit on HCAA in mid-October 2018, with only a very few minor observations and recommendations (which were addressed by year-end). On the same note, all six remarks which were attached to the December 2017 EASA Aerodrome Certificate in the form of Deviation Acceptance & Action Documents (DAADs), were successfully closed in December 2018 following a relevant inspection by HCAA. On the week of May 7th-11th, a General Audit on regulatory compliance and operational performance was conducted by HCAA on AIA’s Security System. AIA’s readiness for the protection of passengers, flights and facilities against acts of unlawful interference, was thoroughly reviewed. The General Audit outcome reconfirmed that AIA maintains a high security level. Conclusively, it should be highlighted that AIA is fully compliant to the operational regulations and best practices in all aspects of airport operations. Other Operational Highlights and Developments Following a new IATA resolution 753 that compels baggage reconciliation both on departure and on arrival, a major upgrade in AIA’s Baggage Reconciliation System (BRS) was successfully carried out. AIA is amongst the first airports worldwide to have implemented provisions of the IATA resolution 753. The project was a joint effort of the Airport Company and Aegean Airlines. An additional communication platform next to the long existing Airport Cargo Community Committee has been introduced, i.e. the “Airport Ground Handling Action Group”, comprising the Airport Company and key business partners, aiming at quicker and more collaborative decision-making in the area of Ground handling. The three main Ground Handlers were introduced to the system in January 2019, while airlines and additional Ground Handlers are expected to join by early 2020. The Airport Company’s proposed action titled “AIA’s evolution into a high-performing node within the European ATM network”, was assessed as eligible for funding of up to €2,250,000. The action has been submitted in the context of the “2017 Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)/Transport Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research (SESAR) Call” and relates to a five-year (2019-2023) coherent plan aiming at the development and implementation of new concepts in a) airport operations, b) information sharing, and c) collaborative performance management. In 2018, the programme for “On-The-Job Training” awarded to the Airport Company by the Oman Airports was completed. During this large-scale training programme, 109 professionals from Oman have worked for approximately 4,000 hours next to their AIA peers, witnessing first-hand best practice operations in a variety of functions (e.g. airside and terminal operations, maintenance, etc.). It is worth to be noted that the Airport Company is one of the selected partners amongst the best in class airports, in terms of operational performance. For the sixth time in a row, the Airport Company and the members of the Athens Airport aviation fuel supply chain, were awarded a Gold distinction (Sustain Performance Award) by the Joint Inspection Group (JIG). 2.2 Pricing and Airport Marketing During 2018 the Airport Company continued its dynamic marketing strategy and incentives policy. The Airport Company’s aeronautical marketing strategy encompasses comprehensive developmental and targeted programmes for airlines, including incentives and marketing support packages, and constitutes a cornerstone of the Airport Company’s aeronautical strategy for healthy financial growth. At the annual consultation with the airport users, held in February 2018, as per the Airport Charges Directives (2009/12/EC) as these have been incorporated in the Greek legislation (PD 52/12), the Airport Company announced that all airport charges remain unchanged without any increase for the tenth consecutive year. Furthermore, the Airport Company continued to provide incentives to airlines, comprising growth incentives and a number of targeted ones. In total, 13 different developmental and targeted incentives, both for developing new markets as well as for 4 (EC) 216/2008, (EC) 1108/2009 and (EU) 139/2014 4 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM reinforcing existing ones, were in effect during 2018. Incentives are applied in a fully transparent and nondiscriminatory manner and they constitute a profitable business case. The majority of the operating carriers made use of one or more targeted or developmental incentives, many of which benefited further by receiving marketing support actions. The Airport Company’s targeted approach was also the main element of its 2018 marketing campaign towards the airlines. Specifically, the 2018 campaign featured the slogan “Do the Math” to reflect AIA’s successful growth during the previous year, and the opportunity this presents for the airlines since it creates the ideal environment for them to grow. The contribution of the airlines to AIA’s performance in 2018 was acknowledged by the Airport Company for the 19th consecutive year by presenting awards to those that recorded the highest passenger traffic growth during the specific year. For the last seven years, the Airport Company has channelled innovative marketing efforts to its airline business partners and to consumers, but it has also extended its endeavours to actively support the attractiveness of Athens as a year-round destination. Against this background, in order to gradually introduce Athens as a top European destination, the Airport Company, the Municipality of Athens, Aegean Airlines and SETE (Greek Tourism Confederation) have joined forces in an unprecedented for the Greek reality partnership, the “This is Athens & Partners” which involves actions towards the development, marketing, and management of Athens as a destination. All creative forces of the city are invited to participate in this partnership. Through an integrated, three-year development plan, “This is Athens & Partners” is committed to coordinating and implementing actions both for the development and upgrading of Athens, as well as for the effective promotion of the city in the major tourist markets abroad. In this context, significant benefits are expected for Athens and the city’s economy. The development plan focuses on three strategic areas: Destination Development, Destination Management and Destination Marketing. All three aim at developing and communicating products and services that will form the identity of Athens and will offer to the visitors a cohesive experience. The Airport Company once more organised the 6th Airport Chief Executives’ Symposium (ACES-Athens) in December 2018. This Airport Company initiative takes place in Athens on an annual basis, aiming to highlight the interdependence between the air transport industry and airports and the development of the destinations they serve, as well as to introduce actions for the strengthening of Athens as a tourism destination. The 2018 “ACESAthens” theme was “Growing Sustainably A new strategy for Airports & Destinations” and focused on seeking the golden balance between Business and Society and the need for a new holistic business-to-society strategy. In addition, the company contributed in many specialised conferences, workshops and events, promoting the high performance of the airport the high quality of its services. In this context, the Airport Company co-organized with IATA, the Global Airport & Passenger Symposium (GAPS) in October 2018. The GAPS is focusing on bringing together industry experts, senior airline and airport executives, government authorities and solution providers to explore current opportunities, challenges and recommended solutions to shape the future travel experience. 2.3 Consumers Retail services Capitalising on the growth of passenger traffic, AIA’s shopping centre recorded a very positive performance in 2018 with revenues increasing by 10.5% compared to the previous year. The main growth drivers were the commercial success of the recently upgraded Intra Schengen area, the solid performance of the Food & Beverage concepts introduced during the last years and the improved commercial performance of the newly-renovated Satellite Terminal Building. Indeed, an extensive commercial redevelopment project was carried out at Satellite Terminal Building (STB) in spring 2018, delivering a new terminal area of high aesthetical standards and considerably upgraded commercial value, paired with an increased STB’s Retail and Food & Beverage offering selection. At the same time, the Airport Company continued the effort of redesigning its commercial offering at both terminals, to better address the constantly evolving passenger demands. In this framework, a large Duty-Free shop and seven new specialty retail units commenced operations, while another specialty retail unit was substantially 5 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 renovated. Additionally, ten new Food & Beverage concepts were successfully introduced, and three new services units were added to AIA’s portfolio. As a result, AIA’s total commercial space now spans to more than 12,000 sq.m. Further to the above, the Airport Company launched a series of targeted marketing and co-promotional sales activities in close cooperation with the concessionaires, aiming to promote AIA’s shopping centre as part of a unique travel experience. These activities included several happenings to celebrate the launch of the new STB commercial area, the promotional campaign “Lucky Bag” in the Schengen area and the launch of the Shopping Centre experiential campaign “Live-it”, all achieving remarkable results in terms of enhancing customer experience and supporting the sales performance of the Shopping Centre. Landside services In 2018, the Airport Company’s car parking revenues increased by 3.8 % compared to the previous year. The recorded growth is largely a result of the aggressive marketing plan that was put into effect for a third consecutive year, to promote AIA’s parking services through radio spots, frequent newsletters, and intensive digital campaigns, all of which also communicated the new competitive pricing policy. The positive impact was also recorded in the performed Quality Monitor Survey, where the KPI “Acceptability of parking price/price level” improved by over 10% among parking users. Further to the marketing activities, the 2018 parking strategy also involved building and strengthening partnerships with concessionaires of AIA’s Shopping Centre and Retail Park, as well as with Attiki Odos and key airlines (e.g. Aegean Airlines), to boost transactions. Online booking was placed once more at the centre of the communications plan for the parking, in order to address ongoing business challenges, by generating sales and promoting the offered service against alternative airport access options and car parking competition. In 2018 e-parking tickets increased by a remarkable 22%, highly supported by the parking loyalty scheme “PARK€WIN” that doubled its members since last year, and already counts more than 60,000 members. Terminal Services In a year marked by an all-time record in passenger traffic, the Airport Company managed to offer personal assistance and information to more than 3.1 million passengers and visitors. The Airport Call Centre handled approximately 426,000 telephone inquiries with almost 95% of callers being served within 20 seconds. Additionally, more than 5,500 inquiries were received and processed electronically via the “airport info” service. To improve visibility, efficiency and overall service, the Central Airport Information Counter on the Departures level, available 24/7, was renovated during 2018 to form a “landmark” in the middle of the Check-In Hall. Also, as part of our business continuity plan, a new dedicated Call Centre facility was created at an alternative building, to ensure the smooth transition to an alternate site in case of major disruption of the regular Airport Call Centre operation at the Main Terminal. 2.4 Property Business Unit In 2018, property business of the Airport Company achieved positive results, key highlights being the improved performance of the Airport Hotel and the Exhibition Centre. Indeed, the Airport Hotel ‘Sofitel’ saw a new record in annual sales turnover in 2018, achieving an increase of 7.0% compared to last year. The ongoing renovation programme of the Hotel’s facilities involved the improvement of the 6th floor during the year, while works towards the refurbishment of the 5th and 7th floors commenced in late 2018, scheduled for completion within the first quarter of 2019. The Metropolitan Exhibition & Conference Centre recorded a considerable turnover growth of 33.8% vs. 2017, mostly due to hosting the biennial international shipping exhibition “POSIDONIA” and the improved performance of other major events such as “XENIA” and “FOOD EXPO”. Building on 2017’s firm performance, the Airport Retail Park presented a sales growth of 4.1% over the previous year. The performance was considerably aided by the Park’s operation on Sundays for a second consecutive year, 6 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM in specific from May to October, in line with the pertinent law addressing retail stores in tourist areas. Buildings and Space Leases mainly serving the airport community (i.e. airlines, ground handlers and state entities) also reflected an upward trend, with the occupancy rate reaching 88% over the available portfolio. Finally, the annual production of the Photovoltaic Park witnessed a 5% reduction compared to 2017, largely due to the unfavourable weather conditions in the second half of 2018. Still, the efficiency of the Park remains at a higher level than the national average. 2.5 Information Technology & Telecommunications The Airport Company through its Information Technology & Telecommunications (IT&T) services continued its effective performance, contributing to the unobstructed operations of AIA and its stakeholders along the year. Furthermore, its project portfolio was enriched with new B2B and B2C services using innovative technology, with the aim to enhance operational excellence and customer experience. Major Projects and Developments As part of the implementation of the Next Generation Networks (NGN) project related to the replacement of the Airport’s Data and Telephony Network, new capabilities and services to both AIA and the Airport community have been implemented. Specifically, AIA’s network is now equipped with 40Gbps capacity in the backbone and 1 Gbps to the user, traditional telephony has been migrated to Internet Protocol (IP), providing unified messaging with voice, video, presence and instant messaging, with increased services security, efficiency and availability. Also, against the continuously increasing demands of Internet capacity for both AIA and its customers, the Airport Company has successfully upgraded Internet bandwidth to 1 Gbps and 800 Mbps backup. The Airport Company completed the replacement of the existing emergency call-out notification platform (e-con) with a new platform. The aim of the system is to minimise the time for alerting staff of an organisation, external authorities and other parties to emergencies and other incidents and to monitor the progress of the sent notifications in real time. The annual IT&T Disaster Recovery exercise was performed with the participation of all involved parties and all systems were tested successfully. ISO 20000 and ISO 9001 certifications were renewed by TÜV AUSTRIA for the IT&T Business Unit. The interconnection between AIA’s Airport Operational Database platform (AODB) and Aegean Airlines’ Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was successfully completed. Also, the Airport Company successfully interfaced its Sort Allocation Computer System with Aegean Airline’s host computers, thus allowing the provision of information on the Arrival Belt Allocation to the airline’s passengers. The second “Digital Gate” innovation challenge, an initiative of the Airport Company in cooperation with the Athens University of Economics and Business and the scientific support of the Laboratory of Electronic Commerce and Business, has been successfully completed and the four awarded teams were publicly announced in the awards ceremony in February 2018. The Airport Company successfully launched a new innovative service based on emotional humanoid robot techniques. AIA’s robot, named “Pepper”, improves passenger experience by welcoming visitors and passengers at AIA and providing information on flights and weather at destination. The Airport Company also launched a “WeChat” application, (developed by a third-party provider) addressed to Chinese visitors, bolstering its decision to become one of the first “China-ready” airports in Europe. “WeChat” is the most widespread Chinese application with over 1 billion active users per month, offering messaging, social media and mobile payment functions. Finally, a new mobile application for AIA’s corporate website, www.aia.gr was built, improving end-user experience. 7 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 2.6 Major Corporate Projects and developments Extension of ADA Concession Period Further to the communication and exchange of information among the competent parties foreseen by the Concession Extension Agreement that had been signed on 30 September, 2017 (extending the Airport Company’s concession period by 20 years, i.e. until 11 June 2046), the Airport Company submitted its final offer to HRADF, which was accepted by HRADF’s Board of Directors on 14 September, 2018, while the offer and the correspondingly revised Concession Extension Agreement (the “Agreement”) were approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders of the Airport Company on 27 September, 2018. The final offer entailed payment of a Consideration amount of €1,115,000,000 to HRADF, adjusted by adding an amount equal to 10.30% per annum, calculated pro rata on a daily basis, in case payment occurs after 31 December, 2018. Furthermore, on 28 September, 2018, pursuant to the provisions of the Agreement, the Airport Company provided to HRADF the confirmation with regards to the commitment of the financial institutions for the financing of the Consideration of the Extension. On 2 October, 2018, the Agreement was pertinently submitted to the Court of Auditors, which approved that the execution of the Agreement between the Contracting Parties, namely the Greek State, HRADF and the Airport Company, is not impeded. Following the decision of the Court of Auditors and upon relevant actions of the pertinent services of the Ministry of Finance, the Agreement was submitted to DG Comp, which on 12 December, 2018 granted the respective approval resolving that this Agreement does not entail State Aid. At the same time, with its letter dated 11 December 2018, DG Grow confirmed that the conclusion of the Agreement is in compliance with the EU Law about Public Procurement. The Airport Company, based on the content of the Agreement, signed on 18 December, 2018 with a consortium comprising the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank, the required loan agreements for the issuance of a Second Lien Bond Loan amounting up to €665,600,000. Concurrently, in accordance with the Agreement, the European Investment Bank, upon the signing of the relevant amendments to the Master Facility Agreement, granted all necessary approvals in relation to the Agreement on 18 December, 2018. The ADA Concession Extension Agreement was ratified by the Hellenic Parliament on 14 February, 2019 and the effectiveness of the Concession Extension took place upon the relevant publication in the Government Gazette, i.e. law 4594/2019 on 19 February, 2019. The amount paid to HRADF as Consideration on 22 February, 2019 reached €1,131,676,123 (plus the applicable VAT) was comprised of the initial Consideration of €1,115,000,000 and the amount of €16,676,123 representing the adjustment for the period from 1 January, 2019 to 22 February, 2019. Second Lien Bond Loan In order to pay the Consideration for the concession extension to HRADF, the Airport Company has entered into a Second Lien Bond Loan Agreement for an amount up to € 665,600,000 with the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank as subscribers (namely the 2L Bond Loan). The 2L Bond Loan documentation was signed on 18 December, 2018, and the disbursement of the loan took place on 22 February, 2019, three business days after the effectiveness of the ADA Extension Agreement, i.e. within the time limit prescribed therein. The 2L Bond Loan was achieved in a very short period with the efforts of the Airport Company supported by expert financial and legal advisors. The selection of the Greek banks’ consortium was the result of a competitive process, which tapped the interest of the Greek and international markets to finance the Airport Company for this transaction and ensured best possible commercial terms and flexibility for the Airport Company. The 2L Bond Loan finally amounted to € 642,476,578 disbursed once off, with a 15-year tenor and semi-annual payments. The 2L Bond Loan is subordinated to the existing EIB loan, the latter to be fully repaid until June 2021. Terminal Facilities Capacity At the end of September 2018, passenger terminal facilities reached their capacity”trigger point” (i.e. 23.4 million passengers on a rolling twelve-month period which corresponds to 90% of the relevant capacity of 26 million annual passengers). Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of the ADA, the Airport Company, within 14 days 8 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM after reaching the trigger point, requested IATA to perform a passenger demand forecast of the next two years and to determine whether, after allowing for any increase in the design capacity of any buildings or equipment due to technological, organisational or other improvements, the relevant 90% threshold would still have been reached, and whether passenger traffic will reach or exceed the relevant 95% threshold within the next two years. Indeed, IATA’s independent review confirmed that the capacity of the airport’s passenger terminal facilities remains at 26 million annual passengers and therefore, the 90% threshold of the new capacity has been reached and furthermore, that the passenger traffic within the next two years will exceed the 95% threshold. Accordingly, the results of the IATA review were subsequently communicated to the Greek State. Main infrastructure projects The main infrastructure projects undertaken in 2018 are summarized below: • BHS-22: The project refers to a complete reconfiguration of the Baggage Handling System (BHS) in order to comply with the EU Standard 3 requirements (EU Regulation 1087/2011 refers) as well as to increase BHS capacity. This multiyear project is scheduled to be completed in 2022. • The scope involves: • Replacement of the existing Hold Baggage Screening Standard 2 equipment (x-rays) with Standard 3 equipment (tomographs) and necessary works in the two baggage halls including replacement of both sortation systems, as well as connection with the new check-in counters related to the Main Terminal South Wing Expansion; • Additional make-up carousels and one reclaim belt; • Development of a Transfer Baggage Facility replacing early baggage storage systems. Full implementation of the project will be carried out in phases and the works at the two baggage halls will not coincide. The design and all major procurement processes have been completed and works have commenced. • The Main Terminal South Wing Expansion project. Design studies and the tender procedure were successfully carried out in the third quarter of 2018 allowing the initiation of the construction works in the quarter that followed. The project is expected to be operationally completed towards the end of the first half of 2019, while the new commercial areas are anticipated to be fully completed in the first quarter of 2020. • The operational and commercial enhancement of the Satellite Terminal was completed in the second quarter of the year, thus increasing the capacity of the facility and expanding its commercial areas. • The upgrade of the Main Terminal’s public WC facilities was completed in the third quarter, and has significantly upgraded the level of service offered. • The Main Terminal’s new Non-Schengen bus-gates were constructed and delivered in operation in the third quarter, and greatly assisted in dealing with the increased passenger numbers. Protection of Personal Data The Airport Company has established a Personal Data Protection Management System, prior to the enforcement date of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25th 2018. The system comprises corporate policies, manual and procedures, with assigned accountabilities for management and employees. Appropriate technical and organizational controls have been implemented or enhanced, ensuring personal data availability, integrity and confidentiality. Risk assessments and impact analyses for major processing activities have been carried out, privacy notices to the public have been issued and data processing requirements have also been introduced in the Airport Company’s tendering processes and contracts. The Airport Company’s compliance status was ascertained through the performance of a Readiness Review Exercise in September-October 2018, by a team of external auditors. The conclusion of this exercise presented the compliance maturity, that is continuously supplemented by respective action plans. 9 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 3. Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability In 2018, the Airport Company took a major step forward with regards to Sustainability governance by merging its Annual and Corporate Responsibility Reports into a single document (the Annual & Sustainability Report), denoting in this way the embedding of sustainability into the core business. The Annual & Sustainability Report 2017 was the outcome of a fully revised corporate reporting process. Sustainability, as a balanced multi-faceted approach that takes account of the social, environmental and economic aspects of business with a long-term perspective, is embedded in the Airport Company’s strategy in an integrated manner across key characteristics of our business: Operational, Environmental, Corporate Citizenship, Employer’s Responsibility and Governance. The Airport Company applies a corporate Sustainability Policy which is regularly revised in order to reflect the emerging sustainability trends and global standards. The Airport Company engages in independent Sustainability Assurance for the verification of disclosures’ accuracy, completeness and abidance to applicable standards. The Sustainability Reporting abides by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and is in line with the company’s sustained commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, the acknowledgement of the United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and the Agenda 2030, contributing to the global sustainability effort. In 2018, AIA joined the ACI-Europe Task Force for the development of a Sustainability Strategy for European airports. The outcome of the task force is expected to be presented at the 29th Annual ACI Europe Congress at Limassol in June 2019. 3.1 Operational Responsibility Operational responsibility is the cornerstone of the Airport Company’s commitments. The Company ensures safe, secure, efficient and value-adding services for the benefit of a well-coordinated airport community and for delivering an exceptional experience to the travelling public. Aviation Safety is the top material issue for the Airport Company, as it is validated in the company’s annual Materiality Analysis. During 2018, nine aviation safety audits were conducted to third parties operating at the airport, in line with the provisions of EASA Aerodrome Rules for aviation safety practices. In relation to the health & safety of the travelling public, all public and technical areas are regularly inspected, in order to ensure that airport facilities personnel comply with legal provisions and the Airport Company’s corporate rules and procedures. In 2018, 21 health & safety audits were conducted towards third party members of the airport community. Operational readiness and availability performance of critical systems was maintained at exceptional levels. At the same time, the 2018 Passenger Survey results revealed a significantly high appreciation of AIA’s performance as evaluated by our passengers (4.26 on a 5-point scale). Furthermore, AIA’s dedication to passenger service excellence led to an exceptional accomplishment bringing AIA at the top position of European airports for the second consecutive year5. Passenger satisfaction is also at the focus of every employee of the Airport Company, as more than 1,100 “virtual passenger” walkthroughs were conducted in 2018 as part of the innovative “i-mind” programme, a number that corresponds to over 81,000 inspections. Committed to providing quality services, the company handled more than 3,500 comments received from nearly 2,000 passengers and responded in an average time of 8 days. Airport Company’s care for respect of human rights in operations was acknowledged in 2018. The joint initiative by the Hellenic Police and the Airport Company to create awareness on Human Trafficking, received the Corporate Affairs Excellence Award in the respective category for Stakeholder Collaboration. Finally, it is also worth noting that in 2018, 8.85% more passengers with disability and/or reduced mobility (PRM) made use of assistance services compared to 2017. 5 ACI ASQ Survey 2018: “Best Airport by Size and Region: 15-25 million passengers annually, Europe” with a satisfaction score of 4.13 on a 5-point scale 10 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM 3.2 Environmental Responsibility In 2018, the Airport Company held strong to its commitment to sustainably operate and develop the Airport with a focus on environmental protection. In accordance with industry best practices, a Climate Change Adaptation study for the airport was initiated and expected to be completed by the end of 2019. By heavily investing in energy-efficient technology over the past decade, AIA has managed to reduce its carbon footprint by almost 50%. The Airport Company’s environmental profile is further bolstered by the production of clean electricity by its 8.05 MWp Photovoltaic (PV) Park, avoiding the emissions of more than 12,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Application of the “Polluter Pays” principle to waste management at AIA continues to produce remarkable results. The Recycling Rate exceeded 80% for Solid Non-Hazardous Waste (32,608 tonnes of the total 39,221 tonnes). In addition, 368 tonnes of Hazardous Waste and 261 kg of Medical/Clinical Waste were collected and transferred to licensed facilities. Finally, airport employees recycled 6.1 tonnes of hazardous and non-hazardous waste at AIA’s dedicated Recycling Centre. The Airport Company replaced the analysers in its Air Quality Monitoring Network with newer equipment capable of measuring additional parameters. Furthermore, the recertification audit of AIA’s Environmental Management System (EMS) was successfully completed in accordance with the latest version (2015) of the ISO 14001 standard. The current certification is valid until 09/01/2022. 3.3 Employer’s Responsibility The people of the Airport Company are the most valuable resource and the key to the Company’s business success. At the end of 2018, the number of full-time equivalent staff employed at year-end was 740 employees, compared to 714 employees at the end of 2017. A significant number of employees are highly educated, while 31% of the Airport Company’s personnel reside in the local communities, reflecting our close relationship with the Mesogheia community. In October 2018, a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) was signed, as each year since 2000, between the Airport Company’s Management and the Employees’ Union under mutual consensus of the two parties, thus preserving constructive and peaceful labor relations. During 2018, the Airport Company put forward an integrated programme for the wellbeing of its employees. As part of the programme, a variety of initiatives were carried out throughout the year for the employees and their families, with the aim to support work and life balance and to further inspire corporate loyalty. Activities organised by the Airport Company’s Human Resources Department included family days with outdoor activities, guided tours to cultural venues, employee fitness programmes, etc. Employees’ participation to at least one activity of the above programme reached 43%. In order to facilitate internal communication, a new corporate Intranet site was launched in 2018, with a fresh look & feel, new applications and enhanced presentation of content. The Training & Development Plan for 2018 resulted in the delivery of a total of 28,665 training hours, equivalent to 38.71 training hours per full time employee (FTE) and with a learning coverage of 99.19% for employees attending at least one training session during the year. Training programmes aimed at the development of competence and skills, in line with compliance requirements, business challenges and industry trends while promoting employee professional advancement. Indicatively, 2,500 training hours were completed during the annual EASA Compliance Recurrent Training, while 6,633 training hours were completed on-line via e-learning courses. Also, in 2018 AIA further developed its systems to support training activities for our employees as well as for the Airport Community employees, through a unified Learning Management System (LMS). 3.4 Corporate Citizenship The Airport Company, in cooperation with Benaki Museum organised a number of thematic exhibitions & events, such as the exhibitions titled “When Pictures Paint a Thousand Words”, “Images of Athens” and “Greek Seas-A photographic journey in time”. For the fifth year in a row, the “Fly me to the Moon” cultural programme offered passengers and visitors a special cultural & entertainment experience at the airport by hosting, among others, the National Theatre of Greece and the National Opera. An important social initiative was the “Boarding Pass in Autism – Air Travel Flow simulation for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)”, run by the Onassis Foundation in collaboration with AIA, under the auspices of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the support of Aegean Airlines. In the period 2001-2018, more than 80 exhibitions and cultural activities hosted at the airport’s premises highlight its unique identity as a venue of constant cultural interaction and promotion of Greek Civilization to millions of passengers and visitors every year. Undoubtedly, AIA is a significant driver of economic development in the local region, a role which is complemented by targeted 11 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 investments in social, educational, cultural, athletic, environmental and other causes, over and above any legal obligations, all confirming the Airport Company’s identity as a good corporate neighbour. The Company’s relations with local communities remained strong in 2018 following the implementation of its annual Community Engagement Plan. Some of the more important initiatives undertaken in this respect in 2018, include financial rewards to local schools for their participation in AIA’s Recycling Programme as well as to top students from local high schools that were admitted to Greek Universities, the continuation of the awareness programme on AIA’s environmental protection measures in the Mesogaia area, and financial assistance provided to local cultural and athletic associations, communal supermarkets and families in need. Furthermore, the Airport Company continued to fund the programme for the conservation and promotion of the Vravrona Wetland in collaboration with the Hellenic Ornithological Society and provided financial support to the Archaeological Museum of Vravrona. Also, the Airport Company provided support to the Municipality of RafinaPikermi to help restore normal operations following the devastating fire of July 23rd. Finally, nine of the original ten airside Follow-Me vehicles were donated to the Hellenic Air Force in March, to cover needs at air force bases. 3.5 Socio-Economic Impact Following 5 years of traffic and business growth of our airport, during a period of macroeconomic stagnation, it was deemed necessary to reassess the overall economic and social value of AIA. Therefore, in 2018, the Airport Company assigned to the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) to undertake an Economic Impact Study for its performance. The objectives of this study were to identify and measure the impact from the operation of AIA to the Greek economy and to the Mesogheia region and its contribution to economic activity and employment, and to highlight the importance of AIA for the development of the Greek tourism industry. The methodology used, measured the total economic impact of AIA as the sum of three separate but interrelated categories: direct, indirect and induced impacts, as well as the broader effects from travel expenditure, etc. The results of the study clearly demonstrate that AIA is a major contributor to the socioeconomic output of the country in terms of economic value creation (annual added value at national level: €7.9 billion or 4.4% of the Greek GDP) and in terms of job creation (operation of the airport yields 181,000 jobs at national level). Also, the study showed that 3,700 people residing in the area of Mesogheia are employed at the airport, whereas (considering also the indirect and induced effects) the impact on employment in the Mesogheia area is estimated at about 11,600 jobs. 4. Financial Statements’ Highlights The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Accounting Policies approved by the Board of Directors of the Airport Company. Operating revenues of the Airport Company reached the amount of €478.7 million, higher by 10.4% (or €45.2 million) compared to the previous financial year, mainly attributed to the improved performance of traffic dependent revenue segments. In total, Airport Company’s participation in the Airport Development Fund (ADF) reached the amount of €88.7 million, higher by €8.9 million or 11.1% in comparison to the prior financial year, in line with traffic growth. Part of the ADF receipts covered interest expenses of €16.8 million (2017: €21.4 million), while the remaining €71.9 million (2017: €58.5 million) covered part of the instalments of the loan received for the construction of the Airport. In 2018, operating expenses increased by €4.2 million or 2.81% mainly due to additional cost requirements following continuing traffic growth, and the once-off advisory, legal and other expenses related to the concession extension. Overall earnings before interest, tax, depreciation & amortisation (EBITDA) in 2018 were increased by €41.0 million or 14.41% compared to the previous year and reached €325.5 million. Depreciation charge was €77.5 million in 2018, slightly higher by €0.9 million to the corresponding charge in 2017 12 Annex I: Reporting by the BoD to the AGM of €76.6 million, due to additional investments in capital expenditure within the year. Net financial expenses stood at €25.2 million presenting a decrease of €4.3 million or 14.6% versus 2017, mainly due to the gradual reduction of the outstanding balance of the Airport Company’s debt. Profit before Tax reached €239.7 million. After accounting for the aggregate charge for income tax of €68.6 million, the statutory and other reserves of €8.6 million and the prior year’s retained earnings of €218.4 million, there remains a distributable profit of €380.9 million. Given the short-term financial obligations for the Airport Company arising from the ADA Extension Agreement, no dividend distribution to the shareholders is proposed by the Board. The Statement of Financial Position of 31 December 2018 reflects total Assets of €1.36 billion. The value of the Airport Company’s Non-Current Assets (€0.59 billion) represents 43.6% of the Total Assets, indicating that the Airport Company still remains a capital-intensive company. The Airport Company continued to present a healthy financial performance, with consistently strong key performance indicators. More specifically, Net Turnover & ADF per passenger stands at €20.5 (2017: €20.9), while Operating Costs per Passengers remain at low levels, namely €6.3 per passenger (2017: €6.9 per passenger). Moreover, the Airport Company uses a method of measuring, AVA (Added Value on Assets), to calculate the value created from operating revenues and expenses, also taking into account assets and cost of capital, since airports are largely capital-intensive business entities. In 2018 increased value was generated, since AVA (Net Operating Profit After Tax minus Cost of Capital x Net Assets) was €150.7 million (2017: €119.6 million). All Fixed Assets are recorded in the Fixed Assets Register and are free of any encumbrances apart from the conditional assignment of the Usufruct extended since 1996 in favour of the Airport Company’s lender, European Investment Bank (EIB). Fixed Assets were depreciated at rates reflecting their estimated useful lives and the legal limits on their use as provided by the ADA. The value of the Usufruct of the Land that was assigned by the Greek State for the development and operation of the Airport, the present value of the fixed component Grant of Rights Fee and the value of the Intangible Assets are equally depreciated over the operation of the 25-year concession period. Investment in Associates consists of €3.25 million and represents the carrying amount of Airport Company’s participation in the equity of Athens airport Fuel Pipeline Company S.A. The Airport Company’s Closing Cash position for 2018 is €656.5 million. The Company is exposed to financial risks such as cash flow and fair value interest rate risk, price, credit and liquidity and to concentration risks. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in short-term deposits and highly liquid financial assets minimising its exposure to interest rates volatility. As regards the borrowings, these are either with fixed interest rates or, in the case of floating interest rates are hedged, eliminating any potential adverse impact on company’s financial performance from the fluctuation of interest rates. In particular, the weighted average fixed interest rate of EIB Loan is 6.12%, whereas the current outstanding balance amounts to € 217.4 million out of the initial withdrawn amount of € 997.0 million. The repayment of the EIB Loan is effected through semi-annually installments which started in June 2004 and will be completed in June 2021. In addition, the Company has entered into a Second Lien Bond Loan Agreement for an amount up to € 665.6 million with National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank for the partial financing of the Concession Extension Consideration. The Second Lien Bond Loan was disbursed once off, with 15-years tenor, semi-annual payment and will bear floating interest rate comprised of the six-month Euribor plus an applicable margin, currently at 3.10%. The Airport Company will enter into an interest rate hedging agreement for the full amount of the Bond Loan and for a period of two years to eliminate its exposure to interest rates volatility. In order to cover the credit risk, the Airport Company obtains adequate securities from customers, as per the applied Credit Policy. The liquidity risk is managed through efficient cash management involving cash forecasting and investments strategy that ensures the sufficient level of available cash to meet operational needs, to cover the debt service obligations and to finance investments, complying with the debt covenants in terms of creditability and maturity of investments. The nature of the risks, as well as the scope and the company policies for managing financial risks, are presented in Section 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Other risks and uncertainties related to tax disputes with the Greek State and disputes on municipal charges with two of the surrounding municipalities are analytically referred to in note 5.28 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Regarding events that occurred after the financial position date a reference is made in note 5.30 of the Financial Statements. 13 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 5. 2019 Outlook Following the effectiveness of the concession extension in February 2019, it can certainly be stated that the Airport Company has entered a new era. Firstly, instead of preparing for the closing of the concession period, the Airport Company has now the opportunity to plan anew for a long-term horizon. Indeed, the extended concession period will serve as the fertile ground for developmental strategies in most aspects of the airport business. Furthermore, the prolonged period is better aligned with the useful life of critical infrastructure components, enabling a more rational utilization. Finally, the acknowledged expertise of the Airport Company can also be capitalised by a more dynamic development of external business activities. At the same time, the years ahead are obviously not without challenges. In the short-term, the Airport Company, after having paid €1.13 billion (net of VAT) for the Concession Extension Consideration and having incurred for this purpose a new loan of €642 million, will enter a period with a need for an extra diligent cash flow monitoring and cost control. This situation will be intensified upon the expected incurrence of additional financing for the funding of the construction of airport expansion works. Indeed, after the achievement of the terminal capacity thresholds, the Airport Company is proceeding with the necessary planning activities for the required expansion, and -following the approvals foreseen in the ADAwill embark on major construction works for the expansion of the terminal and other necessary capacity enhancement investments. In 2019, the Airport Company will make in its accounting and reporting the adjustments that are necessary following the prolonged concession period and the financial impact of the concession extension transaction. Furthermore, the Airport Company plans to adjust its pricing policy in alignment with the extended concession period and will closely monitor in the mid-term the impact of the new and future investments vis-à-vis its regulatory allowance. The Airport Company aims to improve its competitive position, following any price adjustment in combination with airlines’ incentives, to remain a cost-efficient operator, to serve its debt obligations and to ensure long-term shareholder value and returns. Thus, after a very lengthy and extremely laborious process for the conclusion of the concession extension, we are looking forward to the years ahead of us. Years with opportunities for more developments and healthy growth, but also years with need for close cost monitoring, with challenging expansion works, within a more complex and demanding European regulatory environment especially in the aviation sector, and within an increasingly competitive environment. We have achieved to be a successful airport company in the past, and we are confident that in the years of excitement to come we will rise to the new challenges and continue to deliver quality and value for our shareholders, our employees, the Greek economy and the society at large.

Airport S.A. (“the Company” or “AIA”) is active in the financing, construction and operation of civil airports and related activities. As a civil airport operator, the Company manages the AIA at Spata, Greece. The Company is a Société Anonyme incorporated and domiciled in Greece. The address of its registered office is Spata, Attica 19019, with General Commercial Registry Number 2229601000. The Company was established on 31 July 1995 by the Greek State & Private Investors for the purpose of the finance, construction, operation and development of the new international airport at Spata Attica. In exchange for the finance, construction, operation and development of the airport the Greek State granted the Company a 30-year’s concession commencing on 11 June 1996. The Company commenced its commercial operations in March 2001 following a construction period of approximately 5 years initiated in September 1996. At the end of the concession arrangement (11 June 2026), subject to the stipulations of Article 33 of the Airport Development Agreement (“ADA”) and without prejudice to all rights and obligations then having accrued to the Greek State and/or the Company, the airport together with all usufruct additions will revert to the Greek State, which will enjoy all rights of ownership over these without payment of any kind and clear of any security, unless the concession arrangement is renewed as provided by the Article 4.2 of the ADA. Pursuant to the Article 4.2 of the ADA the Hellenic Republic Assets Development Fund (the HRADF) sent a letter to AIA on 7 December 2015 requesting the initiation of the negotiations in view of the possible extension of the concession period for another 20 years. Further to the communication and exchange of information among the competent parties foreseen by the Concession Extension Agreement that had been signed on 30 September, 2017 (extending the Airport Company’s concession period by 20 years, i.e. until 11 June 2046), the ADA Concession Extension Agreement was ratified by the Hellenic Parliament on 14 February 2019 and the effectiveness of the Concession Extension took place upon the relevant publication in the Government Gazette on 19 February 2019, i.e. law 4594/2019. The Concession Extension Agreement entailed payment of a Consideration amounting to €1,115,000,000 to HRADF, adjusted by adding an amount equal to 10.30% per annum, calculated pro rata on a daily basis, in case payment occurs after 31 December 2018. The Airport Company, based on the content of the Agreement and in order to pay the Consideration for the concession extension to HRADF, has entered into a Second Lien Bond Loan Agreement for an amount up to €665,600,000 with the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank as subscribers (for more details refer to notes 5.19 & 5.30). The Company’s return from air activities is capped at 15.0% on the capital allocated to air activities. In the event that the Company’s actual compounded cumulative return exceeds 15.0%, in 3 out of any 4 consecutive financial periods, the Company is obliged to pay any excess return to the Greek State, condition which never till 31 December 2018 took place. The terms and conditions of the concession for AIA are stipulated in the ADA. The ADA and the Company’s Articles of Association were ratified and enacted under Law 2338 dated 14 September 1995. The number of full-time equivalent staff employed at year-end was 740 employees, compared to 714 employees at the end of year 2017. The financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors on 26 March 2019 and are subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders. 2 Significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have consistently been applied to all the years presented. 9 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 2.1 Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC Interpretations and the Law 4308/2013 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company on a going concern basis. Management has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation of the accounts is appropriate. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of financial assets that are measured at fair value. 2.1.1 Going concern As a result of the funding activities undertaken and the increased focus on working capital, the Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company should be able to operate within the level of its current financing. Currently net interest expenses are covered by operating profits more than 9 times. After making enquiries, management has reasonable expectations that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements. 2.1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosures The accounting principles and calculations used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017 and have been consistently applied in all periods presented in this report except for the following IFRS’s which have been adopted by the Company as of 1 January 2018. The Company applied for the first time IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” and IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”, starting on 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” replaces IAS 39 “Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement” for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the classification and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting of financial assets. The Company adopted the new standard on 1 January 2018 without restating comparative information. There was no effect from the implementation of the new standard. Classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities IFRS 9 eliminates the previous categories of financial assets, as provided in IAS 39: held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale. The classification is based on the following two criteria: (a) whether the objective of the business model for the management of a financial asset is to hold it only to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and to sell and b) whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset consist exclusively of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (“SPPI” criterion). As far as the trade and other receivables are concerned, the Company implements a business model with the objective to hold financial assets and receive contractual cash flows. As a result, the Company measures these receivables at amortized cost at the initial application of IFRS 9. The new standard did not have an impact on the classification and measurement of the Company’s financial liabilities. 10 Annex II: Financial Statements Impairment The adoption of IFRS 9 led to changes in the accounting treatment of impairment losses on financial assets, as it replaced the recognition of realized losses, as per IAS 39, with the recognition of expected credit losses. Trade and other receivables are classified under the new model of expected credit losses. As far as trade receivables are concerned, the Company implemented the general approach of the standard and calculated the expected credit losses initially over 12 months and on significant deterioration of credit risk over lifetime of the receivables. The Company assessed the need for impairment allowance on these receivables, however, due to the fact that all users have covered them through letters of guarantee or cash deposits, the Company concluded that there are no expected credit losses and does not provide for these specific receivables separately in its financial statements. There is no impact from the adoption of IFRS 9. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 replaces IAS 11 “Construction Contracts”, IAS 18 “Revenue” and all the interpretations that are relevant to revenue from contracts with customers, unless such contracts fall within the scope of other standards. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. IFRS 15 provides a single, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers on the revenue determination and recognition. The standard is also applied for the recognition and measurement of gains and losses on sales of non-financial assets, which are not included in the normal course of business of the Company (e.g. sales of fixed or intangible assets). It requires entities to allocate transaction price from contracts to individual discrete promises, i.e. performance obligations, based on standalone selling prices, according to the five-step model. Revenue is then recognized when the entity satisfies the performance obligations, i.e. when it transfers the promised goods or services, as defined in the contract with the customer. With respect to the initial application of the standard, the Company opted for applying it retrospectively only on contracts that are not completed as at the date of first application (1 January 2018), with the cumulative effect of the initial application being recognized on the date of the initial application. Therefore, any cumulative effect of the initial application of the new standard would be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of the retained earnings (or any other equity component, if applicable) on 1 January 2018 (hence no restatement of comparative information is needed). Management assessed the impact of the application of the standard on the Company’s financial statements, operating results and financial position. On the basis of this assessment, the Company concluded that the new revenue standard had no effect since there were no significant differences compared to its current accounting policy on revenue recognition, thus no adjustment was made to its retained earnings. Although the new standard does not introduce material differences in the Company’s current accounting policies, the respective accounting policy has been formed as set out in note 2.17 of the financial statements. IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Clarifications) The objective of the Clarifications is to clarify the IASB’s intentions when developing the requirements in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, particularly the accounting of identifying performance obligations amending the wording of the “separately identifiable” principle, of principal versus agent considerations including the assessment of whether an entity is a principal or an agent as well as applications of control principle and of licensing providing additional guidance for accounting of intellectual property and royalties. The Clarifications also provide additional practical expedients for entities that either apply IFRS 15 fully retrospectively or that elect to apply the modified retrospective approach. 11 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IFRIC Interpretation 22: Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration The Interpretation clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency. The Interpretation covers foreign currency transactions when an entity recognizes a non-monetary asset or a non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before the entity recognizes the related asset, expense or income. The Interpretation states that the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate, is the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary prepayment asset or deferred income liability. If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, then the entity must determine a date of the transactions for each payment or receipt of advance consideration. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the interpretation and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. 2.1.3 Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted IFRS 16: Leases The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract, i.e. the customer (‘lessee’) and the supplier (‘lessor’). The new standard requires lessees to recognize most leases on their financial statements. Lessees will have a single accounting model for all leases, with certain exemptions. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Company’s operating leases as a lessee. As at the reporting date, the Company has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of €567,346 (refer to note 5.27). Management has made an assessment and considers that there will be no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. Amendment in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture The amendments address an acknowledged inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and those in IAS 28, in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. The main consequence of the amendments is that a full gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves a business (whether it is housed in a subsidiary or not). A partial gain or loss is recognized when a transaction involves assets that do not constitute a business, even if these assets are housed in a subsidiary. In December 2015 the IASB postponed the effective date of this amendment indefinitely pending the outcome of its research project on the equity method of accounting. The amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. IFRS 9: Prepayment features with negative compensation (Amendment) The Amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Amendment allows financial assets with prepayment features that permit or require a party to a contract either to pay or receive reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract (so that, from the perspective of the holder of the asset there may be ‘negative compensation’), to be measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the amendment and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. 12 Annex II: Financial Statements IAS 28: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments relate to whether the measurement, in particular impairment requirements, of long-term interests in associates and joint ventures that, in substance, form part of the ‘net investment’ in the associate or joint venture should be governed by IFRS 9, IAS 28 or a combination of both. The Amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, before it applies IAS 28, to such long-term interests for which the equity method is not applied. In applying IFRS 9, the entity does not take account of any adjustments to the carrying amount of longterm interests that arise from applying IAS 28. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there will not be significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IFRIC Interpretation 23: Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments The Interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12. The Interpretation provides guidance on considering uncertain tax treatments separately or together, examination by tax authorities, the appropriate method to reflect uncertainty and accounting for changes in facts and circumstances. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments require entities to use updated actuarial assumptions to determine current service cost and net interest for the remainder of the annual reporting period after a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement has occurred. The Amendments also clarify how the accounting for a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement affects applying the asset ceiling requirements. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IFRS 3: Business Combinations (Amendments) The IASB issued amendments in Definition of a Business (Amendments to IFRS 3) aimed at resolving the difficulties that arise when an entity determines whether it has acquired a business or a group of assets. The Amendments are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is in the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period, with earlier application permitted. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of ‘material’ (Amendments) The Amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 with earlier application permitted. The Amendments clarify the definition of material and how it should be applied. The new definition states that, ’Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a 13 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 specific reporting entity’. In addition, the explanations accompanying the definition have been improved. The Amendments also ensure that the definition of material is consistent across all IFRS Standards. These Amendments have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management has made an assessment of the effect of the standard and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. The IASB has issued the Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015 – 2017 Cycle, which is a collection of amendments to IFRSs. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 with earlier application permitted. These annual improvements have not yet been endorsed by the EU. Management has made an assessment of the effect of these amendments and considers that there is no significant impact on the Company’s financial statements. IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not remeasure previously held interests in that business. IAS 12 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify that the income tax consequences of payments on financial instruments classified as equity should be recognized according to where the past transactions or events that generated distributable profits has been recognized. IAS 23 Borrowing Costs: The amendments clarify paragraph 14 of the standard that, when a qualifying asset is ready for its intended use or sale, and some of the specific borrowing related to that qualifying asset remains outstanding at that point, that borrowing is to be included in the funds that an entity borrows generally. 2.2 Foreign currency translation 2.2.1 Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (‘the functional currency’). The Company’s financial statements are presented in Euro (€), which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. Any slight discrepancies are due to rounding’s of the relevant amounts. 2.2.2 Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. 2.3 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise movable assets, such as vehicles and furniture & fixtures which do not form part of the service concession intangible asset. 14 Annex II: Financial Statements The items included under the heading “Property, plant & equipment” in the accompanying statement of financial position are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the various categories of property, plant and equipment to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Mechanical Equipment shorter of 10 years and remaining concession period Vehicles shorter of 6-10 years and remaining concession period Fixtures & Equipment shorter of 10 years and remaining concession period Hardware shorter of 5 years and remaining concession period Land, buildings, installations, fencing, aircraft ground power system, runways, taxiways, aircraft bridges and aprons held under the Service Concession Arrangement constitutes the total infrastructure that has been recognised as an intangible asset (refer to accounting policy 2.4). The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial position date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other (losses)/gains – net, in the income statement. 2.4 Intangible assets 2.4.1 Service concession arrangement The Service Concession Arrangement refers to the ADA which governs the right that has been granted by the Greek State to the Company for the purpose of the finance, construction, operation and development of the AIA. The above right has a finite useful life of approximately 25 years which is equal to the duration of the concession arrangement following the completion of the construction phase. The Service Concession Arrangement has been accounted under the intangible asset model since the Company, as operator, is paid by the users and the concession grantor has not provided any contractual guarantees with respect to the recoverability of the investment. The intangible asset corresponds to the right granted by the concession grantor to the Company to charge users of the airport services. The Service Concession Arrangement consists of the fair value of acquiring the service concession which principally includes the cost of the usufruct and the costs incurred to construct the infrastructure (net of government grants received), as well as the present value of the fixed determined future obligations for the grant of rights fee payable to the Greek State as set out in the ADA. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of the right over the duration of the Service Concession Arrangement which is approximately 25 years. Any subsequent costs incurred in maintaining the serviceability of the infrastructure is expensed as incurred unless such cost relate to major upgrades or to the extension of the concession period which increase the income generating ability of the infrastructure. These costs are capitalised as part of the service concession intangible asset and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the Service Concession Arrangement. 2.4.2 Grant of rights fee, variable fee component As set out in the ADA and in respect to the period after the twentieth anniversary of the Agreement Commencement Date and until the end of the Concession Period, the Company shall pay to the Greek 15 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 State per quarter the higher of: (a) a fixed amount of €3,750,000 and (b) 25.0% of 15.0% of the Consolidated Operating Profits for the Financial Year of the Company ending immediately prior to such Quarter. Consolidated Operating Profit is specifically defined in the ADA as: (a) the operating profit of the Company and its Subsidiaries (before interest, extraordinary and exceptional items, taxation calculated on profits or distributions and similar charges), all as determined on a consolidated basis and excluding amounts attributable to minority interests in Subsidiaries, in respect of a Financial Year as shown by the Audited Accounts in respect of that Financial Year, (b) less interest paid during that Financial Year (other than any interest paid on or as a result of a prepayment or acceleration of all or part of the relevant indebtedness) in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money incurred in respect of the provision, acquisition, construction, maintenance, repair, renewal and operation of the assets allocated to Air Activities. The accounting for the Service Concession Arrangement continues as determined in 2.4.1, with the exception that the variable element of the Grant of Rights Fee which is expensed to the income statement in the period in which it relates. 2.4.3 Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are depreciated over their estimated useful lives (5 years). Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Company, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Costs include the employee costs incurred as a result of developing software and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Computer software development costs that recognised as assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives (5 years). 2.5 Impairment of non-financial assets Assets, such as the service concession intangible asset, that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants less costs to sell and value in use the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit. If the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the difference is recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced by the same amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 2.6 Financial assets 2.6.1. Initial recognition and measurement Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), and fair value through profit or loss. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Company’s business model for managing them. With the exception of 16 Annex II: Financial Statements trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient, the Company initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Company has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price determined under IFRS 15. Refer to the accounting policies in note 2.17 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are ‘solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)’ on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. The Company’s business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. 2.6.2. Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in three categories: • Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) • Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments) • Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading, financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Derivatives are also categorised as ‘held for trading’ unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the end of the reporting period, otherwise they are classified as non-current. Financial assets with cash flows that are not solely payments of principal and interest are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model. The Company elected to classify its listed equity investments under this category. Financial assets at amortised cost The Company measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: a) the financial asset is held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and b) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. 17 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Financial assets at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments) Upon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Gains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment. 2.6.3. Derecognition and impairment Derecognition A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position) when: The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a passthrough arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained. Impairment As far as trade receivables are concerned, the Company implemented the general approach of the standard. The Company assessed the need for impairment allowance on these receivables, however, due to the fact that all users have covered them through letters of guarantee or cash deposits, the Company concluded that there are no expected credit losses and does not provide for these specific receivables separately in its financial statements. 2.6.4. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. 2.7 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course 18 Annex II: Financial Statements of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Spare parts consumed within a year are carried as inventory and recognized in profit or loss when consumed. 2.8 Trade receivables Trade receivables are unconditional amounts due – only the passage of time is required before payment from customers for aeronautical and other services performed in the ordinary course of business (refer to note 2.6). If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as noncurrent assets. The Company has established a provision policy based on which all trade receivables are assessed on a case by case basis. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement and is included in “Net provisions and impairment losses”. 2.9 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 2.10 Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs associated directly with the issue of new ordinary shares are shown in equity as a reduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 2.11 Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 2.12 Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the financial position date. 2.13 Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and the Company will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to borrowing and other related costs are recognised in the income statement to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate (refer to note 5.4). Government grants relating to non-current assets are off-set against the cost of the relevant non-current asset. The grant is recognised as income over the life of the respective depreciable non-current asset by way of a reduction in the depreciation/amortisation charge (refer to notes 5.7, 5.8). 19 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 2.14 Current and deferred income tax The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of Greek tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the financial position date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Company’s financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit and loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the financial position date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. 2.15 Employee benefits 2.15.1 Pension obligations The Company has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that typically defines an amount of pension benefits that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. Defined benefit pension plan The Company’s obligations to pay employee retirement benefits under Law 2112/1920 are considered and accounted for as defined benefit plans. The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the financial position date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 20 Annex II: Financial Statements Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Defined contribution plan For defined contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. 2.15.2 Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Company recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the financial position date are discounted to present value. 2.15.3 Bonus plans The Company recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses based on achievement of predefined financial and operational targets. The Company recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation. 2.16 Provisions Provisions are recognised when: The Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions include the obligations under the Service Concession Arrangement to maintain, keep in good operative condition, renew and replace to the extent reasonably necessary the serviceability of major infrastructure components, such as roads, runways, taxiways, aprons, air field lighting and baggage handling equipment etc. which require major overhauls at regular intervals during the concession period. These contractual obligations for maintaining or restoring the infrastructure are recognized and measured based on experts’ studies on large scale asset management projects using the best possible estimate of the costs that would be required to meet the present obligation at the financial position date (in accordance with IAS 37), since the maintenance and restoration obligation arises as a result of the usage during the operating period. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. For the restoration provision of the Company see note 5.21. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense. 2.17 Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the services is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those services. Control over 21 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 services rendered is transferred to the customer upon delivery of the respective service respectively. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and the revenue can be reliably measured. Payment terms vary in line with the type of sales transactions and depend mainly on the products sold or services rendered, the distribution channels as well as each customer’s specifics. The Company assesses whether it acts as a principal or agent in each of its revenue arrangements. The Company has concluded that in all sales transactions it acts as a principal. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts. For sales of services, revenue is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, as the customer obtains control over the promised services, by reference to stage of completion of each specific performance obligation and assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided. If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company recognizes this amount as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in the future. The Company provides different developmental and targeted incentives offered to airlines, both for developing new markets, as well as for reinforcing existing ones. These incentives are assessed by the Company to determine whether they constitute a material right that the customer would not receive without entering into that contract. Under the new requirements, the Company concluded that incentives constitute a variable cost, which is accrued within the financial year. 2.17.1. Sales of services Revenue from the sale of services is derived from “air activities” and “non-air activities”. “Air Activities” mean the provision of facilities, services and equipment for the purpose of landing, parking and servicing of aircrafts; the handling of passengers, baggage, cargo or mail on airport premises; and the transfer of passengers, baggage, cargo or mail to and from aircrafts and trains. “Non-Air Activities” mean the provision, operation, maintenance, repair, renewal staffing and supervision of the following services, facilities and equipment: car parking, general retail shops, restaurants, bars and other refreshment facilities, vehicle rental, porter service, hotels etc. Aeronautical & Centralized Infrastructure charges The use of facilities and installations at the Airport by Airlines/Aircrafts against payment, is stipulated in the guidelines for our customers manual “Terms and Condition of use and schedule of traffic charges” as published in the Company’s official site. Revenues from the use of such facilities and installations related to aeronautical & centralized infrastructure charges are recognised in the income statement when the services are rendered. The criteria for the recognition of income related to aeronautical & centralized infrastructure charges is the aircraft’s take off due to the very sort cycle of aircraft turnarounds. Each arrival of an aircraft and its subsequent departure is considered as a cycle of movement/flight where all necessary services have been rendered. Article 14 of ADA sets the rules for defining the charges levied to the users of the airport with respect of the facilities and services provided at the airport. According to the aforementioned article, the Company is entitled to determine at its discretion the level of airport charges in order to achieve a maximum return of 15.0% per annum on the capital allocated to air activities. Retail concession agreements The Company’s business area has at the financial position date, a total of 68 retail concession contracts, concerning the performance of various commercial activities at the airport. A retail concession involves granting of rights to a concession holder to operate and manage a commercial activity in a specific location designated by the Company. The concession rights are 22 Annex II: Financial Statements calculated according to an agreed scale as a percentage of the sales generated by the concession holder subject to an annual minimum guaranteed fee. A separate part of the concession contract is entered into for the space required for warehouses, for which a fixed rent is payable. Revenue from Concession agreements is accounted for as income for the financial year in which it was generated, while the settlement of the annual concession fees is finally recognised by the Company in the income statement, at year-end. 2.17.2 Parking fees Revenues related to parking services to vehicles used by passengers and visitors to reach the airport are recognized in the income statement when the service is concluded. The criterion for the recognition of revenue related to parking charges is the vehicle’s departure. Each arrival of a vehicle and its subsequent departure is considered as a cycle of movement where all services have been rendered. 2.17.3 Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest rate method. When a receivable is impaired, the Company reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument and continues unwinding the discount as interest income. Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognised using the original effective interest rate. 2.17.4 Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. 2.18 Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. 2.19 Leases The Company as a lesee The determination of whether an agreement contains a lease is based on the substance of the agreement at the inception of the lease. An agreement contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, even if that asset is not explicitly specified, for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. Leases under which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made by the Company under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The Company does not lease any material property, plant or equipment under finance leases under which it substantially retains all the risks and rewards of ownership. The Company as a lessor The Company’s property area has at the financial position date, a total of 108 lease contracts, concerning the lease of buildings, offices, storages, lounges and lockers at the airport. 23 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 The Company rents properties held under the concession and located within the airport premises under operating leases. Revenue from such leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with IAS 17 (Leases). 2.20 Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders. 2.21 Fair value estimation and hierarchy Company uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: • Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. • Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. The carrying value of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values at the financial position date. The fair value of financial assets that are debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income or equity investments measured at fair value through profit and loss account is assessed using quoted prices in active market (Level 1). The fair value of loans is estimated by the method of discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate swaps for the average duration of the loan which corresponds to the average duration of the relevant debt obligation (Level 2). During the year there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 and no transfers into and out of Level 3 for the measurement of fair value. 2.22 Associates Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20.0% and 50.0% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recognised at cost and subsequently at cost less any impairment losses. Dividend income is recognised when the right to such income is established. The Company’s investment in its associate amounts to €3.25 million as of 31 December 2018 represents less than 1.0% of total assets at that date. This investment has not been accounted for under the equity method of accounting on the basis that it is not considered to be material to the Company’s operations and any share of the profit or loss or share of other comprehensive income of this associate is unlikely to influence the economic decision of the users of these financial statements. 3 Financial risk management 3.1 Financial risk factors The Company is exposed to financial risk, such as market risk (fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The general risk management program of the Company focuses on the unpredictability of the financial markets and attempts to minimize their potential negative influence on the financial performance of the Company. The financial risk management of the Company is performed internally by a qualified unit, which operates under specific rules that have been approved by the Board of Directors. The ongoing developments relating to the macroeconomic and financial environment in Greece have not significantly affected the operations and financial performance of the Company. 24 Annex II: Financial Statements Historically, the Company has demonstrated increased resilience in the years of macroeconomic instability, combining financial performance with operational excellence and quality of services and therefore, Management does not expect that the operations and financial position of the Company will be significantly affected in the foreseeable future. Despite all adversities, past and future, Management has and will continue to assess the situation and its possible impact, adjusting its operating strategy whenever necessary, in order to deliver financial and non-financial value to shareholders and other stakeholder parties. 3.1.1 Exchange rate risk Exchange rate risk occurs if future business transactions, recognized assets and liabilities and net investments in activities outside the euro zone are expressed in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company (Euro). The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange risk is very limited since its business is substantially transacted in its functional currency. 3.1.2 Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The cash flow interest rate risk is the risk of fluctuations in the future cash flows of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in the market interest rate. The Company has interest-bearing assets in the form of cash and cash equivalent (short term time deposits and other highly liquid investments), thus profits and cash flows from investment activities are dependent on market interest rates. During 2018 the Company’s cash and cash equivalent were not invested in any short term time deposits or any other liquid investments. The impact from possible future interest rates on the Company’s financial performance, regarding cash and cash equivalents and the reserve account (Attica Sub-Account), which is considered as restricted cash is presented below: 2018 2017 Interest rates fluctuation +1.0% 0.0% +1.0% 0.0% Impact on interest receipts 6,739,542 0 4,812,690 0 The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk arising from its long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable interest rates expose the Company to cash flow interest rate risk while borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Company to fair value interest rate risk. The Company’s borrowings (European Investment Bank loan) are borrowings with fixed interest rates. Hence the financial performance cannot be affected by fluctuations in interest rates with respect to such loans. The fair value interest rate risk of such loans is presented in note 5.19. The fair value interest rate risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in the market interest rate. The Company is exposed to fair value interest rate risk as a result of discounting liabilities and receivables of long-term settlement. Such liabilities and receivables are discounted using the prevailing pre-tax risk-free rate which is affected by interest rates fluctuations. The impact from possible future interest rates on the Company’s financial performance from liabilities of long term settlement is presented below: 2018 2017 Interest rates fluctuation +1.0% -1.0% +1.0% -1.0% Grant of rights fee payable 349,410 (322,147) 400,814 (386,575) Interest rates fluctuation +1.0% -0.24% +1.0% -0.43% Provision for major restoration expenses (73,560) 18,004 (11,338) 7,066 Total impact on interest expenses 275,850 (304,143) 389,476 (379,509) 25 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 3.1.3 Price risk Price risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of assets and liabilities as a result of changes in market prices. The Company’s exposure to equity securities price risk is limited to the investment in an unlisted entity which represents less than 1.0% of total asset. The Company is not exposed to commodity price risk. 3.1.4 Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents held with banks and credit exposures from customers. Cash and cash equivalents – Financial assets For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with minimum ratings described below, as set out under the Master Facility Agreement between the Company and the EIB, are acceptable. The Company could cooperate with banks or financial institutions or proceed with the purchase of financial assets that satisfy the following criteria: • Long term unsecured and unguaranteed debt should be rated at: • A3 or higher by Moody’s; or • Aor higher by S&P; or • Aor higher by Fitch • The maturity date of an investment should not exceed the period of 2 years from the investment date • Operates a branch in Greece or such other places as may be agreed between the Company and EIB; and • Is acceptable by EIB All cooperation banks are acceptable by EIB. The analysis of financial assets and bank deposits’ balances based on credit ratings is presented in the following table: 2018 2017 AAA to ACCC to RD AAA to ACCC to RD Equity investments financial assets 0 259,718 0 1,188,000 Restricted cash financial assets 9,900,000 0 9,900,000 0 Bank deposits' balances 654,524,812 297,185 464,375,931 400,361 Total 664,424,812 556,903 474,275,931 1,588,361 The above criteria are satisfied with respect to the financial assets classified at amortized cost including the bank deposits’ balances. As regards to the investment in the financial asset classified at fair value through profit and loss, for which the above criteria are not satisfied, the Company obtained the consent and waiver of EIB on 1 December 2016. Further information is presented in notes 5.9 and 5.19. Trade receivables Regarding credit exposure from customers, the Company has an established credit policy and procedures in place aiming to minimise collection losses. Credit control assesses the credit quality of the customers, taking into account independent credit ratings where available, their financial position, past experience in payments and other relevant factors. Cash and other collateral are obtained from customers when considered necessary under the circumstances. Trade and other receivables are analysed as follows in terms of credit risk: 26 Annex II: Financial Statements Trade and other receivables subject to impairment testing 2018 2017 Fully performed 14,754,833 14,601,047 Past due but not impaired 23,952,565 30,517,654 Impaired 2,938,517 2,460,490 Total trade and other receivables subject to impairment testing 41,645,915 47,579,191 Any past due account that is fully covered by guarantees or collaterals given is not tested for impairment. The aging analysis of the past due, but not impaired amount is presented in the following table: Aging analysis of past due but not impaired receivables 2018 2017 1-30 days 15,454,365 17,912,448 31-60 days 2,161,141 4,916,781 Over 60 days 6,337,059 7,688,425 Total of past due but not impaired receivables 23,952,565 30,517,654 Credit quality of financial assets The credit quality of the financial assets is quite satisfactory, taking into account the allowance for doubtful debt. The Company has established a credit policy which requires the customers to extend securities for the use of airport’s services and facilities. The securities held by the Company are in the form of cash deposits and bank letters of guarantee. The fair value of the collaterals held by the Company as at 31 December 2018 is analysed as follows: Fair value of collaterals held 2018 2017 Letter of guarantees 64,431,549 63,555,986 Cash deposits 29,098,570 27,559,497 Total fair value of collaterals held 93,530,119 91,115,483 The collaterals above have been received against the outstanding balance of all trade receivable accounts. The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to information about counterparty secured amounts: 2018 2017 Group 1 – Fully secured 8,383,695 8,942,809 Group 2 – Partially secured 5,605,714 5,330,592 Group 3 – Not secured 765,424 327,647 Total 14,754,834 14,601,047 Provision for impairment As of 31 December 2018, trade receivables of €26,891,082 (2017: €32,978,144) were partially or fully tested for impairment and adequately provided for their unsecured amount. The amount of provision stood at €2,414,045 as of 31 December 2018. The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers, who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations. It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered. Movements on the provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows: 2018 2017 At 1 January 2,416,675 2,513,479 Addition (release) of provision for receivables impairment -2,630 (96,804) At 31 December 2,414,045 2,416,675 27 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in “Net provisions and impairment loses” in the income statement. The other classes within trade receivables do not contain impaired assets. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the value of total provision for impairment of trade receivables. 3.1.5 Concentration of credit risk The Company is exposed to concentration risk attributed to the concentration of the trade receivables and cash balances and financial assets. The Company has a high concentration of credit risk with respect to 2 carriers (2017: 2 carriers) which represents higher than 10.0% of its aeronautical revenues. For bank balances and deposits, there is a significant concentration of credit risk with respect to 2 banks (2017: 2 banks), which hold more than 10.0% of the Company’s cash balances and deposits. However, no financial loss is expected based on what has been referred above in note 3.1.4 for cash balances and financial assets. 3.1.6 Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the entity will have difficulty in raising the financial resources required to fulfil its commitments. Liquidity risk is held at low levels through effective cash flow management and availability of adequate cash. Cash flow forecasting is performed internally by rolling forecasts of the Company’s liquidity requirements to ensure that is has sufficient cash to meet operational needs, to fund scheduled investments and debt and to comply with loan covenants. As at 31 December 2018 no cash and cash equivalents were subject to capital controls through effective cash management. The table below analyses the financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the financial position to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Undiscounted cash flows in respect of balances due within 12 months generally equal their carrying amounts in the financial position, as the impact of discounting is not significant. 28 Annex II: Financial Statements Between Between At 31 December 2018 Less than 1 year Over 5 years 1 & 2 yezars 2 & 5 years Borrowings 95,148,992 95,119,007 47,544,603 0 Grant of rights fee payable 15,000,000 15,000,000 45,000,000 36,833,333 Trade and other payables 64,347,323 0 0 0 Total 174,496,315 110,119,007 92,544,603 36,833,333 Between Between At 31 December 2017 Less than 1 year Over 5 years 1 & 2 years 2 & 5 years Borrowings 95,128,776 95,148,992 142,663,610 0 Grant of rights fee payable 15,000,000 15,000,000 45,000,000 51,833,333 Trade and other payables 55,631,818 0 0 0 Total 165,760,594 110,148,992 187,663,610 51,833,333 Grant of Rights Fee payable relates to the fixed determined future obligations (refer to note 2.4.1). 3.2 Capital risk management The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, use excess cash to repay its borrowings (subject to the termination provisions of the respective loan agreements) or sell assets not pledged as security, to reduce debt. Consistent with others in the industry, the Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including “Current and non-current borrowings” as shown in the statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets. Total capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the statement of financial position plus net debt. Gearing ratio 2018 2017 Total borrowings 217,431,038 295,632,204 Less: Cash & cash equivalent and current financial assets (217,431,038) (295,632,204) Net debt 0 0 Total capital – (equity plus net debt) 759,163,627 587,474,670 Gearing ratio n/a n/a Part of cash & cash equivalent covers the outstanding balance of borrowings. 4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The accounting estimates 29 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next year are disclosed below. 4.1.1 Taxes The internal control procedures for the related tax risks are part of Company’s control system. The general tax risk for the Company concerns the timely submission of complete tax returns, the payment of the tax amounts concerned as well as compliance with all tax laws and regulations and reporting rules specifically relating to corporate income tax. The Company is subject to income tax, VAT and other taxes in Greece. Significant judgment is sometimes required in determining the Company’s tax position for such taxes in certain instances due to the particular tax regime, under the ADA, applicable to the Company’s operations, which is subject to challenge by the tax authorities on the grounds of ambiguity or different interpretation with tax laws. The Company recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will arise or tax losses reduced. Where that final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current tax, deferred tax and other tax assets and liabilities in the period during which such determination is made. 4.1.2 Provision for restoration cost Provision for restoration cost includes future expenses for the major overhauls of roads, runways, taxiways and replacement of airfield lighting and baggage handling equipment. Significant estimates are required to determine the level of provision such as the timing of the expenditure, the extension of the works and the amount that it will be expensed in the future. The nominal value of the provision for restoration cost is annually determined by a qualified department within the Company based on international experience and the specific conditions relating to the operations of the airport. The amount of the provision is discounted at the financial position date by using the risk-free rate for similar time duration. 4.1.3 Provisions for legal claims The Company has a number of legal claims pending against it (refer to note 5.28). Management uses its judgement as well as the available information from the Company’s legal department and legal experts, in order to assess the likely outcome of these claims and if it is more likely than not that the Company will lose a claim, then a provision is recognized. Provisions for legal claims, if required, are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. 4.1.4 Retirement Benefit Obligations The present value of the pension obligations for the Company’s defined benefit plans depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost / (income) for pensions include the discount rate and salary rate increases. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency and jurisdiction in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability. 30 Annex II: Financial Statements 4.1.5 Impairment of non-financial assets and investments in associates and joint ventures The Company assesses at each reporting date, whether indicators for impairment exist for its non-financial assets (refer to note 5.10) and its investment in associate. If any indication exists, the Company estimates the asset’s or cash generating unit’s recoverable amount. Judgment is involved to some extent in determining whether indicators exist and also the determination of the cash generating units at which the respective assets are tested. 31 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 5 Notes to the financial statements 5.1 Revenues Analysis of revenues from contracts with customers 2018 2017 Air activities Aeronautical charges 230,229,963 211,073,759 Centralized infrastructure & handling related revenues 52,955,664 47,803,331 IT&T and other Services 12,774,219 11,056,114 Total air activity revenues from contracts 295,959,846 269,933,204 Non-air activities Retail concession activities 59,767,485 53,723,404 Parking services 13,836,052 13,324,944 IT&T and other Services 17,519,427 15,832,666 Total non-air activity revenues from contracts 91,122,964 82,881,014 Total revenues from contracts with customers 387,082,810 352,814,218 Other revenues Rentals & other revenues from air activities 90,539,170 77,594,965 Rentals & other revenues from non-air activities 1,092,997 3,116,595 Total other revenues 91,632,167 80,711,560 Total revenues 478,714,977 433,525,778 Operating revenues were measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account the amount of any trade discounts or tax-volume rebates (refer to note 2.17). The fair value of the consideration received, or receivable is equal to the invoiced amount, since the Company doesn’t provide any deferred credit terms to its customers, in the form of interest-free instalments or at below market interest rates. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity and the revenue can be reliably measured. As at the financial position date, the Company has contracted with tenants for the following minimum noncancellable operating lease payments from customers: Analysis of minimum lease payments from customers 2018 2017 Within one year 17,071,501 16,131,252 Between one and five years 54,025,822 57,575,177 More than five years 19,828,325 29,598,107 Total minimum lease payments from customers 90,925,648 103,304,535 Concession fees earned for the year ended 31 December 2018 include turnover linked fees in excess of base concession fees amounting to €12,164,281 (2017: €6,643,758). 32 Annex II: Financial Statements 5.2 Depreciation & amortisation charges Analysis of depreciation & amortisation charges 2018 2017 Depreciation of owned assets 4,367,224 4,284,413 Amortisation of intangible assets 88,182,501 87,352,070 Amortisation of cohesion fund related to intangible assets (15,076,777) (15,076,777) Total depreciation & amortisation expenses 77,472,948 76,559,706 5.3 Net financial expenses Analysis of net financial expenses 2018 2017 Financial expenses Interest expenses and related costs on bank loans 16,672,174 21,256,921 Unwinding of discount for long term liabilities 5,017,162 5,488,831 Other financial expenses 3,505,487 2,849,253 Financial expenses 25,194,823 29,595,004 Financial revenues Interest income (14,987) (116,439) Financial revenues (14,987) (116,439) Net financial expenses 25,179,836 29,478,565 Interest and related expenses amounting to €20,301,702 (2017: €24,261,939) were paid during the year ended 31 December 2018. The Company did not proceed to any investments on its cash surplus (investments in cash deposits and financial assets) within 2018, therefore there is no weighted average interest rate earned in 2018 (2017: 0.0%). Interest income amounting to €2,905 (2017: €122,480) was received during the year ended 31 December 2018. 5.4 Subsidies received Airport Development Fund (ADF) In accordance with Law 2065/1992, as amended with Law 2892/2001, the Greek State imposed a levy on passengers older than 5 years old departing from Greek Airports, amounting to €12 for EU passengers and €22 for non-EU passengers, for the purpose of ensuring that passengers share the responsibility for funding the commercial aviation infrastructure within the Hellenic Republic. As of 11 April 2017, onwards, in accordance with Law 4465/2017, and until 1 November 2024 the levy for both EU and non-EU passengers has been set at €12 per departing passenger over 2 years old, while as of 1 November 2024 the levy will be further decreased to €3. A passenger fee is collected by the airlines and consequently refunded to the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority on a monthly or cash basis, through bank accounts opened at the Bank of Greece for each airport, in favour of the Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority. For the year ended 31 December 2018 the Company was entitled to subsidies under the ADF amounting to €88,749,927 (2017: €79,860,546) as analysed below: 33 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Analysis of subsidies receivable 2018 2017 Receivables meeting interest and related expenses 16,825,778 21,359,734 Excess over borrowing cost 71,924,149 58,500,812 Total subsidies receivable 88,749,927 79,860,546 Any subsidies receivable in excess of qualifying interest and related expenses for the year are shown as other revenues in line with the accounting policy 2.13. 5.5 Income tax expense The corporate income tax rate of legal entities in Greece is 29% for 2018 (2017: 29%). According to article 23 of the Law 4579, released in December 2018, the corporate income tax rate in Greece, currently 29%, is expected to be reduced by 1% each subsequent year as follows: 28% for 2019, 27% for 2020, 26% for 2021 and 25% for 2022 onwards. As at 31 December 2018, the effect of the changes in future income tax rates in other comprehensive income of the Company, is a tax relief of €357,679. Income tax is calculated on taxable income or, in circumstance where the Company has tax losses carried forward, on gross dividends declared for distribution. For further information refer to note 5.22. The Company has paid a special once off tax surcharge in accordance with Law 3808/2009, which, in the opinion of the Company, was higher by €9,099,138 than the amount that it should have paid in accordance with the provisions of the law and the tax privileges, which have been granted by the ADA. Management proceeded with the legal actions to remedy the higher income tax bill referring the issue to the Administrative Court of Appeals on 18 February 2010. The hearing took place on 17 December 2013 and by virtue of decision no. 2896/2015 notified to the Company on 7 September 2015, the appeal of the Company was rejected. The Company filed on 5 November 2015 respective annulment petition before the Conseil d’Etat for the cassation of the decision of the Administrative Court of Appeals. The hearing initially set for 31 May 2017 has been postponed for 10 April 2019. However, based on the updated risk assessment of the case, which was re-estimated by the management in cooperation with its legal consultants, the Company decided to recognise the disputed part of the special once off tax contribution in 2018 financial results.

The Company’s liabilities towards European Investment Bank are secured through the assignment of the Usufruct (refer to note 5.19). 37 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 5.9 Financial assets Equity Investments Equity investments are financial assets classified at fair value through profit and loss and are analysed as follows: Equity investments financial assets 2018 2017 Attica Bank shares 259,718 1,188,000 Total equity investments financial assets 259,718 1,188,000 Equity investments are measured at fair value. The acquisition cost of the equity investment amounted to €9,900,000, whereas the fair value as of 31 December 2017 was €1,188,000. On 26 April 2018, Attica Bank announced the reverse split of its common shares (1 new share for 14.18 old shares with the share price amounting to €4.25 from the initial price of €0.30) and the Share Capital Increase (SCI) as per its BoD decision of 22 December 2017. AIA did not participate in the SCI that took place in May 2018 after the decision of the Board on 21 December 2017, resulting to the decrease of its number of Attica Bank’s shares from 33,000,000 to 2,327,221. However, AIA proceeded to the sale of its pre-emptive rights totalling 2,327,221 during the period 04 May 2018 – 11 May 2018 and did not participate in the aforementioned SCI. As of the financial position date the fair value of the equity investment amounted to €259,718. A fair value loss of €928,282 was recognized in profit and loss account and the fair value gain of €231,000 of year 2017 was recycled from other comprehensive income to profit and loss account. As of post financial position date 18 February 2019 the fair value of the equity investment amounted to €276,939. As explained in notes 3.1.4 and 5.19, the equity investment financial assets acquired are not “Authorised Investments” as defined in the loan agreements entered into between the Company and EIB with respect to the Company’s borrowings. In accordance with the provisions of the aforementioned agreements, the Company obtained the consent and waiver of EIB for this investment on 1 December 2016. The waiver imposed the undertaking to the Company to open a new pledged Reserve Account (Attica Sub-Account) with the amount of the acquisition cost of the equity investment (€9,900,000) that is classified as restricted cash. Based on their maturity date, financial assets are classified as follows: Analysis of financial assets 2018 2017 Current financial assets Current financial assets 0 0 Total current financial assets 0 0 Non-current financial assets Non-current financial assets-equity investments 259,718 1,188,000 Non-current financial assets-restricted cash 9,900,000 9,900,000 Total non-current financial assets 10,159,718 11,088,000 Total financial assets 10,159,718 11,088,000 5.10 Other non-current assets Other non-current assets are analysed as follows: 38 Annex II: Financial Statements Analysis of other non-current assets 2018 2017 Investment in associates 3,245,439 3,245,439 Long term guarantees 249,806 236,021 Total other non current assets 3,495,246 3,481,460 Long term guarantees relate to guarantees given to lessors for operating lease contracts, and were measured at their present value, by discounting future cash flow transactions with the weighted average borrowing rate of the Company. 5.11 Inventories Inventory items are analysed as follows: Analysis of inventories per category 2018 2017 Merchandise 608,665 582,415 Consumables 910,982 891,258 Spare parts 4,883,244 4,769,127 Inventory impairment (572,483) (619,776) Total inventories 5,830,408 5,623,024 During 2018, a release of impairment provision of €47,293 was recognized in the income statement in order to reflect the accumulated provision for certain obsolete and slow-moving items to €572,483. 5.12 Construction works in progress Analysis of construction works in progress 2018 2017 Beginning balance 2,470,539 5,175,039 Acquisitions 19,714,413 17,616,869 Transfer to property plant & equipment-owned assets (2,594,644) (6,275,591) Transfer to intangible assets (8,757,419) (14,045,778) Total construction works in progress 10,832,889 2,470,539 Construction works in progress mainly refer to additions and improvements on the existing infrastructure assets such as technical works, building and facilities, roads etc. These assets will be returned to the Grantor at the end of the Concession Period, together with all other infrastructure assets as described in note 1. Upon the completion of the construction, such assets related to the infrastructure, will increase either the cost of the concession intangible asset or the owned assets. 5.13 Trade receivables Trade receivable accounts are analysed as follows: 39 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Analysis of trade receivable accounts 2018 2017 Domestic customers 24,165,123 26,954,565 Foreign customers 3,170,257 1,869,942 Greek state & public sector 4,600,176 6,763,459 Accrued revenues 190,915 2,225,515 Provision for impairment of trade receivables (2,414,045) (2,416,675) Total trade receivable accounts 29,712,427 35,396,805 All receivables are initially measured at their fair value, which is equivalent to their nominal value, since the Company extends to its customers short-term credit. Should any of the trade receivable accounts exceed the approved credit terms, the Company charges such customers default interest, (that is, interest on overdue accounts) at 6 months Euribor interest rate plus a pre-determined margin, as stipulated in the respective customer agreements. Such interest is only recognised when it is probable that the income will be collected. During 2018 a provision release of €2,630 (2017: release of €96,804) was recognized in the income statement, resulting in an impairment provision as at 31 December 2018 of €2,414,045 (2017: €2,416,675). 5.14 Other receivables Other receivable accounts are analysed as follows: Analysis of other receivable accounts 2018 2017 Accrued ADF 18,284,939 67,888,957 Corporate income tax advance payment 44,398,010 0 Other 11,512,045 19,936,184 Total other receivable accounts 74,194,994 87,825,141 Accrued ADF represents the amount of the passengers’ airport fee attributable to the Company, which had not been collected by the Company at year-end. Corporate income tax advance payment relates to income tax liabilities of 2019.

KGaA (13.33334% of shares) e) Copelouzos Dimitrios (1.999990% of the shares), f) Copelouzou Kyriaki (0.999997% of the shares), g) Copelouzos Christos (0.999997% of the shares) and h) Copelouzou Eleni-Asimina (0.999997% of the shares) 5.17 Statutory & other reserves Under Greek Corporate Law it is mandatory to transfer 5.0% of the net after tax annual profits to form the legal reserve, which is used to offset any accumulated losses. The creation of the legal reserve ceases to be compulsory when the balance of the legal reserve reaches 1/3 of the registered share capital. At 31 December 2018 the Company’s legal reserve increased by an amount of €8,552,063 (2017: €7,002,454) and amounted to €77,158,666 (2017: €68,606,603). In addition, there are a reserve for tax purposes amounting to €352,604 (2017: €352,604) and a reserve for actuarial gains/losses recognized due to the adoption of the amended IAS 19, amounting to €719,915 (2017: (€91,789)).

In addition, the prevailing bank loan agreements impose specific conditions for the permitted dividend distribution, which have been fulfilled since 2003 when the Company was in the financial position to distribute dividends. Given the additional short term financial obligations for the Company arising from the “Airport Development Agreement” Extension Agreement, no dividend distribution to the Shareholders is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders. 5.19 Bank loans Borrowings are analysed as follows: 41 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Analysis of loans 2018 2017 Long term loans EIB loan 134,348,764 217,431,038 Total long term loans 134,348,764 217,431,038 Short term loans EIB loan 83,082,274 78,201,166 Accrued interest & related expenses 568,574 773,380 Total short term loans 83,650,848 78,974,546 Total bank loans 217,999,612 296,405,584 European Investment Bank loan The Company and EIB, under a supplemental agreement signed on 19 December 2008 between them, agreed to partial release the Greek State’s Guarantee on the outstanding balance of EIB Loan and to modify certain terms of the EIB Master Facility Agreement related to the applicable interest rates. The modified terms are effective from 31 July 2009 and include the consolidation and division of the outstanding balance of the initial loan into two loans, Loan A and Loan B. As of 31 December 2018, Loan A was fully repaid while the outstanding balance of Loan B was €217,431,038. The weighted average interest rate for all tranches under Loan B is 6.12%. The Company’s liabilities towards EIB are secured through the assignment of the Usufruct, the ADA Claims, the Insurance claims and the contracts that generate revenues for AIA and the pledge of Bank Accounts and Securities. All the covenants set under the EIB Master Facility Agreement have been fulfilled as of 31 December 2018. As explained in notes 3.1.4 and 5.9, as of 1 December 2016, and following the negotiations with EIB and the Greek State in its capacity as EIB Loan Guarantor, the Company obtained the waiver of EIB for the investment of €9,900,000 in the financial asset measured at fair value through profit and loss account that did not meet the criteria of “Authorised Investments”. The waiver imposed the undertaking to the Company to open a new pledged Reserve Account (Attica Sub-Account) with the amount of the acquisition cost of the financial asset (€9,900,000) and the decrease of the amount available for Dividend distribution to the Company’s Shareholders by the balance of the Attica Sub-Account. The relevant Attica Sub-Account was opened on 1 December 2016 and the amount of €9,900,000 was deposited on 2 January 2017. The Company may only transfer amounts out of this bank account in situations where the Company has disposed of some or all of its shares in Attica Bank on market terms. Furthermore, in terms of this remediation agreement, any funds left over once the entire Attica Bank shareholding is disposed of, will be transferred into the Proceeds account. However, in the context of the extension of the Concession period, it has been agreed with EIB that the funds of the Attica Sub-Account will be used for the payment of the Consideration of this transaction and the relevant amount was released on 21 February 2019 (refer to note 5.30). The amortised cost of the long-term financial liabilities at fixed interest rates from the EIB Loan is determined using the effective interest rate method, by discounting the future contractual cash flows with the effective interest rate applied to those liabilities. The fair value of the financial liabilities at fixed interest rates is determined by discounting the future contractual cash flows with the current mid-swap interest rate for the average loan life period of such liabilities. The fair value measurement of the financial liabilities is categorised as Level 2. 42 Annex II: Financial Statements Fair value of the borrowings 2018 2017 Carrying amount 217,431,038 295,632,204 Fair value 236,746,284 330,952,805 Excess of fair value over carrying amount (19,315,246) (35,320,601) Second Lien Bond Loan (the 2L Bond Loan) The Company paid to the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (HRADF) on 22 February 2019 an amount of €1,131,676,123 (including the adjustment of €16,676,123 calculated on 10.30% per annum on the agreed consideration of €1,115,000,000 pro rata on a daily basis) plus applicable VAT, in cash as consideration for the extension of the Concession Period. Within this context, the Company has entered into a 2L Bond Loan Agreement for an amount up to €665,600,000 with the National Bank of Greece and Piraeus Bank as subscribers (namely the 2L Bond Loan). Even though the 2L Bond Loan documentation was signed on 18 December 2018, the disbursement of the loan took place on 22 February 2019, 3 business days after the effectiveness of the ADA Extension Agreement. The 2L Bond Loan finally amounted to €642,476,578 disbursed once off, has a 15-year tenor, semi-annual payments and the interest rate will be comprised of the 6-month Euribor plus an applicable margin currently at 3.10% p.a. The 2L Bond Loan is subordinated to the EIB loan. The Company has undertaken to hedge from floating to fixed rate the 2L Bond Loan, by not less than 70% (but not more than 100%) for a tenor of at least two (2) years by way of entry into any combination of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate caps or swaptions. All borrowings are denominated in Euro, the functional currency of the Company. 5.20 Employee retirement benefits In accordance with Greek labour law, employees are entitled to compensation payments in the event of dismissal or retirement with the amount of payment varying depending on the employee’s compensation, length of service and manner of termination (dismissal or retirement). Employees who resign or are dismissed with cause are not entitled to termination payments. The amount payable in the event of retirement is equal to 40.0% of the amount which would be payable upon dismissal without cause. The provision for employees’ retirement benefits is reflected in the attached statement of financial position in accordance with IAS 19R and is calculated, as at the financial position date (31 December 2018), based on an independent actuarial study. The results of any valuation depend upon the assumptions employed. Thus, as at 31 December 2018: • If the discount rate used were 1.0% higher, then the Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) would be lower by about 13.5%. • If the discount rate used were 1.0% lower, then the DBO would be higher by about 16.1%. The results of the actuarial study for the provision for employee retirement benefits as computed by the actuary are shown below: 43 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 Actuarial study analysis 2018 2017 Principal actuarial assumptions at 31 December 2018 Discount rate 1.82% 1.63% Range of compensation increase 0%-3.0% 0%-3.0% Plan duration 15.05 16.26 Present value of obligations 10,015,756 10,761,931 Net liability/(asset) in the balance sheet 10,015,756 10,761,931 Components of income statement charge Service cost 245,228 272,613 Interest cost 174,875 181,101 Settlement/curtailment/termination loss 29,315 118,386 Total income statement charge 449,418 572,100 Movements in net liability/(asset) in the balance sheet Net liability/(asset) at the beginning of the period 10,761,931 10,148,627 Benefits paid directly (52,347) (221,468) Total expense recognized in the income statement 449,418 572,100 Total amount recognized in the OCI (1,143,246) 262,672 Net liability/(asset) in the balance sheet 10,015,756 10,761,931 Reconciliation of benefit obligations DBO at start of the period 10,761,931 10,148,627 Service cost 245,228 272,613 Interest cost 174,874 181,101 Benefits paid directly by the Company (52,347) (221,468) Extra payments or expenses/(income) 29,316 118,386 Actuarial loss/(gain) (1,143,246) 262,672 DBO at the end of the period 10,015,756 10,761,931 Remeasurements Liability gain/(loss) due to changes in assumptions 982,770 (234,712) Liability experience gain/(loss) arising during the year 160,476 (27,960) Total actuarial gain/(loss) recognized in OCI 1,143,246 (262,672) An actuarial gain (the difference between expected and actual DBO as at the end of 2018) of €1,143,246 arose during the year due to the following factors: • Change in financial assumptions: the equivalent discount rate has increased from 1.63% to 1.82%, producing a gain of €280,626. The salary increase assumption has decreased for all future years, producing a gain of €702,144. Thus, the change in financial assumptions gives rise to an overall actuarial gain of €982,770. • Experience: the gain of €160,476 is mainly from lower salary increases than anticipated for 2018 (experienced salary increases were on average 0.7% whereas the corresponding assumption was equal to 2.3%). • According to IAS19 Revised, the entire actuarial gains or losses that arise in each accounting period are recognized immediately in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), in net equity. In this case, the gain arising over 2018 is recognized as an income in the OCI statement. 44 Annex II: Financial Statements 5.21 Provisions As at As at Analysis of provisions Additions Utilisations Releases 1 Jan 2018 31 Dec 2018 Restoration expenses 15,110,128 370,078 780,506 0 14,699,699 Net other provisions 4,654,303 2,269,407 0 697,282 6,226,428 To be settled over 1 year 19,764,431 2,639,485 780,506 697,282 20,926,128 Total provisions 19,764,431 2,639,485 780,506 697,282 20,926,128 The provision for restoration expenses relates to the future expenses that result from the Company’s contractual obligations to maintain or to restore the infrastructure to a specified condition before it is handed over to the Greek State at the end of the service concession arrangement. It is expected that an aggregate amount of €15.89 million will be spent on major restoration activities commencing in year 2019 through year 2025 based on management’s current best estimates. 5.22 Income & deferred tax liabilities Income tax liabilities At the financial position date, the recognition of the income tax liability amounting to €86,646,569 reflects the income tax payable on taxable income at the rate of 29.0%.

According to the provisions of article 25.1.2.(k) of the ADA, (Law 2338/1995) tax losses can be carried forward to relieve future taxable profits without time limit. Tax losses have primarily arisen from the application of the accelerated depreciation method as provided by paragraph 8 of article 26 of Law 2093/1992. In addition, according to article 25.1.2.(j) of the ADA the accelerated depreciation method provided by Law 2093/1992 refers to tax depreciation and constitutes an allowable deduction for tax purposes even though the depreciation in the annual statutory accounts of the Company may differ from year to year. At the financial position date, the Company recognised a deferred tax liability on the outstanding accelerated depreciation, amounting to €120,005,768 (2017: €151,111,204). 5.23 Other non-current liabilities Other long-term liabilities are analysed as follows: Analysis of other non-current liabilities 2018 2017 Grant of rights fee payable 78,877,775 89,010,679 Long term securities provided by customers 2,374,275 2,211,012 Total other non-current liabilities 81,252,050 91,221,691 The Company pays a quarterly fee to the Greek State during the concession period for the rights and privileges granted in ADA. The carrying amount of the liability represents the present value of the future payment that concerns the fixed part of the fee at the financial position date. In 2018 a finance charge amounting to €4,867,096 has been recorded as unwinding interest of the liability due to the passage of time (2017: €5,362,215). The amount payable within the next 12 months is included in trade & other 46 Annex II: Financial Statements payables. The present value of total future payments at the time of airport opening has been included in the cost of the intangible concession asset which is amortised over the concession period. An amount of €2,435,104 is included in the 2018 amortisation of the intangible concession asset with respect to the grant of rights fee (2017: €2,435,104). Long term securities relate to performance guarantees provided for by the lessees for longterm lease agreements. Long-term securities are measured at their net present value, by discounting the future cash flow payments with the weighted average borrowing rate, at the financial position date. The weighted average borrowing rate for the Company for 2018 was at the rate of 6.12%. 5.24 Trade & other payables Trade & other payable accounts are analysed as follows: Analysis of trade & other payable accounts 2018 2017 Suppliers 20,893,461 14,770,622 Advance payments from customers 12,991,510 12,219,988 Beneficiaries of money – guarantees 15,442,202 13,637,982 Value added tax (86,872) 747,491 Other taxes payable and payroll withholdings 4,027,217 3,790,793 Grant of rights fee payable 15,000,000 15,000,000 Other payables 20,149 3,225 Total trade & other payable accounts 68,287,667 60,170,102 The amount shown above for suppliers represents the short-term liabilities of the Company towards its trade creditors as at the corresponding year end for the goods bought and the services they had rendered in the respective year. Advance payments from customers represent mainly the prepayments effected by the airlines which have selected the “Rolling prepayment” method in settling their financial obligations to the Company for the use of the airport facilities. Beneficiaries of money – guarantees represent the cash guarantees provided by the concessionaires for the prompt fulfilment of their financial liabilities arising from the signed concessions agreements. The cash guarantees are adjusted each year in accordance with the latest estimate of the expected sales forecast of the concessionaires for the subsequent year. The carrying amount of trade payables closely approximates their fair value at financial position date. 5.25 Other current liabilities Other current liabilities are analysed as follows: Analysis of other current liabilities 2018 2017 Accrued expenses for services and fees 25,610,865 19,852,438 Total other current liabilities 25,610,865 19,852,438 Current liabilities mainly concern to accrued cost for services rendered by third parties, private or public, which had not been invoiced at year end. 47 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 5.26 Operating lease arrangements The Company as a lessee Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Company for certain of its vehicles. Leases are negotiated for an average term of 5 years and rentals are fixed for the same period. In the current year, minimum lease payments under operating lease, amounting to €237,478, were recognised in the income statement, while the corresponding amount for the year 2017 was at €240,807. At the financial position date, the Company has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which are presented in note 5.27. The Company as a lessor Refer to note 5.1. 5.27 Commitments As at 31 December 2018 the Company has the following significant commitments: a) Capital expenditure commitments amounting to approximately €48.8 million (2017: €7.8 million) b) Operating service commitments, which are estimated to be approximately to €106.4 million (2017: €71.8 million) mainly related to security, maintenance, fire protection, transportation, parking and cleaning services, to be settled as follows: Analysis of operating service commitments 2018 2017 Within 1 year 38,958,767 30,166,462 Between 1 and 5 years 55,910,205 24,841,560 More than 5 years 11,541,713 16,757,114 Total operating service commitments 106,410,685 71,765,136 c) Operating lease commitments are analysed as follows: 2018 2017 Within 1 year 235,802 223,226 Between 1 and 5 years 331,544 395,961 Total operating lease commitments 567,346 619,187 d) Variable fee Component of the Grant of Rights Fee for fiscal year 2019, which is based on the calculation of the 2018 Consolidated Operating Profit as set out in ADA and as described in notes 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, is estimated to €25.4 million. This amount will be recognised in the income statement within 2019. 5.28 Contingent liabilities The Company has contingent liabilities comprising the following: Tax Audits a) The Company has not been audited yet by the Tax Authority for the fiscal year 2010. Recent decisions of the Conseil d’Etat set a 5-year limitation period of the State’s right to impose taxes and fines, although 48 Annex II: Financial Statements the limitation period can be extended up to 20 years, based on applicable provisions. At financial position date, the Company has not received any tax audit notification for the subject year. b) Effective from fiscal years ending 31 December 2011 onwards, Greek companies meeting certain criteria were obliged to obtain an “Annual Tax Certificate” from their statutory auditor in respect of compliance with tax law, as provided for by par. 5, article 82 of L.2238/1994 and article 65A of L. 4174/2013. As of 2016 the “Annual Tax Certificate” became optional. Irrespective of the tax audit performed by the tax auditors, the tax authorities reserve the right of future tax audit. The Company has received unqualified Tax Compliance Reports by respective statutory auditor for fiscal years up to 2017 (inclusive). The tax audit for the financial year 2018 is in progress, the issuance of Tax Compliance Report is expected to be issued within the fourth quarter of 2019 and management expects it to be unqualified. Value added tax With respect to VAT, the Tax Authority questioned the right of the Company to set off the total VAT of all fixed assets acquired and services rendered until 31 December 2015, as stipulated by article 26 paragraph 7 of Law 2093/1992, in conjunction with Articles 25.1.1 & 25.1.2 (g) of the ADA as ratified by Law 2338/1995. The Tax Authority disputed the above right of the Company to set off VAT, which corresponds to activities not subjected to VAT, i.e. property leases, and proceeded to impose VAT –including penalties – for the fiscal years 1998-2012 amounting totally to €168.4 million, comprising of €46.0 million capital and €122.4 million surcharges. The Company referred the issue, related to years 1998-2009, to the London Court of International Arbitration, in accordance with Article 44 of the ADA. Pursuant to the final award of the London Court of International Arbitration No 101735, which was issued on 27 February 2013, the relating acts of determination had been issued in breach of law. Alongside, the Company appealed before the competent Administrative Courts of Appeals against all the acts of determination of the Tax Authority to impose VAT on such capital and operating expenses, requesting the annulment of the tax assessments for all years from 1998 to 2012. The Administrative Court of Appeals by its decisions, regarding the acts of determination for the years 20042009 amounting to €12.2 million, rejected the appeals of the Company. The Company filed respective annulment petitions before the Conseil d’Etat for the cassation of the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeals and the Conseil d’Etat by its Decisions, which were notified to the Company on 11 March 2015, accepted the annulment petitions of the Company on the VAT disputes for the fiscal years 2004-2009 and referred-back the cases to the Administrative Court of Appeals. The hearing before the Administrative Court of Appeals took place on 7 October 2015, which by its decisions finally accepted the Company’s petitions and the VAT assessments for the fiscal years 2004-2009 were annulled. However, the Greek State on 20 May 2016 filed annulment petitions against the latter aforementioned decisions in favour of the Company before the Conseil d’Etat. The hearing took place on 11 October 2017 and the decisions notified to the Company on 30 August 2018 were in favour of the Company. Furthermore, regarding the assessments for the years 1998-2003 and 2010-2012, the juridical process before the Administrative Courts of Appeal is as follows: • For the fiscal years 1998-2003, which corresponds to VAT imposed on non-exempt expenses, such as, entertainment and hospitality expenses amounting to €1.3 million, the hearing took place at 7 April 2017 and the Company’s appeals were fully upheld, apart for year 2002 where the hearing took place at 16 October 2018 and the decision is pending. The same Court referred the VAT assessment for the fiscal year 2001 to the Administrative Court of Appeals due to lack of competence, the hearing of which took place at 7 November 2018 and the decision is pending. The Greek State has filed respective annulment petitions for the years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2003 before the Conseil d’Etat the hearing of which took place at 1 October 2018 and the decisions are pending. 49 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 • For the fiscal years 2001-2003, which corresponds to VAT imposed on the acquisition of fixed assets and operating expenses amounting to €150.3 million, the hearing took place at 16 October 2018 and the decisions are pending. • For the fiscal years 2010-2011, which corresponds to VAT imposed on the acquisition of fixed assets and operating expenses amounting to €3.5 million, the hearing took place at 10 October 2016 and by virtue of decisions nos. 1665/2017 & 1666/2017 the Company’s appeals were fully upheld. The Greek State has filed respective annulment petitions before the Conseil d’Etat the hearing of which is set for 18 September 2019. • For the fiscal year 2012, which corresponds to VAT imposed on the acquisition of fixed assets and operating expenses amounting to €1.1 million, the hearing is set for 8 April 2019. Based on the Company’s experts’ opinion by reference to the aforementioned final award of the London Court of International Arbitration No 101735, no provision has been recognised for all above acts of determination. Property tax With respect to property tax, the Tax Authority questioned the right of the Company to be exempted from any property tax until 31 December 2015 as provided by paragraph 5 of article 26 of Law 2093/1992, in conjunction with Articles 25.1.1 & 25.1.2 of the ADA. Further to the completion of tax audits on real property, the Tax Authority issued real property tax assessments for the fiscal years 2008-2013, amounting totally to €44.6 million, comprising of €28.2 million capital and €16.4 million surcharges. The Company referred the issue, to the London Court of International Arbitration, in accordance with Article 44 of the ADA. Based on the final award of the London Court of International Arbitration No 142821, which was issued on 21 January 2016, the Greek State was instructed to indemnify the Company as per Articles 5.2(i) and 32.3 of the ADA against the consequences of the real property tax levied on the Company by the Greek State for the period 2008-2013. Alongside, the Company appealed before the competent Administrative Courts of Appeals against all the acts of determination of the Tax Authority to impose real property tax, requesting the annulment of the tax assessments for all years from 2008-2013. Regarding the real property tax assessments, the juridical process before the Administrative Courts of Appeal is as follows: • For the fiscal years 2008-2009, which corresponds to the charge of real property tax amounting to €12.7 million, the hearing took place at 19 September 2016 and by virtue of decisions nos. 1048/2017 and 1047/2017 the Company’s appeals were fully upheld. The Greek State has filed respective annulment petitions before the Conseil d’Etat the hearing of which is set for 18 September 2019. • For the fiscal years 2010-2012, which corresponds to the charge of real property tax amounting to €15.2 million, the hearing took place at 16 January 2017 and by virtue of decisions nos. 5522/2017, 5524/2017 and 5527/2017 the Company’s appeals were fully upheld. In January 2018 the Greek State filed respective annulment petitions before the Conseil d’Etat the hearing of which is not set yet. • For the fiscal year 2013, which corresponds to the charge of real property tax amounting to €16.7 million, the hearing took place at 10 October 2016 and by virtue of decisions nos. 804/2017 and 807/2017 the Company’s appeals were fully upheld. The Greek State has filed respective annulment petitions before the Conseil d’Etat the hearing of which is set for 18 September 2019. Based on the Company’s experts’ opinion by reference to the aforementioned final award of the London Court of International Arbitration, as well as the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeals, which recognised that the arbitral award is binding for the Greek Administrative courts, no provision has been recognised for all above acts of determination. 50 Annex II: Financial Statements Municipal charges The Municipalities of Paiania and Spata-Artemida charged the Company with municipal charges for the provision of cleaning and lighting maintenance for the years 2004-2016 and 2007-2010 respectively, amounting totally to €68 million including surcharges. All respective petitions that Management filed before the competent Administrative Courts of Athens against said Municipalities, claiming that in accordance with the provisions of the ADA the Company has been granted with the exclusive right to provide such services to the airport users, were fully and irrevocably upheld by the Conseil d’Etat, thus rendering the imposition of such municipal charges unlawful. Nevertheless, the Company is still expecting the decisions of the Administrative Court of Appeals related to the hearings of the petitions against the Municipality of Paiania for the annulment of the 2013 and 2017 municipal charges, which have taken place on 1 February 2017 and 5 November 2018 respectively. Based on the Company’s experts’ opinion by reference to the aforementioned rulings of the Conseil d’Etat, no provision has been recognised. Other There are a number of pending legal lawsuits against the Company amounting to approximately €2.5 million (2017: €2.5 million) for which Management, following consultation with its Legal Counsel, believes that there is sufficient ground to successfully defend these claims. No provision for these claims has been recognised in these financial statements on the basis that no material liability is expected to arise. 5.29 Related parties transactions AIA is a privately managed Company, having as major shareholders the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund S.A (which is a company owned indirectly from the Greek State), the Hellenic Corporation of Assets & Participations S.A, (which is a company owned directly from the Greek State) and AviAlliance Group, each one of them holding more than 20.0% of the shares as at 31 December 2018 (for more details refer to note 5.16).

Fax:+30 210 2886 905 ey.com INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT To the Shareholders of Athens International Airport S.A. Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements Opinion We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Athens International Airport S.A. (the Company), which comprise the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018, the income statement and the statement of other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly in all material respects the financial position of the Athens International Airport S.A. as at December 31, 2018 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs), as incorporated in the Greek law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report. We remained independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code), as incorporated in the Greek law, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to the audit of the financial statements in Greece, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other Matter The financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2017, were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on April 26, 2018. Other information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information, includes the Board of Director’s Report, for which reference is also made in the section “Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements”, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Annex II: Financial Statements Responsibilities of the Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as endorsed by the European Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in the Greek law, will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as incorporated in the Greek law, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ▶▶ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ▶▶ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. ▶▶ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ▶▶ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ▶▶ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Taking into consideration that management is responsible for the preparation of the Board of Directors’ Report, according to the provisions of paragraph 5 article 2 of Law 4336/2015 (part B), we report that: ▶▶ a)In our opinion the Board of Directors’ Report has been prepared in accordance with the legal requirements of article 43a, of the Codified Law 2190/1920 and the content of the Board of Directors’ Report is consistent with the accompanying financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. ▶▶ b)Based on the knowledge and understanding concerning the Athens International Airport S.A. and its environment, obtained during our audit, we have not identified information included in the Board of Directors’ Report that contains a material misstatement.

The Athens International Airport 2018 Annual & Sustainability Report (“the Report”) has been prepared by the management of Athens International Airport S.A. (“AIA”), which is responsible for the collection and presentation of the information contained therein. Our responsibility, in accordance with AIA management’s instructions, is to carry out a “limited level” assurance engagement on the English version of the Report, except for Annex I Reporting by the BoD to the AGM and Annex II Financial Statements of the Report which have been audited by the AIA statutory auditors (for the independent auditor’s report see page 54 of Annex II Financial Statements). Our responsibility in performing our assurance engagement is solely to the management of AIA and in accordance with the terms of reference agreed between us. We neither accept nor we assume any responsibility and for any other purpose, to any other person or organization. Any reliance any third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk and responsibility. Work scope and criteria Our assurance engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with ISAE3000 (revised) and the requirements of a Type 2 assurance engagement, as defined by AA1000AS, in order to provide a limited level assurance opinion on: 1. Adherence to the AccountAbility Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness, against the relevant criteria found in the AA1000APS. 2. Accuracy and completeness of quantitative data and plausibility of qualitative information related to the GRI General and Specific Disclosures (indicated in the assurance column of the GRI Content Index with a checkmark, pp. 5-7 of Appendix), against the GRI Standards “In accordance – Core” requirements. 3. Adherence to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress (CoP) requirements, against the guidelines found in the Basic Guide to the UNGC CoP. 4. Alignment with United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals according to the guidance found in the “SDG Compass, Linking the SDGs and GRI” document, developed by the GRI, the UNGC and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD). What we did to form our conclusions In order to form our conclusions in relation to the scope and criteria mentioned above, we undertook (but were not limited to) the steps outlined below: ▶▶ Interviewed certain AIA Executives and Managers to understand the current status of corporate responsibility activities and progress made during the reporting period. ▶▶ Reviewed AIA’s approach to stakeholder engagement through interviews with managers responsible for engagement activities at corporate level and reviews of associated documentation. ▶▶ Reviewed AIA’s processes for determining material issues to be included in the Report, as well as the coverage of material issues within the Report, against aspects found in the “GRI G4 Airport Operators Sector Disclosures”, material issues and areas of performance covered in external media reports, and sustainability reports of selected European peers. 11 Annual & Sustainability Report 2018 ▶▶ Interviewed specialists responsible for managing, collating and reviewing sustainability data reported for internal and public reporting purposes, linked to the GRI General and Specific Disclosures under the scope of our assurance engagement (indicated in the assurance column of the GRI Content Index with a checkmark, pp. 5-7 of Appendix). ▶▶ Reviewed the Report for the appropriate transposition and presentation of the sustainability data linked to the GRI General and Specific Disclosures under the scope of our assurance engagement (indicated in the assurance column of the GRI Content Index with a checkmark, pp. 5-7 of Appendix), including limitations and assumptions relating to how these data are presented within the Report. ▶▶ Read information or explanations to substantiate key data, statements and assertions regarding the sustainability disclosures under the scope of our assurance engagement. ▶▶ Checked the AIA UNGC CoP against the guidelines found in the Basic Guide to the UNGC CoP. Level of assurance The evidence gathering procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance, as set out in ISAE 3000 (revised) on which we formed our conclusions. The extent of these evidence gathering procedures is less than those designed to obtain a reasonable level of assurance and therefore a lower level of assurance is provided. This is also expressed by the ‘moderate’ level of assurance, under AA1000AS, according to which “the assurance provider achieves moderate assurance where sufficient evidence has been obtained to support their statement, such as the risk of their conclusion being in error is reduced but not reduced to very low or zero”.
