Evaluate all new projects against the aspiration to contribute positively to mitigating climate breakdown, and encourage our clients to adopt this approach. Upgrade existing buildings for extended use as a more carbon efficient alternative to demolition and new build whenever there is a viable choice. Include life cycle costing, whole life carbon modelling and post occupancy evaluation as part of our basic scope of work, to reduce both embodied and operational resource use. Adopt more regenerative design principles in our studios, with the aim of designing architecture and urbanism that goes beyond the standard of net zero carbon in use. Collaborate with engineers, contractors and clients to further reduce construction waste. Accelerate the shift to low embodied carbon materials in all our work. Minimise wasteful use of resources in architecture and urban planning, both in quantum and in detail. “ 61 NORD ARCHITECTS A/S 62
