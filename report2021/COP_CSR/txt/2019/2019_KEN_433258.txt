In 2018, CST was able to look at several salient issues in human rights, Labor, Environment and anticorruption. As we reaffirm our commitment to the UN Global compact principles, we realize there is more to be done and from last year’s report we shall note progress in the various areas as we highlight salient issues and more that may have come up in the one-year period. We also note that the SDGs that guide CST have increased due to the broadness of our work to ensure inclusivity and that no one is left behind. We strive for a better tomorrow and overall shared value to ensure that not only does CST as a business thrives but also as a community of diverse people. For each material issue we address, we will highlight the key SDGs that guide us to ensuring that we are meeting our goals. 7|Page UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 HUMAN RIGHTS Cityscape Trends reaffirms its commitment to and support of the UN Declaration of Human rights, WHAT DID WE WORK ON IN THE PAST YEAR? OBJECTIVES 1) Increase the number of trainings conducted by 25% 2) Ensure that all employees are receiving a minimum wage 3) Ensure that all employee contracts are signed 4) Assess the impact CST has on the community OUTCOME Affirming that: Out of 89 employees as in the period 2018/2019, the following trainings were conducted:  On job trainingthis was 100% complete for all staff  Internal trainingThis is conducted annually and in the reporting period, 36 staff attended  External trainingthis is where facilitators are brought in to train the staff and in the period 2018/ 2019, 19 staff attended the training making it a low turn up The government has taken steps to ensuring that they have standardized the minimum wage for various industries via the labor bill passed. As a signatory to UN Global Compact principles and advocate for human right at the work place, we are working towards ensuring that our staffs are well compensated by ensuring 8|Page UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 that they at least get a minimum wage as we work towards ensuring a living wage for them. In the period 2018/ 2019, 35 employees out of 89 are receiving above a minimum wage, we are a long way from ensuring 100% achievement but with the joint effort of our stakeholders we shall be able to achieve a minimum wage for our staff. This is an 8% increase from the past year. All employee contracts that were not dully filled or signed were signed hence leaving no loopholes. CST prides itself in putting the community as part of our stakeholders. Our community first starts with our employees. In this period we were able to measure the impact we had on our community as an immediate result of our core business. This in turn also plays a role in ensuring that we have motivated staff all year round.  National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) beneficiaries were 10 out of 89. This marks a 7% increase from the previous report  Out of 89, 81 have been able to take their annual leave days before the end of the year.  5 out of 43 women took paid maternity leave for three months while 3 out of 46 men took paid paternity leave Noting further, CST has taken strides to review in their policies and coming up with new ones in the period 2018/2019 to address the salient human right issues within the cleaning industry.  Sexual harassment policy CST 2\SEXUAL HARRASSMENT POLICY.pdf  Human rights policy CST 2\HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY.pdf 9|Page UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 We ensure relevance and significance of these policies through the various forms of training with the most effective being the on job trainings. As a result more staffs are aware of their rights and responsibilities. Guided by the UN Declaration of Human Rights, we sought to emphasize on our salient human rights issues being that CST is a human capital intensive company that relies on people to carry out the core business. Emphasizing that CST demonstrate the importance it attaches to the implementation of its human rights commitment by conducting human rights training to staff where the management team that is also the company leadership conveys the importance of respect for human rights by the company and the employees. Our CEOMary Thuo is quite vocal on the need to safeguard the rights of those unheard, underserved and vulnerable in the society who also include low income earners. She takes time to visit all our existing customers’ on a quarterly basis where she also gets to meet with the staff and shares her vision of a society that respects everyone on the basis of being human despite the existing differences such as age, gender or even religion. Deeply conscious of human rights issues being discussed by senior management, we have identified Gender equality, decent work and economic growth, environmentally safe practices as our salient human rights issues. This is because being a cleaning company, we are first employers. We have a responsibility to protect those under our employ by providing good working conditions in 10 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 compliance with the OSHA regulations to ensure their productivity which in the long run benefits both the employee and the business. Taking into account the recent rising inequality claims within the work place, we chose gender equality as a salient human rights issue. The cleaning industry is termed as a male dominated industry however, we believe that by evening out the scales we get the best of both world. We are able to work with what both genders have to bring into the business and focus on their growth to ensure that the compensation is equal for the same job done. Having considered environmentally safe practices as one of our salient issues, we realized that we directly impact the environment and this also included all the people around us. How are they affected by our business and that are we doing about it these are some of the questions we ask ourselves to ensure that we are looking out for everyone and safeguarding our environment as we carry out our business. 11 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 LABOR In commitment to and support of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, WHAT DID WE WORK ON IN THE PAST YEAR? OBJECTIVES 1) Ensure total compliance with OSHA regulations 2) Ensure that all washrooms are properly demarcated and signage is 100% complete 3) Assess if the company recognizes the rights of its workers to freedom of association 4) Asses if independent trade unions are either discouraged or restricted and does the company enable workers to gather independently to discuss work related problems OUTCOMES Following the need to acquire an Occupational Safety and Health (OSHA) compliance, we have made strides and are in the engagement phase where we have met with OSHA representatives and are planning the way forward and the relevant requirements to becoming fully compliant. As a result, we are able to go through this process step by step as we train our staff on the same. It is expected that by March 2020, we will have achieved 100%compliance. Noting further, all signage and washroom demarcation has been done for the following areas: washrooms, energy consumption, machinery and chemical substances as per the Occupational Health and Safety Act. CST recognizes the need for independent trade unions, safe spaces where the employees are able to gather independently to discuss work related problems. 12 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 Workers have not joined any union body yet and have repeatedly mentioned during interactions via informal conversations and during official meetings that the working environment provided by cityscape is conducive and they feel that their grievances are well handled. ENVIRONMENT Reaffirming our commitment to support the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, WHAT DID WE WORK ON IN THE PAST YEAR? OBJECTIVES 1) Ensure at least 70% completion on the Sustainability project 2) Asses water wastage and how to address the matter 3) Ensure adoption of environmentally friendly technologies by at least 30% OUTCOMES Recognizing that in the period 2018/2019 the sustainability project experienced a lag in terms of resource mobilization to complete the implementation however the project is 50% complete with the expected completion date by the year 2020. Noting that while looking into the matter of water wastage, 90% of our staff were trained on how to minimize water use and to re-use where possible during the five trainings that have been carried out between the period 2018/2019 we intend to improve this in the next year by having consultants to advice on how to minimize water and even portable recycling water systems if possible to be included as part of our green cleaning technology. 13 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 Further noting in the period 2018/2019, we have included the environmentally friendly technologies such as energy efficient machinery as part of our long-term goals as we seek to upscale the business, in the meantime we are implementing best practicesReduce, Reuse and Recycle to ensure environmental cleaning operations. This is taught to our staff on job training and the in-house trainings and so far we have been able to see a reduction on the cost of cleaning materials by over 50% reduction of single used plastic for packaging by 80% and in the next year we seek to achieve 90% on zero wastage. This will however be further confirmed once an impact assessment is conducted in the next period. Noting with concern from our last years’ report that as we sought out environmental friendly and biodegradable detergents for industrial use, we realized that most of the companies producing these detergents specifically made them for domestic use and with the growing awareness of the effect of global warming, many homes have taken a step to conserve the environment by purchasing green detergents. Below is a representation of the biodegradable and environmental friendly detergents used both domestically and commercially. 14 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 DOMESTIC & COMMERCIAL USE OF GREEN DETERGENTS Domestic environmental safe detergent Commercial Environmental safe Environmental safe Domestic Bio degradable Commercial Biodegradable Figure 1 COMPARISON OF GREEN CLEANING DETERGENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND COMMERCIALLY This data was collected from samples through interactions in various industry forums from individuals as well as company representatives and what was their opinion of green cleaning using the green detergents. Out of 15 samples we got the following feedback: Viable and good for the environment7 15 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 Indifferent-4 Cannot work and the damage has been done4 Overview of Sample Opinion Cannot work since damage is done Indifferent Viable and good for the environment 0 2 out of 15 4 6 8 Figure 2 OVERVIEW OF SAMPLE OPINION 16 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 ANTICORRUPTION We reaffirm our commitment to and support of the UN Convention against Corruption, WHAT DID WE WORK ON IN THE PAST YEAR? OBJECTIVES 1. Asses the risk of corruption when doing business 2. Involve our stakeholders in the fight against corruption OUTCOMES Confirming that in the period 2018/2019, we experienced a setback due to the risk of corruption when conducting business. CST got a contract on condition that a percentage of the amount is to be paid to one of the Project managers. We made two cheque payments totaling up Ksh.90, 000. The company reevaluated the decision and ceased making payments. The project managers threatened to terminate our contract and held it against us to never get any new contracts from the Institution which cost us a major disruption on cash inflow. Despite the setback, we are proud to not be further compromising our values by upholding our stand on Anticorruption. Recognizing from our last report, regular trainings have been held with our staff to emphasize the importance of anticorruption within the organization especially after reviewing the Anticorruption policy. Furthermore, we have engaged our clients to support us on any misdemeanors on our employees who seek funds from them to undertake certain duties that are within their rights as our clients. CST 2\ANTI CORRUPTION POLICY.pdf 17 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 Noting with regret that we have experienced salary delays in the months of February 2109 and March 2019 due to delayed payments from two major contracts with the hopes of being bribed to release the funds. So far, pending payments from October 2018 have been cleared keeping in mind pending payments from January 2019 to July 2019. This affected the productivity of the staff but with steadfast determination, CST has been able to restructure is looking towards a brighter future. ACTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2020 HUMAN RIGHTS 1) Increase training with emphasis on salient issues by 30% at least biannually. 2) Increase the number of staff paid above minimum wage by 15% 3) Implement a grievance mechanism and asses its effectiveness. 4) Assess the impact of UN Global Compact principles in implementing of Human Rights. LABOR 1) Complete the OSHA compliance process. 2) Determine the effect of independent trade unions for CST employees ENVIRONMENT 1) Ensure completion of the sustainability project. 2) Conduct an environmental impact assessment 18 | P a g e UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT 2019 3) Report on progress towards achieving environmentally friendly technology 4) Initiate and plan for creation of green cleaning SOP ANTICORRUPTION 1) Engage the stakeholders to educate on the risk of corruption when conducting business 2) Report on the impact of corruption while conducting business. CONCLUSION Cityscape Trends continues to improve and work on the projects and initiatives it has launched and innovate new ideas in the next year that we will report annually on the progress made to incorporating the Global Compact principles in our business operations and by extension meeting the sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. This report shows our continued commitment to the United Nations Global Compact principles and to communicate actions undertaken to ensure a better world for future generations to come. 19 | P a g e
