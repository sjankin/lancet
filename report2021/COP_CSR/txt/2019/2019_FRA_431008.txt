By this COP 2018, DIAM renewal his commitment to the Global Compact ten principles. Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. p. 6 1. Governance Questions related to CSR and climate change are overseen at board level: a CSR steering committee formally meets every 6 months. This steering committee reviews the risks, strategy, progress and action report, and takes decisions on CSR and climaterelated strategic questions for DIAM. Once a year, the CSR steering committee is done with the full executive board of DIAM to review performance of the full year, like for instance carbon intensity or % of waste recycled. And on the other occurrence it is done with the core board members most related to CSR (COO, CFO, HR, CSR sponsor) to review the half-year progress. At board level, the COO and a “CSR sponsor” are especially involved into the CSR and climate-related issues. The Group COO follows very closely all CSR-related topics and in particular the ones related to carbon-strategy, to circular economy and to compliance. The CSR Sponsor is a Business Unit CEO with special interest in the global CSR transformation of DIAM. He provides guidance and support to the Group CSR Director on all CSR-related topics. The Group CSR Director is in charge of proposing and implementing the CSR strategy and actions and of preparing the progress reports, disclosure and communications. He has direct access to the COO and to the “CSR sponsor”, as he reports to the COO with a dotted line to the CSR sponsor. He formally reports to the CSR steering committee every 6 months. The CSR team at headquarters is formed of the Group CSR Director, a Group CSR project manager, and the Group Safety and Purchasing Director. In addition, they regularly get the help from interns. At BU Level, each BU has one designed CSR correspondent. This part-time role is essential to smoothly relay the information back and forth between central and BUs, and to develop local projects. p. 7 2. Labour Practices & Human Rights DIAM has a formalized policy regarding labour practices and human rights: on Employees health and safety and Working Conditions through DIAM HEALTH and SAFETY POLICY; on Labour Relations, Career Management, Child and Forced Labour, Diversity, Discrimination & Harassment, through the SOCIAL AND ETHICAL GUIDE and on the External stakeholder human rights through the Suppliers Code of Conduct. 2.1. Employee health and safety As stated in DIAM’s health and safety policy, DIAM’s first responsibility, even before serving clients, is to cause no harm to the health and safety of all the people who live nearby, visit, work in our offices and production sites or who work at our client’s sites, nor to the customers who use our products and services. Health and safety risk assessment Every Monday, occupational accident indicators are consolidated and discussed at the ExCom level. Any accident with work stoppage gets communicated to the entire Group in a “flash” communication sent to all business unit directors and QHSE managers, with the intention to pinpoint risky situations, root-cause analysis and give the teams the opportunity to discuss the situation and specific risks in their sites that might be similar to the ones that led to the specific accident communicated. Accidents statistics show us that the most probable work accidents risks for DIAM are the risk of cut, risks for employees using knives, and the chemical product usage. DIAM pushes all its sites to continuously improve their safety. The Central CSR team constantly helps sites to improve through specific projects and internal audits. DIAM encourages responsible behaviour and global consideration for the work environment. All plants are requested to organise a Safety Day every year to promote safety awareness, rules and behaviours with all their employees. This initiative has been successfully implemented throughout the entire Group, with every plant focussing on the aspects that they deem most important for their site, like fire training, evacuation drill, use of personal protection equipment, first help training, etc. The various initiatives have been shared throughout the Group in a short video, in order to do crossfertilization of ideas. The health and safety management system follows SA 8000 and ISO 45001 best practice and each site is audited internally every 18 months on an audit grid inspired by these standards. Safety Committees and / or fire-response teams have been formed in the largest plants of the Group. These Safety Committees follow the deployment of a PDCA (continuous improvement “plan do check act”) action plan nurtured by internal and external audits, and by site-own risk assessments. p. 8 2.2. Working conditions DIAM is committed to the well-being of its employees and to encourage all initiatives to improve the working conditions. Measures such as a shareholding plan is proposed to key managers. Legal and beyond profit-agreements are implemented in some site to allow to reward our employees to the level of their involvement and the quality of their work. SA 8000 is the international standard used by DIAM for its social policy and work conditions policy. It is also used as a reference, along with the “Living Wage” principle, for the definition of the Group’s remuneration policy. The application of this policy is verified through on-site SA8000-based social audits performed by internal and external auditors. In addition, employee satisfaction is monitored annually by a partner barometer. 2.3. Social dialogue DIAM implements various initiatives regarding social dialogue. There are Unions and / or employee representatives in 50% of DIAM locations. In countries or locations where specific representation is not in force, the CSR relays serve as communication relays. Furthermore, several communication tools (intranet, newsletter, notice display, verbal announcements from the plant managers and semester communication of financial performance) are implemented to promote transparency and a good social climate.

Training and career management Talent management is crucial for a company that relies on the empowerment of its talents in the fields of engineering and innovation. This is the foundation on which we have built the ambitious training goals which we have implemented at Business Unit and site levels to better respond to the operational needs of people and business. For a company offering engineering and innovative products like DIAM, employee skills are key to guarantee a high level of performance. A global training was implemented among different teams depending on their needs (creation methods, sales excellence) and then at business unit level. DIAM aims to provide at least one training every year to every employee (we reached 80% of DIAM employees who received at least one training in 2018), and to have an average of 14 hours of training per year per person (we reached 13 hours per FTE in 2018). Regular assessment of individual performance Individual annual reviews have been implemented since 2013. In 2018, such reviews have been conducted for 33% of DIAM employees. These reviews go through various criteria including client relationship management, international skills, and management skills. “People reviews” of high potential employees are organised on an annual basis at Board level by the HR Director. The assessment of the high potentials is based on a profile grid established by the HR department to maximize the homogeneity of the appreciation methods. It is followed up by individual meetings. Every 18 months, the network of high potentials is fostered by a strategic convention during which they gather and spend two days to increase cooperative work.

Child labour, slavery and human trafficking DIAM prohibits any form of forced or compulsory labour. Our policy is based on the based on SA8000 standard and our adhesion to the United Nations Global Compact. Our commitments on this matter are explicitly stated in DIAM’s “Code of Conduct”, in particular regarding compliance with international fundamental labour standards and the prohibition of the use of forced labour in all operations. DIAM strictly prohibits child labour (No employees below 15 years). Minors can work in certain special cases, particularly work-study apprenticeships, but only in stringent compliance with all the regulatory provisions. These commitments are listed in the “Code of Conduct”, particularly in regard to compliance with the fundamental international labour standards and the prohibition of child labour. Several initiatives are conducted regarding the integration of youngsters through internships within those limits. Some countries have been identified as more at risk on these issues. In such countries, DIAM has taken specific commitments and actions. In China, DIAM explicitly forbids personnel to pay ‘deposits’ to the company upon commencing employment, or to withhold any part of any personnel’s salary, benefits, property or documents in order to force such personnel to continue working for the company and, of course, we are p. 11 not engaged in or support human trafficking. Additionally, DIAM ensures that no employment fees or costs are borne in whole or in part by workers. Personnel clearly have the right to leave the workplace premises after completing the standard workday and are free to terminate their employment provided that they give reasonable notice to the company. Specifically, about child labour prohibition, DIAM China inspects and cross-references to verify the validity of at least two types of official ID. There is a reliable ID verification system to control the workers' access into the facility, such as finger printing or ID card with owner's photograph to prevent under-age workers entering the facility by using another person's ID. Finally, training materials/records on the policy for workers are in place in the site. 2.6. Discrimination and harassment Diversity is a matter of performance, credibility and equity for the Group. To encourage diversity, DIAM implemented a policy several years ago that was founded on the belief that all employees should share the values of respect and solidarity. In overall staff, the proportion of female employees among the Group is close to the proportion of male employees. The reporting on Human Resources is harmonised across the Group since 2012. A dashboard is followed on monthly basis with HR KPIs. These results are presented every year at Executive Committee level. DIAM has a formal approach on diversity issues within the “Solidarity” pillar of Sustainable by DIAM policy. The Group promotes initiatives aimed at developing equal opportunities for all kinds of employees: Long-term unemployment hires People with disabilities Employees suffering from occupational disease Refugees Age diversity – employees over 50 years-old Rehabilitation to the work world Reinsertion – previously imprisoned employees for instance Disadvantaged areas (favelas, deprived neighbourhood, disadvantaged province) Ethnic minorities Rehabilitated former addicts Sheltered workplace – work done with companies employing disabled or disadvantaged people At DIAM, we support local initiatives which bring life to our vision of social inclusiveness and showcase our willingness to give back to society in many forms (charity and social inclusion). Those are some examples of actions taken. In DIAM “D3” USA, supporting men’s and women’s health issues has become part of the D3’s annual calendar. Employees and temporary agency workers p. 12 alike participated in 2017 in October’s Wear Pink Day and Movember. D3 also supports local universities and food pantries. DIAM Brazil has donated 459 books in 2017 to enhance a local public school’s library. Other initiatives include favouring hiring from low-income areas. DIAM Yzeure has a longstanding partnership with a social inclusion workshop for both production and postconsumer dismantling. DIAM Prestige Europe is initiating a partnership with Singa France, to foster and design opportunities between newly arrived people (including refugees) and the local community. DIAM Australia is now employing two people from White Lion, a national nonprofit organisation which supports youngsters breaking their cycle of disadvantage. In 2017, DIAM Poland has signed an agreement with a local prison to ‘resocialise ‘offenders through work. The employees also raised money for a polish NGO which helps children with special needs. In the UK, DIAM very actively partners with RNIB and Remploy, two NGOs to recruit disabled employees or help the work and social inclusion of people with difficulties. DIAM Display China sponsors five young girls from Chinese minorities with the NGO Couleurs de Chine to provide them access to school. Furthermore, to fight against discrimination and harassment issues, DIAM implemented a Whistle-blower procedure.

Environment and Customer safety DIAM has a formalized environmental policy on Energy consumption, GHG emission, Materials, Chemicals and Waste, environmental impacts from use of products and Products End-of-Life and Sustainable consumption through the DIAM CSR POLICY; on water consumption through the DIAM WATER POLICY and on the customer health and safety through the DIAM HEALTH and SAFETY POLICY. 3.1. Energy Consumption and Greenhouse gases DIAM is committed to play its part in addressing the environmental crisis. Through the analysis of the life-cycle environmental impact of representative categories of displays, we have identified the predominant ecological aspects for each categories of displays. In light of this, priorities are eco-design, post-shop POS displays collection and their proper reuse and recycling. Reduction of energy consumption through employee’s awareness Training and informing employees about environmental issues is an integral part of the measures put in place by the Group in each of the countries where it operates. In 2018, DIAM organized a Group-wide “Recycling day” event. That day, all DIAM employees have been invited to learn about climate change and the environment, to share ideas on circular economy, and to act to reduce our environmental impact (materials, waste, water, energy, products…). All DIAM employees have signed the DIAM Code of conduct where they commit to limiting their environmental impact in their line of work (including reduction of energy consumption). Purchasing of renewable energy through the electrical grid In 2016, taking effect on 1/1/2017, DIAM started to switch to renewable electricity by switching 100% of its electricity consumption in France to renewable. In 2018, DIAM reinforced this action by switching most of sites around the world to renewable electricity. By this action, DIAM consumed 19 GWh of renewable electricity (or 82% out of a total consumption 23GWh) and avoided 6 600 tons of CO2eq. emissions. Indicator Unit 2015 2016 2017 2018 2018PF* Electricity consumed MWh 18 987 18 758 22 568 23 070 21 895 Renewable Electricity consumed MWh 0 0 9 143 18 988 18 143 Share of renewable electricity % 0 0 40 82 83 Avoided emissions due to tCO2eq 0 0 669 6 600 5 927 renewable electricity Figure 6: Electricity related indicators 2018PF*= 2017 reporting perimeter p. 15 DIAM plans to reach 90% of renewable electricity consumption in 2020. Production of renewable energy In the beginning 2018, 180kWp of ground panels and then 50kWp additional panels on the roof have been installed on DIAM Brazil sites (see photo below). The powerplant produced 190 MWh of renewable energy in 2018 for the energy network and for the site’s activities. At the beginning 2019, 38% of the DIAM Brazil electricity consumption come from this powerplant and saved 28 tons of CO2eq.. Table 1: Power plant at DIAM BRAZIL Reduction energy consumption through efficient devices On injection sites, we have invested to convert part of the production machines from hydraulic presses to electric presses that consume less energy and that automatically switch to standby mode. 123 tons of CO2eq. and 2 000 MWh have been saved by this action. It is our intention to continue the efforts to convert to more energy-efficient machines. Furthermore, several DIAM sites (France, China, USA…) installed low consumption lights (LED) in the production areas with significant decreases in electricity consumption whilst maintaining or improving the workshop lighting environment for workers. By this action, we reduced our consumption by 77MWh and we avoided about 50 tons of CO2eq.. p. 16 Process optimization to reduce emissions of GHGs On a day-to-day basis, process optimization and industrial housekeeping also contributes to energy saving, for instance with machines shutdown tests and warnings, with the installation of programming devices for heaters, etc. Monitoring of direct or indirect GHG emissions DIAM has targeted a 5% per year decrease in CO2eq. intensity (CO2eq. emissions scope 1+2 by euro of sales). To reach this target, DIAM implemented a monthly reporting on gas and electricity consumption to monitor the direct and indirect GHG emissions and to identify the entities under operational control with high potential of energy savings. The increase in DIAM’s Scope 1 is mainly due to the Group's growth and acquisition. (Note: we improved reporting on car fleet consumption in 2017, resulting in an increased estimate that year). DIAM’s Scope 2 decreased thanks to renewable energy purchased through the electrical grid. The CO2eq. intensity decrease is mainly due to the Scope 2 decrease and a slightly higher revenue.

When computer equipment finally become a waste, its sent to DEEE recycling. Furthermore, DIAM promotes video conferencing to limit travel impact. We have installed video conferencing equipment in most of Group’s site. p. 17 Energy audit Thanks to the monthly monitoring of energy consumption, DIAM identified two sites with high potential of energy savings. These two sites represented 23% of the total energy consumption of the Group. DIAM launched two energy audits on these two sites with the help of an external expert in industrial energy efficiency. The goal was to identify actions to reduce energy consumption and to be able to duplicate these actions on other sites in following years. 3.2. Water DIAM is committed to water resources protection. Our ambition is to decrease our water intensity (water consumption by euro of sales) by 5% every year. In addition, we have in mind the varying impact of hydric stress depending on water basins, and adapt our ambition to stress levels. DIAM is triggering improvement projects through a specific monitoring of the sites situated in high water-stress areas and of the sites with a significant consumption. In 2018, DIAM had only one site located in a high hydric stress area: Sousse in Tunisia. Reduction of water consumption through monitoring and employee information Every month, the Group conducts a monitoring of water consumption to identify deviations that could pinpoint to potential leaks. This monitoring enabled us to reduce the water consumption by a factor of 6 on a site, to 1 300 cubic meters in 2018 from 6 000 cubic meters in 2017. DIAM in the USA has reduced its office water consumption through close monitoring and education of employees. All DIAM employees have signed the DIAM Code of conduct where they commit to limiting their environmental impact (including reduction of water consumption). Reduction of water consumption through innovative equipment To save water resources, DIAM implements different solutions of water reuse. For example, at Yzeure Plant, the water circuit of hydraulic presses now turns in close circuit to increase water reuse, reduce net water intake from the grid and wastewater rejects to the grid. It is our intention to continue the efforts to convert to more waterefficient machines. Measures implemented to reduce pollutants rejected into water p. 18 To reduce pollutants rejected into water, DIAM seeks technical solutions to develop the use of alternatives technologies such as water-based solvents. For instance, Prugent DIAM China has managed to replace all solvent-based paints by waterbased paints. Steps to detect and eliminate any groundwater contamination When relevant in sites using chemicals, DIAM may request independent third-party analyses to detect potential soil or groundwater contamination. The increase in water consumption is mainly due to the Group’s growth and acquisition.

Materials, Chemicals and Waste DIAM’s material impact primarily come from plastics, wood-related materials, metals, electronics and chemicals. In 2018, DIAM generated 3 410 tonnes of waste. We estimate materials purchased and waste generated to represent respectively 48% and 16% of the scope 3 indirect emissions of greenhouse gases. Beyond climate change, the use of chemicals could have an impact on the health of employees. To protect climate and our employees, DIAM implements actions to reduce our activity impacts. Labelling, storing, handling and transporting hazardous goods DIAM sites are requested to regularly train their teams on the proper handling and storing of chemical and hazardous substances. A key aspect of reducing the related risks lays in the decrease of their usage through eco-design and process improvements by which we gradually get rid of gluing and switch to less impactful techniques like, for instance, sonic welding and digital printing. Proper labelling, storing, handling and transporting of chemicals and potentially hazardous goods are to be organized at site level and are regularly audited by Group internal audits. Internal audits check the various impacts of these risks: human health and safety, risks for the environment, and risks of fire and explosion. It also checks the actual training of employees and their proper information on the levels of risks and necessary handling measures. p. 19 Formal timeline defined to reduce consumptio n of hazardous substances The furniture manufacturers are subject to REACh1 requirements in Europe and DIAM works actively to constantly improve its REACh reporting capacity. To go further, and in direct link with the precautionary principle, DIAM has the goal to avoid potentially harmful chemicals, and has made important efforts to ban the use of CMR 1A (proven risk) and CMR 1B (alleged risk) and to limit and replace whenever possible the use of CMR 2 (potential risk). To achieve this objective, DIAM developed in 2017 an internal tool to ease the identification, elimination and replacement of CMR products. Work process or innovative technologies implemented to reduce, recycle or reuse waste Eco-design plays a major role in this effort too: glue-free products for instance are a constant aim for DIAM as they enable good recycling rates, be it at production stage (quality or process rejects) and after store life. Intensive work is being done at DIAM to limit waste generation during process through technological improvements, for instance at CNC and laser cutting. All waste are sorted and taken care of by specialised companies. Work process or innovative technologies implemented to treat waste or facilitate clean disposal Most DIAM industrial sites have plastic grinders enabling to reduce the size of the waste and -when possible, i-e in plastic injection sites, and provided it does not have detrimental impacts to the quality of the products to reuse the material directly into plastic injection. Chemical wastes are handled through specific streams for safe recycling. 1 Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals p. 20 3.4. Environmental impacts from use of products The major and probably only environmental impact from the use of products comes from the in-store electric consumptions of POS displays. We estimate this impact to represent 20% of DIAM’s total carbon footprint in 2018. We invite our clients, brands and retailers to act with us to reduce this impact by adjusting their light levels requirements and by switching their stores to renewable energy consumption and by switching off the POS displays when not in use. DIAM offers specific solutions to decrease the consumption of POS displays, through optimization of the electric consumption and light diffusion and the use of activity sensors and switches and the implementation of innovative techniques to generate the same amount of light with less energy consumption. 3.5. Environmental impacts from Products End-of-Life Scope 3 indirect emissions of greenhouse gases is by far the main contributor to DIAM’s climate change footprint with an estimation of 97% of the total (direct and indirect: scopes 1,2 and 3). We estimate 52% came from the purchased goods and services (mainly arising from the plastic purchases) and 15% from the end-of-life treatment of sold products (the emissions generated by the products after they are disposed of. Theses emissions depend on the markets in which they are used and disposed of); and 20% from the use of sold products (mainly arising from the electric consumption of POS display). Please note that those estimates may be revised in the coming years to reflect a better and more complete grasp of the emissions. As scope 3 (indirect emissions from the full life-cycle of the products) is the most important factor, the Group is concentrating its efforts on eco-design of POS displays, with a specific effort on power consumption and on circular economy (recyclability and effective recycling). We contribute to push the POS ecosystem towards the actual recycling of POS displays by offering recycling solutions to our customers and by promoting circular economy in various instances with our customers. Products and packaging designed for easy dismantling and recyclability Easy, manual dismantling is a constant goal for DIAM as it is a key aspect of how we can improve the impact of POS displays through actual dismantling, sorting and reuse or recycling of the materials. To achieve this objective, we train our teams and share the best practices among the Group to avoid the use of glues and minimize the number of materials used in one display. We also develop dismantling instructions to enable proper dismantling. p. 21 Company specific take back programs, and/or facilities for collection of equipment Already, most of DIAM displays can easily be dismantled. This enables the recovery and re-use of valuable materials which may be regenerated and re-used into the production of new products. But actual claim back and effective dismantling and recycling is not necessarily applied and in its vast majority, the POS market is still very linear to date. Circular economy models must be found and DIAM is firmly committed to participating to such efforts. Ease of dismantling is a needed first step, but is useless if the products are thrown to general refuse and sent to landfill or incinerators. Things must change. For a prestige brand, DIAM created a 100% dissociable POS display and has organized the actual recycling of the previous version with a social economy partner. Thanks to the specific capabilities of the social partner, the dismantling is of very high quality and the recovery and segregation of components are maximized. 3.6. Customer Health and Safety To our best knowledge, DIAM products have no or limited impact towards endcustomer’s health and safety. We estimate that most volatile components coming from process and production are dissipated well before the display arrives in the stores. We pay special attention to the structural resistance of our products and to their proper installation when we install them, to avoid any risk of tilting or fall that might result in customer injury. p. 22 3.7. Promotion of Sustainable Consumption DIAM offers its expertise to its clients to reduce their carbon footprint: we are able to calculate the carbon footprint of products for most important offers. An internal tool developed in partnership with a well-known life cycle analysis consulting firm is available for that purpose. Further explanation and co-construction work need to be done with clients to better integrate environmental requirements into their design requirements. 20% of DIAM’s climate change impact comes from the electrical consumption used by products in the stores. DIAM has developed advanced know-how on ecodesign, especially on illumination optimization to reduce this impact.

Sustainable Procurement Full compliance with internationally proclaimed human rights has become a license-to-operate in the purchaser/supplier relationship. We welcome this positive trend. We fully adhere to the UN Global Compact 10 principles. We implement policies, tools and responsible practices to prevent any risk of abuse. Likewise, compliance with environment regulation and an active environmental impact-reduction policy are now clear requests from all stakeholders, including DIAM. This includes for instance carbon footprint reduction along the entire value-chain, use of certified wood-based products from sustainable sources to avoid harmful deforestation, actions on the bio-diversity preservation, etc. To push our suppliers in that direction, we ask them to sign and commit to a supplier code of conduct to be referenced with DIAM. We also request them to submit to autodiagnostic evaluations and often to on-site audits to evaluate their compliance with DIAM’s commitments and with regulation. 4.1. Social and environmental factors within procurement Social and environmental factors within procurement are addressed through a responsible purchasing policy based both on the quality of products and services as well as on the social and environmental values of DIAM Group. DIAM Supplier CSR code of conduct We share growing expectations with our suppliers. We expect them to adhere to and comply with our suppliers’ code of conduct. This suppliers’ code of conduct is based on: Complying with the social and environmental standards in force. Adopting an approach based on ethics and transparency. Prohibiting forced labour and child labour. Providing employees with a safe and fair work environment. Applying safety and risk-prevention rules. Respecting the environment and being in line with an eco-design approach. Beyond the compliance with the principles we thrive to encourage our suppliers to become partners in the promotion of eco-design and to find innovative solutions to limit the environmental impact of their business (for example by using recycled materials or by changing to new printing systems). Our intention is to increase the implementation of this policy over the coming years. p. 25 Indicator unit 2015 2016 2017 2018 Sites with over 50% of their suppliers % Not Not Not 49% who signed the code of conduct reported reported reported Figure 11: Supplier's code of conduct related indicators CSR risk analysis In the referencing of production suppliers, supplier risks are identified using a risk mapping by purchase types integrating the following criteria: expense amount, business strategy, as well as country risk (ethics criteria) and activity risk (CSR criteria) consistent with the EcoVadis’s risk scoring. This mapping allows buyers to identify, analyse and rank strategic suppliers and/or suppliers in the most exposed categories. Consequently, buyers can launch the required risk management actions (supplier assessment, supplier monitoring, site visits, etc.). Every two years, this CSR risk analysis is renewed for production suppliers. Over the last year, CSR risk analysis have covered about 80 of the Group’s strategic suppliers. Supplier assessment on environmental and social practices DIAM uses EcoVadis assessment system to measure the CSR performance of its strategic suppliers. This involves a remote documents-based audit of the supplier covering several criteria across environmental, social (human rights), ethical (corruption) and supplier relation issues, based on international CSR standards and with expert review and feedback. Using a collaborative solution allows suppliers to minimize the workload linked to CSR reporting, by sharing their results with multiple customers. Over the last year, supplier’s assessment has covered about 30 of the Group’s strategic suppliers. Over the last year, evaluations have covered about 10% of the Group’s strategic supplier’s procurement spend. Over the last year, evaluations have covered about 5% of the Group’s strategic suppliers. DIAM’s intention is to keep increasing the number and quality of evaluations in the coming years. p. 26 Training of buyers on social and environmental issues within the supply chain In 2017, a number of DIAM purchasing teams have been trained to suppliers’ audits, environmental and ethical questions. Further efforts have been performed in 2018 with the revision of the CSR risk analysis and a more efficient approach to screening and auditing suppliers. Over the past two years, 16 buyers received at least one training on sustainable procurement. Over the past two years, 30% of buyers received at least one training on sustainable procurement. On-site audits of suppliers on environmental or social issues On-site audits of suppliers (either directly done by DIAM or subcontracted to audit specialists) are an effective way to obtain and validate evidence of compliance. Over the last years, on-site audits of suppliers have covered about 30 of the Group’s strategic suppliers. Over the last year, on-site audits of suppliers have covered about 10% of the Group’s strategic supplier’s procurement spend. Over the last year, on-site audits of suppliers have covered about 5% of the Group’s strategic suppliers. On-site audits of suppliers are followed upon by our purchasing teams through corrective actions plan and reviews. The audits, action plans and reviews cover the business performance of suppliers, operational service level, and ethics and compliance. The aim is to enhance the capacity building of suppliers on environmental or social issues with a continuous improvement plan. p. 27 Indicators Unit 2015 2016 2017 2018 Suppliers which has gone Number Not Not Not 80 through a CSR risk analysis reported reported reported Suppliers which has gone Number Not Not Not 30 through a CSR assessment reported reported reported % of total procurement spend % Not Not 0% 10% which has gone through a CSR reported reported assessment or audit % of all suppliers which has % Not Not 0% 5% gone through a CSR reported reported assessment Buyers at DIAM Number Not Not 47 54 reported reported Buyers across all locations who Number Not Not Not 16 received at least one training reported reported reported on sustainable procurement over the past two years Buyers across all locations who % Not Not Not 30% received training on reported reported reported sustainable procurement over the past two years Suppliers which has gone Number Not Not Not 30 through an CSR on-site audit reported reported reported % of total procurement spend % Not Not Not 10% which has gone through a CSR reported reported reported on-site audit % of all suppliers which has % Not Not Not 5% gone through a CSR on-site reported reported reported audit Figure 12: Sustainable procurement related indicators p. 28 4.2. Wood and/or wood-based products from sustainable sources DIAM integrates an environmental aspect in the choice of the products we purchase. For instance, DIAM’s intention is to concentrate its purchasing of paper and cardboard on deforestation-free certified products (FSC label or other when FSC is not available).

Fair Business Practices 5.1. Anti-corruption and bribery Prevention of corruption and bribery Over the last few years, DIAM had an important growth with a strong international development. To integrate the corruption risk, and in link with the French Sapin II law, DIAM has started to enforce in 2016 an anti-corruption policy and a surveillance system. This monitoring system consists in: A corruption and bribery risk assessment conducted in 2017 by an independent third party over the entire DIAM business scope. This corruption risk assessment will be conducted every 3 years. A specific action plan on areas identified as high risk of corruption has been carried out (for example: supplier audits). An awareness training performed to prevent corruption and bribery based on the e-learning tool of global compact (The Fight against Corruption) has been deployed on 27% of employees (841 employees), focused on critical positions like purchasing, sales and management. A code of conduct was established and is signed by all managers and employees. The code of conduct is integrated into the contractual relation between DIAM and its employees and disciplinary sanctions may apply for noncompliance. An ethic alert procedure (Whistleblowing mechanism) is available to all employees and visitors to report any issue regarding corruption and bribery. Our external financial auditors perform tests and controls regarding corruption and bribery. All these elements are monitored by the financial department, human resources department and CSR department. Sensitive transactions and charity-related actions Like all investments and actions using DIAM’s brand name, it is important to have clear rules and controls for sensitive transactions approval, whilst preserving the decentralized creativity and freedom of the DIAM Group. That’s why DIAM defined validation rules regarding purposes and spend level in term of charity actions in the name of DIAM. Those objectives and spend levels are validated by a control procedure including Group Financial Director, Group Human Resources Director and Group CSR Director. p. 30 Indicator Unit 2015 2016 2017 2018 Total workforce FTE 1 626 1 855 2 789 3 110 DIAM employees who received FTE Not Not 181 841 training on business ethics issues reported reported % of Diam employees who received % Not Not 4% 27% training on business ethics issues reported reported Figure 14: Business ethics issues related indicators 5.2. Information security In addition to the anti-corruption system, the IT department has set up a Group IT Charter and several initiatives for information security. These initiatives are: A dashboard to follow information security risk assessments performed. An awareness communication to prevent information security breaches (Think before you click). An automatic backup of the information (email and attachment) in a protected server. An alert procedure (Whistleblowing) for all employees to report information security concerns and a response procedure to manage breaches of confidential information. Furthermore, the Group IT department and those procedures are certified by quality standard (ISO 9001) which guarantees the respect of the property and the protection of the customer information. Concerning the information security of end-of-life products, we are committed to anonymize the client's waste managed by DIAM and to provide a certificate of destruction (for data or material waste) issued by the partner in charge of the destruction or recycling for all relevant waste.
