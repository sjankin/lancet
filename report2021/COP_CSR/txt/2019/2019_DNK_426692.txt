We believe, that an open-minded dialog with our customers and the empowerment of our employees, not only generates a high performance, but also ensures satisfaction and motivation – both amongst our customers and our employees. We take care of our customers and make sure that their values and visions are passed on to the market. Moranti has a clear Corporate Governance model where all employees, customers and suppliers are encouraged to follow the “Ten principles of Global Compact”. Within our own operation we have education schemes, self-assessments as well as audit processes to ensure that we constantly meet the requirements. Our suppliers have to sign a document confirming that they meet the requirements of Global Compact and likewise document this by audit reports. It is our firm belief, that the “Ten principles within Global Compact” make a difference within trusted corporations and provide sustainable Governance to a better world. Birgitte Dam Kræmmergaard President and CEO Moranti Services A/S April 2019
