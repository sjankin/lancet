International Holding a/s CVR. no. 31 15 85 91 Corporate Social Responsibility 2018 SCHUR INTERNATIONAL HOLDING A/S – CSR REPORTING STATEMENT ON CONTINUED SUPPORT The work and the co-operation with Global Compact are important to Schur. Since we joined the initiative in 2015, we have reported on sick days, work-related accidents, gender distribution, waste, CO2 emission and energy consumption. This year, it makes us particularly proud to inform that since 2015 we have continuously focused on initiatives with a view to reducing the energy consumption. At the end of this year, the initiatives will result in an overall reduction of 40% in the Danish companies, which was the goal at the end of 2020. Global Compact's 10 principles are our guiding star and framework when we work with the three-part bottom line: people, climate/environment and finances. Since 2017 we have elaborated on and documented the work by means of the UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights and Business as well as OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The due diligence work gives us a broad and important insight into our companies' sustainability and it provides a solid foundation for our strategic CSR work. During the past accounting year, we have completed impact analyses in our Swedish and Danish companies. During 2019, the remaining production companies in the Group will be analysed and initiatives to avert and prevent negative impacts on environment, human rights and anticorruption will be carried out in all companies. This report will be the last one in this format. In future, we will describe our strategic ambitions for the coming years in relation to the Global Goals. With this, our fourth annual Communication on Progress -report, we will show our continued support to the UN Global Compact.
