As a standard for golf design we intend to identify native endangered species for replanting or build around them whenever possible, with an emphasis on water conservation and avoidance of the use of chemical fertilizers. Tom Doak was selected for this project because of his international recognition for a minimalist approach to design. Tropicalia integrates smart design into the tropical landscape while preserving the region’s rich natural and cultural heritage. The project embodies the philanthropic and social values of the Cisneros Family and represents a model for sustainable luxury tourism in the Caribbean and the world. 3.3 A NAT URAL ESCAPE 3.3.1 CERULEAN COAST LINE Tropicalia is located in the community of Miches of El Seibo province on the southern shores of the Samaná Bay, a world-renowned Marine Mammal Sanctuary where 2,000 humpback whales migrate annually to give birth and mate in its warm waters. The region boasts a diverse ecosystem of beaches, mountains, mangrove forests, jungle, lagoons and rivers. The area is celebrated for its unique natural beauty, including the stunning beaches of Costa Esmeralda and Playa Arriba, the towering Cordillera Oriental, and the tropical prairie landscapes and forests. Los Haitises National Park, just 45 kilometers west of Miches, contains impressive limestone plateaus, conical hills, caverns and an expansive mangrove forest. The Wildlife Refuge Lagunas Redonda and Limón features two beautiful lagoons, which are home to several native plant and animal species. Nearby, La Gina is a lush bay outlined by mangrove and coconut forests, which are preserved by the Dominican government as a species and habitat management area. Other historical and cultural landmarks in El Seibo include the Santa Cruz Church and the Monument for the Battle of Palo Hincado.

Efficiencies (EDGE). Furthermore, coastal setbacks and elevation platforms for buildings ensure that the hotel and residence infrastructure can withstand the consequences of climate change such as increased occurrences of sea level rise and storm surge. EDGE CERTIFICATION To become EDGE certified, Four Seasons Tropicalia will need to achieve a minimum of 20% energy and water savings, as well as 20% savings of embodied energy in materials. To date the Four Seasons Tropicalia design team anticipates up to 50% energy savings largely thanks to passive cooling systems such as green roofs and open corridors. LEED CERTIFICATION Four Seasons Tropicalia is seeking certification under version three (3) of the USGBC’s LEED Green Building Rating System for New Construction. At completion, the project is anticipating LEED Silver certification, corresponding to 50-59 points for sustainable design, construction and operation strategies ranging across seven categories: sustainable sites, water use reduction, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor air quality, innovation and regional priority. LANDSCAPING AS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY VALUES An output of the Critical Habitat Assessment and the Biodiversity Management Plan developed for the project was a complete revision of the species selection for Four Seasons Tropicalia landscape design, by expert botanists in the Dominican Republic. The project’s landscape designers and general contractors will be using this list, which also contributes to biodiversity conservation. 8.

The diversity of the Committee members has brought strength to this corporate governance body. Members include senior level Cisneros executives hailing from a wide variety of roles and backgrounds, in addition to external advisors, which are convened depending on the particular topic and area of expertise that is needed. In November 2018, we held our 13th Sustainability Committee meeting and discussed strategic decisions for the project’s short, medium and long-term development. Given the increasing complexity and technicality we face as we enter the construction phase, we decided that a strategic priority for 2019 is to segregate topics and define separate, but complimentary agendas for three different working groups: The Tropicalia Sustainability Committee, the Communications Committee, and the Fundación Tropicalia Corporate Advisory Committee. 22 23 3.

The camp provides guidance and a constructive yet fun space for young girls to reflect upon their future and encourage them to make timely life choices like staying in school and postponing pregnancy. As girls complete their full four years of participation in SNSI, we hope SNSI has given them the tools and experience to reflect on their future, their rights and their short-, mediumand longterm goals as they enter into their adolescence.
