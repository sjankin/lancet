We want to have the benefits of a joined workplace. For us if has meant a closer collaboration between the administration and warehouse and our social work life has improved a lot for everyone. For our everyday life it means that we are close to each other, we can act and make decisions at a higher paste than earlier. We have also seen cost advantage in our consumption which also counts the consumption of CO2 and hereby a deduction of our CO2 footprint. POMPdeLUX ApS comply with Danish labor legislation and thus we are confident that we have no violation of working environment laws, basic working rules or the right to freedom of association. We have employees on special terms corresponding to one man/year – that’s a positive increase this year. During 2018 we engaged a trainee in our sales department – both to get the positive output of new knowledge but also to take to social responsibility to get young people into the labor market. In 2018 all our employees were offered a new and very attractive private health insurance and a company paid pension In 2018 every employee received training in our defibrillators to make them comfortable with the machine if any accident should occur. Furthermore, many employees joined a two days course in first aid and firefighting. After merging administration and warehouse, all our fire equipment was updated and placed after careful consideration. POMPdeLUX received Elite qualification in our canteen – the best result possible. Like in all the other years we received very few suggestions in 2018 from our whistleblower system and the few claims were all solved. In 2018 86% BV was produced on certificated factories. 79% of these factories are audited. 15% with result A, 5% with B, 47% with C and 12% with D and 7% with SA8000.

POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 9 PROMISES We strive to reduce the impact, which we have worldwide from running our business. Our effort on restricted chemicals has contributed to a general higher awareness of avoiding harmful chemicals in our clothes, zippers and buttons. We are committed to offer our customers as many products as possible with Oeko-Tex standard 100 label or the organic label, GOTS. We are committed to up-hold chemicals legislation and we observe the EU-Reach as a minimum. Furthermore, our chemical code of conduct follows Oeko-Tex 100 class 1 values, even though they are not labeled. Our suppliers are obligated to inform if any production deviate and in which area the deviation is found. We promise to do random chemical tests made by Bureau Veritas. ACTIVITIES We uncover our resources on essential and relevant areas and strive to reduce our consumption pr. employee. An area of focus is our recycling of cardboard, which we increase year by year. In 2012 we developed relevant KPI’s for our environmental effort. Our position on transportation is clear and demands us to prevent from flying clothes from origin to our warehouse in Denmark unless absolutely necessary. Good preparation is the key to the solution in that respect and we endeavor to influence our suppliers to have the same attitude. During the year we started to use railway from Asia as a better alternative to air-transportation. We will still have the focus on our transportation ways in 2019 and will still prefer sea freight. We strive to have as much of our clothes labeled with the health label, Oeko-Tex 100 to create confidence for our consumers. We also support the organic clothing industry by using the GOTS label on as much organic cotton products as possible. We have an organic collection of underwear/nightwear produced according to the international global standard GOTS and in 2018 we have added more products labelled with GOTS. Through our membership in BSCI we have implemented our policies, restricted chemicals program and the BSCI Code of Conduct in our supply chain. Additionally, we try to help our suppliers with working tools, awareness training courses, management manual and make sure that all health and safety issues are understood. We have 100% signed commitments to our restricted chemicals program from suppliers and all our core suppliers have obtained a higher awareness on environmental challenges in general. We perform chemical testing on a random basis every season. Especially we focus on testing new suppliers, new sub-suppliers and new materials. POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 10 “ WE STRIVE TO REDUCE THE WORLDWIDE ­IMPACT, WHICH WE HAVE FROM RUNNING OUR BUSINESS. POMPdeLUX | UN GLOBAL COMPACTCOMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS REPORT | PAGE 11 EFFECT FROM ACTIVITIES POMPdeLUX Aps comply with Danish environmental legislation and thus we are confident that we have no violation of environmental laws in Denmark. In 2018 our measurements of water, heating, electricity and waste are the following: (Pr. worker) 2017 2018 Water in m3 9,8 8,7 Waste in KG 226 425 Cardboard for recycling in KG 895 852 Heating in MWh og m3 9,8 8,8 Electricity in KwH 4469 3420 Transportation by ship/ air/truck 64/21/14/1 % 63/16/8/13 % of BV with Oeko-Tex 100 29% 36% % of BV is cotton according to GOTS 5% 7% % of BV with both Oeko-tex 100 – 3% and GOTS The changes in our measurements of water, heating, and electricity are positive due to two locations in the first 9 months of 2018. At the end of 2018, we have already seen the positive result by running the administration and warehouse together. Our cost advantage in our consumption is falling which also counts the consumption of CO2 which deduct our CO2 footprint. We have seen a little reduction in our recycling of cardboard. The explanation is very clear – we have reduced our buying volume to secure a lower remnant stock after end season. It´s very important that we don´t have any leftovers and we never destroy any garments after end of season. Instead we distribute our stock to our outlet shops, we also donate locally and globally, and the rest we sell to a broker. The increase of waste is caused by moving the warehouse to a new location. In 2018 we had the following grouping of transportation ways: ship 63% air 16% truck 8% railway 13%. In 2018 we have 100% signed commitments to our restricted chemicals program from suppliers. In 2018 we succeed to uphold our promise of increasing the production of products with Oeko-Tex 100 and GOTS certification. We not only managed to increase the production of products with Oeko-tex 100 to 36%, but we also had 7,2% with GOTS. This year we produced 3% with both Oeko-tex 100 and GOTS certification.

PROMISES At POMPdeLUX corruption is not acceptable and we strongly distance ourselves from using bribery or corruption where ever we do business. We strive to influence our suppliers that corruption should be avoided everywhere in their own range of influence. ACTIVITIES We have a clear and unambiguous anti-corruption policy.

We have implemented our policy in our organization and we strive to influence our suppliers and business partners that corruption should be avoided everywhere in their own range of influence. During the year we usually receive presents from our business partners. We collect all these presents and at Christmas time, we make a social event for all employees where a lottery is arranged and the presents are allocated this way. Through our membership of BSCI we have implemented our policies and Code of Conduct in our supply chain. We try to help our suppliers with working tools, awareness training courses, management manual and make sure that all terms are understood. POMPdeLUX also has a whistleblower system for the staff to have an anonymously place to put forward claims or suspicious observations. Our Whistleblower is a key source to innovative information and of course we will still be focused on this topic in the future. EFFECT FROM ACTIVITIES Bribery and corruption is very rare in Denmark due to tradition and strict legislation. We are confident that POMPdeLUX ApS complies with Danish bribery and anti-corruption legislation and thus we have no violation of national laws in our headquarters in Denmark. We believe that our effort on anti-corruption and bribery have raised awareness among our staff. Until now we have never been involved in a legal dispute regarding corruption. In 2018 we had no cases regarding bribery or anti-corruption from the whistleblower scheme, and the few claims we had were solved.
