ENIGMA GROUP 2019 3 THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY Our Performance in 2018 Enigma continued its drive for sustainability and compliance within the parameters of the UN Global Compact principles via integration with verified accreditations such as the current ISO 9001:2015, OHSAS 18001:2007, ISO 14001:2015 ISO 27001 and Achilles. These were secured while undergoing significant ongoing business growth. In March 2018 Enigma also achieved a top rating and highest ever score of 157 points in the Security Industry Authority’s assessment scheme for Approved Contractors. For the second year running Enigma was placed in the top 5% of all UK SIA Approved Security Contractors. Enigma maintained its excellent record in Health and Safety for staff, clients and others affected by our operations. Over the past 12 months Enigma continued to refine its carbon reduction strategy (first implemented in 2010) by introducing more stringent monitoring and control measures in waste reduction, recycling and CO2 output from vehicle/office fuel and energy use. Due to our concerted efforts at carbon reduction initiatives Enigma continued to achieve significant reduction in both waste and carbon emissions relative to the annual increase in business growth. This was achieved partly by an emissions strategy involving more stringent vehicle monitoring; a staff reward system for planning and enacting vehicular mileage reduction; and the strict use (purchase and hire) of green award vehicles. Results show a substantial comparative reduction in Enigma’s overall carbon footprint between 2013 and Dec 2018. We have established a long-term sustainability strategy with positive outcomes to be achieved for all strategic KPIs by 2020 (see end Chart). Objectives for 2019 Today Transparency, Sustainability and Social Responsibility are essential requirements for sound business practice and all-inclusive social and economic growth. Stakeholder demand for accountability and transparency is more prevalent than ever. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is all about addressing such requirements and demands. Our shared UN Global Compact membership helps provide our company with valuable tools and guidance in its quest to satisfy best practice CSR in our daily operations and the strict regulations of the industry in which we operate. The ten principles of the Global Compact also provide a frame of reference with respect to the multifaceted issues of human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. 4 www.enigma-group.com THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT AND SUSTAINABILITY In 2019 Enigma will actively engage its employees and commercial contacts in the implementation of Enigma’s sustainability strategy. The objective is for all stakeholders to share in the responsibility and satisfaction of creating a healthier, more sustainable physical environment and more principled and sustainable social organisation. To assist in this development Enigma will introduce new awareness programmes for employees and commit all stakeholders through the application of Enigma’s Sustainable Supplier Charter. Stringent Carbon Measurements will continue to apply to all aspects of Enigma’s business activities. We will integrate the UNs seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our CSR strategy. We will take steps towards improving interactions with clients, to express our values of corporate social responsibility and to understand their needs and priority values to help accentuate common ground This will also help reinforce the bond with clients and give us the ability to improve our operational and strategic services. Our business is focused on a minimal “environmental footprint”. A more proactive personnel policy and training will make our planners and employees more aware of the impact of their actions on Enigma’s environmental footprint. New personnel will also be expected to have high environmental awareness and personal competencies. As part of our community engagement, we will maintain our arrangements with the Social Landlord and Regenerations Charity in London enabling disadvantaged people to gain valuable employment training and certification via our training partner. Enigma will aim to improve financial support to various youth sporting groups in different regions of the UK. As part of Enigma’s broader commitment to Sustainable Communities, Consumption, Climate Change and Environmental Enhancement, Enigma will extend support to Tree AID, Water Aid and UNICEF’s general health programmes. Tree Aid UK and Water Aid are separate charities which invest heavily in tree planting and providing accessible drinking water for communities on the African continent. UNICEF has a broad range of programmes aimed at the general welfare of children and communities including the WASH programme (WATER, SANITATION, HYGIENE). This programme takes specific aim to provide clean, affordable and accessible water for all impoverished people across the globe. Enigma supports this aim with its charitable donation to UNICEF and its operational commitment to the UN Global Compact. Glen Webley Chief Executive Officer ENIGMA GROUP 2019 5 ENIGMA & THE 10 PRINCIPLES OF THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT Enigma seeks to achieve profitable growth while making the world a better place. To succeed in this mission, Enigma plans its business growth on a comprehensive sustainability strategy which integrates the United Nation’s principles relating to human rights, labour governance, the environment and anti-corruption. Enigma have a clear strategic intent to base our operations on core values and honour obligations towards the communities in which we operate. Certification and industry standards guide our approach and actions. 6 www.enigma-group.com ON HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: B  usiness should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: Business must ensure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. The aim of the Enigma Group is to communicate to all its employees, business connections and communities in which we operate our commitment to respect and uphold human rights. We endeavour to observe and promote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations. The guidelines and conventions of the United Nations and International Labour Organisation on the Rights of the Child are also fundamental to instructing our policy provisions. Commitment • Enigma human rights policy • Enigma Group ethical code for all our suppliers Implementation • Enigma employs a widely diverse workforce who are guaranteed an “equality for all” policy to prevent discrimination in hiring, promotion and work conditions based on race, caste, colour, national origin, sex, age, religion, disability, marital status, actual or perceived sexual orientation, employment status or political affiliation. We endeavour to ensure that employees of sub-contractors and our suppliers have similar guarantees against discrimination. Enigma also expects that all of our employees and those of associated companies are able to work in an environment free of physical, psychological and verbal abuse and harassment, and in an environment free of the threats of such abuse and harassment. • Enigma has a published statement on human rights which is implemented through internal management systems and staff training, both introductory and ongoing. In March 2011 Enigma introduced a formal, periodic revision course for employees with more than 12 months company service. This course is now given to each employee at 12 monthly intervals and covers policy statements and job-specific information. It is to now continuously, along with other training and updates, as required. The course aims to ensure awareness of content and of changes to the initial induction training that all employees are traditionally given at the beginning of their employment. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 7 ON HUMAN RIGHTS • Enigma’s employment handbook and site instruction booklets include all Policy Statements including those based on ethical commitments and legislative requirements. Appropriate procedures for implementation of policy are also comprehensively described. The Policy Statements and Procedures are checked and reviewed on an annual basis or more frequently as necessary to ensure any safety or other compliance issues and legalities are applied and maintained. • Whereas Enigma has long had a broad mix of employees from varying national and ethnic backgrounds, our gender mix was poor due to the traditional male dominance of our core business. In January 2011 we introduced new recruitment procedures which helped to increase the number of female employees from 7% to 13% of the total workforce by mid-2011. This had increased to 19% by March 2014 and to 23% by Mar 2017. • Enigma endeavours to provide enhanced working conditionslegislated and best industry practicesregarding health, safety and comfort, for its employees. It is Enigma’s policy to provide a written Risk Assessment for all work sites and to implement all necessary control measures before workers are allowed on site. Enigma only contracts to clients with appropriate Management, Health Safety & Environmental accreditations and Corporate Social Responsibility/ Sustainability Policies which adhere to Global Compact Principles. • Enigma has implemented a proactive information, advice and complaints structure for through the provision of: a. 24-hour local management contact. b. 24-hour national management contact (through our ARC centre) • To ensure Global Impact principles were incorporated in Enigma’s sustainability strategy and operations, a management committee was established in 2010. The committee is now chaired by our CEO and includes two directors and Enigma’s Compliance Manager. The operational expertise of committee members helps link issues regarding aims of improving work and living conditions for all stakeholders under the umbrella of sustainability. The development of sustainable communities and workforce, best practice health and safety procedures, natural resource protection and environmental enhancement, are the essential priorities. All key business areas are represented at the committee which is given external specialist advice from SSAIB and Achilles. 8 www.enigma-group.com ON HUMAN RIGHTS • Enigma’s ethical code for suppliers highlights all ten principles of the UN Global Compact to which our suppliers are expected to adhere to throughout their operations. Enigma has linked this to the ISO. 9001.2015 quality assurance manual, and is documented, audited and reviewed. See Enigma’s Sustainable Suppliers Charter (below). ENIGMA GROUP 2019 9 ON HUMAN RIGHTS 10 www.enigma-group.com ON LABOUR Principle 3:Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. Principle 4: Business should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. Principle 5: Business should uphold the effective abolition of child labour. Principle 6: Business should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Commitment • Managing equality and diversity policy • Enigma code of conduct • Enigma ethical code of conduct Implementation • Enigma’s written Code of Conduct and Policy Statements provide a clear outline to all employees of policies, procedures and boundaries of various aspects of employment relating to terms, conditions and conduct that must be adhered to. Together they inform that Enigma supports all legislative and applicable common law and regulations concerning an individual’s right to freedom of association and right to Collective Bargaining. They also inform that no employee should be expected to work below national wage and benefit standards, or under forced, unsafe, or unsatisfactory conditions; or that any employee, at any level, should allow anything to compromise their own commitment to Enigma’s health & safety, environment, and social policies. • All employees can access our national ARC centre on a 24hr basis either to request information and advice, or otherwise to report or raise concerns over possible breaches in policy, conduct and other standards. • Enigma provides all staff with a risk assessment (including hazard identification) and an environmental impact assessment for their particular place of employment. These assessments are reviewed at regular intervals with a compulsory minimum 12 Month re-assessment period and comply with British Standards OHSAS 18001:2007 and ISO 14001:2015. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 11 ON LABOUR • Enigma applies quantitative testing in the recruitment process as an antidiscrimination measure. Two tests are given: one for literacy and the other for industry-specific knowledge. They were introduced in 2011 in order to increase objectivity and to help eliminate undesired (including unintentional) discrimination. From the time of introduction there has significant improvement in our female to male staff ratio. Enigma aims to continue this development of greater gender equality in the company and our HR Department has since achieved an even balance of male and female staff. • Enigma through their ISO 9001: 2015 accreditation has asserted minimum expected ethical standards for suppliers through 2010 to June 2018 (See Enigma’s Ethical Code and Sustainable Suppliers Charter). This is documented, audited and reviewed based on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact covering the area of human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, bribery and corruption, and sets out the standards that are expected from all suppliers engaged by Enigma.

Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibilities. Principle 9: Business should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment Enigma Environmental Policy: The environmental objective of Enigma is to provide effective environmental awareness and control, seeking to continually improve all aspects of its environmental performance within its sphere of operation as far as is economically viable. Implementation • Enigma will endeavour to care for the environment through continual review and improvement to working practices relating to environmental impacts. • Enigma will comply with the requirements of relevant legislation and regulations. • Enigma will encourage the efficient use of energy, materials, products and services together with minimising and eliminating pollution and waste wherever possible. • Enigma will apply health and safety considerations throughout all activities. • Enigma will provide employee awareness training in its environmental policy and procedures. • Enigma has established shared environmental objectives with clients and suppliers. • Enigma employees, directors and consultants are required to carefully consider environmental issues when making decisions in the planning, controlling and execution of work for the company. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 13 ON THE ENVIRONMENT • Implementation of sustainable mobility of the workforce and thereby reducing the average journey distance continues to decrease our CO2 footprint. Enigma endeavours to recruit local staff for work locations to reduce travel. For almost a decade Enigma has used “green award” cars for managers, supervisors, and mobile response drivers. These cars which included electronic/fuel hybrids have significantly reduced fuel costs and Enigma’s carbon footprint. • From 2017 Enigma Group will only purchase vehicles of Euro 6 emissions standard or better, with a preference for electric and petrol/electric. New standards expected in 2019 will be adopted • Enigma has operated an intensive office recycling programme for several years. This has led to a now very refined division of all office waste (for example: high grade white paper; mixed white paper; newspaper; coloured paper) and a methodical procedure ensuring an almost 100% recycling score for all recyclable waste materials. • Through a policy change first initiated in 2010, approximately 95% of Enigma employees were receiving information and rota bulletins by email as opposed to post by July 2011. By June 30, 2014 this figure had risen to and maintained at 100% which also includes Employee Pay Slips and Monthly Newsletters. • As part of its carbon reduction initiatives, Enigma established teleconferencing as the default format for management meetings and by June 2014 the 85% target for inter-branch meets was achieved and has since risen to 95% in 2017 • Enigma’s environmental policy implementation will be based on BS. ISO 9001: 2015 and ISO 14001: 2015. • Enigma was first assessed 31st March 2009 for accreditation by Achilles UVDB category B2 and certificated and has been successfully reviewed annually through to 2017 (Supplier number 056588). • Compensating all greenhouse gas emissions emission by annually donating to the foundation “Trees for All”. • Every year in the period 2015 to 2025 the aim for Enigma Group is for an energy consumption drop of 2% per employee. 14 www.enigma-group.com ON THE ENVIRONMENT ANNUAL EMISSIONS GRAPH 2012DEC 2018 UN Global Compact 15 ON THE ENVIRONMENT TABLE: EMISSIONS DATA 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Diesel Used/ 25289 (X 2.583) 25178 (X 2.583) 24880 (X 2.583) 23100 (X 2.583) 22400 (X 2.583) 20356 (X 2.583) Litres = Kg CO2e 65321 KG 65034 KG 64265 KG 59667 KG 57850 KG 52579 KG = Tonnes CO2 65.32 TONNES 65.03 TONNES 64.27 TONNES 59.67 TONNES 57.8 TONNES 52.6 TONNES Petrol Used/ 26588 (X 2.242) 37843 (X 2.242) 30567 (X 2.242) 28600 (X 2.242) 27440 (X 2.242) 25290 (X 2.242) Litres = Kg CO2e 58610 KG 84844 KG 68470 KG 64121 KG 61520 KG 5806 KG = Tonnes CO2 58.61 TONNES 84.84 TONNES 68.47 TONNES 64.12 TONNES 61.52 TONNES 58.0 TONNES Electricity Used 37989 KWH (X.52) 36120 KWH (X.52) 34360 KWH (X.52) 33200 KWH (X.52) 32375 KWH (X.52) 31500 (X .52) = Kg CO2e 19754 KG 18782 KG 17867 KG 17264 KG 16835 KG 16380 KG = Tonnes CO2 19.12 TONNES 18.78 TONNES 17.87 TONNES 17.26 TONNES 16.83 TONNES 16.38 TONNES 16 www.enigma-group.com ANNUAL EMISSIONS DATA NOTES a. The Fuel Emission Conversion Factors used are based on Defra’s Petrol and Diesel used by UNIT VOLUME (per unit litre used of typical bio-fuel blends as sold in the UK), under TOTAL DIRECT GAS HOUSE EMISSIONS (CO2, GH4, N2O) only (also called TAIL PIPE or AT SITE emissions, which exclude emission costs of fuel and car manufacture and distribution). In 2012 the conversion factor given for Diesel was x 2.58 and Petrol x 2.24. (Defra Annex Tables 1b & 6a; also see Calculators National Energy Foundation and Carbon Footprint Ltd for comparable figures). Note that these Conversion Factors differ from those used to determine emissions per km or mile driven per vehicle type and size. b. The Electricity factor 0.52 is obtained from Defra’s tables, as advised, for Converting Purchased Electricity/ Grid Rolling Average, KgCO2e per kWh, Annex Table 3c. Source: Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Guidelines for Defra GHG Conversion Factors for Company Requirements, 2012. Enigma has reduced kWh each year between 2012-13 and 2016-17 Past and Future Strategy: Emissions Defra provide conversion factors for Passenger Road Transport/Units travelled (km and miles) according to car type and size and fuel used. They also provide conversion factors for other modes of transport (air, rail, sea) and road freight.

London Underground and National Rail are shown to produce less GHG per person than car travel for cars occupied by drivers only. Enigma has used this information, similarly available prior to 2012, to assist in deciding purchases of new vehicles (2012/13 and again in 2014 and 2017, as has been required in our expanding business) and in organising travel arrangements between London, Newcastle/Middlesbrough and other areas of the UK. Enhanced teleconference arrangements have also been instituted over the past three years. From Jan 2010 to Dec 2014 Enigma’s Emissions tonnage grew from 110.4 to 150.6 tonnes. Enigma’s car fleet grew from six cars to fourteen in 2014, with additional use of short-term car hire. New eco rated cars were first bought in 2012. Four of the new cars were Medium Toyota Prius Hybrids; five were small diesels (1.3 litre ecoflex active). Enigma made further purchases of Hybrid cars in 2013 and restricted the use of hired cars to eco models. Enigma also introduced a more rigorous analysis of miles and fuel purchases/ fuel types used for all vehicles. The eco cars have significantly impacted on fuel usage and carbon footprint within a period of rapid growth. In spite of significant staff increases and more than doubling of the vehicle fleet in between 2011 and 2017, emissions increase was only around 30% and the office carbon print dropped 10%. The emissions ratio reduction with vehicles continued as expected in 2014-2018 as newer and more efficient technology and car usage was deployed. In fact, emissions fell across the board this past year, with lower usage of both diesel and petrol, in spite of only a very slight drop in mileage. In the future petrol hybrids or electric will be favoured over diesel due to recent research on diesel pollutants and government policies advocating against diesel engines.

Enigma made further purchases of Hybrid cars in 2013 and restricted the use of hired cars to eco models. Furthermore, in April 2016, a new fleet of cars were purchased by Enigma – 2 x Kia Sportage’s and 2 x Kia Cee’ds – these cars are specifically designed to be more economical and fuel efficient as part of the ECO dynamics model range. The key to Eco Dynamics is the state-of-the art Intelligent ‘Stop and Go’ technology, which switches off the engine whenever the car is stationary, cutting down on fuel usage and CO2 emissions. The cars also have energy saving tyres which reduce fuel usage through less road friction, the gearshift indicator advises on the most fuel-efficient points to change gear ensuring minimal engine wear and tear. Finally, the Kia Cee’d and Sportage models were produced in Zilina, Slovakia; Kia’s first European plant: which meets the highest environmental standards at every stage of the manufacturing process. Enigma also introduced a more rigorous analysis of miles and fuel purchases/fuel types used for all vehicles. The eco cars have significantly impacted on fuel usage and carbon footprint within a period of rapid growth.

Commitment • Enigma Code of Conduct. Due to its primary involvement in the security industry business Enigma, as both a company organisation and a group of people, has a duty to fulfil strict legal and social obligations relating to all forms of corruption and illegality. This duty is accepted in accord with the underlying principles and technical requirements of both UK and internationally acclaimed law. Implementation • Enigma’s Code of Conduct addresses issues of bribery and corruption. As detailed in the Enigma Employment Handbook & the Enigma Instruction Manuals, employees are both protected and encouraged to raise concerns about possible or known acts of corruption. Legal protection is assured under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. In 2012 a whistle blower policy and system was implemented. Hereby our employees are provided with a possibility to raise, protected from reprisals of retaliation, (anonymous) serious and/or sensitive concerns. In 2017 the number of grievances related to corruption were zero. • As a provider of both manned and CCTV security services Enigma carries a great deal of responsibility in the management of public behaviour and Data Protection. Enigma staff are expected to act with enhanced sensibility and unquestionable integrity at all times. In Feb 2018 Enigma Group obtained a Certificate of Assurance in the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme • Enigma is often obliged to carry out internal investigations and provide reports for incidents of suspected criminality involving the property and viability of businesses belonging to clients. These incidents generally involve theft and unlawful property damage but may also include forms of corruption including trade in illegal services and also stolen and/or counterfeit goods. See Table B for percent of incidents resolved to the satisfaction of both Enigma and Client. Note that this past year has also proved very satisfying in terms of increased business with reduced Incidents of Suspected Criminality being reported.

As part of this objective Enigma has aligned its growth model with that described in the UN’s Global Goals for Sustainable Development and the UK Government’s Sustainability Development Strategy. This Sustainable Growth Model focuses on four priority areas: • Sustainable communities and workforce • Natural resource protection and environmental enhancement • Climate change and energy • Sustainable consumption and production Enigma intends to deliver more sustainable solutions for its people, customers and the wider community and environment in which we all work and live. Our strategy reflects our commitment to ensuring sustainability is paramount in all aspects of our business but particularly the impact in the four priority areas. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 23 THE FOUR PRIORITY AREAS 1. SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: “We will be good neighbours who engage with, work with, and support our local communities. We will create an excellent workplace where our people are respected, motivated and competent, and where excellence in Health & Safety is our goal.” 1.1 Health and Safety Through the way we work and behave all our people and stakeholders will be protected from the risks of occupational injury and ill health. 1.2 Our People We will attract, develop and retain the best people and promote diversity in a way that underpins our values. We will ensure equal opportunities and gender equality, end discrimination and create a happy and motivated workforce. 1.3 Community By engaging, respecting and understanding our community stakeholders we will aim to make a positive contribution to everyone’s environment and quality of life. 2. N  ATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT: “We will our impact on environment through the prudent use responsibly manage of natural resources, minimising waste and by protecting and enhancing the environment in which we work and live.” 2.1 Environmental Impacts We will not pollute or contaminate land or water and will manage our waste responsibly. We will seek to enhance and improve the environment where possible through good design and management. 2.2 Bio Diversity We will endeavour to understand and manage our biodiversity impacts and seek opportunities for all forms of wildlife and their habitats. 24 www.enigma-group.com NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION & ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT 2.3 Supply Chain We will work with our supply chain to deliver mutually sustainable solutions that deliver value for money. 2.4 Resource Use We will do “more with less” by maximising resource efficiency in planning, design, waste minimisation and recycling. 3. CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY “We will work to reduce our impact on climate change by minimising all our uses of energy.” 3.1 Atmospheric Impacts We will actively reduce our use of energy and emissions of greenhouse in transport use, design, maintenance and operations of our facilities. 3.2 Design Sustainability will be a key objective of our designs. We will achieve excellence in life-cycle design and exceed our customer expectations by delivering more cost effective, sustainable solutions. 4. SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION “We will work with our customers and suppliers to achieve “more with less” through more efficient use of human and material resources, considering life cycle impacts, and delivering profitable yet sustainable and environmentally beneficial outcomes”. 4.1 Value and Risk We will improve our business margins and create shareholder value in a sustainable way. We will be recognised as leader in the way we understand and manage our risk profile. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 25 4. SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION 4.2 Customer We will aim to be renowned for understanding and exceeding our customer expectations; and for responding rapidly to their demands for more sustainable solutions. 4.3 Governance We will be recognised as a company which applies its values to all its activities and one that demonstrates an ethical approach across all areas of corporate responsibility. As part of Enigma’s broader commitment to Sustainable Communities, Consumption, Climate Change and Environmental Enhancement, Enigma has become a contributor to Tree AID, Water Aid and UNICEF’s general water and health programmes. Tree Aid UK and Water Aid are separate charities which invest heavily in tree planting and community water access on the African continent. UNICEF has a broad range of programmes aimed at the welfare of children and families but also aims to provide clean, affordable and accessible water for all people across the globe. WASH is the UNICEF Programme which stands for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene. Due to their interdependent nature, these three core issues are grouped together to represent a growing sector. While each a separate field of work, each is dependent on the presence of the other. UNICEF’s work in water focuses particularly on issues pertaining to children in their ability to access clean, safe water, and the journey they must take to collect it. World-wide, some estimated 700 million people are still without access to clean drinking water particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (though not restricted this area), yet solutions can be relatively simple and inexpensive. Both WaterAid UK and UNICEF are at the forefront of exploring innovative ways to access sustainable, affordable water while building a climate resistant infrastructure. 26 www.enigma-group.com 4. SUSTAINABLE CONSUMPTION Reducing evaporation at water points and piping water from clean local and distant sources is a standard solution. Finding groundwater as opposed to surface water is increasingly being developed as new techniques allow easier access to groundwater which is less likely to become contaminated than surface water. Although often subject to poor management and over-extraction UNICEF has developed a series of Groundwater Programming and Drilling Principles to ensure how to best site and develop new water points. Household water treatment (for example chlorination or filtration), along with improved water storage and handling, is another control measure to ensure safe water use inside the household and is this is widely supported by WaterAid UK and UNICEF. For sanitation, UNICEF works to ensure access and use of basic toilets and ways to separate human waste from contact with people. One important area of work for sanitation is to facilitate community-led initiatives to build, maintain and use basic toilets and prevention of cross contamination with water supplies. UNICEF’s work in hygiene is aimed at nurturing good hygiene practices, especially handwashing with soap. Although it sounds simple, this act is essential to prevent disease and the health of children. As part of its broad commitment to Sustainable Growth Enigma also contributes to TREE AID UK. TREE AID is a UK registered charity which works to create thriving, sustainable communities throughout the isolated and remote regions of Africa. It works with locally-based teams in the drylands of Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali and Niger and the isolated areas of Ethiopia, working with communities to build skills, knowledge and self-reliance. Since 1987 TREE AID has helped people in the drylands of Africa to lift themselves out of poverty and protect their environment. People here live in some of the toughest conditions on earth and trees are essential to their survival. Trees provide nutrition, generate income and help to create a healthy environment. TREE AID works with local communities to help them protect and grow trees, for themselves and for future generations. TREE AID has planted 14 million trees across the drylands of Africa with hundreds of thousands more trees being naturally regenerated through improvements in natural resource management. Over 1,000,000 villagers have directly benefitted from TREE AID’s work, meaning better health, education and life chances. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 27 4.

It was chaired by the CEO and included the senior management team with advice given by external specialist organisations who had links to the UK government’s Sustainability Development Commission and the UN Global Compact. The SSAIB is also used to gain advice through their Business Leaders Forum in which key players meet regularly to share best practice information and to develop sustainability plans and objectives for Enigma. The Sustainability Management Committee refined the company’s strategic direction and targets using input from all operational groups within the company. To help clarify the company’s sustainability policy vision a long-term strategy model was developed to illustrate the links between Key Performance Indicators and Enigma’s Corporate Objectives. After several intensive discussions thirteen key performance indicators (KPI’s) were established by the committee to measure progress and an independent audit procedure was set up. This was via external auditors using our BS 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 systems. See the Enigma Chart below: Value through Sustainability & Strategic KPI’s. Our strategy will be delivered by: • Generating a culture that actively encourages and communicates best sustainable practices. • Ensuring the real involvement of all our people, our supply chain and stakeholders in the broadest world-wide perspective. • Conducting our business in accordance with our core values of openness, collaboration, mutual dependency, professional delivery, innovation, sustainable and profitable growth. Health & Safety and Company Sustainability As part of Enigma’s integrated approach to sustainability, a management-based Health & Safety cultural assessment was incorporated in its strategy as part of a structured framework with which to assess Health and Safety across Enigma’s business. This assessment continues to form the structure for driving Health and Safety improvements, including those in Enigma’s supply chain. The assessment is based on four key elements: • Awareness: “All our people and stakeholders have an awareness and understanding of Health & Safety hazards and risks that affect our people and business”. ENIGMA GROUP 2019 29 HEALTH & SAFETY AND COMPANY SUSTAINABILITY • Competence: “All our people and stakeholders have the competence to undertake their work with minimum risks to Health and Safety”. • Compliance: “Our work activities achieve compliance with legislation, and our people are empowered to take action to minimise Health and Safety risks”. • Excellence: “Enigma is recognised for excellence in the way it manages Health and Safety”. These four elements of Awareness, Competence, Compliance and Excellence form the framework for Enigma to: • Facilitate the management of Health and Safety excellence. • Communicate the Health and Safety policy, objectives, procedures, guidance, plans and performance. • Realise and maintain continuous improvement in Health and Safety performance. • Ensure compliance with all relevant Health and safety legislation. • Fulfil the structural requirements of OHSAS 18001: Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Specifications. 30 www.enigma-group.com COMPANY SUSTAINABILITY AIMS & STRATEGY ENIGMA SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY CHART UN Global Compact 31 COMPANY SUSTAINABILITY AIMS & STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY: STRATEGIC KPIS RESULTS & TARGETS PRIORITY IMPACTS MEASURES 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 AREAS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS SUSTAINABLE Health & Safety Complete monthly & yearly 78% 92% 100% 100% 100% COMMUNITIES training/ assessments & (ACCE) WORKFORCE Reportable accidents and 0.04 0.04 0.02 0.02 .01 incidents (520,000 manhours) Our People Employee turnover based 8% 6% 5% 5% 4% on voluntary leavers Employee satisfaction 83% 88% 95% 95% 96% ratings : High & Above Grievances raised of an 7 Cases 5 Cases 0 2 Cases 0 ethical nature: internal/ external Equality & Diversity Policy Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Implemented Community Donations made to Local £1000 £1450 +20% £2,300 £3550 Communities Engagement: Support 30 Placements 36 42 44 44 Training for Disadvantaged People Participation Charity Walks £400 £480 +20% £700 £1080 32 www.enigma-group.com COMPANY SUSTAINABILITY AIMS & STRATEGY SUSTAINABILITY: STRATEGIC KPIS RESULTS & TARGETS PRIORITY IMPACTS MEASURES 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 AREAS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS RESULTS NATURAL Environmental Percentage of sustainability 76% 85% 95% 95% 96% RESOURCE Impacts targets achieved PROTECTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL Biodiversity Percentage of contracts/ 81% 89% 100% 100% 100% ENHANCEMENT clients with Environmental Biodiversity Policies Supply Percentage of suppliers with 90% 95% 100% 100% 100% ISO 14001 Resource Use Follow our resource plans 74% 85% 100% 100% 100% CLIMATE CHANGE Atmospheric CO2 reduction by revenue 10% 14% 20% 16% 12% AND ENERGY Impacts (fuel, energy) Av.

This easily leads to confusion even when people are heading in the same direction. Enigma uses the ideas and practices of sustainable development throughout the Company but increasingly the term Corporate Social Responsibility is being used in the business world.
