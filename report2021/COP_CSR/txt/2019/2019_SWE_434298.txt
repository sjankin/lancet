SSM – ANNUAL REPORT 2018 | 1 The leading developer of smart & affordable homes SSM’s vision is to open the housing market to as many people as ­possible. The focus is on developing homes for tomorrow’s urbanites – people looking for affordable, well-planned apartments. Homes that are smart rather than cramped. SSM builds innovative and creative solutions into every square meter in homes located close to public transport and the pulse of the city. This is summed up in SSM’s motto: Smaller spaces. Larger living. 08 focus on Greater Stockholm SSM focuses on what is known as the 08 area (Greater Stockholm). More than 25 percent of people employed in Sweden work in this region, which is the country’s job and growth engine. At the same time, there is a significant housing shortage. The people who have the hardest time finding a home are inhabitants with average or low incomes, or those who have recently moved to the area. 20-44 tomorrow’s urbanites SSM focuses on urbanites. These are people between the ages of 20 and 44 who live in one and two-person households. They prioritize living in an urban environment with good public rail transport. At the same time, they want to have more money to spend after they’ve paid the rent. 2 | SSM – ANNUAL REPORT 2018 >75 Urban Score in all projects Urban Score is a transparent index developed by SSM to make it easier for homebuyers to make informed housing choices. It also shows the strategic direction of SSM’s housing concept. The index measures mobility, everyday services, ­community and well-being. SSM’s projects are designed to have an Urban Score higher than 75 points. 50:50 a well-balanced mix ~2 MSEK indicates focus SSM’s strategic goal is for 70 percent of its cooperative apartments to be priced at about 2.0 MSEK.

At year-end, SSM had more than 1,171 for an apartment in the county.

In 2018, the Swedish government set a goal for 2030 that 25 percent of all new employees in the construction industry should be women. SSM’s recruiting process is focused on skills and experience, but it also strives to create a workplace characterized by diversity. The company uses various approaches to attract more women. SSM also strives to achieve a good gender and age distribution and does not accept situations where any of its employees, customers, cooperative partners, suppliers or others are subjected to any form of degrading differential treatment.

SSM’s share is listed in the Small Cap segment and in the Real Estate sector index. PRICE TREND 2018 was another volatile year for the Stockholm Stock Exchange. After a quiet first half year, the summer was weak followed by a widespread decrease in share prices. The OMX Stockholm fell by 14.3 percent during the last quarter of the year and for the full year 2018, the decline was -7.7 percent. The sector index for real estate companies, OMX Real Estate, showed positive development and ended the year 9.7 percent higher as investors sought out less cyclical and more stable companies. There were differ­ ences between the various sub-sectors within the index: the shares of property management companies rose while housing developers showed weaker performance.
