In addition, some initiatives mentioned refer to the first half of 2019. THIS REPORT CONTAINS TWO PARTS: PART I Provides a short overview about APCO, including our 2018 – 2019 organizational profile and our approach to governance, responsible business and citizenship. PART II Covers our policies, programs and actions to promote the UNGC’s 10 Principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. This section uses the Active level template provided by the UNGC. A global cross-functional team was responsible for developing this report, which was reviewed and approved by the Chair of APCO’s Responsible Business Committee and by our Executive Chairman and CEO. INTRODUCTION 4 PART I About APCO APCO Worldwide is an advisory and advocacy communications consultancy helping leading public and private sector organizations act with agility and build organizational reputations, brands, relationships and solutions to succeed. As APCO enters its 35th year of operating, we celebrate our status as an independent and majority women-owned business and, most importantly, a trusted partner to our clients. We help them anticipate, plan, execute and secure impact through our curiosity, insights and diverse expertise. APCO is the only major consultancy of its kind headquartered in Washington, D.C., serving clients in more than 80 markets around the world. Our 769 permanent employees (as of December 31, 2018) operating in almost 30 offices globally come from diverse professional backgrounds, including corporate, creative and digital experts, former government officials, elected leaders, ambassadors, journalists, business and nonprofit executives and market researchers. APCO secured its independence in 2004 after more than a decade as an affiliate of Grey Global Group. Since its inception in 1984, it has grown from a small one-office firm to a diverse global advisory firm servicing high-profile clients with mostly organic growth. APCO’s revenue has more than doubled since obtaining its independence in 2004. In 2017, APCO retained its independence through a buyout of its minority shareholders with the support of Citibank and Monroe Capital. The arrangement provides the potential for additional capital, which APCO can use for growth, acquisitions and continued innovation to meet the changing demands of the marketplace and to better service clients. This renewed commitment to independence is another step in APCO’s unique story and an exciting opportunity to continue to build a first-rate firm for the future. PART I 5 Mission & Values In the first quarter of 2017, APCO launched its APCO’S VALUES revitalized mission and in 2018 updated its values to better encompass the foundational aspects that drive the work we do. Through regular communications and engagement across regions and practices, employees gained a new perspective on the importance of APCO’s mission and the values that employees adhere to in order to achieve APCO’s goals. APCO’S MISSION In a rapidly evolving global context and a time of transformational change, APCO strives to add value to our clients’ enterprises and benefit society. We enable clients to achieve their objectives through insightful counsel, compelling narratives and creative solutions.

A Diversity and Inclusion Council was created in 2018 in North America to build a more diverse and inclusive environment at APCO and to represent and promote the firm’s values.

Business Air Miles APCO’s business air miles have been consistent with previous years. The nature of APCO’s business as a global consulting firm often requires employees to be onsite with clients. APCO would not be able to deliver as impactful or effective work without sending employees on business travel. However, APCO has attempted to minimize business air miles for internal meetings by installing an advanced video and web conference service, Zoom, in conference rooms across the company. APCO is committed to utilizing these resources to the fullest extent and reducing the footprint for internal collaboration moving forward.
