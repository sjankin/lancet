Sustainability Report 2019 Our founder, Nobuo Ishibashi (1921–2003) 1955 Everything started with this Our Founder’s Spirit Don’t do things because they will make a profit, but because they will be of service to society. “Don’t start off from the thought: ‘What can I do that will make a profit?’ A company is a public organ of society, and we must ask ourselves what kind of product – or what kind of business – will be of use to the world around us and make people happy.” The above is what Nobuo Ishibashi, the founder of Daiwa House Industry, often used to say to the Company’s employees. This is the concept from which the Daiwa House Group started. 001 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 2005 − 50th Anniversary − Guided by our founder’s spirit Group’s symbol message Creating Dreams, Building Hearts The Daiwa House Group symbol—the Endless Heart— represents our vision of building endless emotional connections with each and every one of our customers, as well as the solidarity of the Daiwa House Group. As a Group that co-creates value for individuals, communities and people’s lifestyles, we aim to think outside the box and always to create new value in each successive generation. We will continue to pass on the ideals on which the Company was founded, and work to help realize a sustainable society. DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 002 Business Philosophy Guided by Our Founder’s Spirit Purpose of Publication Our founder, Nobuo Ishibashi, firmly believed in the idea of “contributing to society through business,” when he created the Daiwa House Group in 1955. Since then, for more than half a century, the Daiwa House Group has grown as a company that contributes to society through business. Our Group has responded to the needs of the society through multiple generations and, in 2005, in line with the celebration of the 50th anniversary, adopted “Endless Heart” as a Groupwide symbol of the founding principle and managerial philosophy to realize our goal of a sustainable society where people can live with passion. To realize management sustainability, our Group has divided the Sustainability Report 2019 (hereafter “this report”) by three purposes. ① Accomplish accountability: As a group that maintains the stance of Co-creating a Brighter Future, we will take accountability for contributions to society and the environment as well as reduction in environmental impacts through business. ② Acquire appropriate third-party evaluations: We will disclose information based on requests from stakeholders who are particularly interested in corporate ESG, including corporate assessment agencies, long-term investors, NGOs, and experts. We especially understand that ESG assessment items of corporate assessment agencies are “a collection of the expectations and demands of a global society and stakeholders,” and are aiming to acquire appropriate evaluations. ③ Utilization for improvements in management: As part of the “third-party checks” that we use in the PDCA cycle of management, we make improvements by implementing the points cited in third-party ESG evaluations and dialogues reported herein. We feed back the results of ESG evaluations through important meetings to persons in the company like the sustainability representatives from each department who were involved in the preparation of this report, in addition to the key officers who have close relationships with stakeholders, the Executive Officer in charge of the Environment, department managers and others who were interviewed for this report.

However, teachings both inside and outside the company like a storyduring my years at the helm, I was fortunate to have the teller and making sure our “products and services were useful support of our various stakeholders, to note first and foremost and liked by people.” The founder forever etched his perspective our many customers, our shareholders and investors, of work and life into my thoughts when he made the statement business partners and our employees.

Having inherited the founder’s dream of building practicing the founder’s spirit our group into a “10 trillion yen-a-year business by our 100th anniversary” and, to the best of my abilities, steered the When the founder was battling illness at a retreat house in group to do good for this world as a public organ of society, Noto, Ishikawa during his later years, a few others and I paid we grew into a business with over 4 trillion yen in sales him a visit.

After that first visit, I made overnight trips to see him almost ■ Pursuing our mission “The company is a monthly, during which I listened to what the founder thought public institution of society.” about the company’s future and I expressed what I thought. What he imparted to me in those discussions has helped to I became strongly aware of the point and purpose of develop the Daiwa House Group into what it is today for as much managing a business like a “public organ of society” in 1993 as I have tried to spread that message through the group. when I was appointed president of Daiwa Danchi and tasked To show for that, the “six criteria for decision-making” with reconstructing our then-affiliate. When the founder, that we codified when I became president embody the then in the role of an advisor, called me in and entrusted me founder’s thinking. In a nutshell, all business decisions are with the reconstruction, he said, “This is actually my job, but based on whether or not the outcome down the road will be in the condition I’m in, I want you to handle it.” Knowing the good for the company and our employees, our customers business difficulty that Daiwa Danchi was in, I was hesitant and shareholders, and society in general. This is how we to take on such a heavy responsibility, but the founder, who thought instinctively back in the day, but this train of thought was straddled with health issues at the time, lectured me came from our founder. about how “rebuilding the business was our responsibility Another practical application of the founder’s belief in because the company is a public institution of society,” so I “being useful and liked by people” is the “Asu Fukaketsuno” prepared myself mentally for the challenge.

Reason being, our founder left us a wonderful book titled “The Future of the Daiwa House Group.” Current president Keiichi ■ Our strength lies in our adherence to the Yoshii and all the executives and employees have read it, bottom-up approach learned from it and are applying what it says to their work every day. Fortunately, we are performing well. And, if I were asked to For example, if they run into a wall on something, they can cite a particular reason for our success, it would have to be return to the book and find a solution to their problem as if the the bottom-up approach we have developed since our founder was talking directly to them. founding.

They were learn and refresh their understanding of our mission “the covered in dust and worn thin. He then said, “As many times company is a public institution of society” by reading up on as it takes, get on your feet and get out there. Sales are about the founder’s thoughts from time to time. Moreover, it spells footwork.” His words were loaded with strong convictions the out how to go about business almost as if it foresees the founder held about business. future, and simply explains the path to “10 trillion yen in annual Visit the sites you are in charge of to know the situation. sales by our 100th anniversary.” Before buying a lot, walk the area. If construction is underway, In recent years, employees working at our overseas bases check the work out to make sure there are no problems. All issues and answers are found at the site. Check the project out with your own eyes, think about the issues and, once you find a solution, promptly take action. Though all of this seems obvious, the source of our company’s strength lies in the importance we place on seeing the actual site, product and situation, which is the bottom-up approach I speak of. Not only will the way we focus on this bottom-up approach continue to serve us going forward but, as business expands both in content and scale and in Japan and overseas as well, its importance is likely to grow more and more. ■ Human resource development is the biggest key to growth going forward More than anything else, human resources are essential to the future growth aspirations of our Group. Because of the particularly heavy influence on growth they have, those at the top of the pyramid must have a clear vision of the future and explain it in easy enough language to understand so that it permeates throughout the entire organization. Needless to say, programs that can produce as many of these human resources as possible are crucial. Recognizing the importance of human resource development, managers of our company spend half of their time training and grooming the staff whose work they oversee. I am confident that, by developing human resources who ambitiously seek 009 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 solutions to the social challenges ahead, our Group can grow And, in addition to that, you need a little bit of “luck.” But, you one or even two times over. have to realize that “luck” is not something that happens by Of course, training someone is never easy.

The communities we build are not finished when the infrastructure and structures are in place. Those communities must be happy places for all of the people who live and work there, Employees and the wildlife it contains.

Koji Harano Therefore, we go into a local community prepared to stay on a semi-permanent basis and intent on listening to all sorts of opinions from the local residents and providing area management. Moreover, no longer does a single company go about developing a community on its own. In this era of open innovation, NPOs and businesses Customers from other industries are involved from the planning stage, because it is necessary to increase not just the property values but also the community value. In our 6th Medium-Term Management Plan, we position our Livness Town Projects as strategic business and, in our Social Medium-Term Plan, list “promoting social inclusion in real-estate development” as a priority issue.

Fitting in and sharing common ground are the first steps to “co-creating a brighter future,” so acting straight-up and forthcoming is important toward establishing and maintaining good relationships. The same applies to community development. Local Communities The realization of a sustainable community where residents can lead safe comfortable lives over the long-term requires an extended open dialogue with all stakeholders that builds trust between them and the Daiwa House Group. ■ Hearing from residents ■ Stakeholder meetings Because of the massive size of the Neopolis new town we developed On March 6, 2019, we hosted governmental officials, experts in urban Shareholders in the 1960s, we created opportunities to dialogue with residents by planning and university professors for discussions on the theme of launching a community development committee and council.

To explore effective ways and means to solve these issues, we launched Miki Municipal Organization for Promoting an Ageless Active Community as a cooperative project between industry, government, academia and residents. CSR Management The Midorigaoka Neopolis that we developed in the 1960s is facing similar problems, so, since April 2017, we have been conducting validation as a prelude to re-tilling the new town as a model community. This validation serves toward building a sustainable, multigenerational and recycling-based community where, despite the aging factor, residents can lead rewarding lives and relocate to other units in the community that are more appropriate to their life stage, and new residents can live peacefully and comfortably. The findings and other matters learned from this validation will be applied to other large subdivisions facing similar problems, in the future. Customers The community Midorigaoka Neopolis aspires to be 3 Support for comfortable living including the option to Employees relocate to other units in the community to match one’s stage in life As community residents get older, they would have the option of relocating from a single-family house to housing with assisted-living services that would make life Business Partners easier for them. Nearby would be a place where they can work or take part in activities, which allows them to lead healthy, rewarding and joyful lives, and fosters a sense of community at the same time. Moreover, the units left vacant by residents who move out would be renovated for modern lifestyles to encourage young households to move in. Furthermore, since the suburban location requires a vehicle to get anywhere, a Local Communities shuttle service with self-driving community-owned vehicles would transport residents who no longer drive around the community and to the nearest train stations and bus stops so that residents find it easy to go shopping, etc. So, the goal is to redevelop the complex into a sustainable community where people can live comfortably well into the future.

So, they worked with other departments and crafted a new plan with 16 priority issues that had been selected based on our Long-Term Visions (Management Vision and Long-Term Social Vision) and major trends that would continue to 2030 and have a considerable impact on the 6 bases of improvement. The priority issues and KGIs (Key Goal Indicators) proposed by the working group were submitted to the Corporate Governance Committee where they were discussed and approved as the Social Medium-Term Plan.

The layout and design ideas incorporated into the “Kaji (Chore) Share House” are aimed at reducing the burden of housework by making it easy for everyone in the house to do chores. For the 10-year period from 2008 to 2017, the number of twoLocal Communities income households in Japan increased about 17.5% to 11.88 million*1. Between 1985 and 2018, the percentage of women among all employees rose from 35.9% to 45.0%*1, and has been increasing year by year. With more women in the workplace, society looks forward to increasing achievements by women. Meanwhile, the sharing of housework with men doing the chores to lighten the load on women in the home has become more prevalent. Still, the average amount of time men spend per day on housework in Japan is 28 minutes*2, less than one fourth*2 the time spent by Shareholders their counterparts in the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Many consider such little help to be no help at all to women. Considering such social conditions, we put together a project Internal view of the Future Labo facility team with primary input from female employees, and conducted an in-house questionnaire survey. The questionnaire found not only that women do far more housework than men, but that a gender gap in the view of housework caused frustration for women. These results gave rise to the idea that specific household chores should not be Environment divided up, but that everyone in the family should understand what the chores are, talk to each other about them, and share them. We thus incorporated into house design this idea of “chore sharing” and have been selling these specially designed houses with wellconsidered layout and unique design ideas throughout Japan. This type of single-family house helps to reduce the amount of housework performed by women, enabling women to take more Third-Party Assessment / active roles in society at a time when the Japanese government itself is promoting women’s participation and advancement in the workplace as a national project.

As SDGs, another global environmental initiative comparable to the Paris Agreement, made the top priority issue includes climate change as a matter to be addressed, it is a matter of importance closely related to other matters. Each country has increased its efforts to address climate change The Daiwa House Group, as a corporate citizen, recognizes according to the Paris Agreement, which was adopted in December how important these issues are, working on them actively and 2015 and the movement is being accelerated in response to the systematically. Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5˚C released by the IPCC* We formulated in 2016 “Challenge ZERO 2055,” a long-term last year. In addition, frequent extreme weather such as torrential environmental vision that focuses on “harmony with the natural rainfall, severe heat, and typhoons has spread awareness about environment,” “conservation of natural and water resources,” 141 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 Contribution to SDGs “prevention of chemical pollution” as well as the top priority issue “slowing and adapting to climate change.” In the course of the vision, concrete targets and plans are set nearly every three years as the EGP (endless green program), which is promoted at the Groupwide level. In EGP 2018 (fiscal 2016 to 2018), we took our environmental initiatives under the concept of promoting integrated environmental management within our Group and globally based on the life cycle approach to ensure that corporate profitability can coexist with environmental sustainability. At the same time, we acquired the SBT certification, an international initiative, for greenhouse gas emissions reduction to be consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2˚C temperature target. In addition, we joined EP100 and RE100, international initiatives for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy use, respectively, ZEH-standard xevoΣ PREMIUM as the first-ever company in the world from the construction industry, accelerating activities in terms of a mediumto long-term vision. Principal accomplishments of our business activities include Royal Home Center Tsushima Branch (Aichi), the first-ever largescale ZEB store, which has been in operation since 2016, and Daiwa House Saga Building (Saga), a power self-sufficient building which was completed in 2018 and has been fully powered by renewable energy on a trial basis since then. Regarding housing products, in addition to expanding ZEH, we are promoting advanced community development by applying such technologies as energy self-sufficient housing, electricity interchanging, and ZET to SECUREA Toyota Kakimoto (Aichi), Takao SAKULa CITY (Tokyo), and Toyama City Safe and Smart Model City Block (Toyama). For construction-related products, we have worked on performance improvement in D’s SMART series including environmentally-friendly office “D’s SMART OFFICE” and environmentally-friendly factory “D’s SMART FACTORY,” winning many customers’ favor. In addition, in fiscal 2018, we declared Electricity self-sufficient office “Daiwa House Saga Building” further engagement in such environmental activities, and were certified by the Ministry of the Environment as an Eco First Company by being an environmentally-advanced company in the housing and construction industry. * IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change): An organization that was founded by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and provides reports on scientific findings about climate change. The new Action Plan for the Environment accelerates integrated “decarbonization” within our Group and globally EGP2021 (fiscal 2019 to 2021), a new Action Plan for the Environment that is launched this year, is going to further promote “Zero Carbon” in terms of products and monozukuri to achieve SBT, EP100, and RE100. “Eco First Company” certification ceremony In addition to promoting ZEH in housing products and ZEB in construction-related products, we are going to engage in new types of community development based on the combined form of energy saving, creation, and accumulation for the combined development for which our Group capitalizes on our strength of having a wide DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 142 Co-creating a Brighter Future with the Environment range of business domains.

In addition, we will reinforce the environmental management Besides, having announced our support for TCFD last system within our Group and globally as illustrated in the promotion September, we are going to discuss how to deal with climateof environmental information disclosure, the development of related financial disclosures recommended by TCFD in its final environmental education, and the introduction of an IT-based report. environmental law management system. On the other hand, our Group regards national and international In order to incorporate “carbon-free” and other environmental trends in environmental challenges including climate change as big risk reduction activities into supply chains, we will cooperate with business opportunities. The construction-related business, which our business partners for our mutual benefits by setting greenhouse accounts for more than 80% of our Group’s sales, is closely linked gas emissions reduction targets and promoting sustainable to the climate change issue in terms of energy consumption. procurement of timber. Increased awareness about environmental challenges and tightening of laws and regulations encourage the introduction of buildings of high environmental performance, therefore, we aim to ensure business superiority by actively working on products of high environmental performance. In addition, given that climate change is a globally shared issue, products of high environmental performance and environment-conscious real estate development can be key “weapons” for our overseas business. By improving our environmental brand through the promotion of such actions and the pursuit of international initiatives such as SBT, EP100, RE100, and TCFD, we aim to realize corporate profitability coexisting with environmental sustainability and contribute to our management vision “Build a world in which people can lead fulfilled lives.” DREAM Solar Yamagata Mogami BiVi Senriyama 143 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 Long-Term Environmental Vision The Daiwa House Group aims to realize a sustainable society as a group that co-creates value for individuals, communities, and lifestyles and tries to make “zero” environmental impacts within our Group, globally, and through supply chains. Our Group formulated the long-term environmental vision “Challenge ZERO 2055” in fiscal 2016, focusing on 2055, which marks the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Daiwa House Industry.

When attending COP23 the next year, we witnessed the world begin to shift to decarbonization, reaffirming our determination to accelerate our efforts to realize a carbon-free society. Amid such a global trend, one notable accomplishment of EGP2018 was to position “carbon-free” as one of the key management issues, promoting a long-term goal for it internally and externally. This goal allowed us to acquire the SBT certification as an ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction target that was consistent with the Paris Agreement’s 2˚C temperature target. We set a long-term goal for energy saving and renewable energy as well, joining EP100 and RE100 simultaneously as the first-ever company Environment in the world from the housing and construction industry. Besides, as environmental products, we developed energy self-sufficient houses and power self-sufficient offices, engaging in validation experiments for them. As another accomplishment of ESG, continued due diligence and supplier engagement for the legality and Katsuhiro Koyama sustainability of timber our Group procures are being established as a means of addressing escalating Manager of Environment Department deforesting risks. As for information disclosure and communication, in order to have it known that Technology Headquarters Daiwa House Industry commitment to ESG would improve corporate value, we started to issue an integrated report to make the sustainability report more substantial and engaged in active communication with institutional investors. Third-Party Assessment / Consequently, in addition to being ranked the highest A in the CDP Climate Change Report 2018, we received the Environmental Communication Awards for the fifth straight year. In the EGP2021, which is launched in fiscal 2019 and positioned as an action phase for achieving the Data Section targets of SBT, EP100, and RE100, we are going to accelerate our efforts for “carbon-free” both in terms of products and monozukuri* and enhance cooperation with our business partners.

CSR Management However as external environmental changes accompanied by Items of which TCFD recommends disclosures climate change are highly uncertain, we find it important to pursue Organization’s governance of climate-related risks and appropriate handling of risks and business opportunities Governance opportunities Board of directors’ governance of risks and opportunities, management’s role simultaneously with multiple scenarios taken into account. in assessing and managing risks and opportunities We are going to use the items “Governance,” “Strategy,” “Risk Impacts on an organization’s business, strategy, and finance Strategy Management,” and “Metrics and Targets,” of which the TCFD Short-, mediumto long-term risks and opportunities, impacts on business, strategy, and finance, and resilience of strategy based on climate scenarios recommends the disclosures, as a tool to verify the validity of our Customers Status of identification, assessment, and management of engagement in climate change and pave the way to constructive Risk climate-related risks Management Status of integration of process of risk identification and assessment, and communication with investors through active information disclosures. process of risk management into the entire organization’s risk management Keeping with this notion, we announced support for the TCFD Metrics and targets used to assess and manage climate-related recommendations in September 2018 and have been part of the Metrics and risks and opportunities Targets Metrics used by an organization to assess and manage risks, targets and TCFD consortium, which was founded in May 2019. results for risk and opportunity management Governance Employees Board of Our Group positions “slowing and adapting to climate change” as Directors Environment Director (President) one of the important management issues and has appointed a Senior Group Environmental Promotion Committee (Chairman: Executive Officer in charge of the Environment) Managing Executive Officer as Executive Officer in charge of the Corporate Governance Committee Environment, who is responsible for implementing a climate change Environment Department strategy, with the Group Environmental Promotion Committee Daiwa House Industry Specialized Subcommittee Group environmental chaired by an Executive Officer in charge of the Environment.

Some effects of climate change Environment may not last long, but others can have mediumor long-term consequences. Classifying the factors of various external environmental changes accompanied by climate change into “transitions” and “physical changes,” we assess possible financial impacts facing us on a scale of large, medium, and small with affected periods assumed, trying to identify important risks and opportunities. In addition, based on such risks and opportunities, in order to devise business strategies that flexibly respond to external environmental changes in the future, we assess the degree of impact on our business by using multiple scenarios. When analyzing them, we refer to Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the scenario in which “transitions” progress, and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 for the scenario in which extreme “physical changes” progress to verify the validity of our business strategies. Third-Party Assessment / A recent simplified scenario analysis has shown that our net zero energy housing and buildings and environmental greening businesses are forecast to grow with the profit increase likely to cover negative financial impacts under any scenarios, which has made us reaffirm the validity of our risk management and the importance of active pursuit of opportunities. Note that this analysis, as the first Data Section steps, is simplified only for important risks and opportunities for the housing, commercial and office building businesses in particular. In addition to targeting more businesses, we are going to improve completeness of risks and opportunities and refine scenario analysis. 163 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 Managerial Philosophy ■■Principal risks and opportunities related to climate change Short term (0 to 3years), medium term (3 to 10 years), long term (10 to 30 years) Degree of Affected Types Content financial and Overall Picture periods impacts ◆ Tightening of Building Energy Efficiency Act With the scope of application of compliance with the Building Energy Efficiency Act expanded or energy efficiency Short-term Medium Policies, standards elevated, the number of businesses or properties to be regulated can balloon, which can increase workloads and costs of houses and buildings we offer. Transitions laws and regulations ◆ Carbon tax hike and expansion of emissions trading Foundation of Risks With the carbon tax significantly raised or emissions trading expanded, a significant increase in operational costs Medium-term Small or additional business tasks out of regulations will be needed, which can result in reduced work efficiency. ◆ Maximum temperature in summer rising CSR Management Physical With the maximum temperature in summer rising, workers in construction sites where outside work is common Chronic Short-term Small changes can be at higher risk for heatstroke, which can lead to delay in construction periods or reduced productivity in construction sites. ◆ Demand for houses and buildings with fewer greenhouse gas emissions growing Products / We have a domestic policy target of “making newly-constructed houses and buildings zero energy-oriented by Present time Large services 2030.” With support for achieving the goal continued and expanded, demand for ZEH and ZEB, products with high unit price per building, can grow. Transitions ◆ Creation of carbon credits through the supply of low-carbon houses and buildings Products / With emissions trading introduced nationwide, demand for carbon credits will grow, which can promote the Customers Opportunities Medium-term Medium services creation and acquisition of the credits through the supply of low-carbon houses and buildings and generate additional profits through their sale. ◆ Expansion of the environmental greening business beneficial to heat-island phenomenon control Physical Products / With urban heat-island phenomenon becoming severer accompanied by maximum temperature in summer rising, Medium-term Small changes services there can be a growing need for the temperature adjusting function by greening, which can expand the greening business. ■■Summary of the result of scenario analysis External scenario Reason for choice Result of analysis Application to policies and strategies Employees Most viable as the future of A possible increase in operational costs Under the policy of “maximizing sales increase and minimizing profit Nationally Determined domestic business, which due to tightening of regulations can be decrease with early development of ZEH and ZEB, and cost reduction Contribution accounts for much of our covered by an increase in sales of ZEH and pushed forward,” we performed monitoring of the growth of sales rate of (NDC) business.

Risk management We recognize that the climate change risk is one of the risks that have significant impacts in the medium and long run and integrate it in the Groupwide risk management process. We carefully identify and assess risks and opportunities nearly every three years, their identification and assessment used to identify priority issues in a Medium-Term Management Plan, which is formulated every three Local Communities years, and an Action Plan for the Environment or reflected in major policies and target levels in these plans. In response to the Environment Department’s identification of “external environmental changes” accompanied by a shift to a decarbonized society and “physical changes” derived from global warming, we assess important risks and opportunities from the likelihood of these changes and possible financial impacts when they have become realized. With identified important risks and opportunities discussed by each department for its concrete measures, the Group, each department, and each worksite set important management indicators and targets in an Action Plan for the Environment, trying to meet them. For progress monitoring, the Group convenes the Group Environmental Promotion Committee biannually, while there are a quarterly subcommittee review for each department and a biannual worksite ECO diagnosis/training for each worksite.

Excluded from the data, however, are smaller companies that impart no environmental impact for each indicator. The coverage rate of the target companies is estimated at 93%. Foundation of Regarding the environmental impact of sites outside Japan that are excluded from the data, we report only CO2 emissions and water consumption on pages 212 and 227 of Materials and Data Section because sales of our businesses outside Japan represent only 7% of consolidated net sales. In addition, in the event of a change in the number of consolidated subsidiaries subject to environmental management, the following measures are undertaken in CSR Management order to facilitate the comparison of any such change. [When the number of relevant organizations decreases during the term (due to a sale, etc.)] Data of such an organization shall be collected for the fiscal year (until it is sold) and excluded from data collection from the next fiscal year on. This measure shall not be applicable to the past data. [When the number of relevant organizations increases during the term (due to an acquisition etc.)] If the environmental impact is large: Data on the relevant organization is excluded from the data for the relevant year or base year but is included beginning with the Customers subsequent term of the Environmental Action Plan; past data is also included. If the environmental impact is small: Data on the relevant organization is included beginning with the subsequent fiscal year. ◇ Main referential guidelines ・“Sustainability Reporting Standards” by the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) ・“GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised)” by the WBCSD/WRI ・“Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard” by the WBCSD/WRI Employees ・“Environmental Report Guideline (2018 Edition)” by the Ministry of the Environment ・“Guidelines on Calculation Method for Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Business Operators” by the Ministry of the Environment ・“Basic Guidelines on Calculating Greenhouse Gas Emissions through Supply Chain Ver. 2.4” by the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ・“Guideline for Quantifying GHG Emission Reduction Contribution” by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ◇ Report on preceding data Business Partners In general, the time period covered by our reports is the preceding 3 to 5 years. If a calculation method or the scope of reporting is changed, corrections and reports are included in the above-mentioned periods as well as in the benchmarks for the base year. ◇ CO2 emission factor As a general rule, our Group uses fixed values during the period covered by the Environmental Action Plan (three years) in order to ascertain accurately the Local Communities improvement status of the Company itself. Regarding fuel, etc., we use values based on the Energy Efficiency Act (Act on the Rational Use of Energy) and the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. Regarding purchased electric power, we use the actual values (average of each member company) released by the Federation of Electric Power Companies of Japan in fiscal 2005.

Regarding renewable energy (consumed in-house), it is assumed that electric power purchases have been reduced by its use; therefore, the same heat quantity conversion factor used for purchased electric power is used.

As a result of P156, promoting such energy-saving efforts for our facilities, the targets were achieved. In next fiscal year, we are going to carry on promoting energy-saving 212, 213 activities, as illustrated in the introduction of renewable energy in our facilities such as the solar power generation system and the development of new technologies. We promoted the mega-solar business smoothly mainly through the Groupwide dream solar project and had 287MW, 9MW, and 2MW generated by solar power, wind power, and hydro power, respectively. With annual electricity generated 1.35 times more than the level one fiscal year earlier, the P156, 214 Foundation of target was achieved. As sales of the commercial and office building-related business grew, contribution by insulating/energy-saving equipment expanded smoothly. Contribution by solar power generation, however, fell significantly in the environmental energy business and the renovation business as Feed-in-Tariff P156, CSR Management dropped, with the result that the target was not achieved. From next fiscal year on, we are going to promote ZEH and ZEB, and expand the energy 215, 216 creation business to increase contribution to overall CO2 reduction. For C-ranked timber subject to a survey carried out last fiscal year, we took corrective actions such as switching to procurement from lower risk areas, which resulted in a 0.3 points decrease in the ratio of C-ranked timber. However as it takes time to complete the switch, the target was not achieved. In next fiscal year, in addition to completing the switch, we are going to further promote the switch to procurement from lower risk areas to reduce C-ranked timber to zero. While a decrease in house sales in the housing business led to a decrease in green spaces, an increase in large projects in the construction-related P166, Customers business expanded green spaces, with the result that the target was achieved. From next fiscal year on, we are going to pursue more green spaces, 221, 222 particularly stressing greening in nursing facilities. With all properties based on development and town planning that are compliant with self-standards, the target was achieved. Thick external wall surface elements and products with large timber sections were heavily used as in fiscal 2017 and the weight of timber waste with materials cut off became heavier. Consequently, the target was not achieved. In next fiscal year, we are going to promote effective utilization of materials by reducing timber waste with the sections of some timber members uniform. P172, In the construction-related business, the construction of buildings whose wall construction surface area per floor space was large increased waste 224-226 emissions, with the result that the target was not achieved. In next fiscal year, we are going to promote the standard adoption of roofing materials that Employees generate less waste for housing products, reducing waste emissions per floor space. We promoted construction waste sorting and maintained a high recycling rate, with the result that most of the targets were achieved. P172, While the target was not achieved in renovations, we improved the recycling rate from one fiscal year earlier by reviewing the waste disposal route. 224, 226 From next fiscal year on, we are going to select waste disposal routes that facilitate recycling to keep the recycling rate high. Although we maintained high standards in promoting the popularization of housing satisfying the requirements of long-life quality housing certifications, Business Partners we were not able to achieve our targets. P172, 228 While our attempt to improve products and productivity increased the ratio of system construction in convenience stores, it was seen to decrease in drug stores and nursing facilities, with the result that the target was not achieved. We are going to improve the adoption rate of system construction by Local Communities familiarizing tenants with it and providing training seminars on it to sales and designing staff. In addition to introducing water-saving devices in hotels, resort/sports facilities, and commercial facilities, we implemented countermeasures against P172, water leakage such as water supply and drainage pipes updating, with the result that the target was achieved. 227, 228 The targets were achieved by: changing thinners for cleaning painting machines into weak solvent; changing primer paints and thinners for steel frames into weak solvent; changing anticorrosive paints into weak solvent; making panel refinish paints waterborne; switching between foaming machine P178, 229 cleaners; and promoting a switch to another painting method. Shareholders The target was achieved in all segments by promoting a switch to low emission construction materials. P178 Self-Assessment Related page In addition to promoting environmental policies to overseas sites and overseas consolidated subsidiaries, we conducted an environmental impact P151, 167 survey of all segments, with the result that the target was achieved. 168, 212, 227 Environment We provided an explanation about the Daiwa House Group CSR Procurement Guidelines to Daiwa House Reform Company’s suppliers and collected an agreement from them. In addition, we conducted a questionnaire survey of Daiwa House Industry’s, Fujita Corporation’s, and Daiwa Lease P153, 154 Company’s respective principal suppliers on whether greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets would be met. From next fiscal year on, we are going to promote an environmental approach to them based on the questionnaire survey result. Third-Party Assessment / While managing processes at our Group companies and worksites, we promoted environmental activities and conducted follow-up in an effort to P151 achieve our targets, but some companies and each branch could not achieve their targets. Data Section In order to promote the ECO training seminar to all worksites, we appointed assistant ECO supporters to raise the seminar implementation rate, with the result that the target was not achieved. In next fiscal year, we are going to work closely with the Environmental Promotion Manager in each worksite in a P152, 211 bid to hold the seminar in all worksites.

reduction” is a numerical value representing how much we contributed to reduction of CO2 emissions by providing housing and buildings as well as promoting energy-efficiency and energy-generation solutions. Managerial Philosophy Using flow-based calculations, our Group calculates CO2 emissions at the use and operation stages for products (housing, buildings, photovoltaic power generation, etc.) in use up to the end of their service life for the relevant fiscal year. We then calculate the contributed reduction in CO2 emissions by subtracting the result from the CO2 emissions generated by a comparable equivalent product. As for the contributed reduction of an ESCO*, the value is calculated by the existing home base method, and the annual CO2 emissions of all facilities subject to ESCO services during the fiscal year (cumulative amount for an existing house) are calculated. We calculate the contributed reduction by deducting it from the CO2 emissions of a comparable facility. and Overall Picture * Initialism for “energy service company,” a business that reduces the costs of its customers’ utilities and water and is compensated for any reduction achieved. ◇ Calculation formula [Example of flow base method] Method ① (New houses): contribution to CO2 reduction (t) =｛(Annual CO2 emissions per house (t/house ∙ year) in the usage or operation stages of the products being compared) – (Annual average CO2 emissions per house (t/unit ∙ year) in the usage or operation stage of products offered during the fiscal year) ｝ × Number of houses sold in current fiscal year × Number of assumed years of use Foundation of Method ② (New buildings): contribution to CO2 reduction (t) = Σ ｛Total floor area (m ) × Annual energy consumption per unit of floor area by application or scale (MJ/m ∙ year) 2 2 × Energy reduction rate (%) × CO2 emission factor (t/MJ) × Estimated number of years of use｝ Note: Energy reduction rate (%) = 1 BEI* * Design energy consumption (MJ/year) ÷ Reference energy consumption (MJ/year) Method ③ (Energy generation facility): contribution to CO2 reduction (t) = Σ ｛Annual renewable energy generated (kWh/year) × CO2 emission factor (t/kWh) × Estimated number of years of use｝ CSR Management Note: Includes power sales. Method ④ (Energy efficiency improvement): contribution to CO2 reduction (t) = Σ｛(Annual CO2 emissions (t/year) before energy-efficiency retrofits – Annual CO2 emissions (t/year) after energy-efficiency retrofits) × Estimated number of years of use｝ Method ⑤ (Electricity retailing): contribution to CO2 reduction (t) = Σ｛(Adjusted emission factor of general electric power supplier (t-CO2/kWh) – Adjusted CO2 emission factor in current fiscal year (t-CO2/kWh)) × Supplied electric energy (kWh)｝ [Example of base method for existing home] Contribution to CO2 reduction (t/year) = Σ ｛(Annual CO2 emissions (t/year) of comparable facilities) – (Annual CO2 emissions (t/year) of equipment subject to ESCO services provided during year)｝ Customers ◇ Scope and calculation criteria Calculation criteria Segment Scope Estimated number of years of Calculation methods and calculation tools Comparison use* [Calculation method] Flow base method ① Single-family [Single-family house] Construction site: 6 areas.

Abbreviation for Building Energy Index, which indicates the energy-saving performances of a building. Foundation of Expressed in the ratio of the primary energy consumption of a designed building to that of the BEI nationally-designated criterion specification building. The smaller the value is, the higher the energysaving performance is. CSR Management B Refers to creatures’ diversity in uniqueness and interdependence. Terrestrial creatures have become diverse in uniqueness by adapting to a variety of environments and evolving over a long period of Biodiversity history and depend on each other directly or indirectly. The Convention on Biological Diversity, signed Customers in 1992, recognizes diversity at three levels: ecosystems, species, and genes. Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) is an environmental performance assessment method of buildings that was originally developed in Japan. This totally C CASBEE assesses the environmental performances of a building including indoor comfort and consideration for landscapes in addition to reduction in environmental impacts such as energy and resource conservation on a five-point scale. Employees E Existing home Refers to existing houses that were domestically built. Started in July 2012, the system obligates power companies to purchase electricity generated from Business Partners F Feed-in tariff system (FIT) renewable energy [solar power, wind power, hydro power (less than 30,000 kW), geothermal power, biomass, etc.] at a fixed price for a fixed period for society-wide promotion of renewable energy. Refers to purchasing products or services that preferentially chooses those which are smaller in Green procurement / environmental impacts rather than those which are good in price or quality. Our Group uses terms G Green purchase differently: “green procurement” for building materials and “green purchase” for stationery for routine Local Communities tasks.

Refers to a large solar power generator that generates more than 1 megawatt (more than 1,000 Shareholders M Mega-solar (power plant) kilowatts) of electricity. In housing and construction design, Passive is a design philosophy and method that takes advantage Passive (control) of nature such as the sun’s heat, light, wind and greenery to create pleasant architectural space, minimizing use of machines such as air conditioners. Environment P Fossil fuel, atomic fuel, and solar or hydro energy, which are called primary energy, are converted/ processed into electricity, kerosene, city gas, etc. as secondary energy. Buildings are mostly powered Primary energy consumption by secondary energy, each of which has its own calculation unit (kWh, liter, MJ, etc.). By converting such units into primary energy, a building’s gross energy consumption can be calculated in the same units (MJ, GJ). Third-Party Assessment / Renewable energy is a generic term for energy that is extracted from repeated natural phenomena and made available infinitely, unlike fossil fuels such as oil and coal, which are finite and exhaustible. Data Section R Renewable energy Specifically included in it are natural energy that uses sunlight, solar heat, wind power, thermal power, etc. and recycled energy such as heat utilization and power generation from waste incineration. 261 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2019 Terms Definition Abbreviation for Sustainable Development Goals, which, adopted at the 2015 United Nations Managerial Philosophy SDGs and Overall Picture Sustainable Development Summit, consist of 17 goals and 169 targets.
