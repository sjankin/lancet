It was the year the Company introthat Teijin has taken some pioneering steps in corporate govduced a corporate officer system, established the Advisory ernance.

Teijin currently has needs to continue evolving, without stopping to enjoy the nine directors (five inside and four outside directors) and five progress it has made in the past. Another hallmark feature of auditors (two inside and three outside auditors), for a total of Teijin is its easily understandable corporate philosophy from 14 members. both an internal and external standpoint.

This is why I believe Teijin has continued to be in business for an entire century. Impact of Board of Directors on Management Suzuki At Teijin, we believe the role of the Board of Directors Suzuki Another feature of Teijin is that important matters are goes beyond monitoring business execution (supervision) to deliberated in three layers. also encompass coaching and advising management. The Board of Directors deals with three kinds of agenda items: Ohtsubo Regarding major items like M&A decisions or forpolicy debates, decision-making and reporting.

If it is an M&A proposal, specifics are discussed in members of the Board of Directors tend to ask many quesdetail, such as how to take the best approach and ready tions and give plenty of guidance. These matters vary from capital. In the third and final round of deliberation, a decision improving returns for shareholders to the social significance of is reached after discussing the actual plan put together after Teijin. Meetings of the Board of Directors last an average of the second round of talks. These repeated deliberations allow four hours, and usually with a feeling of tension like at a discussions to focus on key points. General Meeting of Shareholders. I sometimes get nervous before going to the meetings once a month. Suzuki In our case, outside directors can either apply the brakes or push the accelerator on decision-making. For Ohtsubo After becoming an outside director, my lasting example, even if the business execution side sets an upper impression of the first Board of Directors meeting I attended limit for funds allocated for M&A, if an acquisition candidate is was the openness of the discussions. The meetings are not a must-have company that aligns well with our strategy, outmerely a formality where the agenda is set in stone in advance side directors may push for the M&A deal as a necessary and discussions follow the agenda without detour. I believe acquisition, even if it means increasing the amount of the the Board of Directors is highly effective with this approach. investment.

Advisory Board Improves Transparency of Management Suzuki Members of the Advisory Board comprise two same person serves as CEO, the more influence that person non-Japanese experts, four outside directors, the Company’s tends to have on personnel matters. The Advisory Board was advisor and the CEO. Meetings are convened twice a year, introduced as a system of checks and balances on this once each in the spring and fall. The Advisory Board has influence. three main objectives, namely, to advise management from a broad viewpoint, evaluate the performance of the CEO and Ohtsubo In the context of advising management, we have propose compensation amounts for the CEO, and nominate received astute criticisms and accurate advice from non­ the next CEO. The Advisory Board does not have any voting Japanese experts on our board, an executive director & CEO rights. The results of their discussions are reported to the of an American chemicals company and a professor at a Board of Directors. famous university. All outside directors are members of the The Advisory Board was created due to strong concerns Advisory Board, so they are able to understand current condiabout excessive influence of the CEO and management team tions within Teijin and provide advice from an objective point on promotions and other personnel matters. The longer the of view. Teijin also thoroughly evaluates the performance of its CEO. For starters, the CEO must give a 90-minute presentation about business results and a Q&A session for 30 minutes in English. I think CEO Suzuki struggles to speak in English this entire time, but the listeners are also struggling to understand him (laughs). The Advisory Board holds meetings once every six months. The participants read documents before each meeting, and also review the minutes of the previous two meetings. It would not be possible to evaluate performance without doing so. Suzuki I am also a member of the Advisory Board. For matters concerning the nomination and compensation advisory functions of the Advisory Board, an outside director takes the lead on deliberations, and I do not participate in discussions about matters concerning the CEO. After my presentation and the Q&A session are over, I leave my seat during the performance evaluation portion of the meeting. The time I spend waiting outside during my performance evaluation always seems long. 50 TEIJIN LIMITED INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Ohtsubo Performance evaluations are based on numerical benchmarks, such as ROE and ROIC. Areas difficult to express in figures are thoroughly discussed in the meeting. This is why the meetings tend to last a long time. Suzuki Regarding future CEO candidates, the Advisory Board gives advice from the succession planning stage. Teijin does not simply select candidates from a pool of available people. Ohtsubo At every meeting, I have an opportunity to see the presentations of future CEO candidates. The most important thing, I think, is that the candidates have their confidence and insight in answering questions after their presentation. Since there are still many things that cannot be learned from the first or second presentation, we need to continuously watch the candidates. We feel significant responsibility in assuming an integral part of the selection process. Suzuki The members would probably have a hard time function for CEO nominations and compensation, and outside reaching a decision without taking all these steps.

For the Teijin Group, climate change presents a major problem that has a bearing on the sustainability of its business platform. In March 2019, the Teijin Group announced its support for the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In fiscal 2019, the Teijin Group participates in the TCFD Consortium, a new initiative backed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), the Financial Services Agency (FSA), and the Ministry of the Environment (MOE). We will step up our responses to the TCFD recommendations, hold numerous dialogues with stakeholders on climate-related risks and opportunities, and strive to provide appropriate disclosure of information. Activity policies and plans for climate change and progress thereon are deliberated and reported to Teijin Group’s Climate the Board of Directors through the following channels: (1) function-specific executive reports by the Change Governance Chief Social Responsibility Officer (once a year); and (2) deliberation on basic plans and reports on (➝P.40) progress in the Total Risk Management (TRM) Committee (twice a year). The Teijin Group aims to be “a company that supports the society of the future” as its long-term vision. The Teijin Group’s environmental value solutions harness technologies we have developed to reduce weight and increase efficiency. Through the supply of environmental value solutions, we have been continually seeking to make a contribution to a “low-carbon Strategy society,” a contribution to a “recycling-based society,” and a contribution to a “society to preserve the global environment.” (➝P.30) In addition, given that the Teijin Group conducts a wide range of businesses globally, we recognize that the global environmental footprint associated with our business operations is not small. Mindful of this, we have been working towards finding a variety of solutions and striving to reduce our environmental impact while adhering to the fundamental tenet of ensuring safety.

CO2 emissions are calculated according to the coefficients specified in the Law Concerning the Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global Warming.

However, for power purchased overseas, where known, power company-specific emissions coefficients are used for the calculations.

This problem has become an increasingly urgent global concern. In September 2018, the Teijin Group issued a “Declaration for Solving the Plastic Marine Waste Problem” to demonstrate its commitment to this problem. Regulatory trends surrounding marine plastic waste could elevate the risk of a loss of existing business. However, the Teijin Group considers this as an opportunity to drive growth in the markets for recycling and alternative products. Based on this belief, the Teijin Group is advancing initiatives to reduce its environmental impact and provide environmental value solutions. Helping to Solve the Marine Plastic Waste Problem Support for an Expedition to the South Pole in a through the Recycling of PET Bottles Solar Vehicle Teijin Frontier Co., Ltd. has been implementing a recycling In November 2018, the Clean2Antarctica (C2A) project led by project based on the concept of “local production for local Dutch adventurer Edwin ter Velde embarked on an ambitious consumption” in various parts of Japan. In this project, Teijin expedition to reach the South Pole in an eco-friendly solar Frontier collects waste generated at the venues of outdoor vehicle. The vehicle was made largely from recycled materials events and recycles this waste into resources. such as used PET bottles and other recycled plastic waste.

From fiscal 2019, the Teijin Group has abolished the restrictions (1) to (4) referred to above, and has introduced a telework system that allows employees to work from their homes or other locations. We will manage the telework system so as to enhance the flexibility of employees’ workstyles and maximize the abilities of every employee. ■ Promotion of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) From fiscal 2018, the Teijin Group has been promoting the adoption of RPA in business processes to raise operating efficiency and reduce the workload of routine tasks, thereby enabling employees to focus on decision-making processes and creative tasks that people can perform more effectively. We are pushing ahead with measures to reshape conventional workstyles. These measures include not only the automation of routine tasks that have previously been performed manually by people, but also extend to decisions on whether a given business process is truly necessary or not. Improvement of Job Satisfaction Previously, Teijin Limited and Teijin Pharma Limited had provided opportunities for career-track employees in their 20s and 30s to reflect on their career paths through tier-specific training. From fiscal 2015, the two companies have offered career development training for a broader range of employees, with coverage extended to employees in managerial positions in their 40s and 50s. Through fiscal 2018, 1,219 employees have received this training on a cumulative basis. In this training, the participants review their careers to date, developing a deeper self-understanding based on their values and the strengths gained and lessons learned from experience. The training seeks to enable the participants to voluntarily find and obtain a new career that fits their individual preferences after they identify what gives them the greatest job satisfaction. In order to enhance the job satisfaction of every employee, we have strengthened our support system for employees after they attend training. For example, we offer counseling sessions led Career training by internal career consultants*1 and provide financial support to employees for a portion of the costs they may incur to develop or strengthen the abilities they seek to demonstrate*2 in their new careers. *1 Internal career consultants hold national certification as career consultants. *2 Career development follow-up support system A program to subsidize one-third of training costs, or up to an annual limit of ¥100,000 per person, for employees who seek to obtain certifications and skills in accordance with the plan prepared in career development training. Diversity Recognition Rate Teijin measures the diversity recognition rate based on the results of the employee awareness survey (see page 39). In fiscal 2018, Teijin conducted a survey of all employees of Group companies in Japan and other countries. As a result, the diversity recognition rate Fiscal 2018 84.3% was 84.3% (82.0% in Japan, 92.2% overseas). In order to further increase the awareness of employees in Japan, Teijin will conduct measures in Japan such as helping employees (Fiscal 2020 target 60%, Fiscal 2027 target 100%) to balance work and nursing care responsibilities, promoting the successful employment of people with disabilities, and fostering an understanding of LGBT issues.

This means identifying talents In terms of promoting females, I would like to focus my early, developing talents for future needs, and making Teijin initiatives on promoting females to executive positions more diverse. Diversity for me is more than promoting because I think this is the biggest challenge for Teijin. In the females.

The acquired companies have different backpoint of view is that we have to move away from “thinking in grounds and have their own backpack of culture coming from silos,” such as “We are carbon fiber,” “We are Teijin Aramid,” the previous owner. However, what we missed in the past is “We are resins,” etc. We have to have a “One Teijin Culture” an “integration process.” Without a corporate culture, and that is missing. employees develop less of a sense of belonging.

Of course, you sometimes need to give direction, but you have adults in front of you, and they can very well manage their personal lives. So why do we think they cannot manage their work lives in Teijin too? We should give them more responsibility for their own careers. This again requires a lot of communication and a lot of feedback.

(Note 1) The method of estimating the fair value for securities and derivative transactions is as follows: Assets (1) Cash and time deposits, (2) Notes and accounts receivable—trade and (3) Short-term loans receivable The terms of all of the above are short term and the fair value thereof is nearly equal to book value, so the book value is used as fair value. (4) Marketable securities and investment securities The fair value of shares is the market price. The terms of negotiable certificates of deposit are short term and the fair value thereof is nearly equal to book value, so the book value is used as fair value. See Note 5, “Market securities and investment securities,” for information on investment securities categorized by holding purpose. (5) Long-term loans receivable The fair value of long-term loans receivable, categorized by term, is discounted by the interest rate that is based on that of government bonds, to which a spread that reflects credit risk has been added. Moreover, the fair value of long-term loans receivable that are doubtful is estimated in the same way or is provided in an amount sufficient to cover possible losses on collection. Liabilities (1) Notes and accounts payable—trade and (2) Short-term loans payable The terms of all of the above are short term and the fair value thereof is nearly equal to book value, so the book value is used as fair value. (3) Bonds The fair value of corporate bonds is calculated based on market price. In cases where there is no market price, fair value is calculated by using the discounted cash flow based on the sum of the principal and total interest of the remaining period and credit risk. (4) Long-term loans payable The fair value of long-term loans payable is the sum of the principal and total interest discounted by the rate that is applied if a new loan is made. Certain long-term loans payable with floating rates are tied to interest rate swap transactions and subject to special method.
