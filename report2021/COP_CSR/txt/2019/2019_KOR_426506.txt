To prevent such losses and to utilize water resources more efficiently, K-water has established a pipeline management system by carrying out local waterworks operation entrusted by 23 municipalities since 2004. It has also focused on the improvement of aging facilities. This led to an increase in the scientific operation rating of the waterworks from 68.4 points before the entrustment to Expansion of Smart Overview and current status of the Smart Water City projects 93.0 points today. The flow rate was also enhanced by 23.7%, from 60.6% to 84.3%. As a result, the current population supplied with water amounts to 2.38 million, an increase of 0.64 million in comparison with before SWC (Smart Water City) is a city where a healthy water supply system is implemented, with ICT technologies applied to Water Management the entrustment.
