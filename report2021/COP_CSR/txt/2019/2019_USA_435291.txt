A MESSAGE FROM OUR PRESIDENT & CEO For more than 95 years, West has been by the side of our customers, making a meaningful difference through our mission to contain and deliver injectable therapies that improve patient lives. We realize the important role we play in delivering healthcare to millions of patients across the globe every day, as well as our broader responsibility to support the communities in which we live and work. West’s commitment to sustainability runs throughout our Company, from our Board of Directors, who receive regular briefings on our sustainability program, to the dedicated team members at each individual site. We embrace this responsibility and strive to be good stewards in all of our business decisions—from the raw materials we use, to our production and manufacturing techniques, to how we package and distribute our products. Our team members are also passionate about making a difference, and donate considerable time and resources through our corporate giving and volunteer programs. In return, we are committed to providing our entire West team with a safe, equitable and caring work environment. This year, we set new five-year goals that are designed to further strengthen the Company’s commitment in each of the key areas where we feel we can make the biggest impact: Compliance and Ethics; Diversity and Talent; Health and Safety; Philanthropy; Environmental Sustainability; and Quality. We set these new goals after working to engage and understand what was most important to our customers, our business, our shareholders and our community. I’m proud of what we’ve accomplished in 2018, and look forward to our continued progress in delivering upon these goals to create a sustainable business for the future. Sincerely, Eric M. Green President & CEO 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report 2 OUR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY COMMITMENT We at West recognize our responsibility to be a good corporate citizen, and we strive to conduct our business in a transparent and sustainable manner. As a trusted partner to healthcare, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, we understand being a good corporate citizen is not just important to us, but that it is also a key tool that enables our customers to achieve their own corporate responsibility objectives. In 2018, we made impressive progress against our environmental sustainability goals, further improved our safety record, grew our corporate responsibility program, and received industry recognition with several awards. These achievements were made possible through the leadership of our Board of Directors, sustained executive leadership, commitment from all West team members and incorporation of our corporate citizenship priorities and principles into our daily business. As pleased as I am to discuss our 2018 corporate responsibility highlights, I’m equally pleased to introduce West’s next set of corporate responsibility targets. Running from 2019-2023, we are calling this next generation of West’s corporate responsibility targets the “100-Year Milestone” goals, as they run through the Company's 100th anniversary in 2023. We are happy to report that the new targets are linked to, and support, the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. I hope West’s 2018 Corporate Responsibility Report demonstrates the significant achievements and successes of the last year, and also reflects our deep commitment to continuing this success and building upon it in the years to come. I am proud to lead these efforts but even prouder of the commitment and pride of our entire West team. Together, we are working to build a safer and more sustainable world for our business and the community at large. Sincerely, Steven S.
