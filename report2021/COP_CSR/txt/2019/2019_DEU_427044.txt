Because chemicals form the basis and the ­driving force for innovations in almost all areas of daily life. That gives our sector a key role in solving important future issues, whether they relate to climate protection, efficient use of limited resources, or enabling more and more people on our planet to share in growth and prosperity. To achieve that, it is vital to take an integrated approach to economic strength and ecological and social responsibility. We do that because we are convinced that only companies that act ­responsibly, enjoy people’s trust, and are open to continuous improvement can be successful in the long term. That includes listening very carefully to the concerns of our customers, employees, owners, the capital markets, politicians, and other stakeholders. We need that interaction so we can respond rapidly to key future trends, global developments, and changing market requirements. Consequently, over the past year we once again ensured there was plenty of scope for dialogue with our stakeholders—at various events and through a new global employee survey. 7 This understanding of partnership is important to us. Gone are the days when men in white coats developed new molecules in the isolation of their labs. A new generation of chemical innovations is being created in close cooperation with customers, suppliers, and research partners, through ­collaboration between global corporations and enthusiastic start-ups, and at the interface between different disciplines and fresh business models. The topics of particular importance to us are reflected in our updated materiality analysis. Many of these topics, such as the contribution Evonik makes to ­climate protection, are becoming vital drivers of innovation and growth. One example is the Rheticus research project. In this project we are working with Siemens to combine electrolysis and fermentation in order to achieve something the experts call artificial photosynthesis. The first pilot plant is currently under construction at our site in Marl (Germany). It is scheduled to come into operation in 2021 and will enable low-cost, environment-friendly production of high-value chemicals such as butanol and hexanol from eco-power and CO2 with the aid of bacteria. With this and many other projects, we are making a direct contribution to meeting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. A systematic review of our contribution is a new feature in this report. We have also ­further refined our monetary evaluation of the economic, ecological, and social impact of our business activities. We are happy to have achieved that because extensive reporting of the costs and benefits of our activities is essential to ensure that society accepts industrial production. Similarly, we are especially pleased that we have been able to reduce our specific greenhouse gas emissions by about 30 percent since 2008. We aim to reduce emissions by another 20 percent by 2025. At the same time, Evonik already generates around half of its sales with products and solutions that demonstrably help to improve resource efficiency in our customers’ applications. These are good reasons why we are proud to present this report to you and can sincerely say: Creating the future is our business.

We accept responsibility As one of the world’s leading specialty chemicals companies, Evonik stands for attractive businesses and innovative capability. Our strengths include the balanced spectrum of our business activities, end-markets, and regions, and working closely with customers. We see responsibility and long-term business success as two sides of the same coin. Sustainability has long been a growth driver in many of our businesses. Our leading technology positions enable us to offer customers a wide range of solutions that contribute to efficient use of resources and reduce their impact on the environment. Examples are amino acids for animal nutrition, additives for hydraulic fluids, and functional silanes to protect building façades. At Evonik, good sustainability management goes beyond our own products and production processes. As a founding member of the Together for Sustainability sector initiative, we drive forward transparency and sustainability in the supply chain. 10 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 EVONIK INDUSTRIES STRATEGY AND GROWTH SDGs of ­relevance for Evonik in order of relevance (top to bottom) At Evonik Perspectives on November 20, Evonik plans to build a new production com2018 stakeholders gave Evonik online plex for the high-performance polymer polyfeedback on sustainability topics. amide 12, which is used in attractive growth markets, for example, in the automotive ­sector, oil and gas pipelines, and 3D printing.

UN Sustainable Development Goals of relevance for Evonik The United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide guidance for companies that align their business activities to sustainable development. As a first step, in 2017 we The SDGs of relevance for Evonik started to compile examples from our day-to-day activities and publish them on our website.1 Many of these products and solutions are growth drivers in our portfolio. In 2018, we systematically continued our examination of the SDGs of relevance for Evonik. An SDG is relevant for us if there is a significant positive or negative influence on or by Evonik. Our products and solutions make a positive contribution to achieving the relevant SDGs. We are constantly aware that critical impacts may be associated with some of our business activities. We have developed our own method to identify Evonik’s influence, paying special attention to the sub-targets of the 17 SDGs. In a multi-step process using the WBCSD method, our business activities were weighted at the level of PARCs 2­ on the basis of sales and our corporate strategy (inclusion in our growth engines and innovation growth fields).

This evaluation resulted in the following ranking of the Throughout this report, you can find information on how our SDGs of relevance for Evonik (in descending order from left activities relate to the SDGs of relevance to Evonik. More than to right in each row). 80 percent of Evonik’s sales already have a positive impact on the SDGs, and around 60 percent have a positive effect on the four SDGs of relevance for Evonik. The next step towards ­validating the ranking of the SDGs that are relevant for Evonik will be take place following the sustainability analysis of our business, starting in 2019. Evonik makes an important contribution to achieving the SDGs. The SDGs help us focus and sharpen our ­sustainability strategy. And that helps us identify and utilize new business opportunities.

Our sustainability topics are based on the themes 102-43 identified in our materiality analysis in 2015. We reviewed, 102-46 validated, and in some cases revised these themes in a wide 102-48 range of stakeholder dialogues and discussions with internal 102-49 experts in 2016 and 2017. As a result, we added digitalization, biodiversity, and the circular economy as new topics. The concept and the results of this validation are presented annually to the CR Panel for approval. One goal we set ourselves for 2018 was an extensive ­validation of our materiality analysis to make prioritization even more meaningful. The scope of our stakeholder survey in 2018 was broadened considerably compared with previous years and stakeholders were asked about the most important sustainability issues for Evonik. A distinction was made between We need to know what‘s important to our stakeholders with direct and indirect influence; see chart stakeholders and what‘s important from C05. The participants at our stakeholder dialogues formed Evonik‘s perspective so we can align our the basis for our survey. business activities accordingly.

Particularly dangerous substances are included from lower tonnages. That allows a soundly based assessment of the risks. Where necessary, restrictions are placed on certain usage patterns or, in extreme cases, a complete ban is issued on use in certain products. Evonik evaluates its substances using its own Chemicals Management System (CMS). This system, which was developed in-house, supports us in global product evaluation, analogously to a life cycle analysis. The content of the CMS has been harmonized with the GPS and REACH requirements. By the end of 2018, we had performed more than 80 percent of the required evaluations.
