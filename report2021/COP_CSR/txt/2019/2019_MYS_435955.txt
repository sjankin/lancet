António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Mr. Secretary-General, Commitment in Global Compact I am pleased to confirm that Multi Net Resources Sdn Bhd supports the ten principles of the Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to implement those principles. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Multi Net Resources Sdn Bhd will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. And after joining in this Global Compact, I have a clear direction on how to drive my business into another stage but at the same time contribute to the society. There will be more and more interesting events and transformation in 2019 which will bring Multi Net Resources Sdn Bhd Corporate Social Responsibility to more than just a responsibility. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of joining the Global Compact, and annually thereafter according to the Global Compact COP policy. Sincerely yours, Date: 2019.12.30 _______________________ 11:10:58 +08'00' Tee Lian Phing Managing Director Multi Net Resources Sdn Bhd
