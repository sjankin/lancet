Taking iris recognition’s longstanding respect as the most accurate, secure, reliable, fault-free and fastest method of human identification; IrisGuard has been at the pioneering end of the industry, being the first iris recognition in border control, the first on ATMs, the first in supermarkets and the first to integrate with blockchain. Driving disruptive and state-of-the-art innovations that provide financial inclusion for vulnerable populations, IrisGuard is the only in-house designed and built solution of complete financial authentication and authorisation systems incorporating hardware, software and server processing. With 2.5 billion people across the world without access to traditional banking services and 1 billion without identity documents, IrisGuard platforms ensure that the vulnerable, needy and impoverished can move towards financial inclusion through the simple use of their most secure biometric – their iris. The humanitarian EyeBank® project is the world’s largest iris deployment, enabling hundreds of thousands of forcibly displaced Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt to receive dignified assistance and care for their families. The ability for a refugee to feed their family with a simple blink of the eye is lifechanging and access to cash is exactly the same as someone with a bank account, no additional buttons to press, no aid queue to join. Most recently, IrisGuard launched its innovative mobile iris phone, the EyePay® Phone, combining years of iris technology expertise with a smartphone that will allow us to extend our platform to secure iris recognition payments through mobile platforms in rural areas that have little or no infrastructure with the same accuracy and at a much-reduced cost.

End poverty in all its forms everywhere 1.4 by 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services including microfinance Examples: We are fully committed to the rights of those less fortunate than ourselves and work with the UNHCR and WFP on projects with Syrian refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Egypt. We are a sponsor of the UNCHR’s annual World Refugee Day in Jordan. We also work with Ministry of Displacement and Migration (MoDM) Iraq to assist them in providing aid for Internally Displaced Persons – (IDP) and work with Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) Lebanon to assist local social welfare as well as the National Aid Fund (NAF) Jordan for the assistance of poor. Over the Christmas and New Year public holidays of 2018 our dedicated teams were working hard to set up our equipment to enable the distribution of bread in the Azraq and Zaatari Camps. Starting at 7am, and during 4 hours on the morning of 1st January 2019, 3679 transactions had been completed. The images below show the iris scanning stations and the bread distribution. “irisguard platforms provide convenience, ease-of-use, speed, stability, accuracy, hygiene and robustness to the process.” IrisGuard UK Ltd 43 Shenley Pavilions, Chalkdell Drive, Shenley Wood, Milton Keynes MK5 6LB, UK Page 11 Tel: +44 1908 991683 Email: enquiries@irisguard.com Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture 2.1 by 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round Examples: Our work with WFP in the Jordan refugee camp allows refugees to buy their food using their iris, increasing the efficiency of donor money and encouraging more donors to donate with pinpoint accuracy which has not been seen before. Donors such as USAID, DFID, ECHO and others are reinvigorated and encouraged by our platforms ability to fairly ensure aid is delivered to the right beneficiary all the time and that no one else can deprive the beneficiary from receiving their rightful entitlements. We are also partners with UNHCR for providing automated services through self-service kiosks for refugees ensuring a quick service (It’s so simple, even my nine-year-old daughter can do it) with great ease. IrisGuard UK Ltd 43 Shenley Pavilions, Chalkdell Drive, Shenley Wood, Milton Keynes MK5 6LB, UK Page 12 Tel: +44 1908 991683 Email: enquiries@irisguard.com Our work with WFP Jordan and WFP Lebanon for card verification throughout both countries ensures there are no duplicate distributions involving both Jordan Post and LibanPost as customer touch points providing service with dignity to all beneficiaries. Including post offices also provides revenue for those entities and increased local value and component; this helps change the view of locals towards refugees in the most profound way, refugees going to the post are customers receiving a paid service (for the post) as opposed to refugees who are burdening the country. “irisguard guarantees that every US$, £ or € intended for a beneficiary is delivered to that person and no-one else.” IrisGuard UK Ltd 43 Shenley Pavilions, Chalkdell Drive, Shenley Wood, Milton Keynes MK5 6LB, UK Page 13 Tel: +44 1908 991683 Email: enquiries@irisguard.com Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls 5.b enhance the use of enabling technology, in particular information and communications technology, to promote the empowerment of women Examples: Our work with UN Women to distribute salaries intended for women, only to women, using their iris ensures empowerment of UNW beneficiaries and that no one can collect their salary (work-for-pay) except the woman herself (not the husband, the son or the brother) since we depend entirely on her iris and her presence at the cash-out point. This world-pioneering solution is adopted by UNW and will be rolled out worldwide as an app on our EyePay® Phone once the pilot (currently underway, June 2019) is concluded in Jordan in August 2019. By linking this salary payment system to WFP Building Blocks Blockchain, we ensure women have a place to store their money (the Blockchain wallet) and that it is available to her anywhere she is in the world; this becomes her virtual bank account that no one other than her has access to. We are so fortunate to have had the chance to empower women with great dignity, unparallel protection and security using our EyePay® Cash platform. “irisguard moves the world’s unbanked from poverty to financial inclusion” “Over half a billion dollars has been faultlessly transacted via irisguard platforms using only the iris” IrisGuard UK Ltd 43 Shenley Pavilions, Chalkdell Drive, Shenley Wood, Milton Keynes MK5 6LB, UK Page 14 Tel: +44 1908 991683 Email: enquiries@irisguard.com Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries 10.c by 2030, reduce to less than three per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than five per cent Examples: Our technology provides verification of individuals via their iris to ensure that the transaction and access to cash, wallets and staple food items is kept to a minimum and that each individual receives exactly what they are intitled to. Our technology has reduced fraudulent “ghost” transactions. Ban Ki Moon (UN General Secretary) stated at the Economic and Social Council panel on accountability and transparency in 2012 that “30% of development aid… failed to reach its destination owing to corruption” “data from operations in Jordan has been able to show that as much as 20% of payments, prior to deploying its platform, have been to “ghost” recipients” When looking for organisations to provide our technology to we take into consideration the impact that the company has on addressing the needs of disadvantaged and marginalised population and attend events around the world to show case our innovative technology.

Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels 16.9 by 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration Examples: By providing a universal and portable United Nations identity to refugees and IDPs, and linking that to cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, we provide the beneficiary with mobility and freedom to move armed with a strong identity that is their eyes. Now with our EyeCloud® On Cloud (ECOC) platform, refugees, IDPs and marginalised people can carry their digital identity in their eyes not only within their country but as they move around the globe, and not one can deprive them of who they are. Opening statement at the 68th session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s Programme “We want every refugee to have a unique digital identity. This will enhance accountability and facilitate two-way communication between refugees and service providers. It will also help prevent and reduce statelessness.” By Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2 October 2017 (https://www.unhcr.org/admin/hcspeeches/59d1f3b77/opening-statement-68th-session-executive-committee-high-commissioners-programme.html) Providing access for Pensioner enrolment in Iraq “irisguard spearheads financial inclusion to the vulnerable and under-served populations through its EyePay® platforms” IrisGuard UK Ltd 43 Shenley Pavilions, Chalkdell Drive, Shenley Wood, Milton Keynes MK5 6LB, UK Page 16 Tel: +44 1908 991683 Email: enquiries@irisguard.com
