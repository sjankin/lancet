Sustainability Report 2019 OUR BUSINESS IN FOCUS 11 OUR BUSINESS IN FOCUS BRINGING SUSTAINABILITY TO LIFE Swissport’s fleet of Ground Support Equipment comprises over 50,000 assets. In 2016, the company embarked on a fleet modernization program focusing on operational reliability, efficiency, safety and emissions reductions to better meet client requirements and societal expectations. As a passenger, we come in contact with a great “Efficient ground service processes are vital for many ground service processes and machinery a pleasant airport experience for travelers,” on our way from entering an airport to boarding says Matthias Hüttner, Swissport’s Senior the aircraft.

And yet, Ground Support Equipment (GSE) at any they are essential components of an airport modern airport. ground service delivery. As the largest provider of airport ground services and air cargo handling, operating at more than 300 airports worldwide, Swissport operates a GSE fleet with over 50,000 assets. They all need to be allocated, implemented and properly maintained to support efficient and reliable operation. Swissport has its own GSE workshops and a dedicated fleet management team. 12 OUR BUSINESS IN FOCUS Sustainability Report 2019 Swissport International AG A FIVE-YEAR INVESTMENT costs also increase as vehicles get older, resultTHE FIVE LARGEST GSE CATEGORIES AT PROGRAM UNDER WAY ing in reduced cost efficiency.

Swissport International AG Sustainability Report 2019 » The modernization of our fleet comes with significant improvements for the environment. « Burgess states: “By getting involved at the conceptual stage of equipment development, Swissport is better able to influence what eventually comes off the production line in terms of meeting operational requirements.” A current example of such close collaboration with our GSE suppliers is the exchange between Swissport and a manufacturer of autonomously docking passenger stairs in Belfast. In 2018, when the project was in the extensive testing stage, Swissport was using the autonomous stairs almost every day, providing the manufacturer with feedback collected under realistic conditions. Swissport is also working on deploying more standardized equipment across its extensive network and has significantly reduced the number of suppliers. Most centrally managed equipment categories are now sourced from only 25 suppliers, while some regionally managed categories are sourced from other suppliers. 14 OUR BUSINESS IN FOCUS Sustainability Report 2019 Swissport International AG DID YOU KNOW? 3 1 PUSHBACK 2 The TPX-100-E can avoid up to 8 tons of CO2 per year.

That’s the team that make sure the suitcases and cargo get stowed in the belly of the aircraft. This also gets you pretty close to the big machines, but it was not what he was really interested in. “Then I became the nose-lifter dude,” he laughs. The nose-lifter gets its name from its function: Mario’s truck has a large opening between its back wheels, and he steers it carefully so they are positioned at either side of the aircraft’s nose gear. One barely notices the forces at work here, but it’s a great sight to witness how the low-lying tractor – seemingly without effort – lifts the huge aircraft by its nose and then pushes it backwards to its point of departure. “We each move more passengers a day than any pilot,” Mario muses, and he is most certainly right. 18 OUR BUSINESS IN FOCUS Sustainability Report 2019 Swissport International AG » I tell my followers what qualifications they need, how they have to apply and how they would be trained. « Stronger bass than a rock concert of yourself” is his recommendation to potential Investment requests are submitted by the local Mario’s fascination with his job is infectious. applicants. “Don’t delegate your personal teams, in coordination with regional manageOften, after hours, he responds to messages safety to a policy or a colleague.

We want to recognize the most outstanding employee achievements that could serve as an inspiration to others. The environment is one of four award categories for which initiatives are eligible for nomination. Sustainability Report 2019 Swissport International AG GOING ELECTRIC At the end of 2018, Swissport had some 2,500 electrically powered items of equipment in its fleet. In line with its strategy to procure electrically powered GSE, or eGSE, the number of electric vehicles in the Swissport Group has almost tripled since 2016. About 20% of group electric equipment is stationed in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, in the UK and Ireland region, and in the United States. Asian locations have been catching up. Environmental protection A welcome side effect of the modernization of our fleet is that it comes with significant benefits for environmental management. The latest generations of fossil-fuel powered engines and electrical equipment have improved environmental footprints compared to older equipment. Swissport has made a strategic decision in support of environmentally friendly eGSE. “We purchase eGSE whenever it is appropriate to do so, and our experience has been positive,” says David Burgess.
