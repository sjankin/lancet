Environmental statement update 2019 Update of the consolidated 2017– 2019 environmental statement The Wilkhahn brand has stood for superbly designed ­office furniture with practical innovations for many years. Contents. Wilkhahn has been successful across the world for decades due it its unique and timeless German-made design Product responsibility 3 in Bauhaus tradition. Typical examples are the company’s ON, IN and AT ranges of office task chairs with their freeSustainability goals and sustainability performance 4 to-move concept, which make offices more physically ­active places without compromising on good design, comSustainability programme of action 5 fort and contemporary ergonomics. Material and energy flows 7 Wilkhahn’s office furniture is underpinned by a sophisti­ cated concept. It’s made to stringent quality standards, is Legal notice 8 intuitive to use and sustainable at the same time. The fact that components are easy to dismantle makes replacing ­expendable parts cost efficient and environmentally friendly and extending product lives easier. And by choosing highquality materials and labelling all components throughout, most of the materials can be recycled once the product has reached the end of its useful life. Wilkhahn is an owner-managed, medium-sized company whose maxim is fairness. In addition to protecting the environment, it has also been applying and improving health and safety in the workplace and health management programmes for decades. Furthermore, Wilkhahn is committed to the 10 principles set out in the UN Global Compact and believes this is a solid basis for collaborating with suppliers, Wilkhahn supports the UN Global Compact customers and other stakeholders.

The ten principles of the UN Global Compact Human rights Wilkhahn will report on any successes relevant to EMAS Principle 1: during 2018 in this 2019 environmental statement. Companies are to support and observe ­international human rights As usual, brief texts plus graphics and spreadsheets ­within their spheres of influence and will provide information on the development of key Principle 2: sustainability aspects. ensure that they are not guilty of complicity in infringing human rights. Labour standards Principle 3: Businesses are to uphold the freedom of ­association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining as well as under: Principle 4: eradicating all forms of forced labour, Principle 5: stopping child labour and Principle 6: eliminating discrimination when recruiting and employing people. Environmental protection Principle 7: Businesses are to support a precautionary ­approach to environmental problems, Principle 8: Adopting initiatives to generate a greater sense of responsibility for the environment and Principle 9: encouraging the development and spread of ­eco-­friendly technologies. In August 2018, Wilkhahn was one of the first 15 companies to be presented with an award by Lower Saxony’s Alliance for Sustainability for its exemplary Fighting corruption commitment to its workforce and to environmental protection.

We achieve this thanks to: • useful innovations that make life easier and more pleasant in the long term; • first-class materials, surfaces and technical solutions that guarantee quality even after many years; • distinctive, timeless and appealing designs with the ­potential to become classics. 2. Reduce – “less is more” is more than just a design principle to us, it means: • we reduce the materials used to make handling easier and to protect resources; • we use energy in manufacturing efficiently, for example by drawing on district heating and heat recovery in ­manufacturing; • we reduce emissions, by utilising solar power, climateneutral energy sources (cutting (CO2) and varnishing ­techniques that are low in solvents. 3. Recover – “Reuse + Recycle” In this case, the goal is to continue to use the whole product or parts of it and recycle it at the end: • because the products are modular, expendable parts can be exchanged and features added or retrofitted (e.g. armrest types, covers, cushions, surfaces). • connecting points in the product can be dismantled for easy repair. • where possible, we use pure materials that are marked as such, making them ideal for recycling. 4. Fairness – responsibility all along the line At Wilkhahn, environmental and social responsibility are inseparable.

Furthermore, Wilkhahn Wilkhahn uses various renewables in order to cut emissions chooses energy-efficient vehicles and replaces old vehicles at its Bad Münder headquarters. In 2018, 40% of the energy as soon as required. Wilkhahn picks efficiency-enhancing required to manufacture furniture and for the offices came technology such as an automatic start-stop system in all from climate-neutral district heating, photovoltaics and new vehicles.

In the 2013 reference year, this figure was lighting in parts of the manufacturing departments and in way above 450 tonnes. Two reasons for the significant drop Wilkhahn’s showroom. lie in the much lower mileage covered by the Wilkhahn ­vehicle fleet due to improved tour planning and more local Solvents (VOCs) Last year, approx. 6.1 tonnes of organic solvents were ­emitted into the environment at the Wilkhahn headquarters in Bad Münder. This equals a drop of 10% compared with the previous year. Table top manufacturing was responsible for approx. 4.1 tonnes and chair upholstery for 2 tonnes of organic solvent emissions. Therefore, the statutory emissions threshold of 15 tonnes of VOCs per year was more than complied with as regards varnishing and gluing in 2018 too. Due to the low quantities, no negative environmental impact is to be expected. Wilkhahn carries out regular workplace assessments to protect its employees. The potential health risks associated with processing materials containing solvents are preventWilkhahn has had an electricity charging station that enables short battery charging times at the Bad Münder headquarters since January 2018.

Residues and recycling In 2018, 400 tonnes of residues were produced at Wilkhahn’s Bad Münder site. This was a steep drop of 24% compared with the previous year. Compared with the 2013 reference year, this equals a decline in absolute quantities of 19% and of 27% when adjusted to take sales into account. About a third (29%) of the total was attributed to scrap wood including sawdust from table top manufacturing and pallets. At 32%, cardboard and cardboard boxes accounted for a high proportion and, at 22%, commercial waste was also significant. In 2018, at approx. 18 tonnes, less than 5% Since 2017, Wilkhahn has been increasingly choosing reusable packaging hazardous waste was produced. and therefore cutting resource consumption.
