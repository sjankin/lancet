Tradecorp is deeply committed to respecting human rights, labor rights, protecting the environment as well as combating corruption. In addition, Tradecorp continues supporting and implementing these Principles throughout our scope of influence. This is because we understand that Social Responsibility must be an intrinsic value within our company culture. Thanks to the acquisitions made by the Sapec Group during 2018 we have expanded our portfolio that will allow the further development of the Group, offering integrated crop management programs. These programs are defined to optimize crop yields through an efficient use of agriculture inputs while respecting the environment and health constraints. These acquisitions entail the rise of new needs and challenges related to the integration of the different companies. Our teams have come together to share ideas and experiences, to integrate structures and processes, and have worked together to strengthen and integrate those aspects that have made our companies successful.

Complying with human and labor rights, the environmental conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources, as well as anticorruption practices. OUR GROUPS OF INTEREST In order to select Tradecorp’s groups of interest, we have chosen those groups where the company’s activity has the greatest repercussions. The following groups of interest have been defined: Suppliers and partners Employees Client Society in general 10 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 11 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSABILITY ACTIONS IN 2018 CODE OF CONDUCT AND REPORTING CHANNELS APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: ALL SDG: 5, 8, 10 Diagnosis Since 2012, Tradecorp has implemented a code of conduct which complies with the legislation, rules and regulations of the countries and communities in which it operates. In addition, as a signatory of the Global Compact, it respects and supports the principles of this international initiative, the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the main conventions of the International Labor Organization. Policy The Code of Conduct is mainly based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Declaration of the International Labor Organization on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, on the United Nations Global Compact, and on the company’s mission, vision and strategy. Actions The Code of Conduct code is mandatory throughout the global employee platform. A personnel accepted it upon reading it. In particular, by default when accessing the platform, there is a notification that one has to read and then accept the document. Without reading and accepting they cannot operate within the system. Monitoring 100% of employees confirmed that they have read and accepted the Code of Conduct. The system generates an automatic tracking sheet to proof progress. In 2018, there was no irregularity or breach of the Code of Conduct reported to the complaint channel. During 2019, new actions are planned to implement compliance with the commitments laid out in the Corporate Social Responsibility policies. 12 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY’S DIVERSITY INDICATORS APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 6 SDG: 5, 8, 10 Diagnosis The United Nations Charter (1945) and the Declaration of Human Rights (1948) developed a fundamental idea for legal equality, as well as protection against discrimination. In accordance with this, Tradecorp promotes gender diversity, as well as the professional and personal development of its employees; ensuring equal opportunities. The company does not accept any type of discrimination in the professional field due to age, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, sexual orientation, social origin or disability. Policy This action is based on the Principle 6 of the Global Compact and the policy defined in our Code of Conduct, which clearly states that “discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical or mental, family situation, political opinion or any other issue that may lead to discrimination will not be tolerated. ” Actions The factors studied in our diversity analysis are: gender and age. Monitoring All Tradecorp staff worldwide have been considered for this analysis. The 2018 results were as follows: Global results Genger Age 559 397 Male X% under 30 73 X% between 30 & 39 182 162 Felame X% between 40 & 49 183 X% between 50 & 59 93 X% over 60 28 Asia Pacific 13 America 132 Global Corporate 61 Global Manufact. 169 MENA 19 Spain 81 Europe 84 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 13 DONATIONS TO NGOS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 SDG: 2, 3, 4, 15 Diagnosis Tradecorp has committed to fight against hunger, exclusion or disease, promoting education, defending social rights and protecting the environment. Policy Actions related NGO institutional donations are based on the values conveyed in our Code of Conduct. Actions Tradecorp supports and collaborates with relevant societal institutions that are not involved in situations or activities that could compromise the company’s reputation. In 2018, Tradecorp collaborated with different organizations that support adults and children in vulnerable situation or with significant illnesses, along with organizations that work for the conservation of the environment.

Building our company with people is what differentiates Tradecorp from other companies. In order to achieve company growth, promote innovation and be a benchmark for our stakeholders, all employees must actively participate in trainings that the company provides. Employees engage in their own development and keep up-to-date on the necessary knowledge and skills to promote professional progress and generate value to customers, shareholders and society as a whole. Policy These policies are based on the Human Resource Management Program in the company’s Road Book. Actions The MyGhrow program (which was launched in 2017) is still under development. The Individual Development Plan consists of an interview with an expert and the direct manager to review goals, evaluations and objectives that result in an Individual Development Plan as well as to develop suggestions for training and follow up courses. MyGhrow supports growth and increases development opportunities. The Trainee Program in Mexico aims to attract, retain and offer development opportunities to young people with potential, offering training and practice in our commercial area. Monitoring The previous year’s program in corporate competencies areas continues to be taught, as well as other trainings necessary for the development of different activities. In 2018, 1,723 training hours were taught, with a total of 263 attendees. 5 engineers from the first edition of our Trainee program were integrated as Commercial Technical Representative in the company. PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 15 LABOR RISK ANALYSIS APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 4 SDG: 3, 8 Diagnosis The Prevention of Occupational Risks Law is one of the European Union’s most advanced legislations dealing with matters of occupational health. However, the work related accident and death figures currently show that legal frameworks are of little use if they are not applied. That is precisely the reason why we develop all our activities with a high level of Health and Safety. This risk is mainly related to industrial activities, product storage and chemical product transportation to which the personnel, contractors and the general public are exposed. Policy Tradecorp considers that safety and health are key elements in the management of its operations. This is outlined in the “Work and Safety at Work Conditions” section which can be found in our Code of Conduct. Actions In January we began to measure accidents differently. On one hand, we measured the number of accidents, both minor (no medical leave) and serious, without dividing it by the number of workers as was done up to until now. On the other hand, we started to use the LTIFR indicator (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, the number of lost time injuries occurring in a workplace per 1 million hours worked) for each factory. This indicated that our standards offer a good safety measurement in our production centers and allows for comparison with similar international companies. This year, the central office employees participated in a mandatory occupational risks course which was associated with their jobs. 16 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Monitoring Our production units are inspected annually by the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certification standards. These are carried out through internal and external audits covering 100% of Albacete and Sanchidrian plant’s employees. This year 100% of central office employees participated in an occupational risks course which was associated with their jobs. Accident evolution in comparison to previous years: 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Minor Accidents (%) 8.94 4.8 7.7 13.3 7.5 5.94 Serious Accidents (%) 2.44 0 1.4 0 1.4 0 Good Practices Environmental, Social and Governance Prevenimos Engagement Analysis It is a program that encourages physical and mental Monthly, factories undergo a series of defined health care through programs such as: live healthy, indicators related to Environmental, Social and active breaks and learning to feed my body.

PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 17 DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF PRODUCTS FOR ORGANIC AGRICULTURE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 7, 8, 9 SDG: 9, 12 Diagnosis Tradecorp is a company committed to environmental conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. We work on products to reach the maximum potential in quality and crop yield, while maintaining sustainability as a priority. Policy This initiative relates to guidelines established in our Code of Conduct and to the principles of Global Compact which are related to environmental conservation and sustainable development. Actions In 2006, we began to work on the approval of our organic products by recognized entities. This guarantees the farmer that the product meets organic agriculture requirements. Every year, Ecocert Ibérica, a Spanish company belonging to Ecocert, carries out a technical verification of our products and a complete audit of our production plants, in which it thoroughly analyzes our production processes “in situ.” Today, many of our main products are approved for use in Organic Agriculture. Many of which fulfill both European standards (EC regulations 834/2007 and 889/2008) and the NOP (National Organic Program). 18 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Monitoring According to European standards (EC Regulations No. 834/2007 and 889/2008), in 2018 143 brands were approved for Organic Agriculture and 21 brands comply with the NOP (National Organic Program) standards, while 5 comply with JAS (Japanese standards).

Policy In order to comply with REACH regulations, we identified and managed the risks associated with substances that we manufacture and market in the European Union. We demonstrate how to safely use those substances and communicate all information related to risk management procedures to the parties involved. Actions The REACH regulation had three deadlines: November 30, 2010: deadline for substances manufactured or imported in quantities equal to or greater than 1,000 tons per year; or more than 100 tons per year for substances very toxic to aquatic organisms; or more than 1 ton per year for CMR substances (those substances with carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic properties). May 31, 2013: deadline for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 100-1,000 tons per year. May 31, 2018: deadline of the last registration, which covers substances in the tonnage band 1-100 tons/year. Monitoring As of May 31 2018, the last deadline established by the Regulation, Tradecorp had 100% of its substances registered, fully complying with this Regulation. In addition to the mandatory records, Tradecorp has integrated the REACH standards in the development of our processes. This is to guarantee high quality product continuity on the market while taking into account human health and the environment. PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 21 WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 7, 9 SDG: 6, 9, 13 Diagnosis Water is a scarce resource; therefore, the purification of waste water is necessary and a legally required reality. This directly affects the water quality of rivers, seas and oceans by preventing environmental and land deterioration. In our sector, water consumption analysis and the reuse and recycling are of special importance when analyzing our impact on the environment. Since the greatest water consumption occurs in our production plants, we have carried out a water consumption analysis that entails the reuse and recycling of water from our factories. Policy This action is aligned with our Code of Conduct, with the Environmental Management System, certified with ISO 14001: 2004, and with the principles related to the protection of the environment established by Global Compact. Actions In the Albacete factory we currently have two projects in process to recover water: Discharged water treatment: after the installation of the new treatment system in 2014, figures were consolidated in 2018. Thanks to this water treatment plant, we can guarantee that the water is completely purified and clean, and free of manufacturing waste. In addition, the resulting concentrate from the purification process is used as fertilizer, taking advantage of its agronomic value, reducing the amount of waste generated. Reuse of neutralized waters in the process of urea without biuret: During 2018 we have started a project to store this water and reuse it. Monitoring An external company is responsible for sampling and analyzing the spill water quarterly and without prior notice. In this quarterly analysis, compliance with the limit values for discharge to the public sewage system is controlled, as indicated in the Integrated Environmental Authorization, established by the Municipal Environmental Ordinance (OMMA) of the City of Albacete. During 2017/2018, water designated for cleaning purposes reached around half a million liters (434 m3). Since there was no capacity to store it and reuse it, it was discarded. With the new project to reuse water from the process of urea without biuret, we expect an estimated recovery of 25%. It is expected to reuse 108m3 of high-quality cleaning water that has been analyzed in internal and external laboratories. Although the impact is not economically significant, the company has decided to proceed due to the high environmental benefit. Percentage and total volume of water that is recycled and reused Sanchidrián factory 100% Of reused water Albacete factory 50% 100% Of reused water water that is treated 22 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 23 ACTIONS FOR THE ENERGY OPTIMIZATION AND EMISSION DECREASE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES:7 SDG: 7, 9, 13 Diagnosis At Tradecorp, we are aware of the importance of optimizing natural resources to fight against climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Due to this, Tradecorp is looking for ways to save energy and reduce gas emissions. Policy The actions described in this section are in line with our ISO 14001: 2004 certification and with the environmental principles included in our Code of Conduct. Actions We conduct annual audits and periodic internal studies related to optimizing energy and reducing emissions. The conclusions drawn from these studies constantly allow us to implement improvements that contribute to environmental conservation. 24 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Monitoring Installation of inverters in drying tower fans Introducing inverters will reduce the electrical consumption of the two turbine engines, adapting the tower’s air production to the drying air needs of the product, achieving an energy savings of 16 MWh per year. Thermal insulation improvement in boiler room The feed tank has been isolated, so that it is maintained at 50°C, achieving an energy reduction of 10.7 MWhPCS per year. Good practices LIGHTING In the Tradecorp plants there are different lighting technologies. Overall, the process areas are illuminated with LED technology, a practice that is recommended from an energy efficiency point of view. In addition, skylights are also available improving the quality of lighting with natural light. PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 25 MANAGEMENT AND MINIMIZATION OF WASTE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 7 SDG: 12, 14, 15 Diagnosis Tradecorp’s production processes in Albacete facilities are based on the manufacture of liquid fertilizers of high agronomic value. As a result of the manufacture of our products, certain wastes are generated. Some of them are considered dangerous. Policy All our actions are in line with our ISO 14001: 2004 certification and with the environmental principles included in our Code of Conduct. Actions Replacement of Solid Raw Material by Liquids To minimize hazardous waste and to reduce the risks associated with the formulation of certain products, a project has been carried out to replace two solid raw materials. This way, some hazardous waste is eliminated, because the raw material is received in tanker vehicles and stored in specific tanks, under the regulations for the storage of chemical products (APQ, in Spain). Some raw materials are considered “dangerous products,” therefore their packaging is a contaminated waste that must be handled by an authorized manager. The environmental advantage of eradicating a source of hazardous waste generation by drastically reducing the amount of waste per unit produced (manufacturing + solids + packaging) is considerable. Reduction of cardboard waste with new packing machine During 2017 a new packing machine was installed in the Sanchidrián factory, allowing to change the packing and eliminating the cardboard box that came with the product. This measure allowed for a reduction of cardboard waste, both at our factory (reduced defective supplier boxes, damaged boxes during the process or storage and surplus boxes of each packaging) and on the market. Additionally, the quantity packed per pallet was increased. Good Practices Recycling of containers Recapacicla is program to reduce, reuse and tested on the basis of DIN EN 13432: 2000-12 recycle paper in Mexico. 110 kg of paper have to help preserve and conserve the ecosystem. been correctly managed. We reaffirm our commitment to the environment Plastic is an expensive and complicated material and renew the Amocali A.C Clean Field to recycle. Eight million tons of this material each membership. We commit to transport 100% year end up in the oceans, mainly, light packaging. of the container waste we generate per year, For years we have used single-use plastic cups thus ensuring that the final destination of our with the coffee machines available in the central containers is adequate. offices. In 2018, we began to use reusable Bio Compostable Cups with the 7PO561 Certificate, 26 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Monitoring Replacement of Solid Raw Materials by Liquids After comparing the consumption of these raw materials, here are the results: Solid potassium hydroxide Solid sodium hydroxide 01/01/17 13/11/17 3615,16 kg 01/01/17 13/11/17 911,19 kg 01/01/17 13/11/18 3016,60 kg 598,56 kg 01/01/17 13/11/18 54,82 kg 856,37 kg This means that in less than a year, the amount of hazardous waste generated was reduced 1,454.93kg Minimization of hazardous waste by previous condensation to vacuum pumps in the distillation process Given that certain cleanups have been made during the change, the real benefits of this change will be seen in 2019. The first data obtained represents a 10% reduction in waste, although it is expected to be considerably higher.

Policy This is reflected in our Global Compact commitment and our Code of Conduct. Actions Tradecorp has invested in studies and collaborated with over 15 international universities, along with many other prestigious research centers, with the objective of offering better agricultural solutions that are more environmentally sustainable. Biostimulants research for more productive and sustainable agriculture One of our goals is to gain more knowledge about the effect of biostimulants to improve crop tolerance to different types of abiotic stresses. We conducted trials with different types of products, such as seaweeds and amino acids. In the case of seaweed products, Tradecorp works with manually harvested seaweed, so as not to damage the ecosystem while promoting rapid regeneration. This manual way of harvesting, along with our exclusive Gentle Extraction process that preserves active ingredients without added chemical, allows for products like Phylgreen to have excellent agronomic results. For example, trials conducted in potato in Australia have shown increases in production of up to 32%, as well as a significant decrease in the number of malformations of these tubers. Our biostimulants portfolio, also include amino acids that are 100% from vegetable origin. These plant origin amino acids are especially directed to markets where regulations constrain the use of amino acids to plant origin and markets where the use of plant origin products is being promoted. Iron correction and gradual biodegradability One of our most innovative projects related to the development of more efficient products that need less agricultural inputs is IsliFe 8.2. IsliFe 8.2 is the first iron chelate that combines persistence and gradual biodegradability to deal with iron deficiencies in the most unfavorable conditions, such as alkalinity conditions. IsliFe 8.2 is the product of over a decade of research. Thanks to its exclusive chelating agent, IsliFe 8.2 has a unique quality: gradual biodegradability, which combines biodegradability with a high constant stability, allowing for a high iron availability throughout the crop cycle. Since 2014, more than 30 agronomic trials have been carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the product. Monitoring Our commitment to innovation translates into an investment that is around 5% of our turnover in R&D projects. 28 PART II CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WORK-LIFE BALANCE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES: 2, 4,6 SDG: 3, 5, 8 Diagnosis Tradecorp often mentions work reconciliation, personal and family life, gender equality, female leadership... Effective gender equality along with non-discrimination are a commitment of The Board. Policy This action is in line with section 8 in article 34 of the Spanish Worker’s Statute. Actions Tradecorp currently has a flexible working day. Employees have the right to adapt the duration and distribution of the working day to enforce their right to conciliate personal, family and work life. The use of continuous working hours, flexible hours along with other ways of organizing breaks and work time are promoted. Monitoring This year a new facility access control has been implemented.
