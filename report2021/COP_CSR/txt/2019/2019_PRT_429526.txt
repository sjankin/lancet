Statement from the Board our long standing commitment of Directors 1.1. Statement from the Board of Directors Paula Amorim Chairman of the Board of Directors Dear Shareholders, In 2018, Galp continued to fulfill its ambitions, remaining focused on executing its strategy, ensuring that the Company is well positioned in the global energy landscape, developing its projects according to the best practices and creating sustainable value for all stakeholders. It is consensual that the global energy mix will continue to evolve over the coming decades, and that energy companies will play a key role in promoting the transition to a lower carbon economy. While energy demand continues to grow, companies are being required to reduce their carbon footprint, with projections indicating that renewables and other low carbon businesses will grow substantially in the long term. Nonetheless, hydrocarbons are expected to continue to represent a predominant share of energy demand. In this transformation scenario, it is vital that companies focus on increasing productivity, competitiveness and overall efficiency of their operations and processes, namely through digitalisation and technological modernisation. Galp is looking to the future with enthusiasm, focusing on opportunities but mindful of the challenges. The Company continues to benefit from its integrated model, supported on a resilient and sustainable upstream and downstream portfolio, which remains the foundation for future growth. We continue to provide the Company with people and tools, promoting our values and ambition to grow and optimise our operations, leveraging the Company’s financial strength. We aim to reach more consumers, new markets, new businesses and even different applications for our businesses and products, whilst preserving the essence of our core business. 12 Galp Energective The Galp brand Financial performance Corporate governance Proposal for Appendices allocation of results Galp’s ability to execute its strategy has been appreciated I am grateful to all shareholders for their trust in this by investors and Galp’s share price evolution confirms the project and our partners for working together with us in potential of our approach, with an annualised shareholder shaping the future of energy.

Statement from the Board our long standing commitment of Directors Carlos Gomes da Silva CEO Dear Stakeholders, During 2018, the energy sector faced once again significant volatility, with oil prices varying by more than $30/bbl throughout the year. This volatility reinforces the importance of our integrated business model. The strategic planning approach supported on different scenarios serves as an important tool for ensuring the resilience and sustainability of Galp’s portfolio. The Company’s strategy continues focused on executing the projects where it is present, extracting the maximum value and exploring new ventures which add sources of sustainable value to our portfolio. Although fossil fuels will remain the predominant means to meet primary energy demand during the coming decades, the world is undergoing an energy transition, facing the challenges of providing society with cleaner and reliable sources of energy, while reducing emissions. With this in mind, Galp is incorporating into its strategy investments to reduce its carbon intensity. Galp is pursuing this strategy by wagering on technology, digital and innovation as levers to transform the current business model, developing new businesses in the fields of mobility, energy efficiency and convenience, and investing in primary energy generation through renewable sources, always aspiring to provide a distinct and unique experience to our clients and consumers.

Addressing materiality our long standing commitment 1.5. Addressing materiality At Galp, we implement a set of processes to identify and prioritise material topics related to sustainability. These issues allow us to continuously update and review how material topics create value to the organisation and its stakeholders. Materiality The material topics are those that are considered more relevant, as they reflect the economic, social and environmental impacts of the organisation, or they influence substantially the stakeholders’ evaluations and decisions. The materiality is the threshold that defines which topics are relevant enough to be reported. Source: Global Reporting Initiative This materiality analysis process includes four major steps: Consulting external stakeholders for evaluation of material topics. External assessment Consulting internal stakeholders for evaluation of material topics. Internal Alignment with Company assessment values, policies and commitments. Positioning of several topics as a result of stakeholder and internal consideration. Materiality The matrix guides and prioritizes matrix company strategic decisions, and consequently defines our sustainability reporting. Trend analysis and of emerging issues. Identification Benchmarking analysis of material with peers and leading topics companies. 24 Galp Energective The Galp brand Financial performance Corporate governance Proposal for Appendices allocation of results The identification of material topics is done through a comprehensive materiality analysis process, reviewed systematically, using the following guidelines: • The Global Reporting Initiative; • The 5-Part Materiality Test, proposed by AccountAbility, the United Nations Environment Programme and the Stakeholder Research Associates. This approach guides our understanding of the main challenges we face, and those that have an effect on the organisation’s capacity to create long-term value. The identified methodologies are the basis for the construction of the materiality matrix, reviewed in 2017, that prioritises the most relevant aspects to our business and stakeholders.

Galp Integrated Report 2018 89 The Galp brand To our stakeholders Strategic framework Strategic execution Sustainability, our long standing commitment 5.1. 40 years of the Galp brand In the current era of the ephemeral, immediate satisfaction and instant deadlines, the Galp brand, which was created exactly 40 years ago, was able to maintain its relevance because, in key moments, it was able to anticipate or respond to the trends of its time, transforming itself in order to respond to the challenges that history has put up. The creation of the brand itself resulted from the need to humanise and give commercial coherence to the company resulting from the process that, in the years following the April 1974 revolution in Portugal, gave rise to Petrogal through the merger of the companies that had set up the entire oil sector: Sonap, Sacor, Cidla and Petrosul. This is how, in 1978, the Galp brand was born. By its genesis and position in the Portuguese market, the Brand stood as an important reference from the very beginning, with a dynamic and irreverent attitude, well reflected in the choice of the strong and extroverted colours it showed to the world, trying to shake off the difficult times that were being lived. Throughout its history, instead of adopting a reactive stance, the brand has always positioned itself as a vehicle for mobilising major societal movements, both in terms of behavioural changes, namely the adoption of more environmentally friendly practices, or in terms of more competitive energy sources. The Brand’s longevity and of any brand mainly depends on the ability of the company behind it to permanently provide the most relevant products and services to its customers lives and to value them, not only for what they are, but for what they represent in this case, a more comfortable, easier, more efficient and productive life concept. An essential factor in this path was that the Brand has always known how to keep coherence between what the company was, and how it as evolved, and the messages transmitted to society. 92 Galp Energective The Galp brand Financial performance Corporate governance Proposal for Appendices 5.1. 40 years of allocation of results the Galp brand The firm steps of a great Brand Since the introduction of the Brand, the market grew and Galp anticipated the new reality, attracting consumers and reducing distances. With the overall market experiencing a strong expansion, and with the release of new brands, Galp began to tread a path of differentiation more than ever, including the way it communicated with its public, conquering territory and taking a prominent position in the market. The communication strategy had a strong focus towards youngsters, a target audience that was quite unlikely at the time, but which began to get the Brand’s attention in a movement that was innovative, disruptive and clearly an indicator of Galp’s ability to anticipate scenarios and design its future positioning. An initial contact, an engagement and an acquaintance were projected, which would extend for future generations and would make the Galp brand one of the public’s favourites. In the early 90’s, with a renewed awareness of the importance of the Brand and its perception by the public, Galp committed to creating a visual identity that was sustained and strategically aligned with Petrogal’s industrial production and Galp’s commercial offer. So much so that, with the absorption of Gás de Portugal by Petrogal at the end of that decade, the name of the combined company did not reflect the name of any of the companies which it originated from. It was from the brand itself that the new company was founded. And that’s how Galp Energia was born. At the beginning of the new millennium, the Galp brand reinvents itself and embarks on a new path of approach to the consumer with a promise that goes far beyond the product, an emotional and intangible offer your positive energy, which became the Brand’s signature. Its consumers have this energy themselves and this positive attitude towards life.

Since Galp prepares its financial statements in Euros, this factor, among others, exposes its operations to exchange-rate risk. Given that the operating margin is most sensitive to the US dollar, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, which can contribute positively or negatively to income and margins. Since this is a currency risk associated to other variables, such as the price of oil and natural gas, the Group takes a cautious approach to hedging risk, as there are natural hedges between the statement of financial position and cash flows. The level of exposure of cash flows and especially the statement of financial position is a function of the price levels of oil and natural gas. As a result of the above, Galp controls its exchange-rate exposure on an integrated basis rather than on each operation exposed to exchange risk, except in some specific cases. The purpose of exchange-rate risk management is to limit the uncertainty resulting from variations in exchange rates. As of 31 December 2018, Galp held derivatives such as FX Forwards and Swaps to hedge exchange rate risk (Note 18).

Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: a) identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; b) obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Entity’s internal control; Statutory Audit Report and Auditors’ Report Galp Energia SGPS, SA December 31, 2018 PwC 3 of 6 290 Galp Energective The Galp brand Financial performance Corporate governance Proposal for Appendices allocation of results 9.5.b.

The complexity index of each unit is calculated by the multiplication of the complexity factor Transformation through a breaking down of the hydrocarbon with the unit’s capacity. The complexity of a refinery is equivalent molecules in long chains, with the objective of obtaining to the weighted average of the complexity index of each one of its hydrocarbon molecules in shorter chains, thus increasing the units, including the distillation units.
