In 2017 the BSW transferred income tax amounting to USD8.4 million (Br16.2 million), USD22 million (Br42.5 million) to the population social protection fund), real estate tax amounting to USD10 million (Br19.4 million). 49 48 Enterprise’s risks Investment risks at the metal market; Any project implementation is associated – production costs, which depend on prices with certain organizational, technological and for melting stock, energy resources and financial risks. However, the investment projects other materials and services essential for the launched by OJSC «BSW — management production processes; company of «BMC» holding» are implemented – investment amounts which largely depend at an operating enterprise which has sufficient on contractual prices of equipment; experience in use of the process equipment – debt-to-equity ratio. and construction of new production facilities. The sensitivity analysis included evaluations That’s why the organizational, technical and concerned with the ways in which the above technological risks are of little significance in factors influence on two major efficiency this case. High qualifications of the enterprise’s indices – simple pay-back period and internal employees, application of modern technological, rate of return. organizational and administrative solutions Legal risks in the production activities ensure enhanced Like any other economic entity, the enterprise is efficiency and sustainability of the implemented a participant of tax legal relationships. Currently, projects against probable contingencies, while the Tax Code and a number of the laws regulating availability of invested funds makes it possible various taxes and fees established at the to minimize any financial risks. republican and local level in Republic of Belarus, To mitigate and account for probable risk various tax laws and regulations are in effect effects in business-plans, the Company carries and subject to frequent changes, additions, out multi -variant calculations to identify the amendments. At that, the amendments are on the financial-economic state of Belarusian significance. Alongside with that, resource-saving projects’ financial performance and efficiency partly for the benefit of taxpayers and partly steel-making as most of raw materials consumed technologies introduced at industrial enterprises indicators against various variable factors – to their disadvantage. Similar situation is by steel works are imported. result in relatively reduced scrap production rates (capital input amounts, product sale price, input observed in the field of tax administration. Due to boom-and-bust economy in the next in developed countries with simultaneous growth costs, debt-to-equity ratios). However, taken the state’s attempt to ensure a years, 19-21 potential risks of cyclic price of demand for unused metal. Consequently, Results of the cost efficiency evaluation given in sustainable growth of production rates and the reduction being typical of the metal industry, Europe is experiencing an unsatisfied demand for the project were calculated for the basic pricing stable political situation, a significant increase are constantly increasing. At the same time, metallurgic raw materials, such as scrap metal. conditions effective at the time of business plan in the enterprise’s total tax burden in the near there is an increase in global market prices Planned steelmaking industry expansion preparation. However, as projects proceed to future is highly improbable. Due to complex for primary raw materials and consumables (increases of melting capacities at the already subsequent stages of implementation, these updating of the Tax Code, it is expected to used by the plant, namely for scrap metal, existing plants, construction of new enterprises pricing conditions could change due to global introduce a number of novelties which simplify cast iron and ferroalloys. Reduction of prices equipped with electric furnaces), first of all, in economic changes. Based on the above, it was tax administration and ensure stability of the tax for metal products with simultaneous increase the European part of the Russian Federation, important and essential to carry out a reliability law, simplicity and clearness of legal regulations of raw materials prices significantly affects aggravate the situation even more and could (sensitivity) analysis, providing for evaluation promoting economic activity. the enterprise’s operational activities and its result in total termination of scrap metal supplies of possible effects on project efficiency due to In order to minimize the risks, the financial performance. from the Russian Federation. Besides, supplies variations of external factors and identification enterprise performs monitoring and analysis of Along with the price variations in the global of this kind of raw materials in most countries of acceptable and critical scopes of changes. changes in the tax law, evaluates and predicts metallurgical industry, steelmaking faces risks are either substantially monopolized (in Belarus When carrying out the sensitivity analysis, the scope of potential impact of such changes of excessive production capacities. Currently, for instance, these activities are represented possible changes in the following factors of on its activity, thereby the probability of tax risk a bunch of new large enterprises appeared all by a single enterprise – Belvtormet) or under major influence on economic indicators were formation is estimated as low. around the world. A great number of leading a stringent state control (licensing of activities, considered: Industry risks producers have plans for a substantial expansion setting export – selling Metallurgic industry is distinguished by its of their production capacities, particularly, those quotas, export price as a susceptibility to cyclic variations of prices for associated with manufacture of reinforcing bars. duties levied). factor which raw materials and steel. Demand for steel With a view to advances in steel production As a result, is most is determined by country-specific levels of technologies and transition from blast-furnace consumers susceptible to economic development and consumption by and open-hearth furnace melting of cast irons and are rather changes due major steel-consuming industries. Variations in steels to electric furnace melting, giving steels of dependent to variations raw materials prices are of significant influence improved quality, scrap metal acquires still more on a limited 50 51 group of scrap suppliers and/or bound by certain opportunities for steel raw material supplies. geographical limits of scrap-supplying regions. Lately, metallurgic enterprises are more and Risk of growth in exports from China. more actively engaging in modernization of Liberalization of the Chinese real estate the equipment installed at the enterprises of market brought new investments into this their scrap metal suppliers and in activities in sector and provided the Chinese metallurgists connection with take-over of the most efficient with temporary new orders, but it led to scrap-producing companies. a speculative warming up of the market. So, it is possible to minimize the above risks Currently, the Chinese metallurgists are aimed by developing a scrap-producing network of at satisfaction of domestic demand. However, one’s own. Industry risk management should be when the local market is saturated, there will based on establishing long-term and mutually be a problem with sale of finished products beneficial relations with major suppliers and and then there will be a reorientation to the optimization of procurement and resource external consumer. management processes. Also degradation of the situation was The fact that metal production is partly intended influenced by doubts of many market players for in-country supplies, where prices are concerning the reality of fulfillment by China regulated by the state, accounts for respective its plans for achievement of 150 million tons risks, which, just like on foreign markets, are of capacities. Decrease in domestic demand in associated with possible negative effects due the People’s Republic of China at the existing to price variations. And this could produce a production volumes will strongly press on certain effect on the enterprise’s activities. other export markets in other regions that However, with a view to gradual transition to will also lead to negative scenario of market the market-controlled price setting observed in development. the republic, it is possible to consider this risk as In 2018, there is a trend of introduction of negligible. various measures (duties, quotas, licenses, etc.) Country and regional risks in the world steel industry with the purpose Production and business activities of OJSC to protect domestic markets against «unfair «BSW — management company of «BMC» exporters».

The EMS system adopted by the enterprise was certified for compliance with the requirements of standards ISО 14001:2004 and STB ISO 14001-2005. The requirements of ISО 14001:2004 cover such activities as design and production of rolled sections and structural shapes, wire rod, seamless pipes, steel cord, wire and steel fiber. The requirements of STB ISO 14001-2005 cover production of concast billet, section and shaped materials, wire rod, seamless pipes, steel cord, steel wire and fiber. This is the evidence of the systematic approach implemented to reduce ecological risk probability, minimize ecological payments, represent the BSW as an ecologically responsible enterprise and improve interaction with the stakeholders on issues of ensuring compliance with ecological regulations and requirements. In addition to the currently effective approved medium-term ecological programs, the BSW provides for annual development and approval by respective supervision authorities of ecological control programs and environmental protection plans, which, among other things, envisage regular ecological monitoring and control activities in accordance with the Instruction on Environmental Control of Production, rational use of natural resources. Use of natural resources and environmental protection at the enterprise are managed by administrative control actions and economic methods. 58 59 Implementation of ecological strategy (Elytrigiarepens) among the ruderal types. arvensis), a whinchat(Saxicola rubetra), a Description of the fauna of the territory gray wren-babbler (Sylvia communis), yellow Minimizing the plant’s impact and a part of which is represented by concerned is given based on the literary data. hammer (Emberiza citrinella).
