Their activities are underpinned by a philosoPRODUCTS MADE phy that spans many generations and it is this that FROM RENEWABLE provides the basis for how Metsä Group carries out the management and development of its business. RAW MATERIALS During 2015–2018, Metsä Group carried out a EUR 2 billion investment programme, which has significantly increased the volume of products made from renewable raw materials that are offered to the global markets. In 2018, we clarified Metsä Group’s strategy and renewed our sustainability objectives and targets. Our new sustainability targets will be taken into use in 2019. We will account for all aspects of sustainability in an equal manner. We must be able to reconcile financial aspects with ecological and social responsibility. Our business operations aim at increasing financial value for our owners, and the achievement of this goal enables the forest industry to create a significant amount of value for the surrounding society. Society benefits from the sourcing of the raw materials and the recruitment of workers required for the operations, as well as the tax income generated by the profitable business operations. The forest industry and Metsä Group must remain an important part of our society, contributing to future development needs. Metsä Group is one of Finland’s largest forest management service suppliers, and our wide range of services enables us to influence the ecological sustainability of forestry. Developing the resource efficiency of mills is part of our daily work, and something which we will never finish. Rather, in the spirit of continuous improvement, we will keep setting our goals even higher. 4 METSÄ GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 KEY FIGURES 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 Sales, EUR million 5,709 5,040 4,658 5,016 4,970 4,938 Comparable operating result, EUR million 849 566 439 537 418 343 Comparable ROCE, % 16.8 12.3 10.2 13.6 11.4 9.1 Equity ratio, % 53.1 45.0 43.9 43.2 37.9 37.9 Net gearing ratio, % 13 34 40 25 46 77 Investments, EUR million 272 608 758 492 143 214 Research and development, EUR million 18 18 18 18 18 18 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Our goals must meet international agreements and commitments.

LESS TERRAIN DAMAGE WITH HARVESTABILITY MAPS Harvestability maps are forecasts of the ground’s load-bearing capacity based on permanent terrain conditions. They have been developed in cooperation with practically the whole Finnish forest sector and Metsä Forest was the first to adapt them to use. In 2018, harvestability maps were also included to the forestry plans in our Metsäverkko web service available to our owner-members. Harvestability maps are used in all stages of forest work. With harvestability maps, we can identify sites which can be harvested during a dry summer and which need the ground to be frozen, for example. This helps to prevent terrain damages. Simultaneously we can improve the year-round utilisation of our entrepreneurs’ machinery and thus improve their business profitability and ability to employ. 18 METSÄ GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 CONSTRUCTING SUSTAINABLE WORLD The role of wood construction in urbanising world is strengthening, as importance of sustainability in built environments is growing.

A SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVE TO BUBBLE WRAP The international packaging design competition, Better with Less – Design Challenge by Metsä Board, was to find new environmentally-friendly and functional packaging solutions for some of the world’s most frequently used and fastest growing types of consumer packages. The competition inspired designers around the world with an impressive 302 design concepts from 38 different countries. The winning design ‘Stretching Inner Part’ by Iiro Numminen, introduces an ingenious alternative to bubble wrap. It allows variable sized products to be packed without the need for bubble wrap. This versatile product could be used to pack various types of items and it ensures that the product stays attached to the package during transportation.

The competitiveness of the traditional mill is ensured through continuous improvement and investments. In recent years Mänttä mill has invested in renewable energy among other things. In 2017, Metsä Tissue started the renewing of deinking plant at the Mänttä mill. As a result of the renewal, de-inking sludge, a side stream generated in the purification process of recycled paper, can be used in energy production which naturally reduces the use of other fuels. Additionally, in 2019, liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be introduced at the mill to replace the use of liquefied petroleum gas in the drying process of tissue paper. This will further reduce the mill’s carbon dioxide emissions. “Mänttä mill has always been development-minded and wanted to ensure the quality of its operations. We continuously strive to improve our environmental performance and to develop our operations so that we’ll be producing tissue and cooking papers sustainably in the future, too,” says Kari Karttunen, Mill Manager, Mänttä mill. 22 METSÄ GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 RESHAPING THE FOREST-BASED BIOECONOMY Metsä Group established an innovation company called Metsä Spring in 2018.

A GOOD NUMBER OF POTENTIAL IDEAS During its first half year between June and December 2018 Metsä Spring already had approximately fifty new ideas submitted for consideration. They vary from manufacturing-based businesses to businesses based on digital applications. Metsä Spring evaluates new potential proposals. During the early stages of the company, process to manage the ideas submitted was developed. The assessment work had to start immediately, as ideas came in right from the first day. All fifty initiatives are worthy of careful research to fully understand the potential of them. Most of the ideas were submitted from outside Metsä Group and one-third of the ideas were submitted from outside of Finland, for example United States and Japan.

The project investigates the ability of pulp and paper mills’ fibre sludge side stream to stabilise soil aggregate structure consequently reduce erosion and nutrient leaching through a clay soil profile. Field experiment was started in autumn 2015 and it continues to year 2019. Fibre sludge products decreased nutrition leaching risk and erosion remarkably, even 77% compared to the first year of the field experiment. The effectiveness remains high, 50–74% decrease in leaching risk, in following two years. Investigation proves that the wood-based recycled products can have an important role to reduce nutrient leaching from the fields into watercourses. Improving soil with recycled materials is a cost-effecient way to help farmers improve crop yields.

The training tour, which included almost 40 occasions, focused on the importance of occupational safety, environmental issues, customer service and good harvesting. Particular attention was given to the requirements of the forest certification criteria and the newly introduced harvestability maps. During the field-based part of the training, the participants rehearsed how wide a buffer zone should be left to protect a brook and maintain its’ biological values. By means of such trainings, Metsä Group wants to ensure that the quality of harvesting work remains at a high level even though harvesting volumes have increased. “I think it is positive that Metsä Group takes care of drivers’ skills. In the forest, every day is about learning, but common training reinforces knowledge and ensures that we work towards common goals”, states entrepreneur Marko Marin.

CONTROLLED BURNING FOR BIODIVERSITY While several countries around the world fought forest fires in 2018, forestry experts in Finland conducted prescribed burning of regeneration areas and retention tree groups to maintain biodiversity of forests. Due to effective firefighting, the habitats for the species depending on charred wood would almost disappear without this approach to active nature management in Finland. In the 1960s, controlled burning was a popular method in forest regeneration, but as it is a laborious method it was almost forgotten for decades. Prescribed burning is also an important way to become familiar with the behaviour of fire in wooded areas and therefore help to fight forest fires. “Now the need for controlled burning has again increased due to forest certification criteria. Controlled burning is one of the ways to maintain the biodiversity of forests. While burning the area, the retention and decaying trees form charred large-diameter wood, which benefits many insect species“, explains Operations Manager Arto Tähkävuori. 34 METSÄ GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 NEW GUIDELINES TO CONSIDER BIRD-LIFE In the spring of 2018, Metsä Group updated its guidelines on how to consider bird-life in forest management and harvesting. The key objective is to ensure that both employees and contractors work according to a common operating model and are aware of how to consider bird-life when operating in forests during the nesting period. To minimise the disturbance during the nesting period, the most efficient way is to select the right harvesting place. “The number of nesting birds is largest in lush forests with deciduous trees. That is why we try to avoid logging on such sites during the nesting period. If, for some reason, harvesting needs to take place during the nesting time, we will follow our new guidelines to check the area in advance to observe possible nesting”, states Operations Specialist Vesa Tuominen, an active birdwatcher himself. If a nest is found during forestry operations, the surroundings of the nest will be left untreated. In accordance with the new instructions, the nest is marked on the terrain and in the map application so that the nest can be preserved in the next loop of the chain, such as a harvester driver or an excavator operator.

IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE LIME KILN AT HUSUM MILL During 2018 Metsä Board’s mill at Husum, Sweden, made improvements to its lime kiln. A new Low-NOx burner was installed to improve the combustion and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Thanks to this investment and previous improvements, the mill is now able to run with at least 20% lower NOx emissions to air compared to year 2017 and meet the very strict requirements set in the mill’s environmental permit. 44 METSÄ GROUP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE PARTICLE FOSSIL CO2 EMISSIONS EMISSIONS AT KEMI PULP MILL Metsä Fibre’s mill in Kemi, Finland, has been improving the electrostatic DECREASED BY precipitators (ESP) which remove the particles from the flue gases of 45% the mill’s recovery boiler.

The bioproduct mill in Äänekoski is now fully operational 12 and as a result the area now receives more heavy vehicle traffic. We want to contribute to promoting 9 transport safety by visiting the schools in the area. 6 More than 600 children from the schools attended the events and saw first-hand a big timber 3 truck parked in their school yard. Students were encouraged to make independent observations and 0 consider the impacts of more traffic. All first-graders attending the events were given high-visibility 14 15 16 17 18 vests and reflectors. In addition, the pupils and teachers were given information packs that allowed them and their families to brush up on matters related to transport safety. SAFETY AGENTS SUPPORTING MAINTENANCE SHUTDOWNS Metsä Group’s new bioproduct mill had its first annual maintenance shutdown in May 2018. Safety was supported by special safety agents from Metsä Fibre’s other pulp mills. Safety agents attend to maintenance shutdowns to provide coaching, support, guidance and information. In practice, they set an example and inspire their colleagues to work safely at the field, in addition to participating in internal safety assessments at mills. The first safety agents were selected from a group of volunteers and provided with training in 2017. Their work started in 2018.
