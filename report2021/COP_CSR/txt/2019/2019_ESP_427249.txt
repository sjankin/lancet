EBITDA and recurrent cash flow, placing us in the upper tier of these forecasts. I also believe that we must again continue to Marco Patuano (MP): A key aspect in this financial year that we highlight this year the team’s ability to strike a balance between are closing was the reconfiguration of the Group’s shareholder managing growth, which continues to be intense in terms of structure following the divestment of Abertis and the entry of expanding the perimeter in 2018 we incorporated c.2,500 ConnecT, with a 29.9% stake, as the company’s main shareholder. new sites while maintaining the focus on like-for-like business This also had implications for corporate governance. I will come management. back to this later. Tobias Martinez (TM): Indeed, as the Chairman has pointed out, As far as the day-to-day running of the company is concerned, I the dynamics of Cellnex remain marked by both the expanding would underline the solidity of Cellnex and that of the management perimeter and the organic growth components. In terms of team which is able to align objectives with results. We have closed organic growth, we continue to display very solid indicators in the a year during which we fulfilled the forecasts we shared with the region of a 5% increase in the amount of equipment deployed at our sites, and an increase of 3% in customers per site. Furthermore, consolidated data continues to reflect double-digit growth in revenues with c.15% and in EBITDA with c.20%, which indicate how the company’s portfolio continues to grow, driven, by the incorporation of new assets in France within the framework of our agreements with Bouygues Telecom or in Spain with the integration of Xarxa Oberta de Catalunya (XOC), for example. In relation to inorganic growth we might think that 2018 marked a pause in Cellnex’s growth operations. Is this correct? TM: First of all, I would highlight that in 2018, as I said before, the company continued to develop the agreements reached with our customers in terms of integrating sites and new roll-outs; in France, for example, we have commitments to roll out new infrastructures in the next years, in the wake of the agreement with Bouygues Telecom that we announced last December. Also in this regard it is worth pointing out that cumulative investments this past year reached c.600 million; so the company is still expanding its asset base. Therefore I would not talk about a pause so much as a consolidation of our growth. It is worth remembering that from 2015 until the close of 2018 we have announced or undertaken growth investments to the tune of more than € 3.5 billion. Marco Patuano, Chairman GRI: 102-14 6 Interview with the President and CEO 01 02 03 04 In relative terms, if we compare 2018 with 2017, it is true that we convertible bonds, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the 05 have announced fewer growth projects, although these are very transformational profile of one or more operations could lead at significant from a strategic point of view, such as the incorporation some stage to a capital increase. 06 of the XOC fibre optic network or the new agreement with 07 Bouygues Telecom. This agreement reinforces our strategic Chairman, you foresaw that one key element in the relationship with the French operator while it also positions us in a financial year would be the change in the shareholding key segment for the future roll-out of 5G, providing the possibility structure and consequently in the corporate governance to host data processing capacity in new strategic communications of Cellnex. What would you underline within this process? centres that we will deploy in France. MP: Indeed, Cellnex’s new shareholder structure is one of the MP: I would add to what the CEO has said that there is an factors that marked financial year 2018. I think we can define the undercurrent in the telecommunications infrastructures sector in new situation as one of consolidation and stability, following the Europe which we understand will see continued outsourcing of divestment of Abertis and the entry of ConnecT with Edizione, assets by operators while we will also progressively see greater Adia and GiC as shareholders. sharing of certain elements of the communications networks associated with the roll-out of 5G. In this regard, Europe is clearly Here I would like to underscore two messages that are consistent a market rich with opportunities for operators like Cellnex and we both with the strategy that Cellnex has been following since its remain attentive to the opportunities that this market can offer flotation in 2015 and with the wishes expressed by the new us. In fact, one could say that we know how to wait patiently for shareholders. Firstly, Cellnex is an industrial project that has led opportunities to come along. to the creation of a European telecommunications infrastructure operator with the capacity and the will to build long-term You have repeatedly mentioned the company’s growth partnerships with its customers in the various markets in which strategy. In terms of financing, there is a limit to growth it operates. Secondly, Cellnex is a growth project whose medium with recourse to debt. What kind of instruments are and long-term perspectives, and the criteria by which they must available to the company to accompany this growth? be governed, are shared by the Board of Directors and by the company’s management team. In this connection I think it is TM: First of all, we must underline the liquidity which the company worth pointing out that, as a reference shareholder, ConnecT has continues to have by combining the undrawn debt with cash explicitly stated its commitment to the company’s industrial and and bank funds, which provides us with € 1.5 billion in available growth strategy as well as committing the resources that may be liquidity. This clearly provides us some leeway to react quickly to necessary to accompany that strategy. any opportunities that the market can offer. As regards Corporate Governance, the incorporation of ConnecT That said, it is no less true that Cellnex has to keep its accounts has led to a reshuffle in the Board of Directors that has also allowed well balanced by also taking into consideration certain key aspects us to align Cellnex with best practices in good governance. such as maintaining its “cross over” rating and foreseeable developments in the interest rate curve. The company uses this On the one hand, I would highlight the increase in board members set of parameters, available liquidity, maintaining its rating and from 10 to 12, which made it possible to adjust the representation progression of financial costs to define the most suitable financing of ConnecT in the Board in terms of proportionality, with 4 directors strategy at any given time for growth. out of 12. Likewise, we have reinforced the independence of the Board itself by incorporating 2 new independent directors, MP: Cellnex has taken full advantage of the favourable conditions specifically Marisa Guijarro and Anne Bouverot, boosting diversity on the debt markets during the last few years to invest more than by reaching a female representation of 33%, thereby anticipating €3.5 billion from its own balance sheet without needing to resort the CNMV’s recommendation of 30% by 2020. Finally, another to shareholders. We have mentioned on other occasions how key aspect from the point of view of good governance is the this reflects the company’s capacity to generate cash flow, which separation of roles between a non-executive chairman and a CEO makes it possible to incorporate these new flows resulting from as the company’s top executive. growth to contribute to reducing the ratio of net debt to EBITDA. In any case, and beyond our capacity to draw on debt, as the I should add that the company has a Vice-President elected from CEO has said, it is important for us to maintain our cross over from among the independent directors and a Coordinating Director the rating agencies, meaning that we would not rule out certain who is also independent. alternatives that the market offers and that could be considered depending on any growth opportunities that may arise. Cellnex has already resorted to scenarios such as working together with other financial partners to undertake certain projects or issuing GRI: 102-14 7 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX In 2017, Cellnex shares had the highest revaluation on the Ibex35, at 56%. In 2018 the company’s shares continued to be among the top-performing stock on the selective index. How do you value this? TM: It is clear that the valuation is necessarily positive when we are talking about a revaluation of +5% in the financial year with a differential of +20% in relation to the IBEX35. And if we compare the situation to May 2015, when the company went public, the revaluation now exceeds the 75%. We understand that the market continues to factor in both the increase in the company perimeter and the stability, recurrence and visibility of the flows it generated. Once again, I want to remind you that the sales backlog is now over € 18 billion, equivalent to 20 years’ turnover, taking the € 900 million income for financial year 2018 as the benchmark. I also believe that the perception of consolidation and stability of the shareholding structure of the company and of the commitment of the new shareholders to Cellnex’s industrial project, to which the president also referred, is quite remarkable. Investors, analysts and stakeholders in general are paying increasing attention to compliance with ESG (environment, social responsibility, governance) criteria by companies. What is Cellnex’s approach to these criteria and how important are they for the company? MP: Indeed, we can see that the elements comprising the company’s best practices in terms of good governance, Tobias Martinez, CEO corporate responsibility (CR) and sustainability are factors that are increasingly appreciated and monitored by investors, analysts and markets. At Cellnex, especially since our IPO, these are factors that we have internalised in our policies and in the dayto-day running of the company. In fact, we are responsible, not because there is a policy that says we are, but to the extent that As I said, transparency is also a priority and is part of our CR, a we act responsibly, taking on board the values and principles of key element in the external monitoring of our progress that is one transparency, savoir faire, commitment to innovation and talent, of the features that qualifies us to enter the various sustainability and to sustainability tools within the company’s industrial project. indices. This is why Cellnex is now part of indexes such as I would like to recall that, since it became a listed company, FTSE4GOOD, CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), Sustainalytics Cellnex has been reporting to the market in accordance with and “Standard Ethics”. the international framework standards for the Integrated Annual Report, which attaches the same importance and relevance to TM: I would only add to what the Chairman has said about the the consolidation and treatment of financial and non-financial progress the company is making in relation to the 2016-2020 CR information. Along these lines, back in 2017 the company was Master Plan. Three years into the five-year plan, we have initiated already ahead of the application of the EU Directive on the 90% of the planned lines of action compared to the 82% at the integration of such information and went a step further by having close of 2017 and 70% of the actions have already been executed the non-financial information chapter audited by an independent compared to 52% from the previous year. I would perhaps point external auditor. to two elements marking this financial year 2018. One is the progressive extension of the non-financial reporting perimeter into It is very important to target the fulfilment of these criteria, which is which France and Switzerland have been incorporated, so that why we also take on public commitments, which we renew each we ensure that 90% of the Group’s income also accounts for its year, such as Cellnex’s adherence to the United Nations Global execution in non-financial matters. The second is the materiality Compact and its Principles. Likewise, in the framework of our analysis performed in this financial year to revalidate the goals of CR, we have identified five of the sustainable development goals the current Master Plan, taking into account the significant change (SDGs) to which the company can contribute. and the growth experienced by the Group since the IPO. GRI: 102-14 8 Interview with the President and CEO 01 02 03 04 Cellnex is focused on growth in Europe. What would be In this connection, one key milestone in 2018 was the European 05 your vision of the telecommunications market in the Parliament’s approval of the European Electronic Communications European Union in the medium and long term?

TM: In this connection, I would highlight how we are shaping our value proposal for the 5G ecosystem. We understand that for a Marco Patuano, Chairman neutral telecommunications services and infrastructures operator Tobias Martinez, CEO such as Cellnex, it is important to be able to present ourselves as a strategic partner for our customers by offering them the most integrated solutions possible for rolling out their infrastructures. To this end, we are working in three main axes in which we have been making decisions over the past two years. On the one hand, know-how in the field of Small Cells and Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) resulting from our 2016 acquisition of the Italian company CommsCon, which will play a decisive role in the necessary densification of transmission equipment as well as in coverage provided in closed spaces with large footfall. Examples of this are sports stadiums, convention centres, shopping centres, offices, tunnels, stations and transport systems, etc. A second key axis of our policy will be to ensure fibre optic connectivity to the various telecommunications sites, the socalled backhauling fibre, or Fibre To The Antenna (FTTA). This is a key structural element, as this connectivity is vital for managing the large volume of data flows associated with 5G. The acquisition of the XOC in July 2018 meets this objective. A third axis is the network-distributed data processing capacity, also known as Edge Computing, which is the background of operations like the acquisition of Alticom in the Netherlands in 2017, or the agreement signed in December 2018 with Bouygues Telecom to rol-out strategic telecoms centres ready to house data processing capacity close to the points at which such data are sent and received. In all these areas we are looking at new opportunities and projects in Europe. MP: We understand that from Cellnex we have a road map with a clear definition of the priorities that should mark the company’s development over the next four or five years: continued growth in Europe and support for the roll-out of 5G. That is why we are not only preparing ourselves technologically to respond to the challenge, but are also participating directly and actively, or via the associations in which we collaborate, in the processes of defining the regulatory frameworks, contributing our vision to more clearly defining the rules of play that must facilitate compliance with the European road map in terms of 5G.

As such, Cellnex conducts its business in three main areas of service: Telecommunications Infrastructure Services, Broadcasting Infrastructure and Other Network Services. Cellnex’s business model focuses on the provision of services to mobile network operators (MNOs), broadcasters and other public and private companies acting as a neutral (1) infrastructure provider. This business model is based on innovative, efficient, sustainable, independent and quality management to create value for its shareholders, customers, employees and all stakeholders. As of 31 December 2018, Cellnex has successfully become the leading European telecommunications infrastructure operator with more than 25,032 infrastructures located in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland, including sites and nodes.

One of the main energy efficiency measures that we have implemented on sites is a type of cooling system that consumes less energy by using external air to chill water for more efficient air conditioning than traditional systems. The free cooling system has already been installed on numerous sites in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. In Italy the goal is to install this system in 1,000 sites by 2020 equivalent to 30% of all sites in the country where it has the potential to be installed. In addition, in Cellnex Spain, measures have been taken to reduce energy consumption, such as the renewal of uninterrupted power supply systems (UPS) by more efficient ones, the replacement of luminaires and the modification of tariffs, which without reducing consumption have managed to reduce the associated cost. On the other hand, Cellnex France has opted for a fleet of 100% hybrid vehicles minimising the damage to the environment and to human health.

The Cellnex Group has a code of conduct (the “Ethics’ Code”) approved by the Board of Directors. The corporation prepares an Ethics’ Code Framework which is then adapted in each country . This Ethics’ Code is communicated to all employees. The Group has created a corporate compliance function to improve compliance with the Group’s Ethics’ Code, implemented through specific regulations for each country and the establishment of whistle-blowing channels and the supervision of oversight and control measures to prevent criminal acts. The main values and principles included in the Ethics’ Code are: integrity, honesty, transparency, loyalty, commitment to and defence of Group interests, and responsibility in all actions. The Ethics’ Code includes among its fundamental principles the commitment to strictly comply with the obligation of the Group to offer reliable financial information prepared in accordance with applicable regulations, and the responsibility of its employees and management to ensure this is so, both by correctly carrying out of their functions and by notifying the governing bodies of any circumstance which might affect that undertaking. To mitigate risks relating to financial reporting and to ensure the reliability of such information, the Group has established an Internal Control over Financial Reporting System (“ICFRS”). The Group has a corporate risk control unit that is responsible for carrying out tests to verify compliance with the policies, manuals and procedures defined for the ICFRS, and for validating the effectiveness of controls in place to mitigate the risks related to these processes. However, there can be no assurance that any policies and procedures established by the Group will be followed at all times or effectively detect and prevent all violations of the applicable laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which one or more of the Group employees, consultants, agents, commercial partners, contractors, sub-contractors or joint venture partners are located.

Independent Limited 06 07 Assurance Report on Corporate Social Responsibility Indicators Translation of a report originally issued in Spanish. In the event of a discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails. INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT To the Shareholders of Cellnex Telecom, S.A., In accordance with Article 49 of the Spanish Commercial Code, we have performed the verification, with a scope of limited assurance, of the 2018 Consolidated Director’s Report (CDR), which contains the Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) for the year ended 31 December 2018 of Cellnex Telecom, S.A. and subsidiaries (“Cellnex” or “the Group”). The Consolidated Director’s Report includes information, additional to that required by current Spanish corporate legislation relating to non-financial reporting and by the Global Reporting Initiative Standards for sustainability reporting in their core option (“GRI standards”), that was not the subject matter of our verification. In this regard, our work was limited solely to verification of the information identified in the “GRI Table” and the table of “Non-financial Information Table” in the Appendices to the CDR. Responsibilities of the Directors The preparation and content of the Cellnex Telecom CDR is the responsibility of the Board of Directors of Cellnex. The CDR was prepared in accordance with GRI standards in their core option, and with the standards established in the AA1000AP Assurance Standard issued by AccountAbility. The NFIS included in the CDR was prepared in accordance with the content specified in current Spanish corporate legislation and with the criteria of the selected GRI standards, as well as other criteria described as indicated for each matter in the table of “Non-financial Information Table” in the Appendices to the CDR. These responsibilities of the Board of Directors also include the design, implementation and maintenance of such internal control as is determined to be necessary to enable the CDR and the NFIS to be free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The directors of Cellnex are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information necessary for the preparation of the CDR and the NFIS is obtained. Our Independence and Quality Control We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is based on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC 1) and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our engagement team consisted of professionals who are experts in reviews of non-financial information and, specifically, in information about economic, social and environmental performance. Our Responsibility Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based on the work performed. 157 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX We conducted our review in accordance with the requirements established in International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, currently in force, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with the guidelines published by the Spanish Institute of Certified Public Accountants on attestation engagements on regarding non-financial information statements. Also, we have applied AccountAbility’s AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) (AA1000AS) to provide moderate assurance on the application of the principles established in standard AA100AP and on the sustainability performance indicators (type 2 moderate assurance). The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement and, consequently, the level of assurance provided is also substantially lower. Our work consisted in requesting information from management and the various units of Cellnex that participated in the preparation of the CDR, which includes the NFIS, reviewing the processes used to compile and validate the information presented in the CDR, and carrying out the following analytical procedures and sample-based review tests: • Meetings held with Cellnex personnel to ascertain the business model, policies and management approaches applied, and the main risks relating to these matters, and to obtain the information required for the external verification. • Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the contents included in the CDR based on the materiality analysis performed by Cellnex and described in the Bases for the preparation of the report section of chapter 6 of the CDR, also taking into account the contents required under current Spanish corporate legislation. • Analysis of the processes used to compile and validate the data presented in the 2018 CDR. • Review of the information relating to risks and the policies and management approaches applied in relation to the material matters described in the Bases for the preparation of the report section of chapter 6 of the CDR. • Verification, by means of sample-based review tests, of the information relating to the contents identified in the “GRI Table” and the table of “Non-financial Information Table” in the Appendices to the CDR, and the appropriate compilation thereof based on the data furnished by Cellnex’s information sources. • Obtainment of a representation letter from the directors and management. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, no matter has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: A) The NFIS included in the 2018 CDR of Cellnex was not prepared, in all material respects, including the adequacy of the contents revised detailed in the “GRI Table”, in accordance with GRI standards in their core option. B) Cellnex’s NFIS for the year ended 31 December 2018 was not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the content specified in current Spanish corporate legislation and in keeping with the criteria of the selected GRI standards, as well as other criteria described as indicated for each matter in the table of “Non-financial Information Table” in the Appendices to the CDR. C) Cellnex did not apply in the preparation of the CDR the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as described in the Appendices to the IAR, in accordance with AA1000 APS (2008), namely: • Inclusivity: Cellnex has developed a stakeholder participation process, enabling stakeholders to be considered in the development of a responsible approach. • Materiality: the materiality determination process is geared towards identifying and understanding the issues that are material or significant for Cellnex and its stakeholders. 3 158 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 • Responsiveness: Cellnex responds, through specific actions and commitments, to the material issues identified. Additional information Pursuant to the provisions of the AA1000AS 2008 Standard, we presented to management of Cellnex our recommendations relating to the areas for improvement in management and non-financial information and, specifically, to the application of the principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness. Following is a summary of the most significant observations and recommendations, which do not modify the conclusions expressed in this report. Inclusivity and materiality In 2018, Cellnex has updated its materiality study, following the standards established in the AA1000, supported by various analyses and consultations with certain stakeholders. In order to improve, it would be advisable to continue deepening the consultations with the rest of the stakeholders involved in the current business value chain. Responsiveness In 2018, Cellnex has continued to make progress in achieving the objectives defined in its 2016-2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Master Plan, which constitutes the reference framework for the objectives and actions and programs for each of the Plan's axes in the business units in Spain. As a result of the Group's international expansion in Italy, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Switzerland, it would be convenient to extend and adapt the Plan to all business units in order to ensure compliance with the Corporate Social Responsibility policy in an integral manner. Cellnex has continued working in the integration of new businesses to the perimeter of non-financial information reporting. In 2019, it would be advisable to include new indicators that provide information, not only of the corporate responsibility actions developed, but also of the actual impact of these actions on business.

Regarding the syndicated financing arranged by Cellnex Telecom, S.A., the triggering event is at the parent company level and, for the syndicated 203 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX financing formalised through Cellnex Switzerland, the triggering event is at the level of that company and its subsidiary, Swiss Towers. In both cases, the change of control event is activated when a third party, on its own or with others, acquires 50% of the shares with voting rights or obtains the right to appoint or remove most of the Board members of the relevant company. Acquisition of infrastructure Regarding the Group's infrastructure acquired by the mobile telecommunications operators, the agreements signed with the sellers include the change of control events which establish that, if the seller's competitor becomes a controlling shareholder at the relevant company (where the control is defined as (i) more than 50% of the shares with voting rights or (ii) the right to appoint or remove most of the Board members), the seller is entitled to repurchase that infrastructure. Moreover, that repurchase right can also be granted if the seller's competitor acquires a significant part of the shares or obtains voting or governing rights which can be exercised in a way that can negatively affect the seller's interests. The change of control events can be activated by both Cellnex Telecom and at Group company level.

In accordance with the Board of Directors’ Regulations, directors and executives must report any conflicts of interest and abstain from participating or influencing the decision-making process on matters affected by the conflict. Directors (section 27 c) of the Board Regulations) must abstain from participating in discussions and votes regarding resolutions or decisions in which they or a related person has a direct or indirect conflict of interest. Resolutions or decisions that affect their status as directors, such as their appointment to or removal from positions in the governing body or other similar decisions, shall be excluded from the aforementioned obligation to abstain. Additionally, Directors (section 27 (e) of the same Regulations) must adopt the necessary measures to avoid situations in which their interests, whether for their own account or for others, may conflict with the company’s interests and their duties towards the company. The foregoing excludes the cases in which the company has provided its consent, pursuant to the terms set forth in section 230 of the Spanish Limited Liability Companies Law. Directors (section 28 of the same Regulations) must advise the Board of Directors of any direct or indirect conflict that they or people related to them might have with the Company’s interests. The director concerned will refrain from taking part in resolutions or decisions related to the operation to which the conflict refers. The votes of the directors affected by the conflict and who must abstain, will be deducted for the purposes of calculating the majority of votes needed. In particular, the duty to avoid conflicts of interest obliges directors to refrain from: a) Carrying out transactions with the company, except when these are ordinary operations, carried out under standard conditions for customers, and are of little importance, understood as those operations whose information is not required to convey a faithful image of the entity’s assets, financial situation and results. b) Using the company’s name or their status of director to unduly influence the conduct of private operations. c) Using the company’s assets, including its confidential information, for private purposes. d)Taking advantage of the company’s business opportunities. e) Obtaining benefits or payments associated with the performance of their position from third parties other than the company or its Group, unless they are acts of mere courtesy. f) Carrying out activities, for their own account or for others, that cause them to be in effective competition, whether real or potential, with the company or which, in any other way, cause a permanent conflict with the company’s interests. In July 2016 Cellnex’s Board of Directors approved a new Internal Code of Conduct (ICC) adapted to the requirements of the European Regulation on market abuse. With regard to conflicts of interest, the ICC establishes: Principles of action 212 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 In any situation involving a “Conflict of Interest” (being a clash between the 06 interests of the Company and the personal interests of the Affected Person), Affected Persons shall act in accordance with the following principles: 07 (i) Independence. They must act at all times with loyalty to the Company, irrespective of their own interests or those of third parties. (ii) Abstention. They must refrain from intervening or influencing in the taking of decisions concerning matters affected by the conflict. (iii) Confidentiality. They shall refrain from accessing confidential information which may have a bearing on the aforesaid conflict. Notification of Conflicts of Interest Affected Persons shall notify the General Secretary's Office of any possible Conflicts of Interest to which they are subject by their family relationships, their personal holdings, their activities outside the Company, or on any other grounds. It shall be considered that there is no Conflict of Interests owing to family relationships when said relationship is beyond the fourth degree of consanguinity or the second degree of affinity. It shall be considered that there is a possible Conflict of Interests derived from personal holdings when said holdings arise in relation to a company in which the Affected Person holds a management post or has a significant stake (which is understood to mean a total stake, direct or indirect, in excess of twenty per cent of its total issued share capital). Affected Persons must ensure that the information is kept up to date, reporting any modification to or termination of previously communicated situations, as well as the emergence of any new possible Conflicts of Interest. Communications must be issued without delay once the current or possible situation of Conflict of Interest is recognised, prior to taking any decision which may be affected by the possible Conflict of Interest. Members of the Board of Directors Members of the Board of Directors In addition to the foregoing, the members of the Company's Board of Directors shall be subject to the provisions of the applicable corporate regulations and internal Company’s rules. D.7 Is there more than one company in the group listed in Spain?

The Risk Management System works in a comprehensive and continuous way, consolidating by subsidiary / geographical area and by support area at corporate level. The risk management model implemented has been approved and is monitored by the Audit and Control Committee, and is applicable to all business and corporate units in countries where the Cellnex Group operates. To identify the risks, defined guidelines approved by the Audit and Control Committee are in place. Each corporate area is responsible for identifying, assessing and monitoring the inherent and residual risks, and supervising and implementing control measures to mitigate such risks. The risk map is approved and reviewed by the Audit and Control Committee, which informs the Board of Directors and is cross-checked and implemented by the Management Committee. E.2 Identify the bodies within the company responsible for creating and executing the Risk Management and Control System, including tax compliance risk. The following bodies are responsible for defining, executing and monitoring the risk management system: The Board of Directors: the highest body responsible for defining the risk control strategy and policy. The Audit and Control Committee: Designated as such by the Board of Directors, its role is to monitor the effectiveness of the risk management model and the information supplied to third parties regarding the system, making sure that the risk management system is able to identify, manage, prioritize, control, monitor and provide complete information on risks. Risk Control: is responsible for preparing and updating risk management policies, setting out mechanisms and methodologies to identify and assess risks, updating risk mapping, implementing a system for monitoring and Communications to the highest level of company governance and review the controls that mitigate the identified risks. Senior Management Committee: Is responsible for risk management included in the implementation of the defined risk policies, the approval 214 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 of risk maps, the assigning of responsibilities, the implementation of control activities and action plans as well as the monitoring of existing risks in its area of responsibility. Managers: Each area manager is responsible for identifying their risks and informing the Risk Control in a timely fashion. Likewise, he or she is responsible for identifying and implementing control activities aimed at mitigating risks. E.3 State the primary risks, including tax compliance risks, and those deriving from corruption (with the scope of these risks as set out in Royal Decree Law 18/2017), to the extent that these are significant, which may affect the achievement of business objectives The main risks which may prevent the company from achieving its targets are: Strategic elements, such as mergers between telecommunications operators, emergenceof new competitors, restrictions on growth in regulated markets. Compliance following changes in fiscal, legal or environmental law or being subject to litigation or other judicial processes. Financial as a result of customers defaulting on payments, access to financing, fluctuations in the stock market price. Operatives derived from the integration and optimization of acquisitions, increase in exposure of information systems, emergence of alternative technologies, capacity to attract and retain qualified personnel. E.4 State whether the entity has a risk tolerance level, including tolerance for tax compliance risk. The levels of tolerance are defined in the risk assessment matrix. For the identified risks each person responsible will evaluate the possible impact of such risks should these occur and classify them as low, medium, large or critical depending on their economic impact, implications for the organisation and impact on reputation. Following this the possibility of the risk actually occurring will be evaluated. This possibility is classifies as unlikely, possible, probable and almost certain. The combination of impact and probability leads to risk prioritization. E.5 State which risks, including tax compliance risks, have materialised during the year. The main risks which materialised during the year were as follows:  Regulatory changes. The CNMC (Spanish Competition Commission) initiated public consultation to review the wholesale market for the television broadcast carrier service. The proposed obligations to be imposed on Cellnex are similar to those at present, so no relevant changes are expected. The consultation has been answered but no decision has yet been made.  Some Group clients wished to renegotiate their agreements or amend the current contractual agreements in a negative way. Some clients suggested the possibility of renegotiating their current contracts downwards. We answered that this was not possible since the current prices conform to the regulatory framework and to market prices. 215 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX  Advertising revenue performance in the media sector, especially TV, Internet and radio. Conflict with the CNMC due to potential abuse of a dominant position by the large television groups, to the detriment of the other television companies. This has not yet been resolved but it should not have an impact on Cellnex.  Increase in competition in the acquisition of assets and companies within the context of the Group's business expansion. E.6 Explain the response and monitoring plans for all major risks, including tax compliance risks, of the company, as well as the procedures followed by the company in order to ensure that the board of directors responds to any new challenges that arise. The risk management model establishes the response and supervision plans for the main risks based on their assessment. The risk maps and the risks considered to be a priority are reviewed by the Audit and Control Committee, which, in turn, informs the Board of Directors and notifies it if there are changes to any of the risks not defined as a priority. All the areas also carry out their own risk management. To reduce exposure to risks such as the risks of sharing infrastructure, regulatory changes, technological advances and the development of alternative technology not used at present, an increase in competition, etc., the Group continues with its selective internationalisation, diversification and growth policy, fostering understanding with the Public Administrations to develop infrastructure and continuing with the efficiency plan to optimise operating expenses and investments.

F.1 Control environment Report on at least the following, describing their principal features: F.1.1. The bodies and/or departments that are responsible for (i) the existence and maintenance of an adequate and effective ICFR; (ii) their implementation; and (iii) their supervision. Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) at Cellnex forms part of its general internal control system and consists of a set of processes which the Board of Directors, the Audit and Control Committee, management and staff carry out to provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial information reported to the market. The 'Model for the Organisation and Monitoring of the ICFR' at Cellnex (hereinafter ‘ICFR Organisation Model’) establishes that the Board of Directors is the highest authority responsible for the supervision of the internal information systems, as well as the Risk Control and Management Policies. In addition, the Sections and the Board Regulations state, amongst other things, the following responsibilities: 216 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 -Defining general company policies and strategies, as well as the corporate governance policies of the organisation. -The preparation and approval of annual accounts and any other report or 07 information required by law. -The financial information that, due to its status as a listed company, the company must periodically publish. Definition of the Risk Control and Management Policy, including taxation risks, as well as supervising internal information and control systems. --The supervision of the correct functioning and actions of the delegated bodies, amongst which there is the Audit and Control Committee and designated directives. According to the Board of Directors' Regulation (section 15), there are amongst the basic responsibilities of the Audit Control Committee (hereinafter the AAC): . The supervision of the preparatory process and presentation of mandatory financial information, as well as its integrity. . The supervision of the efficiency and suitability of internal control and risk evaluation in Cellnex as well as the best monitoring and control measures to avoid committing criminal offences and for risk management systems, including fiscal risk and the systems in place to manage compliance with all applicable legislation. . Discussion with the account auditor of the significant weaknesses of the internal control system detected during the auditing process. . The supervision of internal auditing services, ensuring their independence and making sure that the recommendations and suggested corrective measures be considered by the management. Cellnex Internal Audit is in turn responsible for supervising ICFR in delegation from the Audit and Control Committee with the Finance and Corporate Development Department responsible for its design, maintenance and implementation. F.1.2. State whether the following are present, especially if they relate to the creation of financial information:  Departments and/or mechanisms in charge of: (i) design and review of corporate structure; (ii) clear definition of lines of responsibility and authority with an adequate distribution of tasks and functions; and (iii) assurance that adequate procedures exist for proper communication throughout the entity. The Cellnex Board of Directors assigns the responsibility of the design and review of the organisational structure related to the preparation of the financial information to Organisation and General Services and to Finance and Corporate Development. From these guidelines the general structures and distribution of responsibilities and the procedure to design, review, update and inform on these are defined; this process being documented in the form of organisational structure charts and process models and its associated regulations which form part of the policy catalogue of Cellnex. Cellnex has an internal organisational chart which covers all areas and which is basically divided according to department (including those departments involved in preparing, analyzing and supervising financial information). This organisational chart indicates responsibilities up to a certain management level 217 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX and is supplemented by other more detailed organisational charts at departmental level. Regarding to the preparation process of financial information, in addition to the detailed organisational charts and with the aim of assigning responsibilities, there is the ICFR Organisational Model, developed by the Department of Consolidation and Financial Reporting, part of the Finance and Corporate Development department, and which is submitted to the AAC for approval.  Code of conduct, the body approving this, degree of dissemination and instruction, including principles and values, (state if there is specific mention of transaction recording and creation of financial information), a body charged with analysing breaches and proposing corrective actions and sanctions. Cellnex has a Code of Conduct (Code of Ethics) approved by Cellnex Telecom, S.A.’s Ethics and Compliance Committee that is made up from Internal Audit, the Legal department, Resources department, the Company Secretarial department, and the Regulation department, and this has been communicated to the employees and is available on the corporate intranet. Specific training for employees is being planned. The main values and principles set out in the Code of Ethics are: integrity, honesty, transparency and good faith. The Code of Ethics includes among its fundamental principles the commitment to offer financial information that reflects the a fair view of the economic and financial situation in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards applicable, and the responsibility of its employees and management to ensure this is so, both by correctly carrying out their functions and by notifying the management bodies of any circumstance which might affect this commitment. The body responsible for analyzing breaches and proposing corrective actions and sanctions is the Ethics and Compliance Committee.  Whistleblower channel, that allows notifications to the audit committee of irregularities of a financial and accounting nature, in addition to potential breaches of the code of conduct and unlawful activities undertaken in the organisation, reporting, as the case may be, if this is of a confidential nature. Cellnex has and promotes the use of communications channels concerning possible non-conformities with the Ethics Code and other irregular activities in the organisation, especially from a financial and accounting point of view, informing the Ethics and Compliance Committee in all cases. As stated in the Ethics Channel Policy, which regulates the procedure, scope and application of the reports received, the latter can be communicated via a communications form, either by post or email, maintaining the confidentiality at all times. 218 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Any communications will be received, analysed and followed up by the Ethics and Compliance Committee, and this committee will periodically inform the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Audit and Control Committee. From time to time the Ethics and Compliance Committee will inform the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and the Audit and Control Committee about the functioning of the Ethics Channel. If reports have been received during the year, the Ethics and Compliance Committee will produce an annual report on the communications received, to facilitate the analysis of the functioning of the ‘whistle-blowing’ channel.  Training and periodic refresher programmes for staff involved in the preparation and revision of financial information, as well as assessment of the ICFR (Internal Control System for Financial Information), that covers at least accounting rules, audits, internal control and risk management. Regarding training programs and the periodic updating of elements which can affect the preparation and publication of financial information, Cellnex believes the continuous development and training of its staff and management to be key. In this regard, Cellnex also considers that complete and up-todate training on accounting regulations, the rules for preparing financial information, the regulations on capital markets, taxation and internal control is necessary to ensure that the information reported to the market is reliable and in accordance with regulations. Regarding the preparation and review of the financial information, during 2018 Cellnex implemented training plans based on the needs identified by the department of Consolidation and Accounting Regulation in relation to: • New accounting, tax, capital markets and internal control regulations, adopted by the European Union and applicable to Cellnex. • Changes in reporting methodology and / or information systems. • Individual initiative from the team members of the department of Consolidation and Accounting Regulation. Once the needs of these areas have been identified, the appropriate training activities are designed and put into effect to cover annual training objectives on these matters. Cellnex carried out training activities during 2018 using external experts and internal training sessions, covering personnel involved in preparing and reviewing financial information. The training areas on which most emphasis was placed during 2018 relate to accounting, tax and financial matters which could have the greatest impact on the preparation of Cellnex's consolidated financial information, particularly in changes to the fiscal and accounting changes at both national and international levels and with the year's updates concerning EU-IFRS. Cellnex has an on-line training platform where both technical training for specific work groups and a more overall training can be accessed on a voluntary and, in some cases, mandatory basis. In 2018, the following specific training was also provided: 219 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX  SAP RE – IFRS 16 Module – Spain, Italy, France and Switzerland  SAP RE – General – Intensive on-the-job post go-live training IFRS 16 Module – Spain and Italy  SAP RE – Owner management – France and Switzerland  IFRS 16 – Leases Additionally , the Consolidation and Financial Reporting department has subscriptions to a number of publications and journals on accounting and financial matters and to the website of the International Accounting Standards Board which regularly sends new developments and other communications of interest which are analysed and reported to ensure they are taken into consideration when preparing Cellnex's financial information. F.2 Assessment of financial information risks Report on at least the following: F.2.1. The main characteristics of the risk identification process, including error and fraud risk, as regards:  Whether the process exists and is documented.  If the process covers all of the objectives of financial information, (existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; delivery; breakdown and comparability; and rights and obligations), whether it is updated and with what frequency.  The existence of a process for identifying the scope of consolidation, taking into account, among other factors, the possible existence of complex company structures, shell companies, or special purpose entities.  If the process takes into account the effects of other types of risk (operational, technological, financial, legal, tax, reputational, environmental, etc.) to the extent that they affect the financial statements.  The governing body within the company that supervises the process. Cellnex has a Risk Control and Management Policy that establishes the basic principles and the general framework for the control and management of all types of risks which are faced. In this manner Cellnex identifies and updates the principle risks organizing adequate information and internal control systems and performing monitoring functions. The Internal Control and Risk Management Manual of the ICFR (hereafter Risk Management Manual) describes and formalises Cellnex’s internal control and risk management model with regards to the ICFR and establishes mechanisms used to determine the risks in this area, the key business processes along with the practical and operative documentation for this internal control model. 220 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 During the process of the drawing up and issuing financial information this manual sets out what financial information it refers to as well as the methodology for defining it. Furthermore, guidelines are established to determine whether the process covers all financial reporting objectives, (existence and occurrence; completeness; valuation; presentation, disclosure and comparability; and rights and obligations), is updated and with what frequency. Cellnex has identified the relevant business processes together with their inherent risks and has designed a Risk and Controls Matrix that aims to identify the main risks, based on which control activities have been designed, such that when adequately complied with, true and reliable financial information can be obtained. The Department of Consolidation and Accounting Regulation is entrusted with identifying and documenting risks of error in the financial information; the process is supplemented by Internal Audit, which considers identified risks of error in relation to the group's overall Risk Map (which takes into account both financial and non-financial risks). The entire process is ultimately overseen by the Audit and Control Committee. The Cellnex Audit and Control Committee is responsible for supervising the risk control systems with the support from Internal Audit. F.3 Control activities Report on whether the company has at least the following, describing their main characteristics: F.3.1. Review and authorisation procedures for financial information published by the stock markets and a description of the ICFR, indicating those responsible, as well as documentation describing the flow of activity and controls (including those relating to the risk of fraud) of the various types of transactions which may materially affect the financial statements, including financial closing procedures and the specific review of judgements, estimates, valuations and relevant forecasts. Cellnex has a Regulated Information Reporting Manual, duly approved by the ACC, where the process for preparing and approving the financial information and the description of the ICFR to be published in the market and to investors is detailed. This manual sets out the criteria to identify relevant public financial information, this being as follows: Regular reporting obligations (RRO): o Quarterly financial report. o Half year financial report. o Annual financial report and Annual Corporate Governance Report (ACGR) Annual report on remuneration policy for directors (ARR) Significant Events Cellnex's Manual for the Issue of Regulated Information also details the departments involved in preparing, review and authorisation of the financial information and their respective responsibilities from the year end accounting processes to the publication of the relevant facts. In particular, for each set of regulated financial information to be published 221 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX for the market there is a procedure for its preparation and review that requires completing questionnaires for the internal control of regulated information to ensure a reasonable security in the reliability of the entities financial statements. Following the Manual for the Issue of Regulated Information and completing specific questionnaires for internal control is obligatory and subject to review by the internal Cellnex auditor. On the matter of descriptive documentation regarding flows in activities and controls of the different transactions that can materially affect the financial statements, Cellnex has a ICFR Organisational Model that structures the specific mechanisms set up to maintain an internal control environment that favours the generation of complete financial information that is reliable and timely and anticipates the existence of possible irregularities as well as ways in which to detect and remedy these. Cellnex has developed procedures for those processes that are considered material and relevant as concerns their potential impact on the financial information to be published, as detailed below: Revenue recognition and accounts receivable Fixed assets and investments Purchases and accounts payable Staff costs Judgements and estimates Month end accounting, consolidation and financial reporting Cash and borrowings Taxes Individual and consolidated financial statements, six-monthly financial reports and the financial information in the quarterly interim statements of Cellnex are prepared and reviewed by Finance and Corporate Development prior to submission to the Audit and Control Committee. Here the procedures included in the Emission of Regulated Information Manual will be applied as a prior step to a submission of the information to Cellnex Board of Directors for final approval. Cellnex has descriptions of controls over activities and controls directly related to transactions that might have a material impact on the financial statements, to mitigate the risk of material error in the information reported to the markets. These descriptions are documented in the 'ICFR Risk and Control Matrix' and contain information on what the controls should consist of, the reason these are carried out, who should carry them out, how often, and other information on what information systems or what operations carried out by third parties are important for the effectiveness of the control operation in question. The controls cover areas such as income generation, investment and expenditure on concessions, acquisitions and subsequent valuation of other assets, analysis of the recoverability of investments, recording of taxation of profits or the correct presentation of financial instruments and of the financing operations of Cellnex. In relation to the relevant judgements and estimations made, Cellnex reports any areas of particular uncertainty that it considers especially pertinent in its consolidated financial statements. The specific review and approval of the relevant judgements, estimates, assessments and projections as well as the key assumptions used for calculating them, with a material impact on the consolidated financial statements, are made by Finance and Corporate Development and, where applicable, by the managing director. The most significant ones, such as the monitoring of asset values and hedging policies will be treated and reviewed by the ACC before submitting them for the Board's approval. 222 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 F.3.2. Internal IT control policies and procedures (access security, change controls, their operation, operational continuity, and segregation of duties, among others) which support relevant processes within the company and relate to the creation and publication of financial information. Cellnex uses information systems to keep adequate records and monitor Its operations and, therefore, their proper operation is a key element and one that is particularly emphasized by Cellnex. Specifically, the Consolidation and Reporting SAP BPC system has been implemented in all the Group’s companies in Spain. The process of segregation of systems with its parent company Abertis was also completed during 2016. Regarding the companies outside of Spain the database is fed through loading files which are prepared in the relevant foreign subsidiaries and sent back to the corporate offices in Spain for loading into the system. During 2018, SAP BPC has been installed in such foreign subsidiaries so that the charging to the consolidation system may be executed from each country. This process is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018. In respect of Galata the Italian subsidiary in the beginning of the year it was concluded the process for system segregation with their former parent Wind Telecomunicazioni and they have also started to work fully under SAP. The Systems department, which forms part of the Organisation and Efficiency department, which in turn forms part of the Resources department is responsible for establishing the model of internal control over the information systems in those aspects relating to access security, segregation of duties (in coordination with the business areas and support areas) change control, apart from 47 carrying out monitoring activities for risks and controls derived from the externalisation of the systems.

In addition, Cellnex maintains certain activities associated with accounting, payroll and the administration and maintenance of its corporate information systems subcontracted to an external supplier. Cellnex has guidelines drawn up concerning the treatment of activities with third parties both in terms of hiring and the monitoring of results. These guidelines are detailed in the internal purchasing procedures. The Finance and Corporate Development department carries out controls on the work of these experts to check: . The competence, capacity, accreditation and independence of these experts. . The validity of the data and methods used. . The reasonableness of the assumptions used, if applicable. Certain control and risk management mechanisms have been established with the supplier to ensure that financial information derived from such activities is complete and correct, these include: a Management and Monitoring Committee for the contract, agreements in levels of service, risk indicators, service reports, measures 223 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX for technology security, external audits as well as contingency and continuity plans, amongst others.

The responsibility to define, maintain and update accounting policies within Cellnex falls upon the management of Consolidation and Financial Reporting. The duties of the Consolidation and Financial Reporting department also include responding to accounting queries made by the various business units or other corporate areas of Cellnex. Cellnex has an accounting policies manual, the Group Reporting and Accounting Principles Handbook (GRAPH) for the purposes of preparing financial statements under EU-IFRS which is drawn up by Corporate Management Control and regularly updated by it to include the rules applicable to the year.

F.4.2. Measures for capturing and preparing financial information with consistent formats for application and use by all of the units of the entity or the group, and which contain the main financial statements and notes, as well as detailed information regarding ICFR.

F.5 Supervision of system performance Describe at least the following: F.5.1. The activities of the audit committee in overseeing ICFR as well as whether there is an internal audit function that has among its mandates support of the committee and the task of supervising the internal control system, including ICFR. Additionally, describe the scope of ICFR assessment made during the year and the procedure through which the person responsible prepares the assessment reports on its results, whether the company has an action plan describing possible corrective measures, and whether its impact on financial reporting is considered. Cellnex already had a model for internal control over financial reporting, which was supervised in part by Abertis’ corporate functions, to see through its commitment to complete and reliable financial information, and to comply with the fact that its previous main shareholder was also a listed company.,. The adaptation of this model to the specific needs of Cellnex as a listed entity have occupied the majority of the Audit and Control Committee’s activities during this year.

The Audit and Control Committee has already approved the Internal Audit Plan for 2019, which includes the necessary actions to guarantee adequate supervision and evaluation of the plans throughout the year by regularly reporting the incidents detected and the necessary actions for improvement once checked with audited areas. Cellnex has an Internal Audit function that reports to the CAC and, as indicated by the Cellnex Board of Directors Regulations and specifically the section that corresponds tothe powers assigned to the Audit and Control Committee, has the 225 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX main function o supervising the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls and the internal auditing services, by verifying their suitability and integrity, and reviewing the appointment and replacement of the managers, as well as supervising the monitoring and control measures necessary for preventing criminal offences, the risk management systems, including tax-related ones, and the compliance management systems for any applicable legislation, and to discuss with the auditors any significant weaknesses in the internal control system detected while carrying out the audit. During 2018 Internal Auditing developed various activities in key business process reviews and, as reported timely to the ACC, no significant weaknesses that could have a material impact on Cellnex's 2018 financial information have been identified; furthermore, necessary corrective actions to solve other future possible weaknesses have been carried out. Likewise, as stated in section F.7.1, the external auditor has issued a report on the procedures agreed regarding the ICFR description made by Cellnex and which has not highlighted any material issues. F.5.2. If there is a procedure by which the account auditor (in accordance with the contents of the Normas Técnicas de Auditoría (NTA) “Auditing Standards”), internal auditor and other experts may communicate with senior management and the audit committee or senior managers of the company regarding significant weakness in internal control identified during the review of the annual accounts or any others they have been assigned. Additionally, state whether an action plan is available for correcting or mitigating any weaknesses found. The discussion procedure for significant weaknesses identified in relation to internal control is based, in general terms, on regular meetings maintained by the various parties involved. In this regard, the Internal Audit function communicates, on a regular basis, its conclusions regarding internal control during the reviews of the SCIIF to the Finance and Corporate Development department and to the ACC. It also reports on its conclusions relating to the internal audit processes carried out during the year, along with the implementation state of the corrective action plans established. In relation to the relationship with external auditors, as described in section 39 of the Cellnex Board of Directors Regulations, these are channelled through the Audit and Control Committee. To this effect and to comply with its responsibility in supervising the auditor's actions as well as receiving communications regarding potential weaknesses in internal controls identified during professional actions, should there be any, the Audit and Control Committee will periodically meet with the external auditor. These communications are recorded in the Audit and Control Committee's minutes and are monitored through Internal Audit functions. In addition, Cellnex’s external auditors have direct contact with the Chief Financial Officer and maintain periodic meetings both to obtain information necessary to carry out their work and to communicate any weaknesses detected.

That the percentage of proprietary directors divided by the number of nonexecutive directors is no greater than the proportion of the equity interest in the company represented by said proprietary directors and the remaining share capital.

At present, Cellnex's proprietary directors represent 36% of the nonexecutives, while the shareholder that they represent, Connect S.p.A., owns 29.9% of its share capital. Without prejudice to this, we must remember that this recommendation states that this criterion can be mitigated in companies where there are few significant shareholdings.

That the Board of Directors may not propose the dismissal of any independent director before the completion of the director’s term provided for in the Articles of Association unless the Board of Directors finds just cause and a prior report has been prepared by the appointments committee.

And that the Board of Directors must provide a reasoned written account of all these events in its Annual Corporate Governance Report. Complies X Complies partially  Explanation  23. That all directors clearly express their opposition when they consider any proposal submitted to the Board of Directors to be against the company’s interests. This particularly applies to independent directors and directors who are unaffected by a potential conflict of interest if the decision could be detrimental to any shareholders not represented on the Board of Directors. Furthermore, when the Board of Directors makes significant or repeated decisions about which the director has serious reservations, the director should draw the appropriate conclusions and, in the event the director decides to resign, explain the reasons for this decision in the letter referred to in the next recommendation. This recommendation also applies in the case of the secretary of the Board of Directors, despite not being a director. Complies  Complies Partially  Explanation  Not Applicable X 24.

Therefore absences should be kept to the bare 232 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 minimum and quantified in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. However, the Board of Directors’ Regulation does not set out a Board of Directors’ obligation to assign representation with instructions as such requirement cannot always be possible due to 07 no previous participation in the debates and deliberations of the matters put forward to the Board of Directors. 28.

In this sense, Cellnex was rated a letter B, maintaining the same score as in previous years. Furthermore, this year Cellnex joined the CDP Supply Chain programme, which aims to better understand how suppliers are addressing climate change and working to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The response rate of the suppliers who were invited to answer the questionnaire in this first CDP Supply Chain campaign was 35%. United Nations Global Compact In November 2015 Cellnex Telecom joined the United Nations Global Compact as an expression of its commitment to including the corporate social responsibility concept into its operational strategy and organisational culture.

In 2018, following various definition and planning meetings and a design thinking day, Cellnex sensorised the six social houses under the project. Over the course of the year we collected and monitored data, primarily regarding consumption, energy efficiency, temperature and other indicators used to upkeep these 'connected' households. This data is stored on an IoT platform that Cellnex provides which allows the housing authorities to anticipate abnormal situations or risks, optimise resource use, and make decisions on possible actions according to the parameters obtained. It also enables them to learn a new management methodology, which in addition optimises and renders their operations more efficient. It is worth noting that in 2018, the m4Social Project was selected and included in the Special Dossier on the SDGs of the Global Compact Network Spain as a good practice. Highlights: Cellnex plans to adhere to the Code of Good Tax Practices but this had not yet been done at 2018 year-end. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOTE OF CLARIFICATION ap. C1.16 Article 18. Appointment of directors 1. Directors will be appointed by the General Meeting or by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the provisions of Royal Decree 1/2010, of 2 July, by way of which the revised text of the Law on Capital Companies is approved, or the legal text which may supersede the same. 2. The proposals for the appointment of directors submitted to the Board of Directors for deliberation at the General Meeting and the appointment decisions that the Board adopts by virtue of the powers of co-optation legally vested in it must be preceded by the corresponding proposal by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee when in relation to independent directors, and by a report in the case of all other directors. Article 19. Appointment of external directors The Board of Directors and the Appointments and Remuneration Committee, within the scope of their remits, will ensure that the election of candidates relates to persons of known solvency, competence and experience, being particularly rigorous in relation to those called on to fulfil the positions of independent director provided for in Article 5 of these Regulations and in the terms of the applicable good governance standards. Article 20. Term of office 1. Directors will hold their positions for the term provided for in the corporate bylaws, and can be re-elected one or more times for said term. 2. Directors appointed by co-option hold their positions until the date of the first General Meeting. Should the vacancy arise once the General Meeting has been convened, and prior to the holding thereof, the Board of Directors may appoint a director until the following General Meeting is held. Moreover, directors appointed by the Board through co-optation need not necessarily be shareholders of the Company. When, further to the Appointments and Remuneration Committee report, the Board of Directors learns that the interests of the Company are in jeopardy, the director ending his/her mandate or ceasing to hold his/her position for any other reason cannot provide his/her services to another entity with a similar corporate purpose to the Company and that is a competitor thereof according to the assessment of the Board of Directors, for the period established by it, which will in no case be greater than two (2) years. Article 21. Resignation of directors 244 Annexes 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 1. Directors will resign their positions when they have completed the period for which they were appointed and when decided on by the General Meeting under the powers legally or statutorily vested therein. 2. Directors will have to make their positions available to the Board of Directors and, if considered appropriate, formalise the corresponding resignation in the following cases: a) When they cease to hold the executive posts linked to their appointment as a director. As regards independent directors, when they complete twelve (12) years in the position. b) When they find themselves in a situation of conflict of interests or a prohibited situation as provided for by law. c) When they have been prosecuted for an allegedly criminal act or are subject to a disciplinary measure due to (gross) misconduct brought by the supervisory authorities. d) When their continued membership of the Board could put the Company’s interests in jeopardy and when the reasons for their appointment no longer exist. This last circumstance will be understood as occurring with regard to a director representing substantial shareholders when the full shareholding of which s/he is the owner or whose interests s/he represents have been disposed of and also when the reduction of their shareholding requires the consequent reduction of the directors representing substantial shareholders. 3. Executive directors must make their positions available to the Board once they have reached seventy years of age and the latter must decide whether they will continue exercising their executive or managerial functions or remain simply as a director. 4. In the event that, due to resignation or for any other reason, a director were to cease in his or her office prior to the end of his or her mandate, the reasons therefor shall be explained in a letter sent to all the members of the Board. Without prejudice to the timely communication of the cessation as a relevant event, the Board will give account of the cessation in the Annual Corporate Governance Report. 5. The Board of Directors may only propose the cessation of an independent director before the end of the statutory period when there is just cause, as appreciated by the Board following a report by the Appointments and Remuneration Committee. In particular, just cause will be deemed to exist when the director goes on to hold new offices or undertakes new duties that prevent him or her from devoting the necessary time to the tasks inherent in the role of director, fails to perform the duties inherent to his or her office or is involved in any of the circumstances that might cause him or her to lose his or her status of independent director, in accordance with the provisions of the applicable legislation. Such removal may also be proposed as a result of public offerings of acquisition, mergers or other similar corporate transactions that entail a change in the structure of the share capital of the Company, when such changes in the structure of the Board are brought about by the criterion of proportionality. Furthermore, in addition, it was approved in 2016 a Director Selection Policy stating that, in accordance with the provisions of the Limited Liability Company Law, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for proposing the nomination or re-election of members of the Board of Directors in the case of independent directors, with the Board itself being responsible for proposing nomination or re-election in all other cases. This proposal for nomination or re-election must be accompanied by an explanatory report from the Board that assesses the competence, experience and merits of the proposed candidate. Additionally, the proposal for nomination or reelection of any non-independent director must also be preceded by a report from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Selection of the candidates for director shall be based on a preliminary analysis of the necessities of the company, which must be carried out by the Board of Directors with advice and a report from the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The objective is to incorporate different professional and management experiences and competences, as well as to promote the diversity of knowledge, experiences and gender, considering the weight of the various activities carried out by Cellnex and taking into account any areas or sectors that should be specifically promoted. Any board member may request that the Nomination and Remuneration Committee takes into consideration a potential candidates to cover directorship vacancies, in the event that the Committee finds them suitable in its opinion. Additionally, the Selection Policy regulates the process and conditions that candidates must meet. 245 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT · CONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT 2018 CELLNEX NOTE OF CLARIFICATION ap.
