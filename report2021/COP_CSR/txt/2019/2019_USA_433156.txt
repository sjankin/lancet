Tapestry, Inc. 2019 Communication on Progress United Nations Global Compact 2 October 2019 CEO Statement It has been one year since Tapestry signed the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) to align our strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labor, the environment, and anticorruption. The UNGC shaped our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Goals—driving action across Tapestry as we work to achieve these goals. We are engaging our 21,000 employees, our business partners, and suppliers to embrace these Ten Principles. This engagement has strengthened our social and environmental impact across our corporate offices, partners, customers, stores, and our supply chain. At Tapestry, Corporate Responsibility is part of our DNA and influences everything we do—from product development to our philanthropic work, and how we engage with the communities in which we live and operate. Tapestry’s Corporate Responsibility program, Our Social Fabric, consists of three strategic pillars—Our People, Our Planet and Our Communities. We recognize that contributing to a world that is inclusive, sustainable and safe is a responsibility that falls on all of us. This is an ongoing process, but I am pleased with our progress. Attached to this cover note, you will find a listing of the UNGC Ten Principles along with steps we have taken to make progress against each Principle. The UNGC enables us, together with our peers across many industries, to make tangible and positive change where it matters. Thank you for establishing a roadmap that helps guide our efforts on these important initiatives. Jide J.
