However, as an airline, we primarily focus on our climate footprint as it is our most significant impact and an essential part of our customer offering. I am convinced that aviation in general, and SAS in particular, make a positive difference. We make it possible for businesses to grow and enable for people to meet, experience different cultures and bring them closer together. I firmly believe this can only lead to a more tolerant and better world, but we have a great responsibility to provide for a sustainable aviation industry. OUR CLIMATE PROGRESS DURING THE YEAR Significantly during the year, we set a new goal to reduce our total carbon emissions by 25% by 2030 compared to the base year 2005, which goes beyond International Air Transport Association targets. We reckon that around half of these reductions will be achieved through fleet renewal and other improvements, and the rest through the adoption of biofuels. In 2018, we introduced nine new Airbus 320neos and placed a final order for another 50 (in addition to the 30 previously ordered), which will provide us with a fuel-efficient single-type fleet by 2023. By 2030, we also aim to use bio-based jet fuel equivalent to our total domestic flight consumption. To help facilitate the large-scale development of biofuels, we signed a letter of intent with Preem to potentially supply 10–12% of our total fuel demand by 2023. Such ongoing measures are resulting in step-by-step reductions in our emissions. Our CO2 emissions per passenger kilometer decreased by 1.4% during the fiscal year. We have for some time carbon offset our own business trips and in April 2018 we began carbon offsetting all youth tickets. Going forward, we plan to carbon offset all trips made by our Eurobonus members, as well as offer all our passengers an option to purchase biofuel upgrade. as more fuel-efficient aircraft and the greater use of biofuels THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION to reduce emissions. I look forward to adding new Airbus 350 During the year, I joined the Nordic CEOs for a Sustainable long-haul aircraft to our fleet in 2019 and the ongoing introducFuture platform, which will enable us to share knowledge and tion of new Airbus 320neos until 2023. cooperate with like-minded corporate partners on sustainable The societal aspects of sustainability and the importance of business strategies.

We therefore focus on promoting aircraft efficiency and the transition to renewable jet fuels in our ISO 14001-certified environmental management system. COMMITTED TO INDUSTRY OBJECTIVES As a long-term societal actor, SAS intends to be part of a long term sustainable society by supporting the International Air Transport Association (IATA) ambition that it will be possible to fly commercially without material climate impact by 2050. The IATA and the airline industry have agreed on the following joint We focus on promoting aircraft efficiency and the transition to targets: biofuels. • Improved fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5% annually from 2009 to 2020 • Carbon-neutral growth from 2020 • 50% reduction in greenhouse CO2 emissions by 2050, comSAS FLIGHT OPERATIONS TOTAL CO 2 EMISSIONS AND TONNE KM pared with 2005 levels 5,000 Source: www.enviro.aero 4,600 SAS is fully committed to reaching the IATA targets and our 4,200 fuel efficiency has annually improved by approximately 2% 3,800 since 80 2010.

The reduction in emissions was largely due 97 to the introduction of 9 new Airbus 320neos and brand new 95 wet-lease aircraft. Our fleet now includes larger and more fuel93 efficient aircraft which allows us to carry more passengers with 91 lower emissions.

No severe incidents breaching any environmental permits were reported in FY 2018. Environmental-related costs In FY 2018, SAS external environment-related user charges and travel taxes amounted to MSEK 1,693 (1,413). These charges and travel taxes comprised environment-related travel taxes and user charges that are often associated with the environmental performance of aircraft and are included in landing fees. New fiscal environmental taxes have been imposed by the Swedish 2018 and the Norweigan Goverments during FY 2017. The aviation industry pays for its carbon emissions within the EU through the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU-ETS), which is an established market-based measure. SAS expensed emission rights related to the EU-ETS amounted to MSEK 110 (55) in FY2018. We believe that market-based measures should not distort competition but should address emission reduction targets and create incentives for continuous improvement. SAS has supported the development of a global, market-based solution for airline emissions for many years. The UN aviation organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), has decided on a global market-based measure for implementation by 2021 – the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). The key elements of a global solution should not distort competition SAS received a small number of noise violation reports in FY and should incorporate the UN’s CBDR principles (Common But 2018, one of these led to limited financial implications. The Differentiated Responsibility). At present, SAS is prepared to number of breaches has declined in recent years as a result of report its emissions but no tools are available that enable us to the procurement of quieter aircraft and improvement initiatives, calculate the potential costs associated with CORSIA. such as specific flight simulator training scenarios flying to and There are a growing number of environment-related taxes from airports with strict noise regulations. being introduced for passenger air transport, including a new Swedish Air Travel Tax introduced on 1 April 2018.
