Q1. seeking to be an “It’s a vital three year period that forms the first stage of our journey to achieve Group Vision 2026.” The new medium-term management plan, which runs from 2018 to 2020, is important because it is the first stage innovator that can of a journey toward achieving Group Vision 2026. This vision was created through repeated discussions that started when the new structure for the TIS INTEC Group, with TIS as the operating holding company, took effect on July 1, create new markets. 2016. The objective of Group Vision 2026 is to move forward as a cohesive corporate group, with everyone traveling in the same direction to boost corporate value. In 2017, we laid the groundwork through activities to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of Vision 2026 and concurrently drafted the current medium-term manToru Kuwano, TIS Chairman and President, agement plan. What makes this plan different from those that have come before it is that we planned backwards from the image defined under Group Vision 2026. With the end point as our starting point, we determined what talks about Medium-Term Management Plan we have to do to reach that destination and where our efforts should put us when the current medium-term man(2018–2020), which began in April 2018. agement plan concludes. The theme is, in a nutshell, “structural transformation.” Essentially, we will strive for sustainable profit growth and an emphasis on employee self-fulfillment by realizing structural transformation in three areas—concentrating on core businesses, shifting to a prior investment style of business development and expanding global business. Key performance indicators for March 2021 are a strategic domain sales ratio of 50%, operating income of ¥43 billion, an operating margin of 10% and return-on-equity of 12%. In addition, we will actively engage in prior investment and capitalize on M&A opportunities to leverage structural transformation, with investment up to a maximum of ¥80 billion over three years. What is the objective behind a strategic domain sales ratio of 50%? Q2. “Growth in IT offering service, which includes service-style business, is essential.” Group Vision 2026 sees the core businesses of the Group shifting toward four strategic domains— strategic partnership business (SPB), IT offering service (IOS), business function service (BFS) and frontier market creation business (SPB) —by 2026. Our emphasis on structural transformation and efforts to boost the strategic domain sales ratio, which currently sits at 35% and hinges on the SPB, is a reflection of a rapidly changing social landscape. Client companies are struggling with leading-edge digital technologies, notably, artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), as well as diversifying user needs, and they persist in a trial-and-error process in an attempt to figure out how best to adjust their business models and services to the new environment. It was typical, at one time, that system development required clear-cut issues and goals and then time and money invested over the medium to long term to address those issues and achieve those goals. But today, companies need IT and digital methods to get services and products to market as quickly as possible and then constantly update these services and products based on market response. In this environment, the TIS INTEC Group must also change, responding with flexibility and a sense of speed. That is, we have a different role to fulfill, moving away from a mission-accomplished style in favor of a solution-proposal style emphasizing speed. Given this situation, management tapped IT offering service as a strategic domain of particular importance for expansion during the medium-term management plan and placed service-style business*—at the heart of IT offering service—as a key growth engine. An example of service-style business is CreditCube+, a retail payment settlement-related business and a Group strength. Paralleling diversification in business models, the retail payment settlement business has attracted the interest of companies in distribution, communications and various other industries beyond financial institutions, Toru Kuwano, CEO and President including credit card companies. CreditCube+ is a SaaS*-style solution providing a credit card settlement platform system and services. It has the potential to reduce the time and cost needed prior to the start of a retail payment settlement business and will therefore play a part in the spread of cashless settlement by supporting companies that have entered this realm. 11 12 Consolidated Financial/ Medium-Term Platform that Supports Consolidated Profile Group History Value Creation Process Non-Financial Highlights To Our Stakeholders Management Plan Group Business Strategies Value Creation Process Corporate Data Financial Summary (ESG Section) The TIS INTEC Group’s retail payment settlement business strategy will continue to emphasize building and operDescribe your strategy for human resources. ating large-scale core systems for major financial institutions, which is an existing strength.

In addition, we set up Human Resources SBU in April 2018, formulated a corporate manifesto highlighting such points as creating a comfortable workplace, optimizing assignment of human resources and What is the difference between strategic partnership business and IT offering service? ensuring compliance from a labor perspective.

Consequently, we undertook a review of employee performance evaluations and the compensation structure, and in April 2018, we changed the management structure at TIS by adding two new business units—the Industry innovator to create new markets.” Strategy Sector and the Service Strategy Sector—and clarified the role of each unit. In conjunction with this, the To enhance the performance level and efficiency of management, we will continue to emphasize corporate goverreporting segments for TIS were changed. Financial IT and Industrial IT pursue industry-specific business activities with nance. From fiscal 2019, independent outside directors represent one-third of all directors, and one of the three strategic partnership business in mind, while Service IT focuses on IT offering service. The two other reporting segoutside directors is a woman—a first for TIS. We also set up two committees—the Nomination Committee and the ments are BPO, which provides business process outsourcing services, and Other. Compensation Committee—to ensure objectivity and transparency in the decision-making process for appointing and compensating directors. Meanwhile, with a view toward such factors as future implementation of international accounting standards, we intend to cut ¥2 billion, equivalent to 10% of head office costs, by fiscal 2021 through the integration of Group core systems between TIS and INTEC. Furthermore, to provide an incentive to directors and employees, we introduced a performance-linked stock incentive plan for directors and a trust-type employee stock ownership incentive plan for employees. Another new structure is the Corporate Sustainability Committee, which is part of an effort to make directors and employees more personally aware of the social aspect of operations as well as corporate social responsibility, that is, the contribution we can make through our business activities to provide solutions to social issues and thus support sustainable social development, and also to strengthen groupwide initiatives. Today might be called the age of digital transformation—a time when various leading-edge technologies create a significantly different society than before. Against this backdrop, what is the TIS INTEC Group’s raison d’etre? It is vital for each and every employee to be aware of our mission to create new markets and a bright future as an innovator, and that, as the external environment around us changes, so too much we change. I believe the previous medium-term management plan made it possible for us to exceed all numerical targets and, thanks to measures underpinned by three basic concepts—profit emphasis, IT brain and portfolio management—we achieved growth on a groupwide basis. But is that good enough? No. Through the current medium-term management plan, we will promote structural transformation and build a solid platform to support realization of Group Vision 2026. I am convinced that this will allow us to contribute even more to society through our business activities and constantly improve corporate value. There are many issues to address, but the path toward solutions is clear. All ­directors and employees under the TIS INTEC Group umbrella will strive as a cohesive team to reach new goals. The continued support of our stakeholders will, as always, be integral to our success. 13 14 Consolidated Financial/ Medium-Term Platform that Supports Consolidated Profile Group History Value Creation Process Non-Financial Highlights To Our Stakeholders Management Plan Group Business Strategies Value Creation Process Corporate Data Financial Summary (ESG Section) Looking Back on Third Medium-Term Management Plan “Beyond Borders 2017” (From April 2015 to March 2018) Despite some issues still to address, the Group achieved growth overall and Results Made Through Third Medium-Term Management Plan: Portfolio Management exceeded numerical targets in all categories through the previous medium-term Results of Key Activities management plan “Beyond Borders 2017”. ○ Promote total ● Implemented shift to operating holding company to strengthen Group governance optimization of ● Executed transfer of businesses (national health insurance, electricity and gas sectors) between Numerical Targets→Exceeded in all categories Basic Concepts TIS←→ INTEC Group operations ● Promoted concentration of domestic and overseas BPO operations under AGREX Numerical Targets (Fiscal 2018) Profit Emphasis ● Prioritized integration of systems with highly effective components to expand scope of shared △ ● Steadily improve profitability, matched to expanding business results Integrate/centralize systems within Group Estimates Actual results ● Work to prevent appearance of unprofitable projects, and continual shared functions ● Integrated offices in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya theme to keep at low level within Group ● Realized full Group rollout of CMS, improved capital efficiency of Group overall Net Sales ¥400.0 billion ¥405.6 billion ● Conducted review of strategic stockholdings and data centers, improved asset efficiency IT Brain Operating Income ¥30.0 billion ¥32.7 billion ● Wider demand for value-added creation style responses, along with ● Promoted project to pursue possible introduction of IFRS [Operating Margin] [7.5%] [8.1%] assignment solutions geared to client requests, will fuel expansion ● Reviewed business segments with eye toward breakdown better matched to new management structure ● Strengthened response to taxation topics (BEPS response), mainly at overseas Group companies ○ of consolidated sales Net Income Attributable to Owners of Parent Company ¥16.0 billion ¥20.6 billion ● Shift toward market-cultivating style services requires greater sense Realize higher level ● Promoted enhanced IR content through production of integrated report, effective from fiscal 2016 [5.1%] of administrative ● Organized and consolidated internal control management systems, and brought unified system [Net income to net [4.0%] of speed under Group Internal Control Committee supervision Achieved a year management sales ratio] ahead of schedule Portfolio Management ● Emphasized efforts to encourage women to be more active in workplace, seeking to build career-path diversity ROE 8.0% 9.9% ● Steadily leverage measures aimed at optimizing Group capabilities, *F our companies under Group umbrella received highest level certification under “Eruboshi” system, based on the Act Concerning the Promotion of Women's Career Activities.
