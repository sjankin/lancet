The board of directors has established limits to avoid excessive concentrations of risk, and through its investment policy and due diligence procedures IFU further seeks to identify and mitigate the equity and credit risk. 62 | IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Income statement Notes 2010 2009 Note DKK 1,000 DKK 1,000 22/ Equity and credit risk Equity risk Equity risk arises from changes in the fair values of share capital investments in projects. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that IFU will incur a financial loss due to a counterparty not fulfilling its obligation. These credit exposures occur from project loans, derivatives and other transactions. Managing equity and credit risk At portfolio level, IFU mitigates equity risk and credit risk by investing in a variety of countries and by limiting the concentration of risks per partner. IFU assesses concentrations of risk on the basis of total commitments, which include acquisition costs of both share capital investments and project loans, binding commitments and amounts payable on share capital and loan agreements. Further, through the due diligence process, IFU assesses the specific risks for each share capital investment and project loan and seeks to mitigate associated equity and credit risks. For some of IFU's share capital investments, IFU has the opportunity to sell the shares through pre-agreed exit agreements. In this way, IFU mitigates the risk of not being able to exit the investments. See note 27 for fair value measurement basis. On an ongoing basis, the credit quality of the projects is assessed based on among other things: Specific terms as agreed Current and expected operational results of the company Expected sales value and pledges Historical records of debt service IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 | 63 Notes Note The table below shows the distribution of the cost of IFU's investments by the OECD country risk classification. This classification takes into account the political and economic environment of each country, including risk of force majeure such as war, etc. The classification of each country is updated twice a year.

IFU has received the following types of securities: Pledges Indemnities and counter-guarantees The fair value of the pledges is DKK 236m (2017: DKK 269m) and for indemnity and guarantee commitments DKK 275m (2017: DKK 151m). IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 | 69 Notes Note 23/ Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument fluctuates due to changes in foreign exchange rates. IFU is exposed to currency risk through its investments that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency (DKK). It is IFU's general policy to hedge foreign exchange exposures originated from project loans in other currencies than EUR, when the principal of the loan is greater than the equivalent of USD 1m, and internal credit rating is above a certain threshold. IFU does not hedge local currency exposure in share capital investments, as costs are typically very high and by way of operation investments may have a natural built-in hedge, e.g. export-oriented businesses. IFU does not hedge commitments to disburse either, as timing and amounts are often difficult to foresee. IFU primarily uses cross currency swaps to hedge the exposure towards changes in foreign exchange rates on project loans. As exchange rate adjustments of the hedged item and fair value adjustments of the derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement, hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 is not applied. Currency exposure and sensitivity The following table indicates the currencies to which IFU had significant exposure as of 31 December on its financial assets and liabilities excluding share capital investments. The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably likely movement of the currency rate against DKK on profit or loss with all other variables held constant. There is no sensitivity effect on equity as IFU has no assets classified as available-for-sale or designated hedging instruments. 2018 Other Other Increase Provision Effects Project Interest projectprojectNet in foreign DKK 1,000 Hedged for losses on profit loans receivables related related exposure exchange Guarantees or loss receivables debt rates USD 336,983 12,039 2,413 (236,659) 0 0 114,776 10% 11,478 EUR 402,434 13,318 918 0 0 0 416,670 1% 4,167 DKK 168,481 5,033 11,140 236,659 0 (2,251) 419,062 N/A 0 Other 21,206 1,202 570 0 0 (39) 22,939 10% 2,294 Total 929,104 31,592 15,041 0 0 (2,290) 973,447 2017 Other Other Increase Provision Effects Project Interest projectprojectNet in foreign DKK 1,000 Hedged for losses on profit loans receivables related related exposure exchange Guarantees or loss receivables debt rates USD 399,815 11,526 1,925 (268,281) 0 (54) 144,931 10% 14,493 EUR 258,490 6,921 28,616 0 0 (129) 293,898 1% 2,939 DKK 190,781 4,659 16,799 268,281 0 (4,339) 476,181 N/A 0 Other 22,016 1,304 38,972 0 0 (2,082) 60,210 10% 6,021 Total 871,102 24,410 86,312 0 0 (6,604) 975,220 70 | IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Notes Note 24/ Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments. Most of IFU's investments in project loans carry variable interbank interest rates, thus changes in interest rates will mainly affect future cash flows and income. Interest rate exposure and sensitivity The annual effect of changes in the interest rate only affects the fair value of fixed rate loans. For variable rates loans, the effect on profit and loss will be a change in the interest payments for the coming year.

It is IFU's policy to maintain a positive cash position. A DKK 300 million credit facility shared with IØ is in place to cover unexpected negative short-term fluctuations in cash flows. At year-end, DKK 236 million was available for drawing. Furthermore, IFU has access to loan financing of DKK 800m from Danmarks Nationalbank. No drawings had been made on this lending line at the end of 2018. Including the credit facility and lending line at the national bank, total liquidity ressources available to IFU amount to DKK 1,615m at year-end 2018.

The fair value of these project loans amounts to DKK 235m (2017: DKK 133m) measured as the net present value of the future cash flow. The inputs used to measure the fair value for project loans are all level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy, for more information see disclosure on fair value measurement, note 27. For other loans and receivables and other liabilities the carrying amount is measured at amortised cost a reasonable approximation of fair value. 27/ Fair value measurement basis The calculation of fair value is based on a fair value hierarchy that reflects the level of judgement associated with the inputs used to measure the fair value. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: • Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date • Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly; and • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that have been applied in valuing the respective assets or liabilities. • In the following sections a short description of the overall principle for IFU’s calculation of fair value is provided. For all investments the value determined by using the methods described below will be adjusted, if considered necessary and appropriate, by taking the following factors into account: 1) Current and expected operational results of the project company 2) Risk of remittance, if any 3) Specific circumstances relating to the partners, project, country, region and/or sector 4) Current market conditions 5) Tax issues Share capital investments Most of IFU’s fair value estimates are based on unobservable market data (level 3). Indirect investments through financial intermediaries (funds) where the underlying investments are valued according to a fair value principle will be valued at net assets value according to the most recent financial statement received by IFU. Financial intermediaries include own managed funds, loan funds, (externally managed) funds where IFU has a managerial role and externally managed private equity funds. For own managed funds, IFU has made the fair value assessment of the indirect investments following the same principles as described here. Direct investments are valued as follows: • In the initial phase all investments are valued at cost price less any impairment adjustment, as this is deemed to provide a good indication of fair value. Hereafter investments will be valued at either the Discounted Cash Flow method (DCF), by an earnings multiple if appropriate and reliable transaction/earnings multiples are available, or by the net assets methodology, if appropriate. For direct investments in financial institutions, intrinsic value is applied in cases where it reflects fair value. For smaller investments, see below. • If during the 12-month period prior to the reporting date IFU has received a binding offer in writing from a third party, or a significant transaction has taken place, the shares will normally be valued based on the offer or the recent transaction. IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 | 75 Notes Note The following general assumptions are applied when performing DCF or earnings multiple calculations: • For DCF calculations, budgets and forecasts for the investments form the basis for the valuation. • A weighted average cost of capital based on the cost of equity and the cost of debt weighted by the targeted financial leverage from the industry. Growth in terminal period is based on the estimated long-term inflation rate of the country. • An illiquidity discount is applied and other specific adjustments may be applied where relevant for both DCF and earnings multiple calculations. Valuing private investments in developing countries at fair values involves a large inherent uncertainty. Due to these uncertainties, a degree of caution is applied when exercising judgements and making the necessary estimates. For smaller investments (cost price or intrinsic value below DKK 25m) uncertainties are deemed to be even higher and therefore these will be valued at intrinsic value to reflect IFU’s share of earnings in the companies. These investments constitute a minor part of IFU’s portfolio. Some share capital investments include a pre-agreed exit agreement. In these cases the value of the exit agreements is taken into consideration as part of the fair value calculation. Investments valued according to exit agreements are in the table below disclosed together with investments valued based on a recent binding offer or transaction. 76 | IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Notes Note DKK 1,000 DKK 1,000 2018 DKK 1,000 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Share capital investments Opening balance 4,213 0 1,945,669 1,949,882 Adjustment 01/01-2018 due to integration of facilities 0 0 66,733 66,733 Transfers into the level 0 0 15,678 15,678 Transfers out of the level 0 0 0 0 Total gains/ losses for the period included in profit or loss 1 (15,016) 0 (206,850) (221,866) Paid-in share capital in projects 31,738 0 550,336 582,074 Proceeds from divestment of shares 0 0 (15,786) (15,786) Closing balance 20,935 0 2,355,780 2,376,715 Other receivables Opening balance 0 82,154 0 82,154 Closing balance 0 10,800 0 10,800 Derivative financial instruments (Assets) Opening balance 0 17,451 0 17,451 Closing balance 0 5,144 0 5,144 Derivative financial instruments (Liabilities) Opening balance 0 8,057 0 8,057 Closing balance 0 9,342 0 9,342 Total recurring fair value measurements 20,935 25,286 2,355,780 2,402,001 IFU ANNUAL REPORT 2018 | 77 Notes Note 2017 DKK 1,000 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Share capital investments Opening balance 3,233 0 1,767,212 1,770,445 Transfers into the level 0 0 10,094 10,094 Transfers out of the level 0 0 0 0 Total gains/ losses for the period included in profit or loss 1 980 0 66,016 66,996 Paid-in share capital in projects 0 0 270,329 270,329 Proceeds from divestment of shares 0 0 (167,982) (167,982) Closing balance 4,213 0 1,945,669 1,949,882 Other receivables Opening balance 0 85,845 0 85,845 Closing balance 0 82,154 0 82,154 Derivative financial instruments (Assets) Opening balance 0 252 0 252 Closing balance 0 17,451 0 17,451 Derivative financial instruments (Liabilities) Opening balance 0 44,586 0 44,586 Closing balance 0 8,057 0 8,057 Total recurring fair value measurements 4,213 107,662 1,945,669 2,057,544 1) Recognised in Contribution from share capital investments.

Each appointment is personal. The current three-year term ends on 31 July 2021. Since 1 January 2013, an observer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been appointed to IFU’s board of directors. The board of directors usually convenes six to eight times a year. On the recommendation of the executive management, it makes decisions about investments and key issues. It is noted that the chairman and deputy chairman have both been members of the board for more than 12 years and as such cannot be considered independent in accordance with the recommendations by the Danish Committee on Corporate Governance. Further it is noted that IFU in 2018 had business transactions with Nykredit Bank A/S (part of the Nykredit group, in which the chairman is CEO), with Kjaer Group A/S, which is majority owned by board member Mads Kjær, and with Royal Danish Fish Group A/S, in which board member Jens Jørgen Kollerup is a board member. The rules of procedure for the board contain detailed rules regarding conflict of interest – as well as a reference to the conflict of interest rules in the Danish Public Administrations Act, which the board is subject to – and the above-mentioned business transactions are not considered to be of a nature as to impair the general independence of the board members.
