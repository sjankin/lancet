It is a lot about applying a safety attitude and employee engagement, but it is also to observe anticipated workflows at workplaces and to analyse where physical and adverse workloads can be reduced. 5S method Also the plant in Krakow, Poland, extended their 5S approach The St. Petersburg followed a comparable approach to develop The 5S method is a standardised process that, when properly when installing a new printing machine in 2018.

Noise reduction walls between machines and insulation inside the machines also contributes to a better work environment and the noise level was reduced by 1-1,5 dB giving the operators better abilities to talk to each other easily. Increasing awareness and involvement To keep awareness and employee involvement in work safety topics on a high level is key. To support this the Cholet plant in France started to update their safety risk assessment with new procedures in 2018. To improve the involvement of operators safety teams per department were implemented and they were given special training followed by work safety risk analysis of their areas and self-auditing of each department. This is the same approach as already applied for HACCP and also includes reviewing and reducing stress factors. Actions plans are worked out and followed on.

One target is to move to digitalisation and thereby reduce the use of paper and documents. This has started at several plants and as an example the plant in Cholet, France, saved about 12.000 sheets of paper per year through storing all sales orders and related documents on a group server. This is of course a small contribution but an important signal to the employees to review their material use at work and in private life. PROMOTING CARTONS Pro Carton, the European Association of Carton and Cartonboard manufacturers, main purpose is to promote the use of cartons and cartonboard. A recent activity was the start of TICCIT (Trees Into Carton – Carton in to Trees) programme, an educational outreach programme that is all about trees, sustainability and the environment. The idea is to make contact with local primary schools and teach the kids all about trees and why there are good, how paper and cartons are made and why recycling is important. Several AR Packaging plants have or plan to support this programme. The plant in Frankfurt, Germany, produced special tree boxes for an event at a local school and the kids were informed about sustainability of carton board boxes. Supported by a local nursery the boxes were filled with humus and children planted trees which they took home to plant. The box initially serves as a water reservoir, but lets the roots through easily and decomposes in the soil after a short time. From tree to carton and from carton back to tree.

R UBR IK 51 EMISSIONS AND REDUCTION OF CARBON FOOTPRINT The aim to reduce emissions is closely linked to the reduction of energy consumption and consequently an increased energy efficiency leading to improvements for both the environment and economy. Furthermore, in terms of introducing an emission trading system or a tax on carbon dioxide, which is being discussed in the European Union, emissions shall be reduced and kept as low as possible. CARBON FOOTPRINT less energy consumption lead to a direct or indirect reduction AR Packaging has an extensive product portfolio with cartonof greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

This makes the paper and board industry the largest producer of bioenergy in Europe (source: Pro carton). The industry continues to invest in more efficient use of electricity, increasing use of bioenergy and focus on measurement and control of water use. This is also the aim for AR Packaging, driven by the local plants. In addition to the significant impact of raw materials, the carbon footprint reduction for AR Packaging is closely linked to lowered energy consumption and related emissions.
