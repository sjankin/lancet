Profile 1 – Strategy and Analysis Global Compact Report President of the Board's Report on Supporting Global Compact The importance of Global Compact initiative, for both the international business community and the community at large is recognized by our company, but also the value of the initiative for the company itself, through a chance of daily revision and improvement of its business performance. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. joined Global Compact in 2007. Our business continued with successful recovery and growth in last several years, after business conditions and profitability on global market were strongly effected during the crisis started by the end of the previous decade, which forced the most of companies on significant reduction of costs and previously defined plans. However our business principles and practice were not changed in times of crises and recovery, strengthening our opinion that in difficult times everyone should even stronger apply fairness and other right principles in own business environment. We believe that a business is successful only if the profit is gained from socially and environmentally responsible business activities, not to be sacrificed for (usually short-term) financial goals only and that Global Compact principles keep their importance no matter of changes we witness on the global market. We continuously improve our market position with the goal of achieving the best possible results, but also we are aiming to be involved in positive development of business environment, by conducting our business in such a manner as to respect human rights, protect our environment and respect all of the principles comprehensively summarized by Global Compact into the ten most important principles of responsible business conduct. On behalf of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. I can confirm that we continue to apply and promote the concept of socially responsible business conduct and every single principle of Global Compact.

Profile 2 – Organisational profile Social Responsibility in Business Performance Social responsibility is one of the founding principles of our Company, as a general idea representing the commitment of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. to perform its activities in a fair, responsible manner and with consideration towards its business partners, employees and owners. This is also the founding principle of the founder of Scott Bader, expressed through the Commonwealth organisation (employee unity), based on the decisions and acts of Ernest Bader, the founder and owner of Scott Bader in England, a large multinational company today with companies on five continents. The founding of the SCOTT BADER Company and Group Scott Bader Company Limited was established in 1923. Ernest Bader was a Swiss emigrant who set up a merchandising venture in London in 1920 with the sole agency for Swiss celluloid in the UK. By 1932 Scott Bader had moved into manufacturing in the East End of London and in wartime 1940 evacuated to Wollaston, Northamptonshire. The factory built at Wollaston was to manufacture phenolic pastes, reclaim rubber emulsions and produce resins for paints. In 1946 Scott Bader became the first unsaturated polyester resin manufacturer in Europe with licences from America. The Commonwealth The Founders, having experienced industrial strikes and two world wars wanted to create better and peaceful human relationships by moving forward from the usual shareholder/capitalist structures in industry. So in 1951 all the share capital and therefore the ownership of the Company was transferred, free of charge, to Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited, an organisation created for that purpose with charitable status. This highly generous and imaginative act established a common trusteeship business. This means that we have no external Shareholders. All the shares are held in trust and this makes us totally independent. Making a positive Difference 4/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. The intention of the Founders was to create a different company, its well-being entrusted to those who work in it with democratic involvement. As a result of our organisation the employees enjoy many of the benefits (and responsibilities) of ownership without the right to sell the business. Our main responsibility is that each generation of employees must ensure the ongoing success of the organisation so that future generations can benefit from its continued existence. In April 2011 Scott Bader Group celebrated important jubilee – 60 years of Commonwealth, i.e. 60 years since the former Ernest Bader gave his company to employees for common management and trusteeship. Where does Scott Bader operate today? When Scott Bader became a Common Trusteeship Company it operated only in the UK. Over the last 50 years the company has expanded geographically and today has manufacturing companies not only in United Kingdom, but also in France, Croatia, South Africa, Middle East, Canada, India and South America. It also has distribution companies or research centres in Ireland, Czech Republic, Sweden, Germany, Spain, USA and China. It employs over 650 people worldwide. Main markets and industries where Scott Bader companies deliver their products are: marine industry transport chemical containment building industry coatings wind industry graphic arts textiles and furnishes Making a positive Difference 5/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. From Scott Bader customers… The Al Barai Luxury Villas and Apartments use fire retardant roofing and façade panels manufactured with Crestafire® Gelcoat and Resin Terrazzo Dubai Co LLC is an established manufacturer of high quality composites products with eight plants manufacturing various composites products including tiles, precast items and prefabricated buildings. Their products are made to meet the most stringent international Fire, Smoke & Toxic (FST) fume performance specifications. Scott Bader’s Crestafire® gelcoat 76PA and Crestafire® 349 E PA resin were chosen by Terrazzo to manufacture the roofing elements and facades for the Al Barari Luxury Villas and Apartments due to their excellent Fire, Smoke & Toxic fume performance characteristics. “The relationship between Terrazzo and Scott Bader is strong and continues to grow. We enjoy working with high quality products and technically sound staff. Scott Bader has wide product range, which meets most of our requirement ranging from fire retardant products to food grade products to chemical resistance products.” – Terrazzo, Dubai Co LLC Composite canopies manufactured using Crystic® resin and gelcoat Leading property developers St George commissioned NORCO to manufacture 3 unique 14m long canopies to be installed on the flagship One Blackfriars development in Central London. The project called for NORCO to build the canopies to look like polished metal features, while being lightweight and robust enough to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. The canopies were constructed from Scott Bader’s Crystic® resin VE67903PA to create a glass fibre composite laminate with a closed cell structural foam core to provide adequate panel stiffness over the large hollow wing shape. A resin infusion process was adopted for the production of the composite panels, which provided a high quality and void free laminate. NORCO carefully refined a staged infusion approach, specifically for the manufacture of the metal coated areas, in order to avoid ‘print through’ of the composite materials onto the external surface. Scott Bader’s grey Crystic® gelcoat GT600 RAL 2043 was then used as a back-up behind the VeroMetal spray on the canopies to ensure a consistent metal finish.

Steve Golding, Composite Production Supervisor at NORCO, commented: “I have worked with many materials on various composite projects and I cannot fault Scott Bader’s applications. Their products are consistent and provide a high-quality end result. There is no reason to look elsewhere.” The One Blackfriars development consists of a 52-storey tower of a maximum height of 170 meters and two smaller buildings of six and four storeys respectively. It includes residential flats, a hotel and retail units, along with a public space. Construction began in 2013 and will conclude this year. Of the three canopies manufactured by NORCO, one is already in place and the others are due to be installed shortly. NORCO Composites & GRP was established in 1985 in Dorset in the UK and specialise in large composite structures and GRP mouldings for end users all across the globe.

Quality, Environment and Occupational Health and Safety Policy is available to all interested parties. CODE OF PRACTICE FOR COMMONWEALTH MEMBERS A We are a business community and it is our basic attitude and approach to our work and fellow workers that gives life and purpose to the Commonwealth B As a worldwide community we realise the long term health of Scott Bader requires attention to four aspects of the business (i) active democratic involvement (ii) social cohesion (iii) strong research and development (iv) financial growth The practical working out of a balance between the four tasks is a continuing responsibility for the membership as a whole C It is our common responsibility to work together, locally and internationally in such a way that;  We show respect and dignity to each other  Working for Scott Bader has meaning and is fulfilling and we feel valued for our contribution D Being in a position of authority Managers must:  Manage and be accountable to members for their actions  Manage in a style that is participative and consultative  Facilitate change and improvement and encourage others to do the same E Our company manages through mutual collaboration; therefore as members we must accept responsibility for our actions through:  A willingness to learn, develop and grow as individuals  Improved communication between each other and between groups and departments  Being understanding and patient towards problems encountered  Recognising and encouraging contributions made by others, both locally and internationally  A willingness to attend meetings and to participate in the affairs of our local and international community F We must:  Be open, honest and frank in our relationships with each other  Face difficulties directly rather avoid them  Solve problems by discussion and agreement rather than through a mediator G In the event of a downturn in trade we will consider whether circumstance Making a positive Difference 33/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. make it desirable or practical to share all remaining work rather than expect any of our fellow members to be deprived of employment, even if this requires a reduction in earnings. However should a study of our business reveal that it would be in its best interest to reduce or eliminate certain jobs, we will do this in the fairest and most objective way. In particular we will wherever possible offer alternative work. H We have agreed not to hold second jobs without having first sought the approval from the company. I The foundation/creation of our Commonwealth abolished the existence of Scott Bader shareholders and with it the power of share ownership. For this reason we will not acquire other companies, without offering their staff Commonwealth membership as quickly as possible. J We have a responsibility to the society in which we live and believe that should we have a special talent or interest, it would be right to offer this to the wider community. Members are encouraged to engage in some to form of social or public service, however small. K Our social responsibility also extends to 1. Limiting the use of our products to applications beneficial to the community, in particular excluding specific applications used in manufacturing weapons of war 2. Reducing any harmful effects our work has on the natural environment, e.g. by rigorously avoiding the negligent discharge of pollutants 3. Constantly working towards reducing activities that waste the earth’s natural resources L As members of the Commonwealth we support and commit to the principles of the Commonwealth and will do our best to live these out in both our working and private lives Making a positive Difference 34/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF GLOBAL COMPACT Making a positive Difference 35/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. The founding principles of Global Compact The principles which we accept in full and act in accordance with: Human Rights Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights SCOTT BADER d.o.o. operates on international market, cooperating with business partners for which we believe that within their business activities in no manner participate in violating human rights or contribute to minimizing them in any of their other activities in a broader community. In the event that we discovered otherwise, our company would terminate its business relationship with such a company. Principle 2: Ensure that the company itself is not complicit in human rights abuses The founding principles of the Scott Bader Group include an explicit principle of respecting human rights, without which the Companies of the Group would not fulfil the most important precondition of their existence. Our Company has internal acts which were enacted in accordance with legal provisions and with the consent of its employees through their Council. A person has been authorised to which all remarks regarding any form of human rights violation, dignity or the endangerment of an employee. We are a small company in which most of our employees have been working for us for many years now and thereby fostering a mutual respect represents a foundation for good cooperation among employees and for including new employees into our labour processes. Labour Standards Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Every employee of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has the opportunity to exercise their right to freedom of association. 1% of employees are members of the Trade Union of Chemical Industry Workers and 98% are members of the Commonwealth, a union of employees within the Group, through which they exercise their right to participate in reaching decisions regarding the most important issues related to the Company's business and other issues related to the Statute of the Company. Making a positive Difference 36/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. The Local Council of employees members of the Commonwealth, is based on the same foundations and, alongside with Trade Union representatives, represents an additional form of representing employees and exercising their rights. Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Scott Bader opposes any form of forced and compulsory labour which is contrary to the principles of conducting business. The same is requested from all business partners and members of the greater community to which it belongs. The choice and change of one's job position is a basic human right. Each new employee is fully informed of his/her rights and obligations through all internal acts of the Company, and is enabled to and expected to be an equal member of the team which he/she joins, because this is the only manner in which a company can function well. Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labour SCOTT BADER d.o.o. fully supports the abolition of child labour which is not a humane or permissible way of making a profit but rather an activity with long-term consequences in the future. The principle is clearly stated in our internal acts. Below is age structure per main departments in the company: Administration Operations Years 2015 2016 2017 2018 2015 2016 2017 2018 below 18 years 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18-20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 21-30 3 2 0 0 8 10 10 11 31-40 3 4 5 4 15 17 19 18 41-50 1 1 1 2 8 9 9 9 51-55 3 2 2 1 4 5 3 5 above 55 years 2 3 3 4 16 8 8 8 Total 12 12 12 11 51 49 49 51 Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Our Company does everything in its power, by respecting the founding provisions of legislation, by enacting the Company's internal acts and by acting in a fair and nondiscriminating manner with respect to employment and in relations with its employed co-workers, to ensure that there is no discrimination in any segment of our activities. In recruiting process of new employees there are clearly set criteria which eliminate discrimination with respect to employment. No discrimination may be applied related to sex, race, religion, political affiliation or nationality, family status or personal beliefs. The same criterion is applied to the salaries of our employees. Making a positive Difference 37/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. Our internal acts include a description of a mechanism which is at the disposal of our employees for protection from any form of discrimination, as well as procedures set and appointed persons responsible for resolving any situation in which an employee might feel discriminated in any way. Group’s policies like Dignity at Work Policy, Whistle-blowing Policy, Equal Opportunities Policy as well as a number of policies to be applied for new employment as well as on daily procedures, ensure that a good practise and treatment of our people is constant and continuous. Principle 7: Environment SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being a responsible company operating in the field of the chemical industry, pays special attention to environmental protection. Scott Bader Group in own activities consider applying these three pillars: Ecology, Humanity, Business. In conformance with its own principles of sustainable development and business operations and guided by the principles of the Group's operations, including explicitly high standards in environmental protection measures, employee health care and improving work conditions in general, the Company meets and increases the high standards in these fields of industry. As a member of the Scott Bader Group, SCOTT BADER d.o.o. is further obliged to fulfil all the necessary conditions of operations and activities that lead towards the protection of the environment. Monitoring the performance in the field on a regular basis ensures that all employees, as well as interested partners, are well informed about this segment of our operations and, even more importantly, sets new goals for improvement on the basis of former experiences. Basic issues of environmental protection and business operations are regulated by the Company's internal acts with the purpose of eliminating any adverse impact to environment: Rules on waste management from the technological process of wastewater treatment; Rules on operation and pre-treatment of waste and sewage water; an Operating plan of activities in case of sudden pollution; a Waste management plan; an Operating plan of activities in environmental protection; Rules on the disposal of waste oils; Fire safety and Environmental Permit according to IPPC regulation. By fulfilling legal obligations in enacting the required rules and plans, the Company utilizes such a manner of defining the obligations as an additional opportunity for an on-going review of its achievements in the field. The Company makes continuous investments in the protection of the environment, the improvement of production conditions, safety at work, and improving working conditions in the Company in general. Making a positive Difference 38/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. Below are some of the large-scale spending and investments made during the period year 2014 to year 2018: reconstruction of the flooring in production plants. Its aim is to match the latest environmental and production standards. reconstruction of the pools in which hazardous substances are stored new pumps and pipes (to prevent leakage) old level indicators on all monomer underground tanks was replaced with new ones new waterproof floor in peroxide warehouse replacement of insulation system (sheet and thermal wool) on all outside storage tanks and Pthalic Anhydride and Maleic Anhydride storage tank decreasing of thermall losses of all heated buildings replacing obsolete equipment with new reliably high energy efficient equipment (reactors, pumps, agitators, lights ...) The section Environmental impacts contains indicators of the application of this principle in more detail. in 2014 we got construction permit for 1st stage of VOC treatment plant for waste air from SCOTT BADER d.o.o. process plant. We also finished 1st stage (connecting all process waste air outlets to collecting and measuring line) in 2015. in 2014 we have started DCS migration project. Replacing old procces control system with new one Honeywell DCS. It was finished during 2017. in 2014 adaptations are finished in production plant control room, bathrooms, rest room and workers wardrobes from 2014 to 2017 we changed all windows with new thermal insulated and we put additional thermal outside cladding at production, warehouses and offices buildings (decreasing heat loss factor) and renewed production offices roofing with 100 mm thicker heat insulation (decreasing heat loss factor) in 2016 we made new waterproof floors in additives preparing and measuring storage in 2016 we changed all windows and doors, in order to decrease heat loss factor, in oils and alcohols warehouse. in February 2017 we installed VOC pollution control system: RTO (Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer) and official TOC, NOx and CO measurements shows very low emissions of hydrocarbons from production. in 2018 we have upgraded system to collect more rainwater for cooling system used in production. Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Being a manufacturer of chemical products, our environmental responsibility is exceptionally important in our everyday activities. We support any action which results Making a positive Difference 39/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. improving environmental protection and to that end undertake all measures available within our Company. Through cooperation with our business partners, and primarily our customers, we strive to share all of our knowledge regarding the proper application of our products, which we achieve by providing high-quality comprehensive documentation on our products, obtaining all required certificates, subcontracting transport companies with a high quality of service, providing instructions pertaining to managing packaging, packaging disposal etc. Large-scale changes are being introduced to the chemical industry with the implementation of the REACH regulation. We have been participating in the activities related to implementing the regulation from the very beginning and we try to set an example in the fulfilment of all of the REACH requirements in order to help and motivate others to do the same. STATEMENT REGARDING REACH SCOTT BADER d.o.o. is a manufacturer of polymeric products, which are themselves exempt from REACH Registration requirements. However, the raw material substances must be registered. For all supplied raw materials and for those traded products that are not exempt from the REACH Regulations, SCOTT BADER d.o.o. relies on the supply chain to also have completed Registrations according to the applicable deadlines (June 2018). To this end, we are continuing to work in close contact with our suppliers, including those located outside the EU, to ensure that all REACH obligations are met without interrupting supply. Because SCOTT BADER d.o.o. products are mixtures of several substances, the responsibility for REACH Registration of each of these substances lies not with SCOTT BADER d.o.o. but with the original manufacturer or importer of the substance. Each substance will have its own REACH Registration deadlines, depending mostly upon the manufacturer/importer's tonnages. As and when SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has any information from suppliers that any substances present in our products have been registered, we will pass it along to any affected customers by means of updated material safety data sheets for the affected products. Each substance placed on the market that SCOTT BADER d.o.o. either manufactures or imports has been or will be notified to the Classification and Labelling Inventory, as required by the CLP Regulations. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. relies on its suppliers to Notify substances that they either manufacture or import. All SDS for our products (mixtures) are conformed to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 (REACH), Annex II, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/830. Making a positive Difference 40/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies SCOTT BADER d.o.o, as well as the sector for development of the Scott Bader Group, works intensively on the development of products, developed and enhanced in a manner in which by no means endanger the environment. It is our goal to place an increasing number of resins on the market with a lower content of volatile compounds, solvents and styrene. To that end we developed a new generation of alkyd “high solid” resins with a drastically reduced content of solvents. Furthermore, a solvent-less resin was developed, which represents the latest generation of environmentally acceptable alkyd resins on a global level. Polyester resins with a low content and low emission of styrene are also being developed along those lines. Furthermore, new acrylic resins with environmentally acceptable solvents (butyl acetate instead of toluene etc.) are also being developed. In alkyd emulsion project we intend to leave solvent based alkyd resins, now we pass lab and pilot plant step. Next phase will be verification of paint formulations and after that scale-up to Plant. Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery SCOTT BADER d.o.o. decidedly condemns acts of corruption, extortion or bribery committed in order to achieve business goals. We have never been, nor shall we ever let ourselves become involved in a situation that may lead towards any corruptive activity. We are improving our business operations on both the international market and our local market and achieve our results only by operating in a competitive and fair manner. As a member of Scott Bader Group and as a company with business activities in a number of countries around the globe, we are applying Bribery Act. Related to this, our Group managers worldwide, as well as some other employees involved in purchasing and sales are obliged to have the training at Bribery Act and pass the test.

ECONOMIC DIMENSION Making a positive Difference 42/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. EC1 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. kept its position as the sole manufacturer of composite resins and speciality polymers in Croatia, being the leader on the regional market and recognised on the European and larger market, together with other producers of the Scott Bader Group. Our company nurteres and sucessfully keeps its years-long tradition of supplying highquality products to customers all around the world, by introducing product brands and ranges of Scott Bader. In order to respond in a fast and proper manner to all quality requirements of our customers, we have to understand their needs, work closely with them to find and offer new solutions for their production. This requires investments into product development and new technologies, following the Vision and the Strategy of our Company and the Group. SCOTT BADER d.o.o., as a manufacturer and also an exporter of chemical products, is exposed to oscillations on both the raw-materials market and on the final products market. We operate on a very complex market, subject to extremely fast and non-predictable changes. Sales volume of products sold in 2018 was 16.607 tonnes, close to last year 16.906 t. This created turnover from sales of 199 m HRK (in 2017 was 194 m HRK), with share of export sales of 85%, with sales into more than 20 countries.

Making a positive Difference 43/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. The next table shows turnover (in HRK) per our customers’ countries year on year: 45.000.000 40.000.000 2015 2016 2017 2018 35.000.000 30.000.000 25.000.000 20.000.000 15.000.000 10.000.000 5.000.000 0 Costs of production are mostly related to the utilisation of raw material and in 2018 the value of those was depending on changes / increase of raw material prices, which significantly effected / decreased margins in the first half of the year. Net profit at the end of 2018 was lower than in couple previous years, due to difficult conditions on the market, specifically due to raw material prices increases. Other cost of the company, especially those contollable by the company, were in 2018 kept on the low levels with the continous control, internal contribution to savings and with investments those would bring cost savings in future periods, but also taking in account environmental requirements and general sustainability principles and aims. Internal efforts and solutions, especially in investment and maintenance area, with different technical improvements and cost savings, was an important supportive factor to the profitablity of our company. The Company therefore tries and succeeds to utilise its capacities to a maximum level through continuous improvements of the organisation, technology, quality, cost management and human part (personnel) of the business. Profit before tax for 2018 was 1,48 m HRK (in 2017: 2,97 m) and profit after tax was 1,21 m HRK (in 2017: 2,42 m). In 2018 our company invested over 3 m HRK, on which the larger part was related to further environmental protection improvements, as well in manufacturing process automatisation. In 2018, as well as in previous years, there were either no larger issues with debt collections and there is no non collected invoices from the period. Financial situation of the company is stabile, all liabilities are settled on time. Further applying of the policy of strict risk monitoring resulted with minimal uncollected debts at year end. There is a continuous investment in our people too. After the larger generation change, when a number of our colleagues are leaving for pension, we employed more younger people than it was the case for longer period, organising all needed trainings, education and smooth full involvement in our team and preparation to respond to all needed requirements of our specific production and organisation. Our employees are also involved in a number of Group trainig and other different activities, enabling their develpment in their roles and their personal development too. Making a positive Difference 44/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. The Company's income consists of trade and other income. Trade income is income from sales of our products on domestic and foreign markets and a small share of income from selling services and merchandise. Other income includes interest, forex, sales from fixed and other long-term assets and other smaller income positions those could appear.

Furthermore, there are also transportation costs, energy and other costs related to production and production plant maintenance. Other business expenditures include travel costs, security and fire protection, royalties, forex, working protection, insurance, bank fees etc. Employees' salaries and benefits include wages, taxes, transportation costs and other costs for the employees as well as paid benefits (bonuses, jubilee awards etc.). Paid interest would include the interest paid for a, but there was none in 2018. Existing non-interest bearing intercompany credit decreases the Company's exposure towards third parties and enables a more favourable financial arrangement than it would have been should a loan be granted by a third party (e.g. domestic banks). Payments to the State include all mandatory payments regarding VAT, income and other taxes, contributions and other payments. * Investments into the Community: this segment shows the specific characteristics of the organization and functioning of the basic principles in the Scott Bader Group and the existence of Commonwealth. The Scott Bader Group is expressively turned towards its local and wider community, and its financial participation is performed through donations, voted on Assembly by all members of the Commonwealth and paid from a joint fund on the Group level. Therefore the amounts of donations are not shown in the table above, as no expense for local company occurred, although the donations were made to Croatian charities, following the proposal of SCOTT BADER d.o.o. employees.

SOCIAL DIMENSION Making a positive Difference 46/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. SOCIAL DIMENSION Aspect: Community SO1. Nature, range and efficiency of a program or general practice by which the impact of business activities on community is assessed and managed, including the stages of input, activity and output. 1. Importance SCOTT BADER d.o.o., being a participant in a social community, both local and wider, by its sheer existence, through employing people and the level of respecting labour relations, has a social impact.

Donations SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has been proposing over the years to the joined fund the charities that the donations might be granted to, mostly those providing aid for children, young and ill people. The Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited is a registered charity which owns the shares of Scott Bader Company Limited. It receives all of its income from the company. The amount to be donated is either an amount equal to the amount payable as Group Staff Bonus or 1 per cent of the Scott Bader Group Staff Salary Cost, whichever is the greater Local fund is designated to each of the subsidiaries or small operations of SBCL located around the world and is shared out based upon the number of people employed at each of the locations. It is then for the Commonwealth Members at each location to decide collectively either via a charity committee or similar, which charities they would like to propose to the Trustees In the year 2018 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. has got from Scott Bader Commonwealth Limited amounts of 12.960 GBP to be donated. Over several years funds were donated to charity organisation we knew for years and we recognized their need for addition financial help. We wanted to keep continuity and of several years and give some kind of additional security to those organisation that, if they fullfil known conditions from Commonwealth, they could rely on help from Scott Bader for some time. During 2014 and 2015 we added few more charity associations to be donated where we recognize the need for help. With this we continued in 2016 also so we donated few new associations. SCOTT BADER d.o.o. employees are involved in charity and voluntary work.

Debra’s activities are aimed towards improvement of health and social security. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a very rare severe genetic disease that apart from skin problems makes complications and causes many side effects on other organs (eyes, digestion system, locomotion system etc.). EB requires a multidisciplinary approach and systematic monitoring of the patients. Most of the EB sufferers are 80-100 % disabled only after few years of life. Epidermolysis Bullosa* means fragile and sensitive skin like butterfly wings. Everyday life with EB means new injuries, new dressings, pain and surgical interventions. EB in its most severe forms means constant dependence, help, care and support for the sufferers and those caring for them. The main current activities are providing services in the Croatia to improve the quality of life of people with EB via team of specialist and social care managers. Debra also tries its best to provide maximal assistance and support in procurement of health care products and overcoming of everyday difficulties (nurse/social worker) for whole family. In order to provide better and adequate daily assistance to people with EB Debra Centre is organized. Centre is behind Children’s Hospital, and consists of office facilities (as education center and distribution center) and accommodation (two-bedroom apartment) for families while visiting Hospital or just for various workshops and socialization. Patients with Epidermolysis bullosa sometimes need to do check-ups and medical Making a positive Difference 55/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. treatments that may last for several weeks in Zagreb and for that time they need accommodation. To help EB patients and their families to overcome financially high costs we provide them free accommodation. EB is very rare condition, so, for parent to stay with child in hospital is absolute necessity. Unfortunately hospitals usually don’t have such possibilities, so they are trying to support families to be as long as possible in hospital with child, and have assured accommodation very near. 24 hour service and daily care as well as the rent of the apartment are financially very demanding. Financial support from SCOTT BADER would contribute to make efforts of lasting Debra Centre sustainable in order to provide better care for EB sufferers and their families. PUŽ (SNAIL) Put u Život (A Way into Life) – Association of parents of children with special needs was founded to improve the quality of life, medical and social protection of children with special developmental needs and their families through education, various therapeutic treatments etc. Regular activities are divided into programs for children, parents and public, as well as programs for wider social community. Programs for children consist of group activities (such as art workshop, Orff music workshop, computer workshop, playroom and similar) as well as individual programs (different rehabilitation programs such as Montessori, Marte Meo, DIR/Floortime, Sensory integration and speech therapy. DIR/Floortime therapy is a specific technique to both follow the child’s natural emotional interests (lead) and at the same time challenge the child towards greater and greater mastery of the social, emotional, and intellectual capacities. In this therapy is critical role of parents and other family members because of the importance of their emotional relationships with the child. DIR/Floortime therapy is a comprehensive framework which enables to construct a program tailored to the child’s unique challenges and strengths. The role of the child’s natural emotions and interests are in focus, because has been shown to be essential for learning interactions that enable the different parts of the mind and brain to work together and build successively higher levels of social, emotional, and intellectual capacities. DIR/Floortime includes sensory integration too. Floortime ensures the basic developmental steps are strong and gives tools to improve thinking and communicating. A diagnosis does not and should not decide the limits of what child can achieve developmentally. It challenges them to go further and to develop who they are rather than what their diagnosis says. DIR/Floortime approach is new in our country, only several educated therapists work with children. Two of them are our employees. This model gives opportunity for number Making a positive Difference 56/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. of children with developmental problems to develop skills and improve general condition of them. MIPZ International Association of Natural Health International Association of Natural Health is a nonprofit organization aimed at furthering and improving the quality of life and health of citizens, children and young people with special needs, including persons with disabilities. The main activity of the Association is to provide adequate educational-rehabilitation programs aimed at improving health, overcoming disability and damage. In program we’re using natural methods: education, relaxation, specific exercises, acupressure and massage reflexotherapy whose presenters and therapists were trained by expert doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine. In 2015 they continued with the program Healthy-Happy that was started in 2014, with new children and with children that started this program at the very beginning in 2014. Continuation of this program is needed so that results and positive changes could become stabile and children could progress further. Program Healthy-Happy is for children and teenager-adolescent young people from 3 to 19 years of age with psycho-physical disabilities such as: ADHD, hyperactivity, concentration and motoric disorders, depression, anxiety, bed wetting, asthma, bronchitis, allergies, speech/articulation disorders, dyslexia, dysgraphia and many others. In program we’re using natural methods: education, relaxation, specific exercises, acupressure and massage reflex-therapy whose presenters and therapists were trained by expert doctors of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Program is conducted every day for 1 hour and it consist education, relaxation, specific exercises, acupressure, reflex-therapy massages. Monthly costs for 5 children are 23433.00 HRK (2446.29 £) This is a highly efficient natural method, without pain, drugs and operations that gives fast and great health results. Doctors approve and support our program after seeing results of examinations that confirm improvement and progress of health status of users of our program. Hyperactivity, sudden mood changes and aggressiveness has become often and highly significant social problem that leads to violence and bullying among children and adolescent. Violence and bullying leaves physical and psychical marks on victims for life, it changes them from the inside and it leads to difficulties when they are adults. Treatments diminish hyperactivity, aggression, violence because children are more Making a positive Difference 57/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. relax, peaceful; treatments direct children to peaceful solving of problems and conflicts, understanding, tolerance, agreements and dialogue. All that decrease violent and hostile forms of behavior in our society. This program also prevents appearance of hyperactive and aggressive behavior in children and adolescents. Today the number of children and adolescent with allergies, asthma, bed wetting, depression, anxiety, mood swings is increasing and statistics show further increasing in upcoming years. This program allows them to solve these problems entirely, from the root, on natural way, without drugs (corticosteroids and anti-depressive) and their serious side-effects. Project Health-Happy diminishes and prevents hyperactivity, bullying, violent forms of behavior and violence among children, adolescent and later among adult people. It stimulates communication, tolerance, peace, understanding, agreements, patience, tranquility, peaceful solving problems and conflicts. Children won’t fight or bully each other. Society will be healthier, without unwanted incidences like fighting on streets, shooting in schools or on streets, drug using. Improving of communication and understanding among each other and with people that are surround by, increase of concentration, attention, creativity and intelligence leads to better results in school and later in college/university and better jobs. Children grow up in quality, conscious, capable, advanced adults that contribute to society with their knowledge, ideas and creativity. This program helps parents because it shows them how to help their children, how to work with them at home, how to understand more and encourage more their children. Parents can go to work (don’t have to be at home with children 24/7), be more successful at work or be promoted, can earn money and don’t have to depend on social help because they don’t have to worry about their children in the way like they did before, they aren’t under so much stress and pressure like before, they are more relax, calm, peaceful, they have more patience and better communication with their children. Family becomes a quality family because of communication, respect and trust. Program works from individual, over family to society and this is the importance of this program and the reason why it has to be conducted.

REHABILITATION CENTER STANČIĆ Center is social welfare institution which organizes the care of people with intellectual disabilities. Rehabilitation centre stančić provides service at several location in local comunity. At headquarters of the centre stančić is organised accomodation and care for 213 people with intellectual dissabilities. And also community living for 80 people in two location. Center offers services for 55 children and adults through daily centres in two towns, Dugo selo and Vrbovec. The donation from SCOTT BADER will be directed to increasing quality of services for children in Daily centre Vrbovec. Daily centre Vrbovec includes 25 children with intellectual dissabilities from 2 to 16 years old. These are children who came from their families and they are included in rehabilitation programs. Working with children conducted by different professionals: rehabilitator, speech therapist, occupational therapist, physical therapist and educator. Daily Centre Vrbovec provides daily educational and rehabilitation services for 35 children. Through daily experience they have become aware that there is an increasing need for snoezelen therapy. Snoezelen is multi-sensory environments are relaxing spaces that help reduce agitation and anxiety, but they can also engage and delight the user, stimulate reactions and encourage communication. Snoezelen offers relaxation, stimulation, development, therapy. Snoezelen is for all ages and abilities.

HUMMINGBIRDS Hummingbirds is association of parents of children with the most severe disabilities. Main goal for this project is to provide an orthopedic bathing aid and a spare portable suction machine for children with the disabilities. Health insurance in Croatia covers only part of the cost of purchasing the necessary medical equipment to maintiain the living conditions of children at home care similar to those in intensive care units. ln order for parents not to be more financially burdened by the purchase of expensive devices, the Association is helping them by providing bathing aids and suction machines throughthe projects. The funds will be spent for buying one bathing aid and one suction machine for two children with most severe disabilities at home care. lt allowe optimum positioning for children with complex needs. A suction machine is a device for removing secretion from the lungs through the facheostomy (neck opening), and removing secretions from the nasal and oral cavities. Aspiration is the first step in reanimation and prevention of dangerous health and life situations for children wiih tracheostomy. Parents are emotionally and financially exhausted from long-lasting struggle for adequate care at home for their children with most severe disabilities. They made great efforts, passed medical training so that the children could be in their homes with their loved ones. By helping parents provide medical equipment, they are encouraging them to take care of children at home, instead of placing them in one of the institutions for children with disabilities. UDRUGA ZA PROMICANJE KVALITETE ŽIVOTA PILATESOM DO BOLJEG ZDRAVLJA This association is devoted to improving health and general quality of life by promoting pilates based exercises. A particular segment of their activities is dedicated to people affected by MS where the goal is to empower MS patients by raising their physical fitness. With this in mind, they have devised a program that includes various types of equipment to target different issues facing MS patients. This program is based on individual approach that takes into account different needs and abilities of attendees. MS is a neurodegenerative autoimmune illness that is accompanied by a number of related disorders and these can take on various degrees: from mild stiffness and walking difficulties all the way to complete paralysis, blindness etc. Since the healthcare system in Croatia is generally struggling with a number of issues, MS patients have not gone unscathed in this process. The main problem is that immediate treatment is not available to those affected owing to outdated criteria according to which the Health Insurance Fund approves medications. Also, there are few associations and projects designed to help MS patients and the number of those affected is rising The exercise program that they developed is primarily designed to help MS patients tackle the challenges they face in their everyday life by improving their muscle tone, equilibrium, flexibility and range of motion. Since every training session is guided by an Making a positive Difference 60/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. experienced instructor who is talking the attendees through the process step by step, they are also able to safely replicate the exercises at home. Apart from resulting in palpable physical progress, such approach also provides a significant psychological boost to MS patients who feel empowered by their improved physical condition and are more independent and confident in their daily life.

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION Making a positive Difference 62/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. Environmental dimension We systematically monitor the impact of our activities and products on the environment and take preventive measures to prevent and reduce unwanted effects. We have a certified environmental management system according to ISO 14001, which ensures that all issues of environmental management are under constant supervision. Taking care about effects on environments is visible through energy utilisation and emission to air and water, as well as cumulating dangerous and non-dangerous waste. There is a continuous request from all responsible sectors (R&D, manufacturing, maintenance) to decrease energy consumption at total, but also per product item. Emission to air is measured on 4 locations in the plant and all results are below defined minimal values, so the periodical measurement is repeated according to Environmental permit. Emission in the air from burnings in our own hot oil boiler is measured, according to the law, every two years. Every year we submit requested reports of air emission to the Register ROO. Since 5th May 2014 SCOTT BADER d.o.o. is one of the 162 company in Croatia which have Environmental Permit according to IPPC regulation. On 7th September 2017 we received Amendments to the Environmental Permit. Surveillance done each year by inspections of different area (fire protection, health and safety, sanitary, vessel under pressure...) showed that in our company there is a high compliance with law regulations, thus ensures minimal effects on environment and people's health, and enables prevention of any accidents with risk for people and environment. Great attention is paid to the organization and regulation of the workplace both in indoor and in outdoor areas of our company. With good organization and clarity we ensure there are no incidents which could lead to environmental pollution and injury at work. EN3 Direct power consumption In our resin manufacturing for heating of production reactors during we are using 2,5 MW thermal oil heater with natural gas fired burner installed 1999. Since May 2013 we are connected to the thermal oil heater also heating new central hot water system for buildings and storage tanks. With an increase in production, rationalisations, introduction of new technologies and better production planning, gas consumption per product unit is decreasing. Problems in gas supply results in investment in gas burner with possibility to use gas and diesel fuel. In 2010 we have made the reconstruction of the gas burner, which we further reduce gas consumption in 2011. As in the period from November 2012 to May 2013 we have replaced steam heating of buildings (production plant, production offices and oil warehouse) and some technology heating systems (homogenizers, molten MA storage tank) with hot water central heating (heat is produced by our natural gas fired Heater), consumption of natural gas per ton of production was increased in 2013 comparing 2011 for 18,8%, but, on the other Making a positive Difference 63/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. hand, we had a huge decrease of steam consumption in 2013 for 41% and decrease of steam consumption in 2014 for 59% comparing to 2012. Every year we are improving our Company energy efficiency by investing in better thermal insulation, high efficient equipment, led lights so result is decreasing of ecology impact (smaller CO2 footprint) and decreasing of energy expenses. EN4 Indirect power consumption The electric power and steam needed for production, heating and cooling of premises and plants are obtained from different sources. Electric power is mostly used in production. In 2012 we installed two nitrogen generator lines and we produce nitrogen for our needs from compressed air. We have higher consumption of electricity but we reduced nitrogen expenses for 50%. Steam consumption is mostly related to heating the plants, working premises and offices and depends on weather conditions. In 2010 we further reduced the consumption of steam with improved temperature control inside heated buildings. In 2011 we made new insulation on outside storage tanks for final products (14 pcs) heated with steam and with that investment we manage reduce steam losses in 2012. From October 2012 until May 2013 we replaced steam heating of buildings and production storage tanks with new more efficient central hot water heating system (we replaced also steam utilisation with more favourable power source natural gas). In August 2013 we have changed thermal insulation on all production vessels (reactors, tanks, columns). Result was steam consumption of 3.357 tonnes (-41%) less in 2013 comparing to 2012 and 4.767 tonnes (-59%) less in 2014 comparing to 2012. In 2016, 2017 and 2018 we have changed a part) of classic lights with new high efficiency LED lights and we will continue with that in 2019. As of September 2017 SB doo is consuming electric energy from 100% renewable resources. With 'green' electric energy we managed to reduce our total CO2 footprint for 30% and received the right to use protected green energy mark. EN8 and EN10 Water All water used in the Company is purchased from local water supply system. The usage is under very strict control. For a number of years now the usage is checked on a daily basis, with the purpose of providing a timely reaction in the case of a leakage or an error in manufacturing process. Making a positive Difference 64/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. A separate cooling water system with two cooling towers has been in use since 1972, and only the amount lost through evaporation on cooling towers is replaced. We also have new vacuum pumps system installed in 2010, with sealling water closed loop, that additionally decreased water consumption. Previously system used sealing water only in one direction, not in circulation. To prevent the accumulation of sediments on cooling planes, till 2012 the water was chemically treated, thus ensuring maximum cooling effect at minimum power consumption. In 2012 we made water treatment reconstruction. Instead of using chemicals, we use ion exchanging treatment. Benefits are that we using less chemicals and water treatment is more efficient. In August 2012 we changed 150 meter of old underground water pipelines with new one and we will decrease water consumption in 2013 for more than 30%. The reconstruction of water supply system and regular control of water consumption, water losses, and hence consumption has been continuously decreasing. In August 2015 we changed the old cooling water system pumps with new 20% efficient and we had lower total electricity consumption in 2016. In 2018 we plan to continue changing of old and obsolete underground water pipelines with new one. EN16 Greenhouse gas emission Burning natural gas in hot oil boiler for heating the plants results in CO2 which is the most often mentioned greenhouse gas. We mentioned before when we have started to use our hot oil Heater for heating of buildings and storage tanks 2012/2013 we increased natural gas consumption (and also CO2 and NOx emission generated by our Heater) but we have significantly reduced the consumption of steam so total CO2 Scott Bader footprint decreased (see below). Total CO2 emission for Scott Bader doo According new ecology standards and EU IPPC Regulative we are taking care for total CO2 emission of our site (CO2 footprint of hot oil Heater, steam heating and electricity consumption is included): Year Total CO2 / production kg/tonne 2015 129,8 2016 128,3 2017 128,1 2018 113,5 After finishing heating system reconstruction in 2013 and all investments in thermal insulation of buildings and more efficient lights our site total energy consumption and Making a positive Difference 65/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. CO2 emission were decreased from 163,3 kg/tonne of product in 2013 to 113,5 kg CO2/tonne of product in 2018. EN20 SO2 and NOx emission When using natural gas for fuel, there is no SO2 emission. Emission of NOx increases with increasing production. Anyway with small reconstruction of hot oil burner in 2012 we decreased NOx emission under regulatory obligated limit 200 mg/mn3 (2015 =169,2 mg/mn3). To achieve bigger reduction in NOx emission it is necessary to change the burner on the hot oil boiler for heating the plant. Year NOx / production kg/tonne 2015 0,0630 2016 0,0612 2017 0,0608 2018 0,0607 Dust emissions in air from production In production we are using also solid raw materials and charge them through hoppers into reactors. In 2012 we have invested in Central dust collector and filter system. It is the best solution for reducing organic dust emission during our solid raw material charging. We measured dust emissions before and after installation of central filter. With new filter system installation we decreased dust emission to air from 102 to 3,1 mg/m3 today. EN21 Waste water release A positive trend of reducing waste water disposal has been observed in a number of years. The decrease in disposed waters is connected with strict technological discipline and regular daily monitoring of consumption, followed by a quick reaction to possible variations. With the purpose of reducing waste, a new closed cooling system was installed in the Laboratory as a replacement for the continuous flow system, which was unnecessary loss of clean cooling water. A new positive step forward was installation of new vacuum station with closed water sealing and cooling system in 2011. So we managed to decrease water consumption and waste water quantity from 0,94 m3/tonne of product in 2012 to 0,55 m3/tonne of product in 2016 and to 0,49 m3/tonne of product in 2018. Making a positive Difference 66/68 Global Compact Report 2018 SCOTT BADER We pioneer the future of chemistry, making a positive difference to all businesses we serve and each life we touch. EN22 Total waste Non dangerous waste (paper, plastic, metal) is collected and recycled by authorised companies. With better sorting for non-dangerous waste we have more useful waste for collection and for recycle, and less waste ends up in municipal waste. Dangerous waste, due to its specifics, could currently be disposed only by thermal processing. Only waste oils are recycled in Croatia, while all other dangerous waste is exported by certified companies to waste incinerators. We are continuously working on reducing the quantity of hazardous waste generated in production: we use liquid instead of solid raw materials wherever possible, thus reducing the amount of hazardous waste packaging new pumps and pipes are installed, that also helps in preventing leakage of raw materials and finished products substandard resins are prepared to be re-used in finished products etc. Additional waste reduction was done in 2016 by separate collection of waste resin from pipeline, and sale of it as a resin mixture instead of disposal as dangerous waste. In 2018, as a result of changing measurement method for viscosity in quality control laboratory, we have managed to decrease amount of waste resin. EN26 Initiatives for reducing the impact on environment According to the legal regulations, a producer is obliged, at his expense and at the requests by customers in proscribed procedures, to dispose of dangerous substances packaging.
