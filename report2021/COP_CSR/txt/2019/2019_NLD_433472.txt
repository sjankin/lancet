We are now a true international company, with a global footprint to better service our Clients, offering local support on all continents Europe, North and Latin America, Asia Pacific and North Africa. This new geographic presence is the platform we needed to reach critical size, deliver global programs and offer unique career opportunities that would have been just unthinkable only three years ago. The integration of Lombard Risk was also the lever we needed to accelerate and deliver our transformation towards a Software Provider model. At the end of 2018, the absorption of Lombard Risk by VERMEG, established a new major stage for the group, organized around products designed and developed to supply the regions in which our clients operate. This third CSR report is evidently largely distinguished by this major external growth operation that is carrying the Group towards a turnover of 100 Million Euro, in contrast with the 50 Million Euro reached in 2016, when we published our first report. If we were able to integrate this major acquisition in less than nine months, no doubt it is because VERMEG DNA is truly embedded with the strong values that link all of us since we started our adventure in 2000: Committed, Ingenious and Authentic. All employees welcomed the new teams with enthusiasm and passion. The new VERMEG Group is undoubtedly and resolutely a different human adventure. 2018 demonstrated it again! In fact, our CSR label, “Empowered by VERMEG,” allowed us to take new steps with the entirety of our ecosystem by implicating each employee, in every country in which we operate, to make VERMEG an even more committed company: by translating our commitments into daily actions in our company’s operational processes, by sharing indicators to monitor improvements and by launching new initiatives, such as the respect of gender diversity and inclusion principles (LGBTQ). Since I created the company in 2000, I have had the conviction that VERMEG must shine on the market, as much as with its collective intelligence and know-how, as through the demonstration of its values and ethics which bring people together and give meaning to our daily actions. The teams that joined us in 2018 quickly realized this, and it is thanks to the commitment of our staff, that we have succeeded in creating such a strong new group, in such a short amount of time, with so much to offer from each person. Enjoy reading the 2018 CSR Report! Badreddine OUALI, Executive Chairman 2 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 No doubt it is because VERMEG DNA is truly embedded with the strong values that link all of us since we started our adventure in 1993: Committed, Ingenious and Authentic.

Starting from January 2017, the Group Executive Committee, leaded by the CEO, recognized for his leadership, humanity and team spirit, launched a CSR Challenge within the Empowered By VERMEG Program, enabling every member of the company to submit CSR proposals. A collaborative platform was created to allow all our staff, at all hierarchical levels, to put forward ideas and vote to launch the proposals posted on the platform. VERMEG’s Executive Committee has pledged to implement the CSR initiatives that receive the most votes. Few companies consult all their staff to develop a framework structuring their CSR initiative. Generally defined by the CSR manager on the Group’s Board, often staff are only asked to participate in the implementation of annual plans. Mousser JERBI, the Group’s CHRO and Myriam SANHAJI, the VERMEG Group’s CSR Director, have deliberately chosen to ask the staff for their views and ensure that they want to follow the path taken by the company founder Badreddine OUALI. 14 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 AN INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE AMBITION TO BECOME AN EXEMPLARY COMPANY The initial CSR Challenge launched within the program “Empowered by VERMEG” attracted the interest of over 300 members of the Group, who proposed over 60 CSR initiatives. Having the staff vote for the best proposals and analyzing all the suggestions compiled on the platform made, it was possible to identify 3 Axis for the Group’s CSR strategy. The interest of VERMEG employee for these 3 axes has been amply reinforced and confirmed in 2018 through the annual CSR Survey launched for all the employee all over the group including the new zones. Almost 110 responses were collected, and 254 new suggestions and ideas were analyzed to highlight the actions to be added in CSR road map 2019. 254 New CSR Suggestions in 2018 through the annual CSR Survey CARBON NEUTRAL TARGET 92 New transport policy: car, plane, cycle, etc. Development of videoconferencing, teleworking, etc. Converting buildings and server rooms Offsetting CO2 emissions by tree planting EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES Support for education 86 Reducing regional inequalities Non-discrimination – Diversity Occupational wellbeing TALENT PROMOTION Support for talent at VERMEG 76 Grants for young artists Artistic and cultural patronage emphasizing socially conscious activities and events This strategic framework, elaborated with all our staﬀ, became the cornerstone of the group’s CSR initiatives all over the world. Mousser JERBI, Executive Director, COO of VERMEG Group VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 15 CSR STRATEGY OUR DIALOGUE CONTINUES WITH STAKEHOLDERS It is essential that VERMEG listens the all times to its stakeholders all over the world clients, staff, suppliers, public authorities, regulators, students, charities, investors, financial backers, etc. in order to understand their expectations, how they view our company and the road that they want to see us take. This interaction enables VERMEG to identify the main risks and opportunities, adapt its approach and improve its performance. It is by listening that VERMEG intends to create the conditions for responsible, sustainable and shared economic development with its stakeholders. In 2018 the huge challenge was to extend this dialogue from Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Spain and Tunisia to include new countries where the geographical expansion took the group: United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Australia, Japan, United States, Brazil, Mexico.

MATERIALITY ANALYSIS The Materiality Analysis was crucial to quickly structure the process by identifying clearly and unanimously the challenges for VERMEG, and the underlying fundamental issues in order to prioritize them according to the three dimensions of the Materiality Matrix : 1 Their importance for our stakeholders on the vertical axis. 2 Their importance for VERMEG’s leaders on the horizontal axis. 3 The Maturity Level reached In-fine, the materiality analysis involves identifying and ranking the various objectives inherent in our economic, social or societal responsibility. Resulting from a working group led by Myriam SANHAJI, Global CSR Director, the analysis has been refined to reflect VERMEG’s level of maturity on each identified objective. With the aim of measuring the concrete results of all initiatives, each objective is given a level of attainment reflecting current practices in all divisions and countries in which the group operates: No action in place to meet the objective. Some isolated actions, but performance is not measured. Several actions in place, with performance measured. Actions in place that are fully anchored in the company’s governance at all management levels (structured action plans with performance management targets and indicators). Structured action plans with performance details communicated to stakeholders.

Raoudha ARFAOUI, in Tunis, who has been involved in developing VERMEG’s CSR policy from the outset, supports Myriam SANHAJI in both coordinating HR initiatives that have a strong CSR impact, but also in promoting CSR initiatives that have a strong HR impact and benefit to the employee wellbeing and engagement. Emilie BEAUMONT a member of the HR administration team in Luxembourg, took responsibility of some CSR actions locally including the harmonization with the activity leaded by the Delegation of Staff elected by the employees. Yasmine EL GHOUL from VERMEG Academy, has also joined the team early 2018 to organize the awareness sessions and campaign about the important role of employees and new joiners for the success of our CSR engagement. She has also contributed to orchestrate the community of ambassadors across the world, as the number became important following the inclusion of the new geographic zones end of 2018. 24 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 THE VOLUNTARY AMBASSADORS IN 2018 CSR Ambassadors BELGIUM FRANCE LUXEMBOURG SPAIN TUNISIA ELSA MANOLIS NATHALIE HOTTIN HEIDI DIAS SOFIENE CHAMEKH YASMINE EL GHOUL THOMAS ONGARO YAMEN BOUSRIH BERNARD NOEL MEHDI BEN KAHLA MALEK TOUHAMI CHRISTELLE VAN DEN BRANDE HALA HAFEZ EMILIE BEAUMONT MOHAMED GHIZAOUI SIMON DEMOULIN HELA HICHRI FIRAS NASRI 3 A CSR Committee Role in charge of the CSR strategy approval, decisions and budget.

The composition of the Board targets a balance of experience, competence and independence. Indeed, on the one hand the competence, the experience of the financial world and the management of large companies, and on the other, the acute knowledge of global geopolitical issues with Serge DEGALLAIX Senior Oﬃcial Ambassador and also Executive Director of “Fondation Tunisie pour le Development” (a NGO who aims to promote and advance economic and social development through partnerships and direct action in the following issue areas: youth unemployment, regional disparity, gender inequality, and access to health care and cultural activities), attests to the concern given by Group executives to engage the company on a long-term basis with stakeholders. TARGET 2 SPREADING ETHIC SPIRIT TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS With its 3 strong values, and above all its Authenticity value (integrity, morality, sincerity), VERMEG has always been a good example in terms of ethics, both through its practices and its employees, but also in the choice of its customers, suppliers and partners. Being said, this did not prevent to launch in July 2018 of a transversal project for the formalization and the harmonization of all the practices at the group level. This urgency resulted from: The acquisition of Lombard and the integration of new geographical areas with existing local policies by country The evolution of international standards in terms of ethical conduct and their convergences towards global standards The EcoVadis 2018 certification, which reinforces the emphasis on this requirement of formalism and communication The expectation of employees regarding more transparency and awareness, to improve their security feeling and their adhesion ACHIEVEMENTS DURING 2018 The CSR Policies Manual, which centralizes in a unique document the CSR Charter of the group (incorporating the 10 UNGP universal principles, as a kind of high level Constitution), and all the resulting policies including the Ethics Policy. The emphasis on Ethics policy as a code of conduct not only for VERMEG staff and management, but also for all its external stakeholders (Customers, supplier partners) The clarification of the process of reporting to the CSR Committee of any Ethic incident / alert through its hotline email (empowered@VERMEG.com) accessible to the CSR Oﬃcer (responsible for CSR compliance among other ethics), but also to the CHRO, the COO, THE CISO and the CEO. 28 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS IN 2019 Redaction of complementary Rules documents to clarify, only when required, the procedure for some Ethic issues mentioned in the Policy: for example, the policy rules document for Whistleblowing to explain how to report any incident/alert including Ethic ones, and the escalation from the management and/or HR to the hotline of the CSR Committee that guarantee confidentiality. Signature of the CSR policy Manual by All VERMEG Top management and employees Publication and communication of CSR policy Manual and all the relating Policy Rules documents internally and externally to spread the compliance spirit Sending the “Ethic Policy as Code of Conduct” for signature to external stakeholders including partners and all providers. TARGET 3 STAFF PROTECTION As VERMEG is present in countries where staff protection levels are different, the group is committed to apply the international standards in all its subsidiaries. The following actions are in course to reduce the potential gaps: Equity in labor rights even where it’s not mandatory by local regulations (i.e. generalize flexibility Policy to the whole group, extending paid sick leave in Tunisia where only 3 days are covered by local social security, etc.) Generalizing advantages and reducing payroll gaps taking into consideration the purchase power in each country (i.e. Extra cost engaged even not mandatory such as additional private health insurance for complementary coverage, international health insurance, supplementary pension contribution, etc.) Implementation in the internal systems (HR system, Time Sheet and project monitoring system, etc.) of all the process to be able to have KPI and dashboard to monitor improvements and risks (such as sick leaves, work accidents, functional diseases, extra time work, worked weekends, CSR alerts, etc.) Selecting an Anonymous Whistleblowing Platform as Hotline to protect identity of the informers Reinforcing the compliance control of the CSR committee through its ambassadors in each subsidiary, as described in the governance section (including Health and Safety compliance, etc.).

This annual exercise still allows to identify new areas of improvement to dig . ENVIRONMENT POLICY 5 PRINCIPLES 1 Environmental Governance to fulfill all national and international environment compliance obligations, including Iso14001 environmental management system, Iso14064_3 Greenhouse gases, etc. 2 Carbon Neutral Program to reduce the environmental footprint of all its activities and operations especially regarding key resources 3 Sustainable Consumption and purchase policy against overconsumption and wasting habits , giving preference to services and products with low impact on environment and equipment with higher life cycle 4 Waste management campaign in all countries for waste Minimization , waste Reuse And waste Recycling 5 Green IT approach for its products and services to drive direct and indirect reduction of environmental and climate impact TARGET 4 ENERGY, CLIMATE AND RESOURCES PROTECTION Following the initial carbon assessment, measures were decided, as requested by all VERMEG staff within the CSR Challenge to target the Carbon Neutral. These measures were taken immediately as described the previous report, and of course continued and reinforced in 2018: Formalize an Environmental Policy within VERMEG’s CSR Policies Hand Book for the whole group Increase shuttle buses from 5 to 9 for Tunis oﬃce to limit the emissions from staff home/work travel. In fact, following analysis of the journeys made by staff with little access to public transport, additional meeting points were created in the staff’s main residential areas to enable them to travel together VERMEG’s Executive Committee decided to reduce diesel cars and replace company cars exclusively with electric or hybrid vehicles if possible in the countries where VERMEG operates. In Brussels, 9 diesel cars were replaced by 6 gasoline and 3 by hybrid vehicles. In Luxembourg 8 diesel cars were replaced by gasoline ones. Promotion of car-sharing although not mandatory, the pooling of transport methods is widely recommended in communication campaigns, particularly in Tunis where home/work journeys are long Provision of quality video conference tools on all sites and in several meeting rooms, making it possible to limit air travel. The number of video Conference in Tunisia oﬃces doubled from 9 to 18 equipped rooms. Generalizing to all employees the use of telecommunication software (such us Skype Enterprise, Teams, etc.) and optimizing the network usage though high-tech solutions (such us Cisco WebEx) Systematic detection of refrigerant leaks when doubt remains as these gases have a major impact in terms of GHG (greenhouse gases). A reduction from 90 to 37 was realized in Tunisia oﬃces. Extension of the waste-reduction program already implemented in Europe also in Tunisia where no regulation and no collection services are operated by the local authorities. VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 31 SUB TARGET 4.1 Waste-reduction program Waste-reduction program continues in 2018 New Waste sorting and collection in Tunisia through partnership with a local private company for collecting and recycling wastes as already done in Europe offices. Waste management campaign through awareness sessions animated by external specialists, such as Else in VERMEG France. Increased use of re-manufactured consumables Recycling coffee pods in Europe Collecting plastic bottle lids in Tunisia to benefit the disabled charity Amel Collecting for recycling computers and ink cartridges Saving paper by modernizing the printers and switching to double-sided printing by default on the printing systems Green electronic signature encouraging recipients not to print the messages Destroying and recycling «paper» documents Reducing paperwork in countries with supporting more electronic versions (e.g. extending electronic pays lips already implemented in Tunis to France) IT and general donation policy, extended to the entire Group from January 2018. In Luxembourg, expiring PCs are systematically resold to employees by the delegation for symbolic prices, while in Tunisia more than 85 PC were donated to students NGO and schools. The remaining stocks were kept for new working students integration VERMEG in 2019 SUB TARGET 4.2 Carbon reduction program A third carbon assessment was carried out for 2018, with the same measurement scope than previous year. The initial approach (limited to considering «business travel», «energy and electricity usage on the sites» and «refrigerant leaks») was adopted again for the 2018 financial year excluding home/work travel and paper usage. A number of corrections were also made to 2017 (Tunisia energy, Tunisia business travel, etc.) to enable the comparison to the ISO scope. This exceptional corrective measure for the second year, was approved again to maximize the transparency and reliability of carbon assessments, given that the move towards a more mature system will remove the need to correct previous assessments. The third carbon assessment measured the impact of the action taken in 2018 and the progress still to be made in the future as the reduction of 8% per year as indicated in the objective was not reached.

BY COUNTRY The proportions of direct emissions generated by heating and the use of electricity on the various sites are shown in the following graph. The % Direct and Indirect energy emissions By Country differences can be explained by the country’s heating methods and energy mix. BELGIUM 10% France and Tunisia use only electricity (including for heating) but France FRANCE 1% “enjoys» a CO2-low energy mix whilst Tunisia has a more «disadvantageous» LUXEMBOURG 18% energy mix.

There is clearly a stabilization of emissions in the «legal» perimeter around 540 Teq CO2. This situation is however not representative of a status quo, as we clearly note that the improvement actions undertaken in Tunisia have led to a signiﬁcant reduction in emissions compared to 2017. On the global scope the increase is entirely due to the increase in the use of air transport. From a methodological point of view, the quality of the data collected is improving thanks to the setting up of a process for the collection of indicators; however, the standardization work of extra-ﬁnancial accounting must continue to reduce the uncertainty remaining on the quality of travel, yet the group’s ﬁrst issue». Jean-Luc Dothée, Vertuel Director, CSR Board SUB TARGET 4.3 Home/Work Travel Reduction The home work travels, remain monitored even out of the carbon assessment scope, in order to reduce their impact. The analysis is done based on a Survey communicated to all the subsidiaries to compare local practices. The next Survey for home work travel will be launched in 2019 for the whole group to include new regions. For 2018 we kept the result and the conclusions of the Survey 2017, as the scope remain similar and the situation almost the same in the EMEA region. Below the main statements: 388 staff members completed the VERMEG Group’s first home/work online survey, which represents 57% of the workforce. Almost 5 MILLION KM have been estimated following this study, with very different practices between the countries (e.g. 78% car travel in Tunis, 85% public transport in Paris). HOME/WORK TRAVEL IN KM PARIS LUXEMBOURG BRUSSELS TUNIS GROUP 352 473 548 290 297 193 3 621 557 4 819 514 34 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 The analysis of home/work travel result and the qualitative feedbacks from users, who were asked to suggest solutions to reduce the commute, identified 3 mains expectations: 1 The importance of developing car-sharing, particularly in Tunisia where the volume of rotations at midday makes it necessary to find solutions encouraging the staff to lunch around the worksites in Tunis and proposing food corner inside VERMEG premises. 2 Promoting teleworking especially in countries where people live far such as Brussels and Luxembourg, and in other countries where public transport system is very weak such as Tunisia. 3 Incentives to use common transport also in Bruxelles and Luxembourg as already done in France (subsidize the monthly subscription Navigo ) and in Tunisia ( «VERMEG Bus” initiative in Tunisia remains very popular and the number of shuttles was almost doubled in 2018) . SUB TARGET 4.4 Carbon compensation program VERMEG wants to do more to reduce its impacts, so it considered launching initiatives to counterbalance its CO2 emissions by planting trees. With the aim of achieving zero environmental impact from 2020, some planting operations were already started around the city of Tunis following the first carbon assessment, and similar one conducted again in 2018. Planting parks as part of “Mécénat Vert”, a tripartite program launched by the Tunisian Environment Ministry with local authorities and companies to revitalize the urban parks that can no longer be maintained by the state. Each company pledges to manage two parks for three years, the first near the VERMEG registered office in Le Lac1 business district and the second in a disadvantaged residential area in the Kram, opposite to Le Lac 3 district. For the two parks, VERMEG engaged its staff and specialist charities such as Gaia care farm and Acacias for All. Furthermore, beginning 2018, VERMEG engaged a landscape company that takes in charge the maintenance services and organize planting days. VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 35 Forest planting operation, “Green Boots ”, launched by the NGO “Tunisian Association for Communication and Technology (TACT), of which VERMEG is a founder member, to fight against deforestation. The second operation “Green Boots 2”, involving the staff of more than 8 companies, consisted of planting 1,000 trees in Sejnane forest in the region of Bizerte, which was devastated few years ago. The generalization of the CO2 emission compensation scheme for tree plantations remain a high priority point in the VERMEG road map, with the strengthening of various partnerships in Europe and elsewhere in the world (among others the partnership already initiated with the association Acacia for All whose mission is to plant 1 million trees in southern Tunisia to combat desertification). The action plan was postponed, following the acquisition of Lombard Risk to be able to propose a global one including the new regions during 2019. Aware that the eﬀort to reduce our greenhouse gases will not be able to reduce our impact to 100%, we already initiated our ﬁrst compensation actions with the aim of structuring a Compensation approach and a plan which covers all the countries where its subsidiaries are located” Christelle VAN DEN BRANDE, CSR Ambassador Belgium 36 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 Challenge Being a leading, responsible and attractive employer 3 Because the quality of our products and added value of our services depends primarily on our staff, our competitiveness and brand image are closely linked to our responsibility as an employer. We decided collectively to meet the following social challenges with actions and results already demonstrating our concrete commitments in the following four areas: Occupational wellbeing Quality of positions offered to staff Non-discrimination and diversity Fair value sharing Early 2018, the staﬃng of our Human Capital team where strengthened as recommended through the Beyond transformation project, to be able to meet this high challenge not only in Europe Middle East and Africa regions, but also in the new ones TARGET 5 OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING Throughout 2018 VERMEG group continued its action to ensure that every VERMEG staff member, in every country, is given working conditions enabling them to be happy and fulfilled in the performance of their duties.

TARGET 6 EMPLOYMENT QUALITY The previous year, the executive Committee headed by the CEO of VERMEG, emphasized the importance of deploying new efforts in each country to better manage teams, rise talent, value and share experiences, increase efforts of training and thus deploy a responsible managerial model ensuring the development of each employee in his position. Therefore, VERMEG made significant efforts to integrate the performance of the HR function as a key success lever for VERMEG’s transformation. VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 41 SUB TARGET 6.1 CONSOLIDATION OF THE HR STRUCTURE The new global Human Resources structure approved by the Executive Committee, with the appointment of a single Group Head overseeing global manager in each skills area, was operational early 2018. HR STRUCTURE Four main functions and three cross-disciplinary functions 1 HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT 2 TRAINING 3 ADMINISTRATION 4 CSR CAREER RECRUITMENT VERMEG ACADEMY PAY & SOCIAL EMPOWERED MANAGEMENT Recruitment pitches/ Training modules Pay By VERMEG Skills proﬁles Employer brand Initiatives Training programs Social (paid leave, WC, etc.) Career paths Headhunters/ Annual report Management Legal partnerships Talent management Management of service Communication Turnover management Mobility providers Management Organizational charts, job descriptions 5 ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES HR processes HR communication Practical development 6 HRMS MANAGEMENT Online tools/templates HR Strategy 7 MANAGEMENT OF THE HR STRUCTURE HR Economic Model Dashboard A Group HR Committee was launched, chaired by the CEO and led by the Chief Human Oﬃcer, to monitor the VERMEG’s HR transformation. Furthermore, HR correspondents in the business lines where designated, and the HR function managers’ report on the progress of their work to these correspondents regularly. During 2018, the new structure made it possible to take steps to: Better integration of employees upon their arrival in the company with the WELCOME program: it is during the embedding of newcomers that the company’s DNA is communicated and the expectation of having employees empathic, tolerant, assertive with a broad cultural openness. Define attractive development opportunities with progressive career paths tailored to the position Define the requirements of key company positions in terms of responsibilities, expected results and necessary skills Make Group practices consistent between the countries and business lines, in order to offer the same level and quality of positions according to skills and performance, irrespective of the project or roles Clarify the need for joint training and training specific to each business line Organize occasional coaching sessions on VERMEG premises (anti-stress, crisis management, etc.) Train the staff for advanced positions either in expertise or management, such as, consultant, project manager and manager Structure mobility programs between the business lines, but also internationally to enlarge the staff’s horizons Establishing a global HR dashboard for the whole group to better monitor the risks and opportunities. This was possible thanks to the generalization of the same HR System, HR Access, to all the countries by migrating and stopping specific ones (People Soft in UK and US, Sage Payroll in Tunisia, etc.). The publication and access to the first version of this dashboard, and the automation are targeted first semester 2019. 42 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 Thanks to these actions, the departure rate decreased in 2018 versus 2017 in all the European countries and VERMEG’s position remains, despite the high turnover in ICT sector, amongst the companies with the better retention rate in Tunisia. TURNOVER FY16 FY17 FY18 Regretted Attrition rate BELGIUM 4.0% 9.8% 2.1% FRANCE 8.0% 10.0% 6.3% LUXEMBOURG 19.0% 17.1% 11.3% SPAIN TUNISIA 20.0% 18.4% 26.3% Furthermore, staff commitment, which has always been vital to VERMEG’s success, remains a key strength that boosts its attractiveness to job applicants despite a very competitive environment due to the brain drain that touch all the ICT industry worldwide. Therefore recruitment increase in 2018 reached 82% versus 2017 and equivalent trend is targeted for the next years. To support this growth a project was launched to implement a Centralize recruitment platform for the whole group. This platform will be accessible for HR members and managers from all the countries early 2019. Besides, two new improvements relating to the recruitment were obvious during 2018: First improvement, the attractivity of VERMEG for experienced candidates versus junior ones, with a substantial growth in the recruitment number of confirmed and seniors profile.

The manager Coach Program: The quality of management is a major lever for employee success, motivation and commitment in VERMEG. For this reason, the group positions the manager as the company’s first HR contact and representative of the Group’s Human Resources policy. As such, in July 2017, the Group rolled out a collective intelligence seminar with its senior executives to jointly define the objectives of VERMEG’s transformation, and how to support the transformation of managerial postures towards more entrepreneurship, transversally and promoting talents and diversity. The first experimental seminar, after getting the adhesion of the participants (mix of director and managers), were proposed on a larger scale in 2018 to take stock of the transformation and ensure the implementation of these good practices over time. This seminar was followed by complementary individual coaching program by external experts in leadership development (duration between 6 and 12 months). Reinforcement of the languages programs: According to the group expansion in 2018, new programs where launched in English as requested by NAM and APAC regions (partnership with Berlitz) and in Spanish and Portuguese as requested by LATAM countries (a partnership with Cervantes).

VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 45 SUB TARGET 6.3 INTERNATIONAL MOBILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTS Since VERMEG creation, mobility has been strongly encouraged and valued as a skill to be developed. Employees from all countries travel to the Group’s various oﬃces and work on the sites of their clients’ countries. Also all new joiners travel to VERMEG academy headquarter in Tunis for the Welcome integration training session. In addition, medium and long-term mobility programs have been set up to meet the clients’ needs as well as demands of employees. The proposed mobility formulas are adapted to the different contexts to ensure the best professional experience for the Group’s employees: temporary assignment, secondment agreement, transfers, expatriation, etc. Taking into consideration the acquisition of Lombard Risk early 2018, the mobility was slowed down in order to be able to clarify the needs of each region according to the new organization of the group.

I believe VERMEG is the ﬁrst company with a headquarter outside the United States to achieve this result.” Alfred Zaher, VERMEG Inclusion at Workplace advisor in the U.S. During 2018 and thanks to the new subsidiary in New York, VERMEG was able to apply for the Best Place to Work for LGBT Equality Label, that evaluates LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive healthcare benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community. The target is to be part of the top-scoring companies CEI in 2019 that are not only establishing policies to aﬃrm and include employees in the United States, but they are also applying these policies to their global operations and impacting millions of people all over the world. Actions taken as part of the evaluation include the oﬃcial publication on the VERMEG website of its “Equal Opportunities in Employment Statement”, which was ratified by the Board and warmly welcomed by internal and external stakeholders. VERMEG has since included its statement in its job adverts to attract all competent candidates for its vacant positions, without exclusion based on race, color, ancestry, ethnic origin, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender expression, civil status, age, religion, political convictions, social status or disability.

During studies to develop the materiality matrix, the leaders and CSR ambassadors asked to go even further. Therefore even more engaging initiatives, based on profit-sharing, incentives and employee benefits, that were considered in the previous year, were confirmed in 2018 to fight against the brain drain in the least developed countries: Increasing the comparative studies by HR team on pay levels in each country to ensure that VERMEG provides appropriate levels of pay for the positions Adjustment of pay policy based on setting clear and measurable targets taking into consideration local diﬃculties, including for example very attractive financial terms support available for the staff in some countries, more generous restaurant vouchers than the legal ones for the staff in Tunis who struggle to access food service areas due to high inflation, etc. Launch VERMEG Car pack to allow young people leaving in areas that public transport and VERMEG shuttles cannot cover, to have their first car.

Indeed today, whatever the field in which the company operates, it has become vital to meet the expectations resulting from the international standards for sustainable development in this area. Especially since the majority of calls for tenders (RFI and RFP) received refer to these requirement whatever their source. This means that additionally to its corporate conscience, VERMEG must also think about the positive impacts of its products, services and practices on the environment, clients, users, employees and any other stakeholders, in order to enhance them and above all, to reduce any potential negative impact. TARGET 11 ECO-SOCIO-DESIGN OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES To move towards the responsible design of its products and services, VERMEG identified three transversal and essential steps: Fair practices Data protection Eco socio design The relating requirements started to be expanded in 2018 at all operational levels: Sales, Marketing, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, R&D and Delivery. The inclusion of new regions and products of Ex Lombard Risk required a huge harmonization efforts during the year to be continued early 2019. SUB TARGET 11.1 DATA PROTECTION AND SECURITY The Group pays attention to data entrusted or that may pass through its information systems. For the sake of reinforcing virtuous practices in favor of data protection, VERMEG renewed annually its Iso 27001 certification and extend it any new building it opens. Furthermore, VERMEG regularly communicates to employees about security best practices relating the use of the Internet, IT tools, and the company files and data. In addition, each employee is reminded of the legal provisions and internal rules stipulated in the internal regulations and the code of conduct concerning the use of data that is based on technological and IT applications. Several consciousness messages are also sent to employees on regular basis about cyber security risks. A special focus all over 2018 was set on The European General Data Protection Regulation and their impact on all the subsidiaries including those in Non European zone The harmonizations of the information securities organization, process and procedures between VERMEG oﬃces and the new one from ex Lombard Risk to prepare the global certification from the whole group in 2019. During 2018, the Group worked on the compliance with various regulations on the personal Data protection, especially the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in European Union on privacy for all individual citizens applicable starting from may. As Data protection oﬃcer I was hired to fulﬁll this mission at the group level” Christine Giovanini , VERMEG Senior Legal & Personal Data Protection Oﬃcer VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 63 SUB TARGET 11.2 FAIR PRACTICES In the framework of Company Social Responsibility, VERMEG pledges to do business professionally, diligently and fairly. Therefore, VERMEG’s Code of Ethics records the company’s ethical commitments: It gives the staff and all stakeholders an overview of the various good conduct guidelines to be followed and insight into legal requirements with the compilation of legislation and reference documents such as laws and the internal regulations. It reiterates the guidelines specific to staff transactions on the financial markets, use of IT equipment and communication in the company. It sets the rules applicable to all of the Group’s business lines in terms of preventing, identifying and managing potential or proven conflicts of interest. But this was not enough, thus VERMEG launched a global project to centralize and harmonize its Fair Business practices all over the group according to the framework of its CSR Chart. This effort started in 2018, will be continued till 2020 to cover all the regions including the new ones through three phases. FORMALIZATION PHASE During 2018, the fair practices documentation was structured as follows to simplify the harmonization between all the countries where present through its oﬃces or its clients: The CSR Policies Manual, which centralizes: The CSR Charter of the group All CSR Policy referring to this chart, including: Ethics Policy as Code of Conduct Safety and Health Policy Environmental Policy Responsible Procurement Policy Donation Policy Volunteering Time Off Policy The Policy Rules annexes to clarify the procedures: Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy Rules Anti-slavery and Traﬃcking Policy Rules Whistle blowing Policy Rules Health and safely Policy Rules The Employee Hand Book which the following structure: The Employee End Book common part for all the group The Employee End Book by Country to clarify the specific rules resulting from local lows and specificities The Internal Rules documents only in the country where this document is required by low. COMMUNICATION PHASE The following communication actions about fair practices are planned and will continue till 2020: Signature of the CSR policy Manual by all VERMEG’s management and employees Publication and communication of CSR policy Manual internally and externally to spread the compliance spirit Awareness sessions will be organized by VERMEG Academy for new joiners but also for current employees (live sessions, LMS courses and quiz) CONTROL PHASE The CSR compliance oﬃce oversees the monitoring of fair practices and analyses the incidents/alerts by country with the help of his CSR ambassadors and country managers. He escalates to the CSR committee when needed for the critical issues. The control will be reinforced during 2019 through the CSR subcommittees as described in the Governance section. 64 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 SUB TARGET 11.3 ECO-SOCIO IT DESIGN Awareness of addressing environmental and social criteria from the product and service design phase emerged during work to develop the first materiality matrix workshops. The Board and CSR teams have understood the cruciality of defining how the initiative could be implemented for VERMEG and preparing training for the different R&D and delivery teams. The initial analysis identified 3 major areas where Eco-design must incorporate different environmental and social criteria: The development of software with lower consumption and different uses of energy type in intensity during all the product life-cycle phases: energy, Green Code, CO2 rejections from the servers, printing, recyclability of materials, optimization of the IT environment surrounding the platforms required for VERMEG solutions both internally and for clients Services: reduce air, car and train travel, introduction of videoconferencing under to reduce our CO emissions but also to improve quality of life for staff and clients Ergonomics beyond performance: optimization of the presentation layer (working with the web agency Anais on best usability factors: fewer clicks, restful color, etc.), Doc and User Guide with easy, enjoyable access Studies have been launched with Chief Technology Oﬃcer Laurent PYTEL and the Product and Services managers of the various business lines to continue the analysis and identify measurement indicators to manage the environmental impacts of designing VERMEG products and services In personal life as in professional life, comfort is no longer a luxury, it is essential and indispensable to last. Technology is not only the tool of performance, but also and especially the comfort of its users!!’ Explains Laurent PYTEL, VERMEG CTO Green IT As an IT partner of international Technological groups, VERMEG is developing a Green IT approach for its products and services to drive direct and indirect reduction of environmental and climate impact for itself and for its clients who must meet their own sustainability objectives. VERMEG Green IT approach is built around two main areas with the following purposes: 1 Reduce the impact of its IT materials on the environment especially its carbon footprint through: The establishment of data centers: reducing energy consumption thanks to server virtualization. The streamlining of printing: reducing the volume of printing (black and white, double-sided, systematic print preview, ...), collection and recycling of consumables (paper, toners, etc.), Reusing printed paper non-used as drafts or notepad, visual logo inviting to not print unless needed at the bottom of each email, etc. The management of computers: promote the acquisition of computers labeled Green IT or Energy Star, reduce of electrical consumption by systematic programming of a hibernate mode, etc. IT material donation to encourage reuse before recycling: The used computer consumables are collected and recycled; the unused hardware is transferred free of charge to associations, hospitals, students for the solidarity economy. 2 Use of new technologies and management systems to support sustainable development The development and evolution of video conferencing infrastructure and web conferencing to reduce travel during inter-company meetings, steering committees, etc. The Eco-socio design of its IT software products and services to enhance their environmental and healthy impact during the whole product life cycle: conception phase, development phase, delivery to client’s phase, the deployment-implementation phase and the production maintenance phase. The Implementation of a Environmental management system to structure, monitor, facilitate and improve all the aspect relating to environment management, according to international standard (such as Iso 14001). VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 65 Purchase Gaia Challenge Sustainable and Solidarity procurement 6 The implementation of a responsible procurement policy at group level was clearly identified as a major challenge; as VERMEG has become fully aware that this should not be approached as an act of communication or charity, but as a true corporate strategy, taking into consideration the fact that purchasing function, at the heart of the operations of the company, is a major lever at the service of its economic performance. Thus, controlling its supply chain through the management of new risks, pushes VERMEG to find opportunities to create value TARGET 12 RESPONSIBLE PROCUREMENT POLICY By responsible purchasing policy VERMEG understands both «Sustainable» and «Solidarity», which aims two objectives: 1 Promote sustainable purchases, means environmental friendly. Therefore, without further delay, the environmental issues are considered in the purchases made by VERMEG as much as possible: Upstream, environmental expectations are specified. This concerns as well services, products or materials used, as business techniques. During the evaluation of the offers, an environmental criterion is integrated to favor the most virtuous suppliers and subcontractors. This criterion can be based on products, techniques used (manufacturing process, waste management, supply and delivery circuits ...), but also on certifications. Concretely, this translates into the use as much as possible of supplies with the ‘green’ label or the management of green spaces which takes more into account the protection of local fauna and flora. Bonuses have also been granted to suppliers and subcontractors who maximize the waste generated. 2 Increase solidarity purchases from fair trade companies, but also those employing people with disabilities or reintegration, promoting social progress and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. Aware that much is still to be done on the subject as highlighted in the materiality matrix, and among the establishment of a Group purchasing policy according to the standards of the profession that was the first and most critical action, below the initiatives launched in 2018 and those planned till 2020. 66 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 ACHIEVEMENTS 2018 Generalizing of the purchasing policy to the whole group Harmonization of Purchase procedure in order to apply it to all the subsidiaries including the new regions Adding sustainable and solidarity requirements in Purchase Request Running Request For proposal to select a new global purchase system including the configuration of CSR criteria Identifying purchase key indicators that will be implemented in the management Dashboard ACTIONS PLAN TILL 2020 Supplier evaluation taking into consideration the reputation including the CSR criteria and the CSR provider assessment platform such as EcoVadis.

Shortly afterwards, it began to contribute to staging directly through VERMEG what are considered major exhibitions in Tunisia (i.e. Spring Art annual exhibition from 2004 to 2012, etc) but also through its Foundation Tunisie pour le Development (the annual exhibition El Meken, the cultural event Jaou Tounes launched by KL Foundation, etc.). Visiting VERMEG’s premises quickly reveals the importance that VERMEG Management places on promoting all talent in each country. This crucial position given to the Art & Culture was confirmed during the CSR Challenge, VERMEG staff voted strongly to consider cultural and artistic development inside and outside the company as an important challenge to maintaining employment engagement. Brought together in each country under the VERMEG’s Got Talent program, the initiatives are based around support for artists and cultural events and the promotion and development of artistic talents at VERMEG. TARGET 13 EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PATRONAGE The external patronage, continues to be anchored in VERMEG’s roots with the same enthusiasm as shown the previous year. The priorities set to promote the artistic talent and cultural enrichment of VERMEG staff continue by re-conducting old initiatives and launching new ones. The work council in each country work closely with the CSR ambassadors to identify and implement the actions and events that meet better the employer expectations and promote VERMEG Talents. Combining between the Volunteering Time Off Policy and the VERMEG Got Talent program is aimed to allow many new possibilities for VERMEG staff such as cultural exchange and artistic development through stays in artist residencies, 68 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT ARTISTS AND CULTURAL EVENTS TILL 2018 EXTERNAL PATRONAGE INTERNAL PATRONAGE Monthly exhibition of confirmed artists on VERMEG Launching a seniority Program offering cultural travels premises in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, with the through all continents (Africa, Asia, America, Europe) option for staff to buy at attractive prices, is extended each five year for staff celebrating 5, 10, 15, 20, … anniversary. to new countries such us UK Proposing music, theatre, painting lessons, etc. for Gallery showcasing artwork on the premises in Tunis: potential talents street arts, young artists, sculptures, etc. Sponsoring Tickets to cultural and artistic events: Organizing events with cultural associations in theatre, exhibitions, cinema, etc. VERMEG premises (i.e. WikiMedia workshop, AFS Encouraging internal shows with VERMEG talents foreign students day, etc.) Or supporting their external (Duo of the jazz group “Trilogy” during the CSR annual events (i.e. Help me Learn citizenship day, AFS first event launched by one of VERMEG employee at the seminar for Africa centering on the global citizenship guitar, the first VERMEG band mini concert with five culture) musicians and singers from various Group affiliates Initiating multidisciplinary event such as the first Luxembourg, Belgium, France and Tunisia) performed VERMEG Cultural & Art Fair, an exclusive event for during the Art Fair attended by all Group staff, all Group staff from all the Group’s countries.

I am very thankful for joining this amazing inter-cultural project during 6 weeks granted by my Company to encourage Volunteering through its new VTO program! Mariam Badarnia, Business analyst and Volunteer at VERMEG VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 69 Al Maken has just been created in 2015 with the aim of developing an international platform of art that will arise annually in diﬀerent regions to open the doors of our cultural and tourist institutions to other cultures in order to walk together on the path of universal values. Cultural Patronage is a noble private public initiative that is now imperative to actively participate in cultural and artistic development in our country. The ﬁrst meeting «Al Maken» was a challenge, we had succeeded with the support of our oﬃcial and private institutions. The hope: to make, with the strength of the commitment of the Association «Al Maken», the current arts in Tunisia an open window and a gateway to the universe.” Faouzi Salﬁ , President and Co Founder of Al Maken Luxembourg Little Van Gogh Bruxells Little Van Gogh exhibition exhibition Paris Little Van Gogh VERMEG Art Gallery exhibition Tunis 70 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 Singing Graﬃti VERMEG Art Fair in Carthage Slam Painting Sculpture Traditional dance Atuge Photo Narrative about Hannibal BARKA at the Carthage Museum by the historian and poet Raja Farhat Wikimedia workshop AFS Cultural Exchange Day at VERMEG VERMEG Got Talent Printemps des Arts 2004-2011 VERMEG CSR REPORT 2018 71 CSR DASHBOARD METHODOLOGY Each division overseeing the data collection is responsible for the indicators provided.
