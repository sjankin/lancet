However, a series of threats have also persisted throughout the year, putting in danger the longIn 2018 a new trade record was reached: exports grew awaited economic recovery. These include: the trade to 2.12 billion euros (+7.1%), while imports were up by war between the US and China, the final Brexit deal almost 13% at 1.82 billion euros. The major challenges between the UK and the European Union, and the in 2019 will be: avoiding trade tensions with the downturn in commodity prices, which are causing United States, preventing financial risks and keeping problems for the economies of emerging countries. pollution under control in the big cities. In 2018, the United States recorded growth of The economic performance of the Eurozone was 2.9% in GDP, compared with 2.3% the year before. also very uneven in 2018. Although Eurostat has not This increase, the biggest since 2015, was due to published its definitive GDP figures, and in many higher consumer expenditure, non-residential fixed cases the data we have is provisional, we can confirm investment and exports. that the Eurozone as a whole grew 1.8%, compared with 2.4% the previous year; the lowest increase Throughout the year, and as expected, the Fed once since 2014, as a result of the slowdown of the German again raised, for the fourth consecutive time, its economy and Italy going into recession in the final policy rate by four quarters of one point, to the range quarter of the year. of 2.25%-2.50%, on the back of the recovery in prices and employment levels during the year. The breakdown by countries shows Spain at 2.5%, as the fastest-growing of the 5 major Eurozone Rate rises are expected to be much more moderate in economies for the second-year running, followed by 2019. With regard to employment, 2018 was another France at 1.5% and Germany at 1.4%. Italy, meanwhile, good year, with 2.88 million new jobs created, reducing which has now experienced over a decade of economic unemployment to 3.9% (4.1% in 2017), its lowest rate stagnation, is advancing at just 0.9%.

These increases are modest due the weakness in domestic demand. Other weaknesses in Europe over the next few years will be: the development of the Brexit negotiations, for the possible disruption to trade that might result; the international trade tensions initiated by the United States, especially with China; the slowdown of the economies of the emerging markets, and the appreciation in the value of the euro, which could have a negative effect on exports.

The Sustainable Building Certification (CES) System considers two main phases: preliminary certification and certification in terms of compliance with a series of variables, mandatory and voluntary requirements that provide a score, and also contemplates a voluntary optional stamp, structured as follows: ¬ “Sustainable Building” preliminary certification: The building's architecture and facilities are inspected. ¬ “Sustainable Building” certification: The building's architecture, facilities and construction are inspected. ¬ “Plus Operación” stamp: The management approach during the building's operation is assessed. The general scope of the environmental performance of a building assesses five key aspects: 1. Indoor Air Quality, 2. Energy, 3. Water, 4. Waste, 5. Management. These aspects are grouped into four categories: A. Passive Archaeological Design (Architecture), B. Active System Design (Facilities), C. Construction, D. Operation. Construction on this hospital began in January 2017 and the project is run by the Directorate of Architecture at the Valparaíso Ministry of Public Works and the Viña del Mar Quillota Health Service. The project encompasses hospital care (closed) and outpatient care (open), will have the capacity for 282 beds, 542 parking spaces and will be located in the Valparaíso Region, in the city of Quillota, in the Quillota district. The “Sustainable Building Certification” (CES) makes it possible to assess, rate and certify the environmental performance of both new and existing public-use buildings in Chile, without distinguishing between administration or whether they are publicly or privately owned. The system was developed by the Institute of Construction with the formal participation and support of 13 public and private institutions, in line with the objective of incentivising the design and construction of buildings with sustainability criteria and encouraging the market to value this type of construction. 112 As it has for many years now, in 2018 Sacyr has extended its performance and energy efficiency, in addition the scope of its energy management system to include to reducing greenhouse gas emission rates and new activities.

Mexico NOISE POLLUTION Some activities carried on by Sacyr generate noise in the natural environment and also in the urban environment. In all these cases noise measurements are carried out in order to ascertain whether it is necessary to adopt mitigating measures, in which case the most appropriate courses of action are established in each contract, and any legislation or regulations applicable are adhered to at all times. Noise mitigation measures are also applied in areas in close proximity to nesting zones or areas inhabited by birds on project sites, mainly construction sites, as stipulated in environmental impact statements, in coordination with the environmental bodies concerned, and periodic monitoring is carried out to ascertain that the measures have been properly applied. (103-1) (103-2) (103-3) LIGHT POLLUTION In contracts with a light pollution impact on the surroundings, mitigatory measures are established for the proper maintenance of lighting units, with checks to ensure they are working properly, and lighting is applied with lower intensity and directed to the work place (instead of towards the sky). Whenever possible, measures are also established to reduce or turn off lighting. Legislation concerning light pollution is also observed at all times. 5 Environmental value 2018 Integrated Report 117 VALORIZA ENVIRONMENT, FIRST COMPANY IN THE SECTOR TO BE CERTIFIED IN EFFICIENT DRIVING In 2018, Valoriza Environment, a Sacyr company, obtained the Efficient Driving certification pursuant to the EA 0050 specifications Efficient driving management system for professional fleets as part of the SUW collection and street cleaning service in Alcalá de Henares, becoming the first company in the services sector in Spain to receive efficient driving certification in the process. This certification establishes control over a series of parameters such as fuel consumption, engine type or inertia, amongst others, making it possible to improve energy efficiency, optimise the consumption of resources and reduce noise and greenhouse gas emissions, which represent key company commitments, in order to ultimately provide quality services and enhance the satisfaction of the needs and expectations of its customers, suppliers, investors and society as a whole. In recent years, Valoriza Environment has invested significantly in renovating its fleet of vehicles in order for it to become more efficient and sustainable, in addition to fitting vehicles with devices dedicated to monitoring driving and training and raising awareness amongst staff to this end. Following the implementation of the Efficient Driving Management System (SGCE), the renewal of the fleet of old machinery with latest generation, more efficient technology using alternative propulsion sources, such as electricity and compressed natural gas (CNG) and the installation of monitoring systems and efficient driving aids in the new fleet, the SUW collection and street cleaning service in Alcalá de Henares has experienced a notable decrease in emissions in 2018 compared to 2017. This new certification sets us apart and makes us more competitive; it entails pooling our efforts once again in terms of sustainable growth and as part of our commitment to environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change. 118 5.2.

OPTIMISING PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND CONSUMPTION (ENERGY, WATER, ETC.) Improving our efficiency by using renewable energy and raw materials. Optimising the value of the natural resources extracted. 132 Among the Sacyr projects that promote the circular economy are the following: REUSE OF AGRICULTURAL WATER DRAINED FOR NEW USES Focussed on the issue of the pollution of water bodies caused by the infiltration of nutrients from agricultural waste water, Sacyr Water is immersed in the implementation of the Life Deseacrop project. It is designing a treatment system based on the use of hydroponic crop drains that makes it possible to reuse treated water in agricultural irrigation, recovering the main nutrients for fertilisation and eliminating water contamination and eutrophication. This is a by-product optimisation and harnessing system, which is additionally powered by solar power to reduce emissions of CO2. LED STRIP LIGHTING IN TUNNELS In order to reduce power consumption, Sacyr Concessions has created a lighting patent using a continuous LED strip to improve lighting in tunnels. Focussing on the replacement of sodium-vapour lamps currently used with LED bulbs, this promotes the harnessing of the lumen per watt ratio and the features of directional light in different locations. As part of the ecodesign initiative, this technology makes it possible to reduce electricity consumption by 66%, preserving the 100% homogeneity of lighting and freely regulating equipment. WASTE COLLECTION AND STREET AND CLEANING SERVICE MANAGEMENT In collaboration with Safe Industrial, Valoriza Environment has implemented the S4Citizens project, a management system for street cleaning and waste collection services. They are implemented along two lines: an ultrasound sensor to control the filling of waste containers, which is of high-precision and based on acoustic lens technology.

SACYR PROMOTES THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY THROUGH THE IMPROVEMENT IN LOCAL ROADS IN MEXICO Sacyr has delivered 10,990 m³ of recyclable materials for the improvement of local village roads as part of the road building project, Carretera Pirámides Tulancingo , which is in its execution phase. This project promotes a sustainable environment through the working of the circular economy. The bitumen waste that comes from the material milled for asphalt is considered inert material and can be reused as wet-mix macadam. among other applications.
