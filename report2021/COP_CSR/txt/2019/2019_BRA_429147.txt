Our assets are located in four regions of Brazil: Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, and South. In 2018, we generated a total of 11 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy, an increase of 26% from the previous year, and 95.6% of this came from clean sources. The higher water levels at Brazilian rivers during the year led the National Electricity System Operator (ONS) to demand a larger volume of energy from hydroelectric plants. These same factors, coupled with the growth in the share of wind and solar sources in the Brazilian energy matrix, reduced the demand for thermoelectric plants to be fired up and, consequently, for the nonrenewable energy generation of our projects. In 2018, CPFL Geração achieved record availability at its plants, thanks to the optimization of operation and maintenance processes, training of the teams, and the application of new monitoring, diagnosis, and preventive maintenance technologies.

This systemic vision is consolidated by the Sustainability Platform, created in 2014 and updated annually using a five-year horizon. In 2017, we designed a new management structure with the incorporation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and power sector megatrends as drivers of the long-term vision, covering the period through 2022. The Sustainability Platform presents a matrix that correlates key themes for sustainability management with stakeholder expectations. Thus, we identified 13 levers for sustainable value, which are divided into 58 indicators (economic, environmental and social) that protect, optimize and create value through shortand mediumterm goals. Success in achieving established objectives for the indicators is reflected in the variable remuneration paid to company executives. The indicators are periodically evaluated by the Institutional Relations and Sustainability Board. Changes in performance are monitored by the Sustainability Committee and communicated to the Board of Executive Officers; the Management Processes, Risks and Sustainability Committee; and to the Board of Directors. When there are deviations from these established goals, we draw up action plans to be executed by the administrative and operational areas.
