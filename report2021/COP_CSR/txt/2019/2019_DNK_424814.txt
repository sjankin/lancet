Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer Statement of the company's chief executive (CEO or equivalent) expressing continued support for the Global Compact and renewing the company's ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles. To our stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that BioPorto reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Peter M. Eriksen, CEO Communication on progress This report concerns BioPorto’s efforts in 2018 which focused on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. BioPorto acceded to the Global Compact in early 2010. BioPorto is aware of its social responsibility and endeavors to improve its social and environmental conditions. In several areas, BioPorto fulfills its responsibility solely by complying with current law, but in other areas, the company’s responsibility has been expanded to include preventive activities for optimizing the various conditions. It is important to BioPorto to highlight these efforts vis-à-vis its customers, suppliers, stockholders, other stakeholders, etc., to ensure that the outside world trusts the company to live up to its social responsibility. For this reason, BioPorto continues its accession to the Global Compact, whose ten principles for social commitment as defined by the UN constitute a global frame of reference. At the same time, through our commitment, we will try to encourage the parties with whom we interact to also shoulder their share of these responsibilities. Human Rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. BioPorto supports and respects human rights. BioPorto has no external suppliers in countries that do not respect human rights. In 2017, BioPorto established a Code of Conduct covering the above. BioPorto’s employees are obliged by BioPorto’s Code of Conduct and will be implemented into supplier contracts to ensure that the company’s suppliers respect human rights. Labor rights 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; 5. the effective abolition of child labor; and 6. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Danish and American traditions, culture and law mean that labor rights are naturally supported and complied with by BioPorto, both in Denmark and the United States. BioPorto has no external suppliers in countries that use child labor or forced and compulsory labor, and BioPorto deems that there is a very low risk of this taking place in areas where BioPorto might be expected to operate. In 2017, BioPorto established a Code of Conduct covering the above. BioPorto’s employees are obliged by BioPorto’s Code of Conduct and will be implemented into supplier contracts to ensure that suppliers comply with these labor rights. The BioPorto group has fair and equal employment terms and working conditions, including equality and non-discrimination. Both the physical and mental working environment are monitored and continually improved to avoid accidents, injury and illness. In the composition of its staff, BioPorto endeavors to achieve an equal gender breakdown as well as a diversity of educational backgrounds, nationalities and cultures. This diversity provides a dynamic workday and encourages fine interplay for the benefit of staff and company efforts alike. 2018 Female Male Non-Danish All Employees 52% 48% 22% Head of Departments 37% 63% 0% Executive Management (one person) 0% 100% 0% Board of Directors 20% 80% 0% BioPorto A/S ∙ Tuborg Havnevej 15 st. ∙ DK-2900 Hellerup ∙ Denmark ∙ info@bioporto.com ∙ www.bioporto.com Phone: +45 4529 0000 ∙ CVR/Vat: DK-1750 0317 BioPorto has adopted a policy on Diversity: “BioPorto is committed to continue working towards ensuring and furthering equal opportunities for all employees in respect of differences, such as gender, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, as all – in our view – serve as key components in ensuring a better, more dynamic and healthier business. We believe that employees should be recognized because of – and not despite – their diversity. The view extended through this policy also includes maintaining equal opportunities for women and men at all management levels in the BioPorto group. The Board of Directors annually discusses the company’s activities to ensure relevant diversity at management levels and evaluates the policy on diversity. BioPorto has defined a target, that no later than in 2022, at least 25 % members of the Management of the company must be women. This target must not detract from other competency requirements in the nomination of members to the Management team of the company. With regards to diversity for the Board of Directors, the Company has reached its target and currently does not have an underrepresented gender, as the gender distribution is 50/50.” BioPorto’s Nomination Committee has a clear policy for evaluating candidates of both genders for vacant board positions, and for the election in 2018 a female candidate was found to honor the competency requirements. For future vacancies in the Board, the Nomination Committee will continue to evaluate candidates of both genders. Environment 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. BioPorto’s in-house production is limited in scope and of such a nature that it has an insignificant environmental impact. An ongoing effort will be made to minimize any other possible environmental impact, including the consumption of water and electricity, which will cut costs at the same time. BioPorto’s activities are primarily knowledge-based. In 2017, BioPorto established a Code of Conduct covering the above. BioPorto’s employees are obliged by BioPorto’s Code of Conduct and will be implemented into supplier contracts to ensure the above. Anti-Corruption 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. BioPorto takes sharp issue with corruption, bribery and similar methods. Suppliers and partners are chosen with care and are included in BioPorto’s quality system. Corruption problems have not affected BioPorto’s activities up to now. In 2017, BioPorto established a Code of Conduct covering the above. BioPorto’s employees are obliged by BioPorto’s Code of Conduct and will be implemented into supplier contracts to ensure that suppliers comply with the above.
