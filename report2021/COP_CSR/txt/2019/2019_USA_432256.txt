distribution centers to our supply chain, and everything in between, we are committed to doing good on a global scale, and I take great pride in that. Our corporate responsibility efforts are guided by our sustainable development goals (our “7 by 2027”), which are in the areas of materials, waste, water, gender equality and quality education, chemicals, climate and clean energy, and human rights. We are just starting to share our sustainability story and people are taking note, which is quite humbling. There are two significant call-outs this year: (1) being recognized by Barron’s as one of the 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies (Deckers is number 52) and (2) our Corporate Responsibility Videos Series, which is available on our public facing website and linked below as a reference. These videos provide a great glimpse into our overall corporate responsibility program and the efforts we are taking to make this world a better place. Deckers is a special place we are a business with a heart and soul made up of a diverse set of individuals who know that we are better together! We build great brands and we believe we must continue to do so in the right way. In FY19, we made great progress toward achieving As a leader in designing, marketing, and distributing our sustainable development goals, and while I am innovative footwear, apparel, and accessories, our immensely proud of how far we have come, we know global scale is significant.

We hope Deckers performing well, empowering our stakeholders can continue to be a role model and show that and conducting ourselves in a socially and financial success and higher social and environmental environmentally conscious way. The more successful standards are not mutually exclusive. we are in business, the more we can do to preserve the environment for future generations, continue Sincerely, doing good in the global communities in which we operate, and further protect human rights. Deckers is filled with passionate people who are working together to drive change across all sectors Dave Powers of our business: from our company headquarters President and Chief Executive Officer MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 2 WELCOME UNGC AND DECKERS’ SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS Deckers joined the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in 2016. With over 9,500 participating companies, the UNGC is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative and joining reinforced our ongoing commitment to conducting business with the utmost respect for universal principles around human rights, labor standards, responsible environmental practices, and anti-corruption. This partnership requires an annual statement of progress (our Corporate Responsibility Report) and we believe that sets us apart from many others in our industry. The UNGC has adopted seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) to guide companies to actionoriented efforts to support SDG implementation. For us, that meant selecting the nine SDGs that were most relevant to our business and brand portfolio. Achieve universal and Ensure inclusive and equitable access to safe, Ensure healthy lives quality education for all Achieve gender affordable drinking water and promote well-being and promote life long equality and empower and adequate sanitation for all at all ages earning all women and girls and hygiene for all Strengthen resilience Ensure universal access and adaptive capacity to Manage forests, combat to affordable, reliable, Reduce inequality Ensure sustainable climate-related hazards desertification, halt and sustainable, and modern within and among consumption and and natural disasters in reverse land degradation, energy for all countries production patterns all countries and halt biodiversity loss 3 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU WELCOME From there, we created our own “7 by 2027” sustainable development goals utilizing the UNGC platform for transformational change.

We are extremely proud of our 7 by 2027 and our efforts to date towards achieving these goals. Our SDGs help us to focus our efforts on those areas where we feel we can have the most impact: waste, water, materials, chemicals, climate and clean energy, human rights, and gender equality and quality education. We want our consumers, our customers, and our stakeholders to know how committed we are to making a significant impact in each of these areas. The following are just a few of our FY19 achievements that are aligned with our SDGs.

MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 8 PEOPLE GLOBAL WORKFORCE As of March 31, 2019, we had a total of 3,346 global 54.7% employees. Excluding retail employees, 963 of our FEMALE global employee population (or 53.3%) are female, 838 of our global employee population (or 46.4%) are male, 44.9% and 6 employees (or 0.3%) are undeclared. Deckers has MALE 236 female leaders (individuals who manage one or more person) compared to 256 male leaders (excluding retail). 0.4% At the retail level, 1,146 of our global retail employee UNDECLARED population (or 74.5%) are female, 389 of our global retail employee population (or 25.3%) are male, and 4 employees (or 2.6%) are undeclared. Deckers has 105 female retail leaders compared to 35 male retail leaders. EXECUTIVE 2 LEADERSHIP TEAM FEMALE Deckers’ executive leadership team is made up of 6 eight members: two are female and six are male.* *As of the date CR Report posted. MALE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 3 In FY19, our Board of Directors consisted of ten individuals: three female, seven male. Our Board FEMALE of Directors represents a wide range of skill sets, backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, and qualifications, 7 which not only brings a well-rounded perspective to everything we do, but we believe this diversity of MALE individuals makes us stronger as an organization. 9 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION FY19 U.S. ENHANCED BENEFITS HSA Deckers offers our employees the option to participate in health savings account (HSA) that combines a highdeductible health insurance plan with a tax-favored savings account, enabling employees to build savings for health expenses with pre-tax dollars. The plan is free to enroll, and Deckers contributes into each enrolled employee’s account to help jumpstart employees’ savings. Money left in the savings account earns interest and belongs to the employee even after employment ends. This enhancement helps our employees and their families save for today and prepare for the future. MONTESSORI PARTNERSHIP Deckers launched a partnership with South Coast Montessori to provide better negotiated tuition rates for high quality child care and child education. Deckers is dedicated to helping our employees find a positive work-life balance, and we believe this partnership helps the parents at Deckers do just that. FLEXIBLE TIME OFF Deckers recognizes that its employees work hard and in order to give their best and live well-balanced lives, they need to take time off for rest, relaxation and rejuvenation. That’s why Deckers offers full-time salaried employees flexible time off to enable them to take the time they need to be with their families, not miss out on children milestones, or just take time for themselves. We know that when our employees are happy and feel supported, they appreciate work that much more! DEPENDENT CARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS Deckers offers employees a dollar-for-dollar employee contribution match (up to $2,500) on Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts for use toward dependent care and childcare expenses. We recognize that dependent care and childcare expenses are both incredibly important and cost prohibitive at times, and want to do our part to help employees cover some of these costs. MATERNITY AND PATERNITY LEAVE POLICIES In FY19, Deckers announced an expanded paid parental leave program of twenty weeks of full pay for mothers and eight weeks of full pay for fathers. INTERNATIONAL BENEFITS As a global organization, we also offer international benefits that are equally competitive, but are structured differently. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 10 GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION DIVERSITY VOICES We strive to create a culture of inclusion where employees are able to freely and equally contribute regardless of gender, gender identity, age, race, disability, or sexual orientation. Our Code of Ethics, which all employees are trained on biannually, exemplifies these values. VOICES, our employee-led initiative elevates employee issues and celebrates our uniqueness. Our VOICES team has established an open forum for all employees, who share common interests and concerns to meet and support one another and work collaboratively to foster an environment of increased diversity and inclusion for all. Each of our brands also recognize the beauty in diversity and seek to represent a wide-range of individuals in all their marketing efforts, whether on social media, in campaigns or through our many influencers. Teva and Hoka have committed its marketing efforts to include 60% people of color and/or body diversity and ability. Sanuk will also be working with Brown Girl Surf (FY20) and GLAAD to help diversify our storytelling. We recognize that our brand consumers, much like our employees, represent a vast array of ethnicities, sizes, and abilities, and our brands are always looking for relevant ways to further represent diversity. CEO DIVERSITY PLEDGE Deckers is proud to have signed The Diversify Outdoors CEO Diversity Pledge in FY19. The Diversify Outdoors CEO Diversity Pledge pairs leading outdoor brands in one-on-one relationships with inclusion advocates to advance representation for People of Color across the industry. The Diversify Outdoors CEO Diversity Pledge is focused on moving the outdoor industry towards authentic inclusion by enhancing diverse representation across staff and executive teams, media and marketing, and athletes and ambassadors through the building of relationships of support, empathy, and understanding. The Pledge aligns with our SDG related to gender equality and further demonstrates Deckers’ ongoing commitment to diversity. 11 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION EDGE CERTIFICATION We are pleased to announce that we have obtained our EDGE Assess level certification! EDGE stands for Economic Dividends for Gender Equality and is the leading global assessment methodology and business certification standard for gender equality. It measures where organizations stand in terms of gender balance, pay equity, and effectiveness of policies and practices to ensure equitable career flows, in addition to measuring inclusiveness of the organization’s culture. WOMEN’S LEADERSHIP SUMMIT In June 2019, Deckers held its second Annual Women’s Leadership Summit. The summit was created by female leaders at Deckers who wanted to share inspiration, express support and create opportunities for the empowerment of Women of Deckers and beyond. This year, we opened the summit up to all employees regardless of sex. The summit brought together leading voices to help create an open space to share, engage, and advance Deckers’ commitment to diversity and equity within the Deckers family. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 12 COMMUNITY COMMUNITY GIVING Doing good in the world through our charitable contributions, product donations, and employee volunteer efforts is an essential part of our culture. Deckers gives in three ways: (1) monetary donations, (2) volunteer efforts, and (3) in-kind product donations. You can read more about our giving efforts in detail below. MONETARY CONTRIBUTIONS FY19 AREA OF SUPPORT BY SECTOR During FY19, we donated approximately $1,332,344 to 141 various non-profit organizations. Deckers generally focuses its monetary donations to four primary categories: community, education, environment, and family & children. By aligning with 20% these four categories, we are able to make a more significant impact in the areas that matter most to us: people and planet. FY19 MONETARY 53% DONATIONS BRAND CHARITABLE SPEND FOCUS 18% $1,332,344 UGG: HERproject, Protect our Winters, and Save the Waves 9% TEVA: Grand Canyon Conservancy, Grand Canyon Field School and Trail Restoration project, Conservation Alliance and Outdoor Industry Foundation. HOKA: IRONMAN (Kona, Santa Rosa, and FAMILY & CHILDREN 53% Florida), Adrian Martinez Classic, Act for the ENVIRONMENT 20% EDUCATION 18% Outdoors (a campaign initiated by the Outdoor COMMUNITY 9% Sports Valley to support projects preserving outdoor playgrounds). SANUK: Surf Happens and Surfrider Foundation 13 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION IN-KIND PRODUCT DONATIONS In addition to our charitable donations, we also donate product to those in need. Since 2006, we have donated 901,565 pairs of shoes to Soles4Soles and Good360. In FY19 alone, we donated 71,779 units of product to Soles4Souls and 10,726 units of product to Good360, respectively. These two non-profit organizations provide products to those who need it the most, while simultaneously diverting product that would otherwise be destined for landfills. Additionally, in December 2018, our Santa Barbara, California community fell victim to devastating wildfires and subsequent mudslides that resulted in tremendous destruction. In keeping with our culture and commitment to giving, our brands stepped up and donated 4,141 pairs of product to those in need. We also contributed $50,000 to Direct Relief for relief efforts related to the California wildfires. In FY19, mother nature also unleashed a series of hurricanes across the United States, notably Hurricane Florence to Hurricane Michael. In these situations, we did what we do best and quickly came together to compile product for donation for those in affected areas. To assist with Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael, our brands donated approximately 3,310 pairs of product to those in need. In FY19, Kauai also suffered severe flooding in FY19 and, to assist with its disaster efforts, our brands donated 2,148 pairs of product. We pride ourselves on our ability to quickly come together and assist others in times of need. This is part and parcel of our Deckers culture of giving back to our communities. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 14 GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION FY19 VOLUNTEER EFFORTS BY REGION While we are incredibly grateful to have the ability to give back to our communities financially, we also recognize the immense value in giving our time. Deckers strongly encourages employees to volunteer with local organizations and provides every single employee with up to twenty-four hours of paid volunteer time each year. Employees who volunteer at least 100 hours in a calendar year also receive a $1,000 donation from Deckers to a charity of their choice. We are better together and want to demonstrate our commitment and encouragement to our employees who donate their time to help others. In FY19, our US offices donated approximately 1,645 hours of their time; APAC offices donated approximately 961 hours of their time; and EMEA offices donated approximately 500 hours of their time. We know that our employees are passionate about volunteering and the true number of collective hours our employees volunteer can be difficult to track and we believe our actual number is significantly higher. In FY20, we intend to launch a new volunteer tracking tool that will make logging hours much simpler. We can’t wait to see the new tool in action to gain a more accurate measure of the true number of hours our employees spend helping others and their communities. In FY19, we partnered with the Santa Barbara Bucket Brigade, and 150 of our Goleta employees volunteered to help with the massive cleanup effort following the Montecito Mudslides. Our Deckers employees worked to dig out homes that had been completely buried and they helped clear out mass amounts of debris that had flown down with the mudslides. In April 2019, we partnered with the Conservation Alliance’s Backyard Collective and over 100 of our Goleta employees volunteered to clear open space and help restore native habitats following winter flooding and severe storms. All of these efforts demonstrate our continued commitment to protect and preserve our local communities for our generation and future generations. 15 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU GENDER EQUALITY/REDUCED INEQUALITIES/QUALITY EDUCATION HUNGER GAMES WIN Deckers was the proud winner of the End Hunger Games Corporate Challenge for the Santa Barbara Foodbank, which is a local competition for corporations in the Santa Barbara area.

We have made strides towards this SDG by utilizing low flow fixtures throughout our corporate headquarters that save approximately 350,000 gallons of water each year. On the exterior of our buildings we have drought tolerant native plants, which also conserve water. Additionally, all water that falls onto our corporate campus flows through a culvert system and into the wetland restoration area surrounding our campus. SUPPLY CHAIN WATER CONSERVATION EFFORTS As a multinational company, we understand the size of our global footprint, and recognize the need to minimize the adverse impact our production may have on the environment. Understanding that our largest environmental impact occurs at the production level, we launched a supply chain partner environmental study in FY18 to continuously monitor the environmental performance of our key partners, and track their initiatives to mitigate environmental impact. Our overall water footprint decreased among footwear, midsole, and outsole partners in FY19, and overall, our participating partners increased the amount of water they are recycling from 109,807 tons in FY18 to 169,387 tons in FY19. Although we did see a slight increase in water usage at the tannery level, we 109,708 TONS OF 169,387 TONS OF intend to continue working with our tanneries in the coming RECYCLED WATER RECYCLED WATER year to make progress towards our water reduction goals.

This effort will significantly reduce waste, travel emissions, and mitigate its environmental impact. We believe this shows yet another way our brands are thinking outside of the box and challenging themselves to further reduce their environmental footprint. DIGITALIZATION OF PRODUCT CREATION In FY19, we made significant strides in 3D printing and design, allowing us to visualize design intent before we finalize a sample, thereby reducing the number of samples manufactured and shipped, ultimately leading to less waste. In Fall 19 we saw a 30% reduction in development samples for the UGG brand alone and we intend to further quantify what this reduction means by way of our overall environmental footprint. Our PLG brands have also been making progress towards decreased sample production. We expect continued reduction and increased efficiency as we move more towards digital product creation. SUPPLY CHAIN WASTE MITIGATION EFFORTS As we continued to monitor waste generation of twenty-five of our key partners, we saw a year-on-year increase in FY19. It is important to note that this is number is not just the amount of waste from our own production it is the gross amount of all factory waste. Most of the increased waste was the result of various on-site construction activities given the shift of the majority of our production from China to Vietnam (e.g. factories needed to build out to compensative for business volume). We, unfortunately, were not able segregate production waste from total waste generated which is why you see such significant increases reflected below. In FY20 we will ensure that our numbers are a more accurate reflection of waste stemming from our own production and we expect to show further reduction from FY18 data (as FY19 data is not truly reflective of our business).

Our goal was to learn a bit more about their disposal channels (e.g. where are they sending their waste) and identify areas of opportunity for improvement where possible. We learned that these two partners dispose of their waste in the following ways: reuse and recycle, compost, incineration with energy recovery and incineration without energy recovery (see below chart for baselines of these two factory partners). In FY20, we will continue to look for opportunities to increase amount of waste going to reuse and recycle and compost.

CARBON AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS Fashion is one of the world’s most polluting industries. The energy usage in the places we manufacture our products has an enormous impact on our environmental footprint. We took a huge step forward in FY18 with the transition of the majority of our production from China to Vietnam. China relies heavily on coal, whereas Vietnam emphases hydroelectricity, thus lowering our footprint significantly. We are undertaking a lifecycle assessment for all product materials to enable us to more accurately determine where our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions are most prevalent in order to identify areas for improvement. 23 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU ENVIRONMENT ALTERNATIVE COMMUTE PROGRAM We encourage the reduction of carbon emissions wherever possible.

As part of our continued commitment to seek sustainable alternatives for key materials, this year, we partnered with the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), which seeks to make cotton production better for the planet and the people who produce it. Sanuk—our largest consumer of cotton—signed the Sourcing Network’s Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan cotton pledges, committing to not source from these regions due to the risk of forced labor in the cotton sector. RESPONSIBLE REPURPOSED WOOL Repurposed wool—used in our UGGpure proprietary technology—the largest material fiber used by UGG is comprised primarily of the wool shorn from hides we are already using, not from live animals. We are also a contributor to the Responsible Wool Kick Start Program, which helps smaller farming operations become responsible-wool certified and get more certified wool into the supply chain quickly. RESPONSIBLE DOWN We use a limited amount of down in our product lines. Our strict Ethical Sourcing and Animal Welfare Policy requires all down must be Responsible Down Certified which requires that down and feathers come from animals that have not been subjected to unnecessary harm. UNIFI® RECYCLED POLYESTER (RPET) In FY19, we greatly increased our use of UNIFI® recycled polyester (rPET), most specifically within the Teva brand. UNIFI rPET is made from recycled plastic water bottles, which means it’s a more sustainable material than virgin polyester. Increase use of UNIFI rPET will impact 1.2 million pairs of Teva shoes and over 66,000 kilograms of recycled polyester. We have made continued use of recycled polyester a corporate priority for the coming year. TENCELTM In FY20, we intend to introduce TencelTM into our UGGPlush™ products. TencelTM is a cellulosic fiber of botanic origin. The fibers originate from wood, a renewable raw material. HEMP Hemp is arguably one of the most sustainable materials available. It is fast growing, does not require pesticides to grow, uses very little water, and thrives in relatively small places. The Sanuk brand is proud to use hemp in some of its products.

The UNGC aims to mobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create a better world. The UNGC encourages companies to (1) conduct business responsibly by aligning their strategies and operations with ten principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and (2) take strategic action to advance broader societal and sustainable development goals, with an emphasis on collaboration and innovation. As a member of the UNGC, we are held accountable and must publicly file an annual Corporate Responsibility progress report. We believe this sets us apart from other companies of our scale and size. This partnership has also assisted us with a targeted approach to sustainability through adoption of our 7 by 2027 SDGs, as discussed above. LEATHER WORKING GROUP The Leather Working Group is a multi-stakeholder group that aims to develop and maintain protocols that assess the environmental compliance and performance capabilities of leather manufacturers and to promote sustainable and appropriate environmental business practices within the leather industry. We have been proud members of the Leather Working Group for approximately 10 years. The Leather Working Group is comprised of member brands, retailers, product manufacturers, leather manufacturers, chemical suppliers, machinery suppliers, technical experts, and other service providers that work together to maintain environmental stewardship protocols specifically for the leather manufacturing industry. In FY19, 97% of our leathers came from Leather Working Group certified tanneries. This figure decreased slightly year-on-year from FY18 as one of our brands had to source from a non Leather working Group certified tannery due to high demand. We have improved controls and methods of remediation in place to ensure we meet our targets in the near future. LEATHER WORKING GROUP’S ANIMAL WELFARE GROUP We are dedicated to animal welfare and ensuring traceability within our supply chain, in part through a partnerships with the Leather Working Group’s Animal Welfare Group which prioritizes efforts around traceability, slaughter protocols, assurance schemes and risk mapping, as well as working to educate the leather value chain on animal welfare related issues. BETTER COTTON INITIATIVE In FY19, we joined the Better Cotton Initiative which exists to make global cotton production better for the people who produce it, better for the environment it grows in, and better for the cotton industry’s future by developing Better Cotton as a sustainable mainstream commodity. RESPONSIBLE WOOL STANDARD We adhere to the Responsible Wool Standard which is a voluntary global standard that addresses the welfare of sheep and the land on which they live. The standard ensures that sheep are treated with respect to their Five Freedoms and also ensures best practices in the management and protection of the land on which the sheep live and graze. RESPONSIBLE WOOL KICK START PROGRAM We also participate in the Responsible Wool Kick Start Program which helps smaller farming operations become responsible wool certified. This in turn enables the industry to have access to more certified responsible wool. TEXTILE EXCHANGE RESPONSIBLE LEATHER ROUND TABLE We are members of the Textile Exchange Responsible Leather Round Table which seeks to advance responsibility and continuous improvement within the global leather value chain. The core focus of this Round Table is the development of a Responsible Leather Assessment Tool that aims to set a global benchmark for minimum best practices in the leather industry. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 32 ENVIRONMENT MATERIALS-RELATED RECOGNITION TEXTILE EXCHANGE PREFERRED FIBER AND MATERIALS LEADERBOARD: UGG AND TEVA We were pleased to be included on the Textile Exchange Preferred Fiber and Materials Leaderboard for both UGG (Wool/Down) and Teva (UNIFI recycled polyester). Teva launched UNIFI recycled polyester webbing (made from plastic water bottles) in a significant portion of its product line, which reduces its consumption of virgin polyester. In FY18, Teva was using only 1.00% recycled polyester (rPET), with a significant increase to 12.69% in FY19. We expect to see additional gains in the coming year when Teva moves to UNIFI rPET in place of virgin polyester for all product polyester webbing. After reviewing materials from 111 participating companies, the Textile Exchange recognized UGG as the top user of preferred wool, and we were also included in the 100% club (e.g. those who have converted completely from conventional fibers) for responsible down. PACKAGING MATERIALS LIFECYCLE ASSESSMENTS (LCA) We approach sustainability holistically: from product design, to materials, to packaging. While our primary goal is to ensure that the product is protected until it reaches the end consumer, equally important are the goals of re-engineering to reduce excess material and utilizing more sustainable materials where possible. We made strides in these areas in FY19 with our packaging materials LCA. Through this exercise, our brands were able to make some significant packaging improvements. UGG removed one piece of tissue paper per box (we went from two pieces to one piece), it switched shoes with a smaller profile to a one-piece box (instead of a two-piece box) thus reducing paper usage, and it reduced the paper weight of its brand booklets by 25%. Sanuk is actively working to significantly remove plastic hangers from our displays. These changes may seem small, but their overall impact is great. We are committed to continuing to improve overall product packaging wherever possible. Designing and maintaining more sustainable packaging makes a large overall impact on the reduction of our environmental footprint, but equally important is educating consumers on proper package recycling. In FY19, our PLG brands began adding language on our packaging reminding consumers to recycle the packaging in which their shoes arrived with the goal of encouraging consumers to think twice before simply discarding the materials in the trash. 33 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU ENVIRONMENT PACKAGING ENVIRONMENTAL SAVINGS BY BRAND ESTIMATION FY17 FY18 FY18 FY19 FY19 FY20 FY20 Total Savings FY18 Total FY19 Total Unit per Unit Per Resources Unit Per Resources Unit Per Total Pairs Resources To Date Pairs Pairs Pair Pair Saved Pair Saved Pair Saved (Aggregate) UGG Reduced Carbon Footprint (lbs of CO2) 4.13 3.08 24,361,599 25,582,834 2.75 24,007,431 7,735,231 2.50 24,007,431 6,178,485 39,496,550 Reduced Water Usage (gallons of Water) 27.65 24.69 24,361,599 72,149,897 22.37 24,007,431 55,677,837 20.48 24,007,431 45,443,107 173,270,840 Reduced Energy Usage (gallons of Petrol) 0.38 0.31 24,361,599 1,679,993 0.28 24,007,431 788,470 0.25 24,007,431 666,634 3,135,097 Reduced Contaminated Water (Gallons of Water) 0.78 0.85 24,361,599 (1,617,011) 0.78 24,007,431 1,748,213 0.72 24,007,431 1,426,409 1,557,611 Reduced Dunnage (lbs of Packaging) 1.39 1.24 24,361,599 3,744,703 1.11 24,007,431 3,117,496 1.00 24,007,431 2,619,035 9,481,234 ESTIMATION FY17 FY18 FY18 FY19 FY19 FY20 FY20 Total Savings FY18 Total FY19 Total FY20 Total Unit per Unit Resources Unit Per Resources Unit Per Resources To Date Pairs Pairs Pairs HOKA Pair Per Pair Saved Pair Saved Pair Saved (Aggregate) Reduced Carbon Footprint (lbs of CO2) 2.73 2.07 3,076,829 2,021,206 2.01 4,344,141 276,840 1.96 4,344,141 195,457 2,493,504 Reduced Water Usage (gallons of Water) 17.27 15.65 3,076,829 4,979,220 15.12 4,344,141 2,330,251 14.77 4,344,141 1,521,749 8,831,219 Reduced Energy Usage (gallons of Petrol) 0.23 0.21 3,076,829 87,060 0.20 4,344,141 41,814 0.19 4,344,141 19,798 148,673 Reduced Contaminated Water (Gallons of Water) 0.50 0.53 3,076,829 (67,524) 0.50 4,344,141 114,393 0.49 4,344,141 43,675 90,544 Reduced Dunnage (lbs of Packaging) 0.93 0.86 3,076,829 225,891 0.80 4,344,141 228,285 0.79 4,344,141 66,713 520,888 ESTIMATION FY17 FY18 FY18 FY19 FY19 FY20 FY20 Total Savings FY18 Total FY19 Total Unit per Unit Resources Unit Per Resources Unit Per Total Pairs Resources To Date Pairs Pairs Pair Per Pair Saved Pair Saved Pair Saved (Aggregate) TEVA Reduced Carbon Footprint (lbs of CO2) 2.19 1.44 5,070,531 3,814,388 1.40 4,754,682 207,671 1.25 4,754,682 701,892 4,723,951 Reduced Water Usage (gallons of Water) 14.90 11.25 5,070,531 18,499,154 10.91 4,754,682 1,609,080 10.00 4,754,682 4,318,304 24,426,538 Reduced Energy Usage (gallons of Petrol) 0.20 0.15 5,070,531 260,808 0.14 4,754,682 26,561 0.13 4,754,682 74,624 361,994 Reduced Contaminated Water (Gallons of Water) 0.48 0.40 5,070,531 387,781 0.40 4,754,682 31,683 0.37 4,754,682 135,655 555,119 Reduced Dunnage (lbs of Packaging) 0.79 0.62 5,070,531 850,680 0.60 4,754,682 92,441 0.53 4,754,682 335,636 1,278,756 ESTIMATION FY17 FY18 FY18 FY19 FY19 FY20 FY20 Total Savings FY18 Total FY19 Total Unit per Unit Resources Unit Per Resources Unit Per Total Pairs Resources To Date Pairs Pairs Pair Per Pair Saved Pair Saved Pair Saved (Aggregate) SANUK Reduced Carbon Footprint (lbs of CO2) 1.07 0.73 4,970,182 1,684,479 0.62 4,742,586 505,277 0.62 4,979,715 (1,538) 2,188,219 Reduced Water Usage (gallons of Water) 7.84 6.26 4,970,182 7,843,450 5.15 4,742,586 5,285,481 5.06 4,979,715 434,473 13,563,405 Reduced Energy Usage (gallons of Petrol) 0.09 0.07 4,970,182 96,869 0.06 4,742,586 54,919 0.06 4,979,715 (2,012) 149,777 Reduced Contaminated Water (Gallons of Water) 0.30 0.27 4,970,182 149,970 0.21 4,742,586 278,030 0.20 4,979,715 33,026 461,025 Reduced Dunnage (lbs of Packaging) 0.33 0.27 4,970,182 264,743 0.24 4,742,586 168,858 0.24 4,979,715 (19,076) 414,526 Below shows what each brand has saved since 2017.

As with other efforts, we recognize that we are better when we work together. We actively seek opportunities to benchmark with other brands to improve our own program and ensure a healthy and safe working environment for factory workers producing our product. Our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct is based off International Labor Organization Standards, and we have teams in both China and Vietnam who audit our T1 factory partners at least on an annual basis. Where we do not have local expertise, we work with programs like Better Work to advance issues of health and safety in our industry. Our audit questionnaire consists of 230 yes/no questions, which helps to eliminate any personal bias. Our executive management team also meets periodically throughout the year to review the performance scorecards of our key partners. In FY19, we audited 100% of T1 partners, which included 32 onsite audits and 103 desktop assessments. We conduct desktop assessments primarily for our agent/licensee sourced suppliers due to location and business volume. In FY19, 83% of factories’ ESC performances were ether Premier or Preferred Partners – meaning they received an audit score of either 85-100% or 70-84% compared to 82% in these categories in FY18. And, only 4% of our T1 factory partners fell into our partner improvement program pending rejection category, compared to 7% last year. Our Supplier performance also improved in FY19. A total of 95% of suppliers ESC performance were either Premier or Preferred Partners compared to 90% in FY18. Only 3% of our supplier partners fell into our Partner Improvement Program pending rejection category compared to 5% in FY18. There is no doubt that these improved ratings are the result of our Ethical Supply Chain team’s relentless efforts in driving our partners to get up to speed with our robust expectations. 2% 2% 4% 4% Premier Partner Audit 3% Premier Partner Audit Score 85%-100% Score 85%-100% 13% Preferred Partner Audit Preferred Partner Audit FY19 T1 Score 70%-84% FY19 Score 70%-84% PARTNER Partner Improvement Program SUPPLIERS ESC Partner Improvement Program FACTORIES Accepted with Conditions Audit Accepted with Conditions Audit PERFORMANCE PERFORMANCE Score 60%-69% Score 60%-69% Partner Improvement Program Partner Improvement Program Pending Rejection Audit Pending Rejection Audit 79% Score 0%-59% Score 0%-59% 93% 41 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU HUMAN RIGHTS TOP FINDINGS OF NONFY19 TOP GLOBAL FINDINGS COMPLIANCE Transparency is important to us, and we believe INSUFFICIENT that it keeps us accountable to our employees, PERSONAL EXCESSIVE PROTECTIVE consumers, and stakeholders. Because of this, we EQUIPMENT OVERTIME MANAGEMENT have continued to monitor the top areas of noncompliance found when our auditors are performing their annual audits. Our results are very similar PREVALENT to what other footwear and apparel brands see. HUMAN RIGHTS Namely, our most prevalent areas of noncompliance RISKS IN OUR are excessive overtime (which is dependent on IMPROPER INDUSTRY MACHINE INSUFFICIENT timing of audit as well as challenges experienced SAFETY MANAGEMENT BENEFITS during peak production), Insufficient Personal Protective Equipment Management (due to lack of INSUFFICIENT FIRE SAFETY understanding and opportunity for added education/ MANAGEMENT training), Insufficient Benefits, Insufficient Fire Safety Management, and Improper Machine Safety Management. In China, which only sees approximately a quarter of our global manufacturing and is continuing to decrease, top findings of non-compliance include excessive overtime followed by insufficient benefits. We believe that because Vietnam production is still relatively new for us, there is a general lack of understanding of expectation and opportunity for added education and training, which we will continue to focus on in FY20. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY COLLABORATION There is always room to grow, benchmark our program, and improve in this space. Our Ethical Supply Chain Team networks and partners with the Apparel and Footwear Brands Collaboration Forum (AFBCF), third party organizations like better work and HERproject, and various other brands to ensure that we are maintaining a best in class ethical supply chain program.

The team held regional workshops and a huge summit with just under 100 attendees in June 2019. Our team recognizes that ongoing training and education are necessary to continue compliance with our expectations. HERPROJECT In FY19, we extended HERproject trainings to an additional seven factories four of which were located in Vietnam and three located in China. In total, an additional 13,500 persons received HERproject training in FY19. Since the inception of our relationship with HERproject in 2016, we have trained over 25,000 women. By 2027, we plan to enrich the lives of 100,000 women globally. In FY20, we aim to launch HERproject programs to an additional six key partners with the goal of being able to say that 95% of our key partners have received HERproject trainings! HERproject is an amazing organization and working together with them we have really seen first hand the impact that we are making in the lives of these women. We are empowering them to take more control over their own health and spread their knowledge to their colleagues, friends, and family members. We sponsor HERhealth which provides a vast range of training topics including general health related concerns, how to give yourself an in-home breast examination, family planning, and proper contraception. Although our numbers reflect the number of women who actually sat in these trainings, the number goes well beyond that. The program encourages the women to empower others that they know: from their children, to their peers, to their friends and neighbors. This domino effect is quite amazing. It truly is a powerful program and one that we are incredibly passionate about. 43 DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update MENU HUMAN RIGHTS HEALTH AND SAFETY We care about our Deckers Family! Not only those working in our corporate offices globally but those who are working in our factories producing our product(s). As noted, we do not own our factories – much like many others in our industry. But we make sure that they are being managed in accordance with our expectations. In FY19, we continued to monitor the safety of the factory workers who produce our product(s). While we missed our FY18 targets outlined in our FY18 CR Report, we are still within industry standards and are striving to improve in FY20. We saw a decrease in Lost Time Injury Rate while the Total Recordable Incident Rate remained flat. We have set a lofty goal for ourselves of reducing these rates by 15% overall by FY22 (using FY18 as our starting point). We plan on reaching this target through ongoing onsite audits and regular training. Creating a safe place to work is not only something we do for our corporate employees – factory workers are part of our extended Deckers Family which we work tirelessly to protect.

We recognize and appreciate and reduce the discharge of that we must work hard to ensure that our hazardous chemicals among our products are safe for our workers, consumers, and key factory/supplier partners by the environment. We regularly review our restricted 50% to minimize adverse impact substances policy to ensure we are abreast of on human health and the all legal restrictions, ensure we are continuing to environment. reduce and/or eliminate those chemicals which have an adverse impact on the environment, and provide ongoing training and monitoring of our partners so that they are aware of our stringent requirements. MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 46 CHEMICALS RESTRICTED SUBSTANCES TRAINING Our Restricted Substances team plays an integral role in the success of our restricted substances program. The team provides many hours of training so that our suppliers and manufacturing partners are armed with the information they need to create high quality products that are both safe and have a minimal impact on the environment. In FY19, our Restricted Substance’s team offered 369.5 hours to our supplier and manufacturer partners on various topics including our RS policy, corrective action plans, CPSIA, CA Proposition 65 compliance, and REACH. RESTRICTED SUBSTANCES TESTING FAILURE RATES There is no doubt that this added training assisted in the decline of our restricted substances failure rate from 2.23 (in FY18) to 1.85 (in FY19). Our teams go beyond just monitoring. They truly work with our partners to ensure a higher level of understanding as is reflected in the below numbers. 2014 2015 2016 2016 2017 2017 2018 2018 2015 2016 2017 2017 2018 2018 2019 2019 (APRIL 2014(APRIL 2015(APRIL 2016(EXCLUDE (APRIL 2017(EXCLUDE (APRIL 2018(EXCLUDE MARCH 2015) MARCH 2016) MARCH 2017) AGENT’S MARCH 2018) AGENT’S MARCH 2019) AGENT’S REPORTS) REPORTS) REPORTS) # OF TOTAL 1132 1268 1429 1380 2510 1838 2729 1780 REPORTS # OF FAILURE REPORTS 128 114 50 32 60 41 45 33 FAILURE RATE % 11.31 8.99 3.50 2.32 2.40 2.23 1.65 1.85 TOTAL RS FAILURE REPORTS AND FAILURE RATE PERCENTAGE 12 9 IN % FAILURE 6 NO.

As a result, we have eliminated or significantly reduced the below chemicals. PFOA AND PFOS We have successfully eliminated all PFOA and PFOS as well as C8 based PFCs (polyfluoroalkyl chemicals) in our entire supply chain. In addition, we have significantly replaced more than 90% Fluorine containing chemicals (PFCs) with silicon-based water-proof, water-resistant, non-wicking and water-repellent chemicals. PFCs are organofluorine compounds containing fluorocarbons, which have typical C-F and C-C bonds. PFCs are used universally in water-proof or similar applications. However, PFCs, especially PFOA and PFOS, are highly environmentally persistent, and they are reported to cause serious effects in animal toxicity tests. Our ultimate goal is to completely eliminate PFCs from our supply chain by the year 2020 and we are confident that we will succeed in meeting this goal. PHTHALATES Restricted phthalates are reported to cause serious health issues. In a recent publication, most Americans were diagnosed to have metabolites of more than two phthalates in their system, phthalates that could cause cancers and/or birth defects. Deckers eliminated all twenty-two restricted phthalates from our products since 2018. DIMETHYL FUMARATE We have eliminated Dimethyl fumarate (DMFU) from our entire supplier chain. Dimethyl fumarate has been used widely as an anti-molding chemical in various products including furniture and footwear. However, DMFU can cause serious and acute allergies after prolonged skin contact. Deckers has eliminated DMFU and has committed to using the most environmentally friendly chemicals to prevent mold growths. NITROSAMINES All regulated nitrosamines have been eliminated from our supply chain. Nitrosamines can be found in rubber materials including synthetic rubber and natural rubber materials, and it has been reported by multiple media outlets that N-nitrosamines can cause cancers, especially liver cancer and gastric cancer. VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC) While it is clear that we have significantly reduced the overall VOC consumption for our brands in BRAND/YEAR 2016 2017 2018 2019 general, we recognize that some of our brands UGG VOC (g)/pair 20 17 17 13.90 showed a slight increase. This increase is due to style changes that necessitate the use of more Sanuk VOC (g)/pair 18 15.2 17.30 solvent based adhesives, primers and/or cleaners, Teva VOC (g)/pair more than 39 20.4 17.20 and certain process changes that lead to the use 45.0 of additional cleaners. We intend to drive these Hoka VOC (g)/pair 25 14.5 15.26 reductions and anticipate overall reduced VOC consumptions for our brands. Koolaburra V0C (g)/pair 17.1 11.47 MENU DECKERS BRANDS | Corporate Responsibility Update 48 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY VIDEOS Something that we are striving to improve upon is our communication and how we can better get the word out about the great work we are doing in this space E1 DECKERS CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY to all of our consumers, customers, and stakeholders. In FY19, we filmed a series of five corporate responsibility videos, which were a true labor of love. While we would love for everyone to read our Corporate Responsibility Report, we recognize that some may want a high-level overview, which is what our videos intend to deliver. They are filmed to provide insight into various aspects of our program from a high-level introduction, to a deep dive in our E2 DECKERS GIVES materials efforts, to HQ/DC sustainability efforts, to Deckers Gives, and to our Ethical Supply Chain, and even to Restricted Substances.
