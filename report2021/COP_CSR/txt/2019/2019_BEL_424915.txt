It is within this framework that the Executive Committee initiated in 2017 the “Ethias 2.0” programme, which concerns the entire company, with the aim of strengthening our structures, our organisation, our governance and our processes, to the benefit of client satisfaction. 7 1.2 THE ETHIAS MODEL Ethias is a Belgian insurance company, created in 1919 by public authorities.

The Executive Committee was also strengthened by the appointment of a new CFO, Cécile Flandre. The gender repartition in the company is balanced. Since 2017, at least one third of the Executive Committee and of the Board of Directors are women. For the first time, a woman is Chair of the Board of Directors. 9 In this context of changes in our internal and external environment, we have begun a process of reviewing and strengthening our strategic fundamentals, with an update of: • our values • our mission • our vision • our strategy The mission statement is the company’s raison d’être. It illustrates what the company does, what it offers and how it positions itself. Our mission: Making insurance easier so as to bring you security, peace of mind and freedom of initiative, with innovative services and products. As partner of your daily life, we put our expertise and our energy at your service. The company’s vision is being updated and will be finalized in 2018. It will then be implemented through the updating of the strategic plan. 10 #ProudOfOurValues Values are the foundation of a company’s identity, culture and personality. They must guide all employees in their daily work, irrespective of their activity. To update these values, we have decided to give a voice to all employees, through an online survey on the company’s values and their translation into different attributes. The present values as they emerged from the survey are as follows: #Human #Commitment Humanity is at the heart of all our For nearly 100 years, we are daily committed to relationships which we treat with our clients, to our colleagues and to society. respect and empathy.

Ethias is also involved in raising awareness amongst its clients in the public and corporate sector so that they are fully aware of these risks and the usefulness of protection against these risks by offering them adequate insurance cover. 12 1.5 METHODOLOGY For Ethias, the realization of the non-financial report represents much more than a legal obligation. This is not only a matter of continuity, Hence, this report is an opportunity to identify any shortcomings since Ethias has been drawing a corporate and to update the CSR strategy, defining the objectives that Ethias social responsibility report since 2007, wishes to achieve in 2018 as well as the measurement elements but also an opportunity to take stock of (KPI). This report is intended to be a unifying document, since it the insurer’s approach as a precursor reflects the collaboration between the different entities to achieve a in corporate social responsibility. common objective: to be and remain a socially responsible insurer. At end-2017, the various entities (HR, Finance, Sales & Customer, Risk, Facilities, Vendor Management, IT, etc.) were invited to participate in workshops dedicated to describing the aspects of their business and responsibilities related to CSR. At each workshop, a framework of topics to be addressed was presented and discussed with representatives of the participating entities. The points to be developed have been identified for integration into a multi-year action plan. Following these workshops, the three roles of Ethias in society were structured as follows: • Ethias as a trustworthy insurer • Ethias as a sustainable company • Ethias as a responsible investor. Based on this process, the report was To produce this report, Ethias has based itself on the produced under the aegis of the Ethics 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Committee, which was set up within Each of Ethias’ actions is guided by an overall Ethias in 2003. A special feature of the strategy based on this responsibility and the resulting Ethics Committee is that it is a joint body commitments. The United Nations Global Compact is composed of as many representatives the guiding thread of the company’s CSR approach. of the employer as of the employees. Its mission is to deploy CSR within the company and to ensure compliance A summary of Ethias’ actions responding to these with the rules of social ethics. 10 principles can be found at the end of the document. 13 14 2. ETHIAS AS A TRUSTWORTHY INSURER For Ethias, recent years have been This policy has resulted in a very high marked by numerous innovations, both serving the public and corporate level of satisfaction among Ethias sector as well as private individuals. clients (93% of individual clients and 98% These innovations all respond to the of clients in the public/corporate sector same need: to provide better service to say they are satisfied): this shows the policyholders, with a view to serving the public interest, protecting the environment confidence that clients have in the company. and promoting social responsibility. This (see point 2.3) is Ethias’ policy as a trustworthy insurer. 2.1 INSUR ANCE PRODUCTS WITH SUSTAINABLE IMPACT Ethias’ CSR approach aims not only to influence the behaviour of the company, its stakeholders and its employees, but also to promote responsible behaviour on a sustainable basis. Ethias has decided to reward the responsible behaviour of its policyholders by creating specific advantageous rates, viz. the eco tariffs. • Insurance “less than 10,000 km”: low-mileage drivers • Solar panel coverage included in home insurance. whose bonus-malus level is between 0 and 2 benefit This is a unique coverage on the market. from an advantageous rate for their car insurance. • Ethias Cyber Protection: cyber attack risks • Specific tariff for green vehicles: drivers of electric are among the most important threats of cars or hybrid vehicles whose CO2 emissions do not the 21st century.

New products will be launched in spring 2018. • A Heart for Sports: covers heart diseases and cerebrovascular accidents that occur while playing sports. • ... 15 2.2 PARTNERSHIP Since 2015, Ethias has been a partner of Bluebike. These are rental bicycles available at SNCB/NMBS railway stations. Ethias insures the bikes and provides assistance coverage to people who borrow them. This partnership was renewed in 2017. 2.3 CLIENTS Ethias has identified three major trends in new customer needs. • Do better with less: clients see their resources (staff, budget,...) decreasing and are looking for efficiency. They expect from Ethias, as a long-standing partner of the public sector, win-win solutions (co-creation) at a fair price. New technologies and digitization can also help to address this problem. • Knowledge: clients want to be informed more quickly and this through proactive communication being directly addressed to the right person. This implies access to clear information and advice at any time and through any channel. • Understand: clients want to better understand their environment and expect their partner to simplify the matter. A more formative and educational approach would therefore be appreciated. Ethias responds to these needs with a strategy of services, digitization, proximity and prevention. In view of client satisfaction, this approach seems adequate. Private Individuals Public & Corporate Sector Studies conducted in 2017 show an The general satisfaction of Ethias’ overall satisfaction rate of 93%1. customers is very high and reaches 98%2. Following a contact with Ethias, 2 out of 3 clients would recommend 94% of our clients consider Ethias to their family and friends. Ethias as their preferred partner in the insurance field. 94% 8 out of 10 clients have already recommended Ethias to their family and friends. 92% of clients have a positive or very positive image of Ethias as an 9 out of 10 customers would choose easily accessible, solution-oriented Ethias again for their insurance. 92% company offering an efficient service. 1 These indicators come from the NPS (Net Promoter Score) project, a tool set up in 2014 to measure the 16 satisfaction and recommendation rate of private individuals (customers & prospects) who have had 2 Study conducted during the last quarter of 2016 contact with Ethias.

PRE VENTION The protection of people’s health To achieve this objective, Ethias undertakes multiple actions in prevention: and physical integrity as well as the • Advice preservation of clients’ property • Tools is the primary goal of Ethias. • Applications Ethias also offers personalized support through prevention experts in various fields: • protection of individuals (accidents at work, well-being at work, school accidents) • protection of goods and services (car, theft, fire, floods ...) • protection of data (cyber risk) Some prevention services IRM Prevention: free service for local administrations: text message alerts on the main risks of bad weather: wind, rain, snowfall/ice and storms. Prevention tips and tricks for optimal protection.

The Ethias Prevention Reporter underwent a new facelift in 2017 to provide rapid on-site prevention reporting. Fleet Reporting: analytical tool for claims related to a car fleet. This tool helps to raise awareness among fleet managers and beneficiaries of a vehicle and to implement an appropriate prevention policy. On the website, which is aimed at local authorities and companies, online magazines, a news blog (prevention, pensions, finance, etc.) and client testimonials help to create a direct link with policyholders, while remaining attentive to their needs. Here are some of the topics covered. • Colloquium on well-being at work • 5 tips for more exercise at work • Road risk prevention • Preventing traffic accidents near schools • Household help safety • What costs do you avoid by investing in prevention? A blog is dedicated to prevention on the Ethias website: 17 www.ethias.be/blog-fr DIGITAL TR ANSFORMATION Ethias has embarked on a major technological transformation programme to support its ambitions.

ETHIAS AS A SUSTAINABLE COMPANY 3.1 SOCIAL COHESION 3.2 ETHIAS 2.0 Ethias considers the social cohesion In order to support the strategy Ethias 2.0 aimed at making Ethias and well-being of its employees more dynamic, more agile and even as an absolute priority, in direct more responsive to its clients, major connection with its values and as an transformations were initiated in 2017 within the Human Resources Department.

Like all insurance companies, Ethias faces many challenges resulting from global changes. The company’s objectives are therefore adapted to the changing situation and to the needs of our society and those of the labour market. 21 3.3 DIVERSIT Y In 2006, Ethias adopted an internal diversity charter. In 2007, this approach earned the company a Diversity label. The charter aims to ban all forms of Diversity covers direct or indirect discrimination but also several aspects: to have a proactive attitude in this field • man/woman (recruitment, career management, fair reflection of the diversity of Belgian society • abled/disabled among employees, enriching the social • ethnic and cultural diversity dialogue in the company by promoting • ... the expression of the various actors on the topic of discrimination in a climate of confidence, tolerance and openness).

A talent management policy was also implemented in 2017 and will be formalised in 2018. The 1,799 Ethias employees received informal training for a total of 7,535.5 hours. 142 INTERNAL JOB CHANGES HAVE 142 BEEN IMPLEMENTED thanks to the talent management policy in order to better meet the needs of Ethias and its clients (including the reorganisation of Ethias 2.0). Investments in training have been intensified: a specific change support programme was set up in 2017 without losing sight of technical training. Indeed, in response to market developments, it is important to maintain a very high level of technical (insurance), commercial and management expertise, while being attractive to young talents who respond to new insurance professions. 23 3.5 RE-ENCHANTMENT PROCESS In 2017, as part of change management, a process of re-enchantment was launched within the company to promote well-being and a sense of company belonging. Various actions have been In June, the Staff Day proposed to the employees, (called “Ethias Get2gether”) such as “Casual Fridays” was an opportunity to share, (with a more relaxed dress within a convivial atmosphere, code on Fridays throughout the a corporate vision of a summer, breakfast offered at renewed and forwardthe company restaurant, etc.). looking team spirit. >>> 24 3.6 PREVENTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS In 2017, managers received SOCIAL CELL training on burnout The Social Cell has existed since 1997.

REDUCTION OF CO 2 EMISSIONS When measuring its carbon footprint by CO2Logic In detail, the actions undertaken in (every two years), Ethias was able to demonstrate the following*: 2012-2013 continue in 2017: • Conclusion of electricity supply contracts favouring the “green label with guarantee of -53 % -11 % origin”. This guarantees the supply of energy produced by hydroelectric power, wind, CONSUMABLES GLOBAL ETHIAS EMISSIONS (paper, meat in tonnes) (tonnes of CO2) cogeneration or solar means (energy 2030) • In partnership with CO2Logic: measurement of the carbon footprint resulting in proposals 360,60 5 509,19 4 906,50 for actions to reduce the footprint; • Partnership with bpost for the CO2 compensation of postal mailings: 171,00 • Modernization of production equipment and management of heating/air conditioning; • Implementation of corrective and/or 2015 2017 2015 2017 innovative measures in order to reduce our emissions (installation of energy metering modules, presence detectors) WASTE REDUCTION Ethias’ action concerns: • Management of waste, packaging and used consumables • Management of suppliers in accordance with ethical standards and with sustainability and proximity criteria. • Quantification of the reduction in consumption (energy, water, paper, waste), particularly upon the conclusion of a collective labour agreement (CCT 90). This led to a 5 % reduction in the consumption of white paper and cardboard cups over a three-month period in 2017 (compared to the same period in 2015). • Setting-up of a “slow food” policy in the company restaurant (98,000 meals per year) and selection of local suppliers adhering to the “Ethias Food Charter” and presenting sustainability/bio labels. Our company restaurant favours local and seasonal products with organic label. It aims for “zero waste” thanks to the system for ordering meals the day before they are consumed. In addition, organic waste is sorted. 28 * See also the PwC’s assurance statement on page 42. Method of CO2Logic CO2Logic carried out the eighth “Carbon Footprint” for Ethias (fiscal year 2017). The method used to carry out the CO2 audit is based on the “Bilan Carbone®” tool. Developed by ADEME (French Agency for Energy and Environmental Management), this tool allows the accounting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on data easily available within the organization. It complies with the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Principles used by CO2 measurement parameters the United Nations (UNFCCC) and ISO 14064. The “Bilan Carbone®” method and the ISO 14064-1 The “Bilan Carbone®” method is an effective standard define three distinct perimeters: solution for identifying the various sources of The first scope covers direct GHG emissions related to emissions linked to Ethias’ activities, on the one energy combustion within the company (production hand, and prioritising them in order to identify processes, internal transportation, building heating), priority areas and draw practical conclusions, emissions related to vehicles owned or controlled, on the other hand. The results of the study are and emissions associated with refrigerant gas leaks. presented in such a way as to give an overall view The second scope includes indirect emissions of the carbon footprint. They may involve some related to the use of energy carriers (electricity degree of uncertainty inherent in their complexity. and heating). Although the company is not directly The results of the study are also compatible with responsible for them, these emissions (coming from the GHG Protocol Initiative and the terms of the power plants or steam) are intimately linked to the CO2 Emissions Trading Directive 2003/87/EC. consumption of these energy carriers by the company. The “Bilan Carbone®” method remains a tool The third scope includes other indirect emissions. This that aims to give orders of magnitude. The main includes emissions generated by the movements of objective is not to compare the results obtained workers (commuter traffic, business trips, etc.) and of with other companies, but is an essential visitors, freight (incoming and outgoing), consumables prerequisite for developing an action plan to (paper, equipment) and food (company restaurant). For reduce GHG emissions. It is intended as an companies that want to go even further, it is possible environmental management and sustainable to take into account the emissions generated by the development tool and gives a complete picture purchase of services, the use of the product by the of the company’s carbon footprint and enables customer, waste, equipment, machinery, buildings, etc. actions to be prioritized according to the relative importance of the emission sources.
