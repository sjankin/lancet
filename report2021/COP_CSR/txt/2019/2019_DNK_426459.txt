It is important and valuable to CPH to get to know our neighbours’ views on the airport even better and to enter into a dialogue – often dominated by the noise issue. In order to strengthen this, in 2018 CPH launched RKE flight tracker – a web-portal showing air traffic at Roskilde Airport. Read more about Roskilde Airport on page 32 and view the Roskilde Airport flight tracker here: https://flighttracking.casper. aero/rke/ (website only in Danish). See also WebTrak for Copenhagen Airport here: https://webtrak.emsbk.com/cph During 2018, CPH went on tour with our ”Dear neighbour” tent, which was both an educational and a positive experience. Since 2017, we have performed neighbour analyses, and the most recent analysis was completed by the end of 2018. The analysis includes questions, about neighbour attitudes to airport noise, which in 2018 shows a decrease in the share of neighbours who feel bothered by aircraft noise ”all the time”/”every day” from 20% in 2017 to 14% in 2018.

These estimates are based on the Company’s business plans and expected useful lives of the assets, the technical and maintenance state of the assets, and regulatory requirements. The residual value is estimated at DKK 184.7 million (2017: DKK 184.7 million) at the balance sheet date. The useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at least at every year-end based on these factors. CPH evaluates the carrying amounts in order to assess whether events have occurred that require an adjustment of these amounts because they are not expected to be recoverable. In estimating the runways' useful lives, CPH has chosen to divide the system into three elements: foundations, surfaces and technical installations. CPH's assessment is that each element has a different useful life. The runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundations due to immediate wear: their useful life expectancy is 10 years. This assessment is supported by historical replacement of runway surfaces and planning for future replacement. Technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 15 years. It is assessed that these technical installations do not have the same useful life as other technical installations, taking into account security measures. Impairment The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested at least annually for any indications of impairment beyond that expressed in the depreciation charges. Where there are such indications, an impairment charge is made against the recoverable amount of the assets where this is lower than the carrying amount. In assessing the recoverable amount, CPH takes into account significant indicators of potential impairment such as purchase and sales prices, and general market conditions. 101 CO NSO L I DAT ED FI N A N CI A L PER F O RM A N CE & S TAT EM EN T S / F I N A N C I A L STAT EMEN T S Notes / Investments NOTE Property, plant and equipment (continued) 3.3 2018 Other fixtures Property, plant and Land and Plant and and fittings, tools equipment under DKK million buildings* machinery and equipment construction Total Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 8,174.4 8,010.3 1,986.0 925.2 19,095.9 Additions 1,937.7 1,937.7 Disposals (122.5) (175.0) (130.0) (427.5) Transferred 446.7 393.6 129.6 (969.9) Accumulated cost at 31 December 8,498.6 8,228.9 1,985.6 1,893.0 20,606.1 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 3,218.8 3,988.8 1,304.8 8,512.4 Depreciation 299.0 334.7 161.1 794.8 Depreciation on disposals (122.5) (175.0) (129.8) (427.3) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 3,395.3 4,148.5 1,336.1 8,879.9 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,103.3 4,080.4 649.5 1,893.0 11,726.2 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total of DKK 849.1 million (2017: DKK 849.1 million).
