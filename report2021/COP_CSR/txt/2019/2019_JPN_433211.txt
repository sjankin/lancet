Fiscal 2018 in Review First, I want to thank you, our customers and stakeholders, for your support of the ANA Group. Fiscal 2018 saw groupwide operating revenues surpassing ¥2 trillion for the first time. Operating income marked a new high for the fourth consecutive year. These results are largely due to the posiShinya Katanozaka tive performance in our mainstay Air Transportation Business. The ANA International Passenger President & Chief Executive Officer Business has made steady progress in building demand, supported by our superior and growing network of routes from/to Haneda Airport.

We have followed through with plans to invest in safety, quality and services, as well as human resources, to solidify our management platform for future business growth. In the peak summer season, we conducted planned flight cancellations primarily on our domestic routes. These cancellations were part of our response to engine issues with Boeing 787 aircraft, or B787. Though it was a difficult decision, safety is always our top priority.

This alliance also entailed adopting the Passenger Revenue Optimization System (PROS). Then, our International Passenger Business posted a profit for the first time in fiscal 2004.

Our plans call for purchasing one Airbus A380-800, six 737-500s, and five Airbus A320-200s. (1) Strengthening cost competitiveness by introducing fuel-efficient Boeing 777-300s, two Boeing 777 freighters (for cargo flights), one aircraft; (2) Optimizing supply to demand by increasing the ratios of narrowand medium-body aircraft; and (3) Enhancing productivity by integrating aircraft types. Fundamentally, the Group purchases and owns strategic aircraft we intend to use over the medium to long term. We employ operating leases to procure aircraft for use over the short term or for capacity adjustment. The Group may also utilize sale-leaseback transactions as a means to diversify corporate financing methods. In these and other ways, the Group selects the most economical aircraft procurement method. 112 113 Results of Value Creation Management’s Discussion and Analysis Interest-Bearing Debt Fuel Expense Sensitivity Financial Position  (¥ Millions) Retirement Benefit Obligations ANA calculated fuel expense sensitivity to fluctuations in crude oil (End of Fiscal Year) 2018 2017 Change Assets The ANA Group defined benefit plans consist of welfare pension fund prices for fiscal 2019 (calculated at the beginning of the fiscal year, Short-term debt: ¥112,987 ¥100,125 ¥ 12,862 excluding hedging) as follows: Total assets as of March 31, 2019 amounted to ¥2,687.1 billion, an plans, defined benefit corporate pension plans, and lump-sum Short-term loans 336 176 160 •F  uel expenses: Approximately ¥3.3 billion per year increase of ¥124.6 billion compared to March 31, 2018. retirement benefit plans.
