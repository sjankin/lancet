The aim is to present information on the management model and performance of Crèdit Andorrà in the economic, financial, social, environmental and corporate governance fields. Crèdit Andorrà SA is the parent company of the investee companies listed in the report. In this regard, the presented information corresponds to the Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group, excluding the data presented in the clients and environment sections, which refer exclusively to the Group's companies located in the Principality of Andorra. The economic and financial information included was obtained from the consolidated financial statements. It is the fifteenth edition of the Crèdit Andorrà publication and it replaces the Corporate Social Responsibility report, published until 2017. The 2018 Corporate Activity Report has been written in accordance with the GRI standards: “Compliance Exhaustive” option based on GRI Standards. Materiality analysis In order to bring consistency and credibility, comply with the directives established by the GRI Standards and comply with them in the Corporate activity report, Crèdit Andorrà has carried out a materiality analysis which has allowed us to identify the relevant topics and prioritise them depending on their level of importance. Materiality is the threshold at which an issue becomes relevant enough to be included in the Corporate activity report. As the GRI Standards establish, this document reports on the material topics resulting from the consultation process based on economic, social or environmental impact on the value chain. Methodology and results Identification was carried out based on the impacts of the actions and activities of the Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group on the banking, financial and insurance sectors, and on their stakeholders. The issues identified have been classified into six categories: sector (business strategy and economic management), ethics and integrity (good corporate governance and compliance), service (relationship with the customer and product responsibility), employees (team management), environment (environmental management) and involvement with society (social action and involvement with the country). To ensure that materiality provides a reasonable and balanced view of the sustainable development of the Group, a more detailed internal analysis of the results was carried out. As a result of this vertical analysis, it was also considered important to class the following aspects as material: local communities, emissions and risk management. Furthermore, information related to non-material issues according to the GRI Standards is reported as this enables the Group’s CSR efforts to be explained in more detail. For further details, see the table with the GRI indicators. 2018 Corporate activity report 5 Materiality matrix Occupational health and safety Combating corruption Socio-economic performance Unfair competition Employment High (≥4.38) Training and education Diversity and equal opportunities Non-discrimination Customer privacy Good governance Average (4.15-4.37) Materials Economic performance Marketing and labelling Energy Innovation in products and services Water Risk management Stakeholder influence Market presence CSR strategy Market impact Socially and environmentally responsible financing and investment Emissions Financial inclusion Effluent and waste Financial education Environmental assessment of suppliers High-quality working conditions Local communities Low (≤4.14) Social assessment of suppliers Financial products with a social and environmental component Innovation applied to internal processes and strategic projects Institutional involvement on an environmental level Strategic alliances Low (≤3.77) Average (3.78-4.00) High (≥4.01) Impact on Crèdit Andorrà Economic Social Environmental Material topics 6 Contents Contents Letter from the Chairman | 08 Letter from the CEO | 10 01 Corporate governance 1.1 Shareholder structure | 13 1.2 Corporate governance structure | 15 1.3 Best corporate governance practices | 20 1.4 Comprehensive risk management | 21 02 Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group.

Materiality, GRI Table of Contents and Table of the Principles of the Global Compact | 100 8 Letter from the Chairman The year that is ending has been important for the Crèdit Andorrà Group, both in business and organisational terms. The environment in which we find ourselves has led us to aim for the direction of international standardisation, transparency, management efficiency and social commitment. In pursuit of this, the Group has closed 2018 still in the lead in terms of income in the Andorran financial market and enhancing our social involvement, something with which we are completely satisfied. In the economic sphere, the results obtained reflect prudent management, anticipating the requirements of the new context in terms of legislation and financial regulations, with the aim of regaining the highest levels of growth. The 36 million euros of profit obtained strengthen Crèdit Andorrà’s position as the country’s leading bank, which is reinforced by business volume in Andorra of €9.408 billion (€15.442 billion in total in the Group). We have also strengthened our support of the Andorran economy and its society, with €2.502 billion in loans to customers. Our good economic management has been confirmed by Fitch Ratings, who maintained Crèdit Andorrà’s BBB rating with a stable outlook. The entity has made significant efforts in corporate governance, in line with global transparency requirements. Aspects that stand out are the restructuring of the Board of Directors, with the incorporation of new members of the Board of Directors (proprietaries and independents) and an Executive Director; the creation of the delegate committees of Audit and Risks and of Appointments and Remunerations, chaired by the new independent Board members, in addition to the implementation of the Shareholder Space portal. This microsite gathers together all the information and documentation relevant to shareholders and allows the sale and purchase of shares. In compliance with the IFRS-EU regulation applied in Andorra, the Bank has also undertaken a redistribution of the shareholder structure that has affected share capital, which as of 31 December 2018 is 63,102,130 euros, represented by 901,459 nominative shares that are distributed among 894,396 class A shares and 7,063 class E shares. 2018 Corporate activity report 9 This redefinition in the governing bodies was also transferred to the management bodies, with a clear desire to facilitate and consolidate the Group’s strategic areas. These are changes that we consider necessary to allow us to face the challenges of the future that is already here and in which our entity wants to continue to play an active role. Digitalisation of banking, focusing on strategic international marketplaces, retaining talent and providing service to customers who are more informed, more connected and more demanding are some of the challenges, which have led us to constantly reinvent ourselves. We are convinced that we are moving in the right direction. We thrive on a way of banking based on the values of service, commitment and people, and which has been recognised again on various occasions in 2018. The financial publications The Banker and PWM, from the Financial Times group, have highlighted us as the Best private bank in Andorra, and Global Banking and Finance Review awarded us the prize for the Best private bank in Andorra and the Best Andorran bank for corporate social responsibility. We want to highlight the latter award in particular because involvement with society has been one of our main distinguishing features, with a continued commitment to the business and associative fabric of the country that we make clear through the Bank’s social responsibility programme. In addition, since 1987, when Fundació Crèdit Andorrà was founded, our initiatives have benefited a wide spectrum of the population: from the 200 young people who were trained thanks to the grants programme (which is celebrating its 30th anniversary), to the over 1,500 users over 60 years old that continuously use the training on offer at L’espai, not forgetting supporting musical creation through the Fundació ONCA or the new Ordino Clàssic festival, and the promotion of research and personal well-being. Being responsible and acting with responsibility has been the aim of the Crèdit Andorrà Group from the beginning, both in financial management and in ethical and social performance. Our leadership goes well beyond being first: it means staying strong regarding our principles and continuing to open doors that allow us to achieve excellency, profitability and sustainability, at the service of our customers, employees and shareholders. Antoni Pintat Mas Chairman of the Board of Directors of Crèdit Andorrà 10 Letter from the CEO It is an honour to address you for the first time as CEO of the Crèdit Andorrà Group. The changes to the Board of Directors and in the management team reaffirm the desire for Crèdit Andorrà to remain leader in the Andorran financial market and present ourselves abroad as a bank with reliable results, that is efficient and innovative in its processes and committed to people and the country. The Group’s results for 2018 reflect this leadership status in the country, with total net operating profit/loss of 172.6 million euros and a net profit of 36 million euros. These figures are in line with the business plan, despite the fairly unfavourable context for the financial industry, due to the poor performance of the markets, an environment of low interest rates and the new banking regulation. It is also worth mentioning other structural factors, due to their impact in terms of efficiency, such as the fiscal transparency measures and the effort using technological and human resources to adapt to the legislative requirements resulting from the Monetary Agreement, as well as the new reality of digital transformation. However, the Group has maintained solid figures that confirm its sufficient capitalisation and liquidity. Thus, the solvency ratio is 15.11% (15.98% CRD IV Phased-In criteria) and the liquidity ratio is 56.27%, both above the legal minimums in Andorra (10% and 40% respectively). In response to the new business plan, I would like to highlight the restructuring of the governing bodies, according to efficiency criteria in decision making and efficiency in operational functioning. The Group’s Internal Audit division has been strengthened, which reporting directly to the Audit and Risk Committee enhances strategic control functions, and various divisions and departments have been concentrated into the Financial Planning, Operations and Resources Division. In addition, the following have been redefined: the Department of Innovation and Strategic Projects and the Department of Corporate Communications, Marketing and Client Digital Transformation. Since the digital and technological area is another strategic challenge. We have responded with an investment of 19.9 million euros, in order to continue to be a technological benchmark for the sector and pioneers in offering digital services to customers who are demanding more and better solutions. It is worth highlighting Merkaat, the digital investment fund advisory service; Crèdit Wallet, which enables payment by mobile phone; access to the online bank e-Crèdit using your finger print and facial recognition, or the biometric signature for common in-branch transactions. 2018 Corporate activity report 11 The business focus on efficiency and focused growth has been another milestone, as well as strengthening the international expansion in three geographic areas: Beta Capital Wealth Management concentrates business in America thanks to the new self-clearing licence, which enables us to boost our genuine differential value offer by being able to also act as trustees. In Luxembourg, Banque de Patrimoines Privés has cemented itself as a hub in Europe for the safeguarding of assets, structuring and administration of investment vehicles for institutional customers, and in Spain Banco Alcalá continues on the path of growth with a diversification strategy that includes entering the management portfolios of a broad segment of customers. Also in Spain, the Insurance Group has headed up an important operation, with the merger of our subsidiary ERM Holding with RSM to become the new ERSM Insurance Brokers, the leading private insurance brokers in Spain, with a brokered premiums volume of 169 million euros. Lastly, in Andorra, with a banking model based on service that places the customer at the centre, our strategic commitment has been confirmed as adequate by the country. The Bank has continued to stand by its commitment to support the Andorran economy and society, which has materialised in €1.211 billion in financing operations to individuals and companies and with regard to investment in corporate social responsibility, through the important work of Fundació Crèdit Andorrà, one of the most important in the country in terms of resources and programmes. We are facing several challenges for which we have a team of professionals who are committed and involved in the same future horizon. The Crèdit Andorrà Group must present itself to the world as a pioneering global bank with the ability to serve and a strong commitment to Andorran society and its development, with the active participation of our shareholders, customers and employees. Xavier Cornella Castel CEO of Crèdit Andorrà Group 12 Corporate governance 01. Corporate governance Corporate governance is one of the fundamental pillars that sustain the strategy of the Crèdit Andorrà Group. In this regard, and in compliance with the provisions of the legislation applicable to financial institutions, Crèdit Andorrà has implemented a suite of actions to strengthen the entity’s corporate governance and align the Bank with the best international practices in relation to transparency and banking ethics. Crèdit Andorrà Group’s corporate governance system is structured around a framework that defines risk management responsibilities according to the three lines of defence model, recommended by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in its “Corporate governance principles for banks”.

The incorporation of independent Board members as the heads of these committees is in response to professionalism, suitability and experience criteria, although it also fosters the adequate performance of the managerial, supervisory and monitoring roles that are assigned to them.

In this regard, the information presented corresponds to the Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group, excluding the data presented in the clients and environment sections, which refer exclusively to the Group's companies located in the Principality of Andorra. The economic and financial information included was obtained from the audited consolidated annual statements. 119 GRI Standards Content Page number or URL Omissions SDG 102-46 Defining report content 4 and topic boundaries To determine which issues are relevant for Crèdit Andorrà (internal scope) and its stakeholders (external scope), a tiered process has been carried out in accordance with standard AA1000SES (2011) on Accountability and the GRI Standards. The materiality analysis process has been carried out from an internal perspective (including the people with decision-making powers within the Group) and taking into account the series of actors within its value chain, since these are the Crèdit Andorrà stakeholders. 1. Identification of topics. The identification of relevant topics for Crèdit Andorrà must be carried out based on the impact of its actions and activities on the banking, financial and insurance sectors and on its stakeholders. This exercise has been carried out using the organization’s internal sources (including the main strategic lines and the cultural model values) and external sources. For the external analysis, an industry-wide benchmarking study has been carried out on the best practices in the field of CSR at a global level, and the main sustainability reference standards have been analyzed. The tools and sources of information used for the identification are: GRI Standards; G4 version of the Global Reporting Initiative financial services sector supplement; Sustainability Topics for Sectors: What do stakeholders want to know? of the Global Reporting Initiative. “34 – Banks, Diverse Financials and Insurance” – 42 Topics; Sustainability — what matters? of the Governance & Accountability Institute, Inc. Financial Services; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Asset Management, Commercial Banks, Insurance and Investment. The issues identified have been classified into six categories: sector (business strategy and economic management), ethics and integrity (good corporate governance and compliance), service (relationship with the customer and product responsibility), employees (team management), involvement with society (social action and involvement with the country) and environment (environmental management). 2. Prioritization of issues. To prioritize the aforementioned issues, and following the principles of Accountability and standard AA1000SES (2011) in our relationship with stakeholders, we have carried out a specific investigation using an online survey to rate the various issues according to their level of importance for the sustainable and socially responsible development of Crèdit Andorrà. This evaluation has taken into account the participation of all of the Group’s internal and external stakeholders. The internal evaluation has involved the participation of the shareholders. The external evaluation has included participation of all the Crèdit Andorrà stakeholders: employees (of the entire Group), customers (from Andorra), the community (associations, foundations, academia, public bodies, etc. of Andorra), suppliers (of the parent company) and the media (of Andorra). In addition to the online survey, the external analysis took into account the results obtained from the benchmarking carried out. For the statistical analysis, the answers provided by the stakeholders have been weighted based on their importance for Crèdit Andorrà, taking into consideration the influence the group has on the economic, social and environmental performance of Crèdit Andorrà and according to the extent to which the Group is affected by the entity’s economic, social and environmental exercise. After the statistical analysis of the responses received, the level of importance of each issue was determined and shown on the materiality matrix. Once the process was concluded and the topics and level of importance determined, all issues with high importance for the organization and its stakeholders (high-medium and medium-high and medium-medium) were considered material. 3. Validation. The results obtained were analyzed in detail in order to ensure that we offer a reasonable and balanced vision for the sustainable and responsible development of the Crèdit Andorrà Financial Group internally and with the participation of managers and the departments and areas most directly related to the strategic CSR issues. As a result of this vertical analysis, it was also considered important to class the following aspects as material: local communities and emissions. 4. Furthermore, information related to non-material issues according to the GRI Standards is reported as this enables the Group’s CSR efforts to be explained in greater detail. 120 GRI Standards Content Page number or URL Omissions SDG 102-47 List of material topics 5 102-48 Restatements of No relevant restatements took place involving information contained in previous reports.
