Delivering growth, development and increased profitability in our two business segments (Entertainment Services and Connected Home) is a high priority for me and my entire leadership team. One of the foundations of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been our longstanding adoption since 2003 and renewed commitment every year to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and more recently, our willingness to integrate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in our CSR reporting. More specifically, Technicolor policies prohibit the use of child labor, forced labor, human trafficking and slavery in its operations and its supply chain and require its suppliers to comply with our standards. The resulting governance processes have helped to place Corporate Social Responsibility at the heart of our business approach and ensure that commercial needs are appropriately balanced with those of local communities, the environment, our business partners and of course our employees. For the sixth year in a row, an external audit of our social, environmental and societal information reporting took place, involving more than 50 stakeholders across multiple countries. Accurate information is vital for the continued progress of our sustainability agenda and a key input to leaders across our business making operational decisions on a wide variety of topics. Focused on suppliers evaluated as “high risk”, Technicolor also added in 2018 a more systematic risk assessment of suppliers with the implementation of the EcoVadis assessment platform for suppliers representing a yearly spending of more than €1 million, such category representing more than 90% of the total spending of the Group. Since 2017, Technicolor is a certified and audited member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) after having successfully implemented its code of conduct throughout the supply chain. RBA membership includes compliance requirements for periodic third-party audits of all critical suppliers with an intense focus on Human Rights. For all its businesses, diversity and equal opportunity is one of the most valuable assets of the Group. On the gender diversity front, actions were put in place through a full range of processes in order to better balance gender diversity and increase the ratio of women in business roles and management levels and leadership pipeline. In 2018, several initiatives to promote gender diversity were encouraged locally in India, France, UK, Poland and Australia. Focusing on equality, inclusion and diversity enables us to attract, retain and develop the right skills. High on the CSR agenda, content security and protection, one of the strong expertise of the Group since its beginning, remains key to our business long-term sustainability. As a major actor involved in all steps of the delivery of Media & Entertainment content to the end user, Technicolor has anticipated the new threats in cybersecurity, issued a Security Policy and implemented an internal program to address risks such as content leaks affecting customers (film), suppliers (source code) or employee personal data, as well as to defend its products and systems against cyberattacks, or theft of otherwise valuable intellectual property. With respect to climate change and the circular economy, Technicolor is taking all steps to fulfill its responsibilities as a global corporate citizen. In 2018, the Company participated for the eleventh consecutive year in the Carbon Disclosure Project. The Group started to implement eco-design guidelines in 2008 and has long taken a positive stance towards environmental issues in the development, manufacture, energy use and ultimate disposal of its products, bringing benefits for both customers and the environment. Employee health and safety remains also an important focus, demanding continuous vigilance and innovation to ensure we do everything possible to keep our employees safe. Our commitment to align sustainability reporting to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards relies on diligent data harvesting processes, and audits help us retain focus year after year. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. Technicolor thereby demonstrates that its non-financial information and disclosures are exhaustive and give more control to stakeholders over the transparency, comparability, quality and accountability of the Group’s sustainability data. All these long-term efforts were recognized in 2018 by external and independent agencies. For the first year of assessment by ISS-oekom, Technicolor achieved the “Prime” status. The Group was rated by Vigeo-Eiris “Top performer in the software-IT services industry” worldwide and ranked 9 out of 230 companies in the Gaïa-Ethifinance index. Finally, Technicolor was granted a “Gold” medal for the second year in a row, based on its CSR Rating assessed by EcoVadis, an independent global organization allowing companies to assess the environmental and social performance of their suppliers. In 2018, Technicolor ranked among the top 5% of companies rated by EcoVadis in the Manufacture of communication equipment industry.

SUSTAINABILITY COMMUNICATION 2018 1.3 THE MATERIALITY MATRIX GRI [102-42 ] [102-44] [102-46] [102-47] TECHNICOLOR The importance of each CSR challenge for the Group was determined by assessment and dialogue based on: • The operational, business, and reputational impact on the Group (the most important across the 3 business divisions, as the impact of any single CSR challenge on a business division may differ widely from one issue to the next); • The likelihood of occurrence; • The likelihood of generation of risk by the Supply Chain (suppliers and subcontractors). • The importance for the Stakeholders was determined based on: • The focus of customers’ requests per CSR issue; • The feedback from employees; • The focus of questions and alignment with subjects judged important by CSR rating agencies. 1.4 THE APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY GRI [102-43] Technicolor’s approach to sustainability relies on 3 pillars: At the same time, video content resolution increases regularly, leading to associated increases in the volume of Attracting and developing a diverse talent pool of data to deliver and the energy required to do it. creative individuals.

During 2018, a total of 6 sites held ISO 14001 certification, and one recently acquired operation is working toward it; As part of Technicolor’s objective of auditing each industrial location at least every three years, three locations were audited in 2018. As a result of these audits, potential improvement items were identified and evaluated, and more importantly, approTECHNICOLOR priate action plans were developed; 2018 Actions and Climate Change: a transportation emissions blueprint was made in 2017 and in Results 2018. Partnering with award-winning and certified French TK’Blue company, which conducts in-depth emissions calculations for its customers, Connected Home benefited from accrued vision and control over the impact of its global logistics chain and was better able to assess which products and partners were best able to align with the Connected Home practice of sea freight first, air freight last, with preference for rail transport within Europe. TECHNICOLOR ENVIRONMENT GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLE 9: 10 Principles Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. TECHNICOLOR Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), Eco-design, Energy efficiency of devices and systems, Program and Policies Industry Voluntary Initiatives and Codes of Conduct. Technicolor started to implement Eco-design guidelines in 2008 and has long taken a positive stance towards environmental issues in the development, manufacture, use and ultimate disposal of its products. The Group is an active contributor to industry voluntary initiatives or codes of conduct, including the EU Codes of Conduct (CoC) on Energy Efficiency of Digital TV Service (DTV) and Energy Consumption of Broadband Equipment (BB), the EU Industry Voluntary Agreement (VIA) to improve energy consumption of Complex Set-Top Boxes (CSTB), and more recently the US Voluntary Agreements for Ongoing Improvement to the Energy Efficiency of SetTop Boxes (STB), and for Ongoing Improvement to the Energy Efficiency of Small Network Equipment (SNE); In 2018 in Europe, Technicolor has participated and contributed to the revision of CoC BB V6 and VIA V4.0. The work on CoC BB V7 has continued and the TECHNICOLOR finalization of CoC BB V7 is foreseen beginning of 2019. The VIA version 5 has 2018 Actions and been published in September of 2017. The intent is now to add in the VIA version 6 Results some non-energy requirements related e.g. to Repair, Reuse and Recycling (RRR), to products’ durability and upgradeability, to restriction of some flame retardants in plastic parts in addition to RoHS, restriction of Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins (SCCP), and the full recyclability of packaging. VIA V6 publication is planned in 2019; In the Americas, in Australia, in Asia, in Africa, and in the same manner, Technicolor monitors and follows environmental regulations and standards; In the United States for example, most of Connected Home STB models marketed in U.S. meet the Energy-Star STB energy efficiency levels; In Europe, Company reporting for 2018 demonstrates that Technicolor achieved the power consumption targets respectively set by the Code of Conduct for Broadband Equipment, and the Voluntary Industry Agreement on Complex Set-Top Box. SUSTAINABILITY COMMUNICATION 2018 ANTI-CORRUPTION PRINCIPLE 10: GLOBAL COMPACT Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and 10 Principles bribery. Code of Ethics, Ethics Compliance Committee, Financial Ethics Charter, Anti-CorTECHNICOLOR ruption & Anti-Bribery Policy, Sourcing Ethics Policy, Technicolor Supplier Ethics Program and Policies Handbook, RBA Code of Conduct, Supplier Monitoring and KPIs, Whistleblower Policy and portal. Early 2018, the Group updated its Code of Ethics after having conducted end of 2017 a revision of its Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy to include reinforced or additional sections, including sections on anti-corruption and anti-bribery, anti-money laundering. The Group’s Whistleblower Policy was also revised in 2017; A Chief Compliance Committee (CCO) has been appointed in 2017 and supports the implementation of ethics rules and policies defined in accordance with applicable regulations. The CCO is also the Secretary of the Ethics Compliance Committee (ECC); As part of Technicolor’s efforts to ensure that employees are familiar with the Code of Ethics and related policies, such as the Whistleblower Policy, the Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy and the Sourcing Ethics Policy, numerous training programs were implemented in the past years by the legal compliance team in concertation with the Ethics Compliance Committee (ECC), including both in-person, WebEx and online courses. From 2010 through 2018, training sessions related to business ethics, competition rules, fraud, anti-corruption and anti-bribery involved more than 15,000 employees worldwide; Over the last few years, amongst other Ethics training courses, members of the finance community completed the Global Financial Fraud Prevention course. During that same time, online training courses focused on the EU Competition-Dealing with Competitors, anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations and policies, and preventing sexual harassment. The Americas population has received training on anti-bribery, competition, anti-corruption, business communications, addressing employee concerns, and fraud prevention. In-person training and preparation meetings took place with key managers in 2017, focusing on the evolution of anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies based on the requirements of French anti-bribery Loi Sapin II. In addition, over the past years, several TECHNICOLOR in-person trainings took place in Mexico, India and China on various aspects of the 2018 Actions and Company’s Code of Ethics; Results The comprehensive Technicolor commitment to prevent corruption, formalized in our Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy, seeks to not only comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery regulations like the French Criminal Code, but to avoid even the appearance of questionable conduct in connection with Technicolor operations. The new Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy which was issued at the end of 2017, includes a practical guide to anti-bribery. Several specific policies (notably targeting third parties such as agents) have been reviewed and background check processes for certain third parties were put in place; -The issuance of the new Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Policy was followed by an all-group message from the CEO. E-learning training targeting all employee categories has been delivered as well as on-site training for specific employee categories such as sales team, legal team or specific countries. Technicolor top management has shown its engagement by issuing several communications to all employees regarding anti-bribery practices, and by requiring regular updates on the anti-bribery program at the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. A risk mapping exercise was performed which involved among others, controlling and sourcing teams, business leaders and specific managers, in order to identify priorities areas for anti-bribery purpose. A subsequent screening of our third parties (customers, vendors, partners) has been done with the support of an external assessment (Lexis Diligence); Pertaining to these policies, any employee may report anonymously any suspected breach of competition rules or anti-bribery rules, and more broadly any breach of the Code of Ethics, through the Whistleblowing portal (phone, email) in the countries where Technicolor is active.
