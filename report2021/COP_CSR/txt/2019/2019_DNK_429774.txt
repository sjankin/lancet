Risk related to Corporate Social Responsibility DHI operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. In order to sustain profitable growth, DHI considers risk management a necessity and has adopted a structured approach to address this area. In DHI, risk management contains four elements: risk identification, risk assessment, identification of mitigating actions and risk reporting. DHI identifies risk using a combination of a bottom-up and a top-down approach. Key risks are initially identified within each business unit using a SWOT analysis and reported to Group Management together with information on what has been done and what is intended to be done. High risks are aggregated and a broad list presented in an annual risk report and challenged by Group Management and finally the Board of Directors. The main risks related to CSR are presented below: Risk Category Risk Mitigation Human Rights DHI has corporate policies for human rights. We support • Freedom of association and freedom of association and abandon any form of forced collective bargaining labour and child labour. • Forced labour • Child labour and young We work actively with health and safety and continuously workers monitor equality and inclusion throughout our business. • Non-discrimination • Health & safety Our compensation packages are externally benchmarked to • Wages and benefits ensure that we comply with market levels. • Fair compensation Labour DHI promotes gender equality and has set targets for top • Gender equality management. • Non-discrimination • Harassment DHI has a whistle-blower policy to promote non• Staff safety and security discrimination and avoid any kind of harassment. Environment DHI manages our operations responsibly in relation to • CO2 and pollution prevention environmental risks and impacts. We actively seek to reduce • Chemical substances our waste and CO2 footprint and manage resources such as • Waste management water and energy to ensure it is used efficiently. Business Ethics DHI conducts business in compliance with legal requirements • Tax and legal compliance and adheres to internationally agreed standards of business • Anti-corruption ethics. • Data and IP protection • Cyber security We have implemented GDPR and are working actively to prevent cyber-crime and to protect our intellectual property. The main drivers for DHI’s actions on CSR are business related. Employee recruitment and retention issues are important focus areas. Thus, failing to implement and preserve sound social responsibility may impair our attractiveness as an employer and consequently put our business at risk if we are not fully equipped to meet our customers’ demands. As such, the main risks identified in relation to CSR are related to company brand and reputation. © DHI Communication on Progress 2018 2.4. Due diligence processes and the use of non-financial KPIs The overall business risks are monitored on a continuous basis. Quarterly reviews are held with all local subsidiaries, where business risks and mitigation actions are reviewed. All new staff are introduced to DHI’s core values and CSR policies, and policies and any incidents are also discussed with employee representatives on a quarterly basis. An Audit Committee has been established, overlooking the overall policies and risk management for the DHI Group. This is closely coordinated with the external audit of the annual accounts by the Group Auditors. Several KPIs have been established to monitor progress on the implementation of the CSR policies. This includes reporting on health and safety, gender equality, fair compensation, tax & legal compliance and DHI’s environmental exposure. 3.

Women account for 35% of all staff in Denmark, and this figure is similar to the total representation of women in the management and Board, which stands at 33%. © DHI Communication on Progress 2018 3.3. Implementation and Performance DHI fulfils the responsibility of securing the rights of our employees. We ensure this by taking various measures: • We offer all our employees a health insurance package • We have established a DHI corporate whistle-blower portal (link) giving employees and other DHI stakeholders the opportunity to submit anonymous or non-anonymous reports serious concerns like bribery, embezzlement, violation of human rights and labour principles, accounting fraud, circumstances which have resulted in substantial injury or environmental damage, and more DHI has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights violations in 2018. 3.4.

All work, including overtime work, shall be voluntary and workers shall be free to leave work or terminate their © DHI Communication on Progress 2018 employment with reasonable notice.

DHI expects all suppliers and subcontractors to share the fundamental principles of DHI’s responsible sourcing standards and that they meet and comply with the requirements of UN Global Compact. As part of the company’s internal processes, DHI has developed a Health & Safety process that covers all activities that are required to ensure a healthy and safe working environment. A Health & Safety Committee was established in DHI in February 2000 and has since continuously worked to create optimal work conditions for employees and secure the absence of work place accidents. One work place accident (> 1 day’s absence) was reported in 2018 and four in 2017. None of which involved terminal or permanent injuries (LTIF per 1 million hours worked = 1,93 in 2018 and 7,67 in 2017). Following Danish legislation, DHI carries out the mandatory workplace assessment surveys (APVs) every third year and whenever there are significant changes in a workplace. In addition, we carry out an assessment of the new employees’ workplace after three months of employment. Actions are taken based on the results of the survey. DHI employs more than 1,100 people located in three different geographical areas (Asia-Pacific, Europe and North & South America) with offices in more than 30 countries.
