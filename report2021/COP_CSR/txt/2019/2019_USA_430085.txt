UN GLOBAL COMPACT INITIATIVE COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2018 Dear Stakeholders, Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture became a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact in September 2012. In doing so, we made a commitment to supporting and implementing the ten principles of the United Nations in the four areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. We will continue to support these principles over the coming years and report annually on our progress. Furthermore, we are committed to supporting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in both the way we operate as a business and through the way that we approach and execute our design work. As part of this commitment, we are required to make an annual disclosure whereby we inform our stakeholders about our efforts to implement the principles of the UN Global Compact. The disclosure report, termed a Communication On Progress (COP), is comprised of two main parts. The first relates to the 10 UN Global Compact Principles and is a description of how we have maintained compliance with the principles. The second section is a summary of our approach to the SDGs that we believe we have an influence on either through our day-to-day business operations or through the products of our work. We disclose statistics about our team – ethnicity, gender pay equity etc. and statistics about our work – how we have reduced carbon emissions of our buildings, how we approach water use reduction etc. We present this Communication On Progress report to you for your feedback and look forward to continuing to improve our work practices and our effect on the built environment. Yours sincerely Robert Forest FAIA, OAA, RIBA, LEED Partner Communication on Progress 2018 Communication on Progress 2018 ADRIAN SMITH + GORDON GILL ARCHITECTURE Gordon Gill, Adrian Smith, and Robert Forest Communication on Progress 2018 ADRIAN SMITH + GORDON GILL ARCHITECTURE Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture (AS+GG) sustainable design.

For more information, please visit smithgill.com. Our office is dedicated to the creation of new paradigms for sustainable development. We utilize a holistic, integrated design approach that emphasizes symbiotic relationships with the natural environment—a philosophy we have termed “global environmental contextualism.” This approach, which takes into consideration building orientation, daylighting, generation of wind power, solar absorption, and a site’s geothermal properties, represents a fundamental change in the design process in which “form follows performance”. It is predicated on the understanding that everything within the built and natural environment is connected and that a building’s design should stem from an understanding of its role within that context—locally, regionally, and globally. Such a pluralistic approach acknowledges the interaction among building systems as well as between those systems and the natural environment and seeks to improve each individual system’s performance. By using this principle in the design of buildings, we can create structures that significantly reduce, or eliminate, their environmental impact. AS+GG’s practice includes designers with extensive experience in multiple disciplines including technical architecture, interior design, urban planning, and Communication on Progress 2018 APPROACH TO PRINCIPLES OUR APPROACH TO THE 10 PRINCIPLES Our approach to addressing the ten principles happens at three levels. what we do ourselves; what we require our consultants and sub-consultants to do; and, what we require our materials suppliers to commit to through specifications.

Within the office, we have replaced most of the lighting with LEDs, the remainder being CFL. We provide recycling bins throughout the office and work with the janitorial staff and building management to measure segregation performance so that we may report it within the CSR. We have funded additional staff training in passive house design and CEEQUAL assessment for infrastructure, public realm and landscape. Measurement Environmental targets for our work are continually assessed throughout the design period. We work in an integrated manner with our sub-consultants and therefore as we improve the performance of the building envelope, or integrate low water consuming fittings, the engineers are able to incorporate these savings into their design. We report project performance annually to the American Institute of Architects and in our CSR. Some buildings will undergo formal Green Building Certification and the predicted energy savings as well as other environmental performance information is reported as part of the certification submittal. Internally we report our own office’s environmental performance through the CSR and through the Green Office Initiative.

The goals were adopted in 2015 by all 193 Nations of the United Nations Generally Assembly with the intention that they be achieved by 2030. Of the 17 Goals, we believe that 12 directly apply to us, either through the way we work, or through the work that we do. The three partners of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture established the firm in the belief that architecture had the power to solve many of the world’s problems relating to the built environment and its impact on the planet and the human population. Through making a conscious effort to analyze each goal, we have identified areas where we may contribute that we would have otherwise thought to be beyond our area of influence. It is our intention to produce a 2025 plan that will establish firm-wide targets to be achieved during the next 6 years. Communication on Progress 2018 GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING 3.6 By 2020, halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents. Creation of pedestrian oriented masterplans that separate foot traffic from high speed moving vehicles. Creation of secure bike lanes that provide protection to cyclists from cars. 3.9 By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination. Draft and implement specifications that prohibit the use of materials containing VOCs in buildings that we design. 3.A Strengthen the implementation of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in all countries, as appropriate. Promotion of green building certification that bans smoking in buildings. 3.D Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks. Our office actively promotes staff participation in activities that promote wellness. This includes gym membership and entry fees for running events. We promote the design of buildings that create a healthy working environment and one that encourages an active life style through walking up and down stairs and providing access to green space.

The ACE Mentor Program is an after school program that introduces high school students to careers in architecture, construction management and engineering. The program is taught by the committed and enthusiastic participation of volunteer mentors who are practicing professionals in their respective fields. By working with real professionals in real work environments, ACE students receive an invaluable hands-on education by learning to understand the day-to-day workings of the ACE industries. ACE’s mission is to inform and excite high school students about career opportunities; encourage students to pursue secondary and post-secondary education that will prepare them for careers in the integrated construction industry; and support the development of basic and technical skills through mentoring relationships. The ACE Mentor Affiliate of Chicago was established in 2000 and has a fourteen-year partnership with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Since then, more than 1,500 high school juniors and seniors from 36 Chicago public schools have participated in the program. ACE Chicago places a special focus on recruiting minority and female students; groups that are significantly underrepresented in the construction and design industry, and in professional occupations overall. 93% of participants are minority and 30% are female. ACE not only engages sponsors and volunteer mentors to expose students to real-world opportunities, it financially supports each student’s continued success through scholarships and grants. Since inception, ACE national has awarded over $15 million in scholarships to promising participants. Teams are composed of 15-25 students and their industry mentors. The program runs every year from November to April, and students meet at a downtown office once a week for two hours. Students learn about each of the tree disciplines through lectures, activities and site visits. They also work together to develop a design project with their teammates. At the end of the year, all the teams gather for a final presentation night. Here they present their designs to other teams, their families, teachers, prospective mentors and the affiliate administrators so all can share in the students’ accomplishments. AS+GG is a host firm for the ACE program in Chicago, representing the Architecture firm on Team 8 and receiving students in our office. Not only do we support the program by allowing a fantastic group of mentors to volunteer their time to the program, we also help with providing student meals, materials and actively take part in both the Executive Board and Associate Board of ACE. Communication on Progress 2018 GENDER EQUALITY GENDER EQUALITY 5.5 Ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision making in political, economic and public life. Females account for 36% of our architectural staff, which is slightly higher than the national average of 34% for the profession. In a traditionally male dominated industry, we actively seek to provide equal opportunities for men and women working within the firm. Regarding the influence on gender equality beyond our firm, we include consideration of gender balance within the organizational chart of potential contractors in the formal tender evaluations process. Contractors who have placed women in senior technical positions are rewarded with a higher score.

We released a major self-driven research piece, entitled RESIDENSITY – a carbon analysis of residential typologies, in 2018. The intent of the book is to advance the state of knowledge regarding sustainable urbanization. The premise was to create 9 communities of 2000 single family homes at a range of scales from Megatall tower, where all homes were in one single building, to urban and suburban neighborhoods with 2000 individual single-family homes. For each community we assessed its impact in terms of land use, energy, transportation and lifecycle carbon emissions. Residensity has been published so that all can learn from it. Communication on Progress 2018 RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION 12.3 By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest. AS+GG has tackled this from two aspects. Firstly, the way we operate as a firm: oo We have moved towards being paperless in the design process through utilizing new technology for reviewing designs. oo We have taken steps to eliminate single use plastic items and plastic packaging from our staff kitchen. oo We will be introducing a food waste composting program by the end of 2019. oo We are updating our policy on lunch and learns to further reduce waste generation and food wastage. And secondly from a design perspective: oo In 2018 we adapted our curtain wall specifications to include embodied carbon targets. These apply primarily to concrete, steel, aluminum and insulation products. oo For concrete we worked with local and national industry bodies to establish targets. For steel we established targets that required a 10% improvement against world steel average and for aluminum we established a requirement for providers to meet a region-specific embodied carbon target either through changing manufacturing and material supply processes or through procuring Gold Standard carbon offsets. For insulation we prohibited the use of HCFC and HFC blowing agents as well as formaldehyde in the manufacturing process. 12.5 By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. AS+GG has strong focus on materials use in our buildings. We know that the built environment is responsible for 39% of global CO2 emissions. We aim to expand our current practice of life cycle analysis to include actual quantities of materials used and not just design quantities. This will identify further opportunities for reducing materials wastage.

As a multi-disciplinary design firm with a strong urban design / city design practice, AS+GG is aware of the impact of climate change on the built and natural environment. We actively seek to ensure resiliency through considering it through the design and through ensuring that simulations include projected climate change scenarios. Communication on Progress 2018 LIFE BELOW WATER LIFE BELOW WATER 14.1 By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution. Although our office activities are far from the oceans, we feel that, especially with the current heightened awareness of marine plastic pollution, eliminating single use plastics in the office is a good start. In the first quarter 2019 we took the following first steps: oo Eliminated plastic drinking straws oo Eliminated single use creamers oo Eliminated disposable plastic coffee cup covers oo Requested lunch and learn providers to not include plastic cutlery We undertook an internal desk-top research study to promote internal awareness of the impact of plastic on the marine ecosystem. This research was presented to the firm by the team that undertook it in advance of our plastics reduction initiative. Our Construction Environmental Management Plans (CEMP) for projects where we are engaged to undertake construction supervision services require contractors to recycle plastics from the site with 90% diversion from landfill. Communication on Progress 2018 LIFE BELOW WATER Communication on Progress 2018 LIFE ON LAND Communication on Progress 2018 LIFE ON LAND LIFE ON LAND 15.1 By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and dry-lands, in line with obligations under international agreements. We requested that our sub-consultants update their standard landscape specifications to prohibit the use of herbicides, pesticides and artificial fertilizers on all projects that AS+GG is involved with. This helps to protect pollinator species, native plants and protect water bodies and water courses from pollution. 15.5 Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species Our designs have a strong focus on the creation of green space, use of native or climate adapted vegetation and restoration of natural biodiversity. We always develop Key Performance Indicators around green area ratio and accessibility to green space. On virtually all of our projects, the intended outcome is to leave the project with more green space than it started off with. Communication on Progress 2018 SUMMARY SUMMARY Martha Thorne, Executive Director of The Pritzker Architecture Prize, and Paloma Durán, Director of the Sustainable Development Goals Fund (SDGF) wrote that “Architects can directly shape the outcomes of a design process to the betterment of a community’s overall quality of life, sustainability, social equity, health and resilience’. This statement echoes the fundamental beliefs of our firm and it is reflected in our day-to-day business operations and the products of our designs. We intend to issue a major update to our office environmental policy during the final quarter of 2019. It will include new initiatives around indoor environmental quality as waste as waste reduction and reporting procedures. One of the reasons for choosing to report on the SDGs was to establish a baseline for future reporting and to guide the development of our AS+GG 2025 sustainability road-map, which will establish targets and an implementation plan for how we work and how our designs will perform within the next 6 years. We look forward to presenting our 2025 plan in the next Communication on Progress Report. Communication on Progress 2018 Communication on Progress 2018
