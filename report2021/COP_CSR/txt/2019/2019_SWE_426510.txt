Service development: Our customers show greater interest in housing-related services and digital solutions. In order to meet the need, we develop these types of services in JM@home. Smart homes: Technological development is progressing ­rapidly when it comes to smart homes. Companies such as Apple and Google are investing heavily in the area. JM is following these changes closely and has several test projects underway in order to evaluate both customer satisfaction and the technology itself. INNOVATIVE SOLUTION JM Labs is an innovation lab that has the goal of engaging employees in an ongoing and transparent idea workshop on how we can find innovative solutions, simplify life for our customers and meet the challenges of the future. The results have exceeded our expectations. There is a pent-up need among employees to be able to share more ideas and lessons learned and co-create the products and services of the future. Promising concepts are presented for Executive Management, and, if they are considered relevant, are adopted into the regular development processes to be included in JM’s products or services. 12 J M A N N U A L R E P O RT 2 0 1 8 N E W C O N S T R U C T I O N – A D V A N TA G E S / jm ’ s offer Five reasons to choose new production and JM SUSTAINABLE IN THE LONG RUN The annual customer satisfaction survey 1) in the housing develNewly built residential units meet very high environmental and opment industry measures our ability to be able to fulfill our energy demands and work environment requirements both promises. 70 percent of all housing customers in the industry during the construction period and in the completed final prodfeel that housing developers fulfill their commitments, and 81 uct.

The ambitious sustainability targets and our deliveries are presented on page 37. A SAFE TRANSACTION AND SAFE LIVING ENVIRONMENT Trygg Bostadsrättsmarknad i Sverige is an industry ­initiative to strengthen consumer protection on the tenant-owner apartment market. JM is one of several established market participants who has seen the need for transparency and comparability for housing associations and their economy. Companies that choose to join this association and have their tenant-owned apartment projects approved undertake to report critical KPIs, for example loans per m2 and residential unit, that the tenant-owners association only has one clear counterpart and the composition of the tenant-owners association’s board of directors. This initiative benefits households, serious housing producers and lenders and contributes to the development of an efficient market for newly produced homes. Advantage of JM’s new production: JM offers a security package that for example protects the home buyer from double housing costs if they have not successfully sold their previous home prior to occupancy. We also want our customers to feel secure in their home, in the immediate vicinity and with our delivery of a finished home. We are therefore working with good lighting in the immediate surroundings and open and bright common spaces that foster social contact, while also having a very structured production that ensures high delivery precision. 1) A survey made by Prognoscentret, an independent market analysis ­company with focus on the Nordic construction and property markets.

Freedom in his first apartment As a navigating officer, Tilly Nersäter sails all over the world. Despite all of the exciting places he is able to visit, it is his newly built JM apartment in Kungs­ladugård in Gothenburg where he has found a home. “It is so fantastic not to have parents at home! That is how I feel every day when I come home to my apartment. Living with my mom and dad at the age of 26… I didn't dare invite anyone over or even mention where I live! I now have furniture in my apartment, so it looks like someone lives here. I have put up lamps, gotten my bedroom closet in order with extra shelving and found my dream sofa on the Internet.” “I submitted an interest notification for the apartment when I was still studying to be a navigation officer. I liked the building because the facade was going to be similar to the protected Governor’s Building in the Majorna district. And I also liked the spacious layout.” “After I graduated, the building was still not slated to be finished for another two years. In other words, I had two years to save the money for the downpayment – 15 percent – and a little more if I wanted to make any changes to the apartment.

Adjustment of tax from previous years for 2017 referred to a utilization of previously unreported loss carry-forwards from JM’s closed operations in Denmark. The Danish company was merged with the Swedish company in 2016, and according to the Group deduction regulations, previous losses in the Danish operations are deductible from profits in the Swedish operations. While waiting for a final decision from the Swedish tax Agency, JM had not previously reported any deferred tax assets attributable to these loss carry-forwards. Non-taxable revenue for 2017 referred primarily to the sale of the shares in Småa AB. The effective tax rate according to IFRS is 21.2 percent (15.3). The effective tax rate according to segment reporting is 20.9 percent (14.9). The difference between the effective tax rate according to segment reporting and the nominal tax rate of 22 percent is primarily explained by the table above. 90 JM ANN UAL REPORT 2018 G R O U P / notes note 9 Earnings and dividend per share Basic Diluted Outstanding number of shares and instruments with potential dilutive effects 2018 2017 2018 2017 At the end of 2018 JM had 69,583,262 outstanding shares (69,583,262).

Cash flow beyond the strategic two-year period is extrapolated based on the ­following assumptions: • Estimated operating profit or loss based on the previous year’s results and expectations of future market developments note 12 Participations in associated companies • Growth rate of 2 percent (2) in order to extrapolate cash flow beyond the 2018 2017 strategic period. The growth rate is a conservative assumption of the operation’s Accumulated acquisition value long-term growth, not exceeding growth for the industry as a whole Opening balance, January 1 1 15 • Discount rate before tax is 8 percent (8), which is based on the JM Group’s averSales – – 14 age cost of capital before tax, while taking operation-specific data into account. On December 31 1 1 Sensitivity analysis If the estimated operating profit after the end of the strategy period had been 5 percent lower than the management’s assessment, the recoverable amount would decrease by 4 percent. If the estimated growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the strategy period had been 50 percent lower than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 12 percent. If the estimated average cost of capital applied for the discounted cash flow had been 3 percentage points greater than the basic assumption, the recoverable amount would decrease by 32 percent. A sensitivity analysis of the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to exceed about 25 percent (21) before the need for impairment would arise. In all cases, the sensitivity analysis above shows a surplus (i.e. that the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying amount). None of the hypothetical cases above should lead to impairment of goodwill for the Norwegian business. 92 JM ANN UAL REPORT 2018 G R O U P / notes note 13 Participations in joint operations and associated companies Specification of Parent Company’s shares and participation in joint operations and associated companies Carrying amount, SEK 000's Number of shares and Company CIN Domicile ­ articipations p % of capital 2018 2017 Adolfsbergs Brunns AB 1) 556303-8685 Örebro 340 33 34 34 Dockan Exploatering AB 1) 556594-2645 Malmö 50,000 33 16,834 16,834 Exploateringsbolaget Högmora KB 1) 916643-6254 Stockholm 1 25 31 31 Fastighetsbolaget Glasberga KB 1) 916643-1842 Södertälje 1 25 101 101 Glasberga Fastighets AB 1) 556361-0707 Södertälje 1,000 25 100 100 HB Silverdal Exploatering 2) 969674-5802 Solna 1 1 Högmora Exploaterings AB 1) 556395-0707 Stockholm 1,000 25 100 100 Kvarnholmen Utveckling AB 1) 556710-5514 Stockholm 50,000 50 165,886 165,886 Kvibergstaden Exploatering HB 1) 969731-1695 Gothenburg 1 50 1 1 Mälarstrandens Utvecklings AB 1) 556695-5414 Västerås 44 44 2,200 2,200 Södra Centrum Krokslätt HB 1) 969777-2144 Stockholm 5,200 65 5,200 5,200 Carrying amount, December 31 190,488 190,488 1) Joint operations 2) Unlimited liability Specification of the Group’s other holdings of shares and participations in joint operations and associated companies Carrying amount, SEK 000's Number of shares and Company CIN Domicile p ­ articipations % of capital 2018 2017 Fastighets AB Kranlyftet 556829-3251 Lidingö 250 50 135,226 135,226 Fjellgata 30 AS, Norway 997484983 Oslo 100 50 307 2,002 Fjellgata 30 KS, Norway 997485009 Oslo 45 45 1,106 7,207 Täby Park Exploatering AB 556833-6555 Stockholm 500 50 421,473 161,500 Grefsen Utvikling AS, Norway 982913209 Oslo 500 50 25,600 25,025 Hans Nielsen Haugesgate 50 AS, Norway 987719427 Oslo 60,000 50 23,958 23,420 Husebyplatået AS, Norway 913864948 Oslo 5,000 50 512 501 Larvik Saneringsselskap AS, Norway 918044051 Larvik 100 50 248 242 Lillestrøm Kvartal 37 AS, Norway 935267269 Lillestrøm 75 50 7,680 7,508 Lillestrøm Kvartal 37 Næring AS, Norway 919196416 Oslo 300 50 31 30 Merbraine, Belgium 450160865 Brussels 625 50 318 304 Noreveien 26 AS, Norway 990351465 Oslo 10 50 90 88 Son Utvikling AS, Norway 990341419 Oslo 23,050 50 12,575 12,292 Spireaveien 6 Utvikling AS, Norway 998015340 Oslo 50 50 520 2,511 Spireaveien 6 Utvikling KS, Norway 998015375 Oslo 45 45 1,835 9,001 Strømmen Sentrum AS, Norway 1) 911662256 Strømmen – – – 7,007 Torstvet Utvikling AS, Norway 959639159 Larvik 5,000 50 11,818 11,553 Carrying amount, December 31 643,297 405,417 Reclassification in the Group – 642,614 – 595,222 The participations’ carrying amount in the Group, at end of the year 683 683 1) During the year, 100% of the shares were acquired in JM Norway AS, Norway.

According to the stated objectives for capital structure, the equity ratio shall be at least 35 percent according to segment reporting. The equity ratio target is a simplified consequence of a more extensive analysis where shareholders’ equity has been allocated to the different asset classes and types of operations in the balance sheet, taking assessed operating risk into account.

The amount of the provision is primarily based on the number of residential units per project and is charged to the project upon conclusion. The majority of the warranty provisions have a duration of around two to three years after the start of the project. Since the effect of when in time payment occurs is immaterial, expected future ­payments are not calculated at present value.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 71–108 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of December 31 2018 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of December 31 2018 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and the balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Our audit approach Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. We tailored our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the JM group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which JM operates. In a business such as JMs, our risk assessment is particularly influenced by the impact of the Board of Directors’ and management’s estimates and judgements on the financial statements. We have assessed the highest risk for misstatements in the financial statements to be the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition in the ongoing projects – in both the residential development business and the construction business. In addition, we have identified a number of other risks that also reflect components of estimates and judgements. Amongst those are warranty provisions, valuation of development and project properties and disputes. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of the Board of Directors’ and management overriding internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Based on the risk assessment the central audit team developed an audit strategy according to which the group audit has focused on the large components JM Residential Stockholm, JM Residential Sweden, JM Construction and the Norwegian operations within JM International which all have been subject to a so-called full audit. For the Finnish operation within JM International, specific procedures have been performed primarily for ongoing projects. With respect to JM Property Development and the building rights in Belgium, the examination has focused on the book values of project and development properties. The central audit team performs the audit of the Swedish components and issues, based on the audit strategy, instructions to the Norwegian and Finnish audit teams. The central team also audits relevant aspects of and controls over the JM group’s common information systems, including SAP ECC. The results of this examination are shared with local teams. Materiality The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. J M A N N U A L R E P O RT 2 0 1 8 109 A uditor ’ s report Key audit matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Other information than the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts This document also contains other information than the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1–70 and pages 122–135. The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion on this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The Board of Directors and the President are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and the consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, the Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern J M A N N U A L R E P O RT 2 0 1 8 111 A uditor ’ s report basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the President intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The audit committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts is available on Revisors­inspektionen’s website www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor’s report. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the President of JM AB (publ) for the year 2018 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the President be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for Opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The President shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfil the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President in any material respect: • has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or • in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the administration is available on Revisorsinspektionen’s website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar.

The most common causes/risks of injury in 2018 were same-level falls (tripping, slipping), ­contact with sharp objects and injuries from self-handled objects. The most common types of injury in 2018 were crushing, squeezing or other soft tissue injuries, sores and sprains, twists or strains. 2) The number of leave-of-absence days due to occupational injuries has gone down despite the increase in the number of injuries, which means that injuries have become milder in nature. 3) The sharp increase in reported near-accidents is due to the digital reporting tool (online deviation system for building industry BIA). 4) Certain skills, for example architects, consultants and different types of subcontractors, are hired in the development projects. 5) Data is obtained from JM’s personnel system. 130 JM ANN UAL REPORT 2018 A B O U T T H E S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O RT / G R I I N D E X Facts and KPIs for sustainability, cont. 2018 2017 2016 RESOURCE EFFICIENCY, Sweden, 306-2 Construction waste to recycling Tons (Part of) 6,277 (58%) 6,465 (55%) 4,980 (50%) Construction waste to incineration Tons (Part of) 3,073 (29%) 3,752 (32%) 3,539 (36%) Construction waste to landfill Tons (Part of) 439 (4%) 647 (5%) 529 (5%) Unsorted waste Tons (Part of) 925 (9%) 884 (8%) 898 (9%) Hazardous waste Tons (Part of) 37 (0.3%) 35 (0,3%) 17 (0.2%) Total amount of construction waste 1) Tons 10,751 11,783 9,962 SMALL ENVIRONMENTAL IMAPCT, Sweden JM’s carbon dioxide emissions, 305-1, 305-2, 305-3 Tons CO2e Scope 1 4,241 4,775 4,708 Scope 2 1,481 1,428 1,754 Scope 3 2) 13,161 16,138 16,701 Total 18,883 22,341 23,163 Newly produced homes’ carbon dioxide emissions from energy Kg CO2e/m2 UFA and year 2 4 4 consumption, CRE3 Carbon dioxide intensity from new production, CRE4 Tons CO2e/turnover (SEK m) 1.2 1.3 1.5 Carbon dioxide intensity from new production, CRE4 Tons CO2e/produced 6.58 3) 6.35 6.43 residential unit Newly produced homes’ estimated energy consumption, CRE1 kWh/m2 A-temp 56 60 66 1) Statistics from our waste contractors.The waste is classified by the waste contractor and reported in fractions in accordance with the guidelines of the Ecocycle Council. 2) JM includes in Scope 3 material transports to worksites, rented machinery, business travel and energy consumption in our newly constructed residential units for the first two years.
