Communication On Progress | 2018 Dear Friends, We have much pleasure in submitting our seventh progress report on United Nation Global Compact regarding 2018, it was a very exciting and transformative year for us as we can take significant steps forward to be a more responsible industry leader and to grow more diverse businesses. In 2018, with the clear commitment to sustainable business development, we could bring forward a range of new innovative products and two products won the distinguished ASEAN Outstanding Engineering Achievement Award conferred by ASEAN Federation of Engineering Associations (AFEO), for their environmental friendliness and energy saving property. Moreover, as we are continually improving our occupational safety & health support to our workforce, we could achieve the prestigious U AYE HAN nd 2 ASEAN-OSHNET Excellent Award conferred by ASEAN Managing Director UPG Paint & Coating Co., Ltd. OSHNETWORK for our high performance in occupational safety and health. Year 2018 was also a transformative year for us because we have been expanding and our company UPG Co., Ltd. was changed to a holding structure to act as a financial investment company and growing the downstream subsidiary companies. Our paint manufacturing business, representing the COP report in the previous years, is being carried by a new subsidiary named UPG P&C Co., Ltd. However, apart from the new company name, all the management, operation, resources and personnel remain unchanged. We have explained further in this report. Furthermore, we could also take some significant steps in our CSR aligned with the UN’s SDGs. For all these milestones, we would like to express our appreciation to our stakeholders. We reaffirm that we will stick to the Principles of United Nation Global Compact and will take our best effort to improve further in future. Sincerely, Aye Han Managing Director UPG Paint & Coating Co.,Ltd. Page 1 Communication On Progress | 2018 In 2018, our company United Paints Group Co., Ltd.

The risk/impact assessment is carried out not only for the production process line, but also for the maintenance operations for emergency situations. Then corrective and preventive actions are taken into account for hazard/aspect identification. The assessment for hazard and aspect were revised in April 2015 in order to cover all area and process. In the second edition assessment registration handbook “Content List of Hazard-Risk Assessment and Aspect-Impact Assessment”, the numbers of total assessments increased A-60 to 70 assessments ( All are A-01 ~ A-70). As necessary assessment for additional process or new locations, related assessment are being also revised or added, presently the total number of assessments are up to A-82. This assessment is based on the plant/location, process/ procedures, OHS and EC describing as revised/review or additional or new assessment. Waste water generated from the water based paint production plant, QC and R&D laboratories is being collected and treated at the waste water treatment plant. Effluent water quality from treatment plant is tested before it is discharged into the public drain. If it meets the Proposed National Standard (Ministry of Health) for discharge, it is discharged into the public drain. If it does not meet the standard it is sent back to the treatment plant. The biological treatment process has been promoted in 2018, and currently it was being taken as test run and commissioning as below photos. . . . Waste Water Treatment System UPG Paint & Coating Co.,Ltd.

Frequency inverter drives can save energy about 40% of ordinary motors. Electrical utilization depends on the machines utilization at production plant. The new water based plant started production in July 2010. Due to the operation of new added machineries, the electrical energy consumption increased from July 2010.Similarly, solvent based production line was also transferred to the new plant in July 2011 and electrical energy consumption increased because of some new addition of equipment and facilities. In mid of 2018, UPG P&C is aiming to start the implementation of industrial energy efficiency project targeting to achieve the ISO50001 certification. UPG Paint & Coating Co.,Ltd. Page 20 Communication On Progress | 2018 After getting the training for industrial energy efficiency improvement conducted by UNIDO, UPG P&C has being introduced to set up SEUs and EnPOs. The statistical analysis was taken and the target for next two years was established as the following. “The objective and target for CY 2017 to 2019 is that energy intensity will be reduced by 5% according to the model of baseline data of CY 2017.” Data and Model Baseline Data = Year 2017 Reported Data = January to December for 2018 and 2019 CUSUM = January to December for 2018 Model = Baseline Data Year 2017 and All Product Variable including CDD, and At 2nd step, P value of Emulsion Product and Solvent & NC are satisfied and model is taken as below; The followings are CUSUM graph and improvement for energy saving for January to December for 2018. CUSUM trend shows the decreasing energy consumption and energy intensity but not gradually decreasing trend. Energy intensity EnPI ratio is 0.991 and energy saving units are 22907 KW according to the model with baseline data CY 2017. Improvement is 0.872% for this reported period.

Page 21 Communication On Progress | 2018 In order to help cut GHG emissions, temperature of our office except for training rooms is set above 28 degree Celsius in the summer. Considering our working environment conditions, we start with small and easy steps such as putting office and electronic devices into low power mode, turning off computers and printers when not in use, and turning off the light during lunch time. With unprecedented high oil prices today, UPG P&C is saving energy: its office temperature is maintained at appropriate levels, air conditioning facilities are managed in an efficient manner and cooling /heating facilities in the summer and winter season are operated and maintained efficiently. These efforts enable UPG P&C to reduce its oil consumption and contribute to cutting GHG emissions. UPG P&C used eco-friendly interior materials for environmental considerations. The building also used water paints instead of oil paints on the wall. Monitoring of air quality at the water based paint production plant, was carried out in 2012 by the methods of Area Sampler and Personal Sampler. Area sampler testing method shows how much particulate matter is spreading in the air at workplace environment. Personal sampler testing method shows how much the worker may inhale the particulate matter from the ambient air. Measurement of Result Unit Reference Value Dust Analyst 13.6.2012 14.6.2012 Particulate Matter 3 2.77 1.44 mg/m (Area Sampler) TWA (Time Waited Average) = 3 5 mg./m Particulate Matter 2.77 0.56 mg/m3 (Personal Sampler) UPG Paint & Coating Co.,Ltd. Page 22 Communication On Progress | 2018 Dust measurement was conducted at the powder transferring area on 13/6/12 and at the packaging area on 14/06/2012. The results reveal that the particulate matter was higher at the powder transferring area but in both places, it was significantly lesser than the reference values. In fact, UPG P&C has been utilizing closed vessel types and dust collectors for the filling process of chemicals in powder form into the mixing vessels. Personal Sampler Area Sampler Method Method In April 2014, ambient air quality measures were performed at near Factory Canteen area and outside the production plant using the HIGH VOLUME SAMPLER with the aid of the Occupational Health Division, Ministry of Health. All the result meet with WHO air quality Guideline. UPG Paint & Coating Co.,Ltd.
