2018 ANNUAL REPORT ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (ESG) A vida é imprevisível e, acredite, isso é muito bom. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT This document is part of the Company’s Annual Report and presents, adopting an integrated approach, our main Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) indicators, complementing the economic and financial ones. This document is based on the guidelines and principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), of the United Nation’s Global Compact and the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI). It also considered the alignment of initiatives and their contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). In 2016, following the concept framework for Integrated Reporting, proposed by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), we revised our data collection process, consolidating indicators, indexes and reports, which started to be reported according to five capitals: Financial, Human, Intellectual, Social, and Relationship.

This change is the result of the pursuit of integration and transparency in the process of communication with our customers, shareholders, employees, brokers, and the society. As a recognition of its management practices and the integration of sustainability into the business agenda, SulAmérica achieved important recognitions and became part of the portfolio of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in the emerging markets portfolio (DJSI Emerging Markets) and it remained in the FTSE4Good, elaborated by FTSE (Financial Times Stock Exchange) Russel. 2 WHO WE ARE SulAmérica operates in the Health and Dental, Automobile, and other Property and Casualty insurance lines.
