Energy is integral to growth, prosperity and sustainability on the continent. In 2018, Lekela moved three projects into construction and expanded our pipeline of projects, demonstrating our capacity to transform energy ideas into operational reality. This skill remains critical in Africa to deliver competitively priced, clean, reliable projects quickly and at scale. Long-term power, long-term prosperity Providing electricity to countries in Africa is only part of the supports local education, enterprise and environmental equation. We develop our projects while applying rigorous programmes. These initiatives help address skills gaps, create environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices with or revive sustainable livelihoods, and tackle environmental the aim of delivering net positive environmental and social challenges. impacts.

Our core objective is to deliver demonstrating how we turned our commitments made in 2017 assets that provide clean, reliable power and we achieve into measurable performance.

This creates the right conditions for success, With this approach, we intend to champion sustainability while by avoiding and mitigating environmental and social risks and working to deliver Africa the energy it needs and, in doing maximising the transformative benefits we can deliver across so, empower communities and protect the environment and society and to the communities we operate in. climate for future generations. This approach was key in Lekela’s success in bringing three wind farms totalling over 400 MW under construction in 2018. Parc Eolien Taiba N’Diaye in Senegal will be West Africa’s largest wind farm when it starts operations. In South Africa, construction is well underway on two sites in the Northern and Western Capes, which in 2020 will join our three operational “We intend to champion sustainability assets that have spent 2018 delivering zero-carbon power to the grid.

This is key for a continent in demand of affordable power. In addition to improvements in renewable technology, falling costs of battery storage are presenting new and innovative business opportunities to explore in our markets. Historically, wind and solar intermittency has restricted the integration of renewables at scale. Across Africa, energy storage can now provide the solution to meet this challenge in a competitive and reliable manner. 4 • Lekela Power B.V. • 2018 Sustainability Report Lekela and the Lekela aims to deliver utility-scale power projects to increase the share of renewable energy generated SDGs with our in Africa.

Construction Lekela successfully completed the financing of three wind projects in 2018. Two of these are under construction in South Africa, with construction progressing rapidly towards the delivery of turbine components in 2019. In Senegal we are building the country’s first utility-scale wind farm. Developed in three phases, Parc Eolien Taiba N’Diaye will be delivering clean power to Senegal’s national grid as early as the end of 2019.

Our workforce has our full support and we commit to participatory engagement with all employees and their representatives. All employees can also access our grievance mechanism, meaning any issues our workforce raises are dealt with quickly and transparently. This facilitates accessibility, accounts for cultural sensitivities and imposes no costs or retribution on the concerned parties. Local employment Lekela’s policy is to hire locally wherever we can, thereby maximising the involvement of communities in the construction and operation of our projects. Similarly, we work closely with our contractors to train workers to participate in construction and operations, where possible. Local procurement To positively impact the wider regional economy, Lekela’s procurement process uses suitable local businesses to establish and maintain our value chain. This should help our projects deliver positive socioeconomic impacts and provide lasting employment Partnering to deliver local opportunities.

Our stakeholders include the communities in which we operate and the governments and partners we work with. We believe that an ethical approach should be at the centre of sustainable business. We embed ethical standards in our governance framework, internal policies and professional standards; these in turn form the basis on which we engage with our stakeholders. This gives us confidence that we can deliver the most benefits possible while avoiding or minimising any negative impacts to the communities in which we operate. It also ensures adherence to consistent environmental and social standards across our portfolio of operations.
