Sanitation Campaign SGO supported youth and community organizations in a major sanitation campaign to clean up neighbouring communities. The campaign was successful in cleaning multiple villages. The day dedicated to the village of Sabodala saw a particularly large number of young people mobilized, as well as many SGO employees with equipment helping in the efforts. “The partnership with SGO, who supported us financially and with equipment, allowed us to organize and succeed in this campaign of sanitation in the villages. We are thankful.” CHEIKHOU SOUMARE, CHAIRMAN OF THE MUNICIPAL YOUTH COUNCIL OF SABODALA AND SABODALA EMPLOYEE 2018 RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 31 performance 32 TERANGA GOLD CORPORATION 13 indicators 2018 RESPONSIBILITY 2018 RESPONSIBILITYREPORT REPORT 33 SGO: ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION PILLAR THEME INDICATOR UNITS 2016 2017 2018 2018 US$ US$ US$ XOF Total economic contributions to Senegal $/XOF (000s) 205,795 203,648 193,246 107,086,507 Payments to government $/XOF (000s) 55,347 55,800 43,551 23,861,298 Economic contribution Local payroll $/XOF (000s) 10,005 10,570 8,865 4,946,513 to Senegal Local procurement $/XOF (000s) 138,976 136,294 139,688 77,639,606 CSR contributions $/XOF (000s) 1,467 984 1,142 639,090 Income tax1 $/XOF (000s) 13,873 20,184 8,115 4,114,826 Withholding tax $/XOF (000s) 4,178 4,386 4,661 2,597,486 Direct taxes Business tax1 $/XOF (000s) 1,206 1,302 14 8,145 Registration fees $/XOF (000s) 1,034 2,705 – – Non-recoverable VAT1 $/XOF (000s) 3,713 2,750 3,001 1,663,059 Indirect taxes Customs duties1 $/XOF (000s) 3,765 3,997 4,094 2,275,589 Fuel taxes1, 2 $/XOF (000s) 4,131 4,811 4,469 2,481,746 Mining royalties $/XOF (000s) 21,080 13,372 15,936 8,910,427 Gold reserves $/XOF (000s) – – – – Other Water and forestry $/XOF (000s) – 173,605 180,337 101,670– payments Dividends paid in advance $/XOF (000s) – – – – Social security and pension $/XOF (000s) 344 417 472 262,102 OJVG advance royalty $/XOF (000s) 1,228 877 1,481 827,487 Advance royalties ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION Gora advance royalty $/XOF (000s) – – – – Local institutional support $/XOF (000s) 21 33 26 14,560 Institutional Direction of mines and geology support fund $/XOF (000s) 494 514 819 447,731 support Ministry of environment support fund $/XOF (000s) 250 250 254 140,834 Foreign suppliers $/XOF (000s) 30,424 27,944 40,886 22,724,736 Total paid to local suppliers (registered in Senegal): $/XOF (000s) 138,976 136,294 139,688 77,639,606 Procurement Subsidiaries of foreign companies $/XOF (000s) 99,828 97,619 98,756 54,889,303 Suppliers with more than 50% capital from Senegal $/XOF (000s) 39,148 38,675 40,932 22,750,303 Utilities $/XOF (000s) 36,357 39,671 45,431 25,250,880 Mining services and mining equipment $/XOF (000s) 54,809 53,978 49,640 27,590,273 General goods and supplies $/XOF (000s) 9,930 9,160 9,240 5,135,659 Transport and logistics $/XOF (000s) 12,462 7,482 7,996 4,444,235 Local Staffing $/XOF (000s) 6,722 8,120 7,779 4,323,625 procurement by sector Other B2B services $/XOF (000s) 4,097 5,002 7,106 3,949,566 Industrial equipment, spare parts and maintenance $/XOF (000s) 9,704 8,240 10,158 5,645,890 Vehicles: rental, spare parts and maintenance $/XOF (000s) 1,030 526 576 320,145 Construction $/XOF (000s) 3,590 2,985 1,030 572,481 Various $/XOF (000s) 274 319 731 406,295 Total contribution to Social Fund $/XOF 1,330,327 879,045 907,675 509,633,305 Water and sanitation $/XOF 111,104 75,502 106,470 58,559,950 Income generation $/XOF 152,652 73,708 74,786 42,799,657 Social Fund Health $/XOF 105,627 116,270 219,349 124,780,850 Education $/XOF 270,925 302,206 241,432 135,184,522 Governance and local planning $/XOF 614,555 257,943 9,087 4,762,017 Sport and culture $/XOF 75,464 53,417 256,550 143,546,309 Gora Fund Gora Fund contributions $/XOF 123,776 71,999 207,256 114,665,193 Donations Donations $/XOF 12,944 33,411 26,764 14,791,898 1.
