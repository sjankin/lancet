Letter from the Chairman Welcome, It is a pleasure to present Tag Systems’ Sustainability Report 2017, the result of a new analysis and reflection where we highlight and account for our commitment and development in the social, environmental, economic and ethical areas. For us, it is an exercise of in transparency that enables us to moves closer towards the heart and soul of the company, which is not only what we do, but also how and why we do it. Once again, we renew our commitment to the United National Global Compact as shown with this report, demonstrating our willingness to consolidate, develop and implement good practices that are aligned with our activity and that help us to be more sustainable. At Tag Systems we believe that sustainability leads the way. As part of the exercise of publishing this first report drafted as per the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, we have aimed to have first-hand knowledge of the topics that our stakeholders deem important to make Tag Systems a more sustainable company, topics we cover in the report. This is highly valuable information for establishing future strategic lines with the capacity to meet the expectations of all those with whom we work. But in our day-to-day operation we do not just want to respond to the needs we have as a company, but also to the global environmental and social agenda set out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). From the essence of our activity and with the willingness of those of us who are part of Tag Systems, we contribute to the different goals defined in this ambitious agenda. Special mention of this shall appear throughout this report. As mentioned above, sustainability leads the way, but it is the excellence that defines how we must move forward. At Tag Systems, we promote initiatives of added value throughout our value chain. With our employees, we are committed to their continuous improvement through training, professional development and offering them a safe working environment. With customers, we guarantee maximum quality and security of all our products and services. We want them to be completely satisfied and to see us as a trustworthy and competitive supplier in terms of quality, price and sustainability. With our suppliers, we are moving forward to make them participants in our commitment with society and the environment. All these initiatives show our commitment to sustainability. We are aware of the important challenges that await us over the next few years, but we shall know how to face them with determination, responsibility and success. I hope you find this Sustainability Report of interest. Joaquim Miró Castillo Chairman Sustainability Report 2017 3 2.

Joining forces with strategic alliances Tag Systems’ alliances enable us to be part of various networks that enhance what we are and what we do as a company, as well as sharing experiences and knowledge of future challenges in our market and the economic and business context. Tag Systems is part of ICMA. As the main international card manufacturers association, its mission is to promote the whole card industry, together with the value of its products and services, providing an independent forum for sharing knowledge and ideas. Tag Systems is a member of PIMEC, a social agent in Catalonia, Spain that participates in work committees and panels with public administrations and representative social agents, as well as regularly giving opinions on legislative initiatives and public policies and making proposals to defend and represent the interests of SMEs and the self-employed. Tag Systems is a member of CEA, a representative body of Andorran business associations which actively liaises with the Andorran business network, institutions and Andorran society in general. Since 2012, Tag Systems has complied with the Achilles qualification system, which arose from the consumers’ need to demand greater control over supply chains, not just from a business performance perspective, but also from ethical and environmental standards. Sustainability Report 2017 10 4. Sustainability leads the way 4.1. Sustainable and responsible management 4.2. Relevant sustainability topics 4.3. Commitment to the local community SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS INTEGRATED IN TAG SYSTEMS The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) – global, inclusive and ambitious – are what guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. In the different sections of this Sustainability Report, we have included the SDG aligned with who we are and what we do at Tag Systems. As a result of the dialogue with the stakeholders set out in this chapter, the sustainability topics that are relevant to us have been validated. This shall enable strategic planning with greater awareness of our ability to generate positive impacts on people as well as the natural environment. Sustainability Report 2017 11 4.1. Sustainable and responsible management With the goal of generating solid growth of Tag Systems, we base our actions on responsible criteria that reinforce our links with stakeholders, ensure our competitiveness and promote the creation of long-term value. Our commitment to sustainability is present in all departments and activities: from product marketing to our employees’ wellbeing, via responsible purchasing of raw materials from suppliers and environmentally efficient production processes. Commitment to the United National Global Compact In 2011,Tag Systems made a commitment to the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact regarding human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption. Human rights Tag Systems respects human rights in each of its activities and positively values its partners, suppliers and customers’ support of the Global Compact or other declarations respecting this principle. Labour Tag Systems respects all national and international principles and regulations relating to labour rights. Non-discrimination labour policies of all kinds are applicable to Tag Systems, all kinds of forced labour are rejected, as well as any kind of work that puts any human or labour right in danger. Environment We assess the environmental impact of our company and manage the prevention of environmental risks. Anti-corruption Tag Systems rejects all activities with signs of corruption, such as extortion and bribery. Since 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The 17 Goals of this ambitious Agenda guide many business actions, particularly when the activity not only generates local impacts but also global ones. Sustainability Report 2017 12 The consolidation of Tag Systems in the international market and future plans demand we deeply reflect on the role we shall have to positively contribute to achieving the SDG. In this sense, throughout this document we have indicated the SDG to which we contribute through our activity. Our stakeholders Each of our stakeholders has an important role in the goals we set. We aim to maintain relationships of trust with each of them to find solutions to common challenges. Aware of the intrinsic value of each of our stakeholders, we establish channels of communication through which we exchange impressions on any aspect related with our activity. Dialogue with stakeholders is key to detecting improvements in the strategic design of the business, as well as in the design of specific actions that may provide solutions to the expectations of the different groups.

Material sustainability topics The initial identification of the potentially material sustainability topics for Tag Systems was based on the following information sources: • GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative • Sustainability Topics for Sectors: What do stakeholders want to know? of the GRI (Software and Service; Technology Hardware and Equipment) • Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) • RobecoSAM regarding IT & Software Services • European Non-Financial Information Directive • Sectorial benchmarking Later, we carried out an exercise to identify and prioritise the material sustainability topics for our stakeholders (indirect external analysis through a consultancy of senior and middle managers who are in contact with different stakeholders) and those that are significant due to their impact on the business (direct internal analysis in a participatory session with the Management Team). During the participatory session with the Management Team, each of the potentially material topics was reflected and agreed upon bearing in mind three factors: Boundary, identifying whether the impact is produced inside and/or outside Tag Systems; involvement, to identify whether Tag Systems is the direct or indirect cause of the impact (through its business relationships); and the level of importance. For indirect prioritisation by the corresponding people, first they were sent a questionnaire and information on all the material topics. Afterwards, a meeting was held with them all to comment and discuss the scope of each topic and the result of their answers. Material sustainability topics Economy and strategy Environment Social Economic performance Materials Employment Anti-corruption Emissions Occupational Health and safety Environmental Training and education compliance Diversity and equal opportunities / Nondiscrimination Socioeconomic compliance Customer Health and Safety Customer privacy Customer communication, satisfaction and Quality The social scope covers many material topics linked to employees and customers. This vision, shared by the Management Team as well as the stakeholders, emphasises the relationship of Tag Systems with people. Sustainability Report 2017 14 4.3. Commitment to the local community Tag Systems’ actions in the local community are carried out through initiatives that enable the projection of corporate values, such as teamwork, or which allow it to be an active participant in contributing solutions to local challenges. In 2017, we have sponsored individual and team sports through, for example, the participation of a Tag Systems team in races around the country (AnyósPark Fun Run and Andorra Ultra Trail Vallnord) and we have made direct donations to Andorran NGO as well as indirect ones through the Andorran Business Confederation (CEA). We also have collaboration agreements with the University of Andorra and professional training centres in the country through which they offer work experience so students can complete their training and improve their marks before their subsequent incorporation into the labour market. Tag Systems aims to be an inclusive company in 2018, a necessary commitment to offer employment opportunities to a sector of the population that often has additional difficulties to show their value.

Sustainability Report 2017 21 5.5. Suppliers, a key factor At Tag Systems, we know that to guarantee the correct development of our activity and quality products and services, it is essential to have suppliers from diverse spheres of activity and categories with whom we maintain long-term relationships of trust. (103-2, 103-3) This means not just having suppliers with a high technical and quality performance, but who also comply and are aligned with the criteria we have defined, among them environmental and social criteria; for example, the provision of a certified environmental management system. We periodically update our supplier database to incorporate compliance with new environmental, quality and occupational safety certificates. The criteria defined when choosing suppliers are: • Provision of certificates and/or systems for quality, environment and occupational health and safety • Prioritisation of local suppliers • Environmentally-friendly products • Technical adaptability of the product The activities for which Tag Systems is supplied with products and services are: raw materials for production, machinery maintenance services, transport services, installations, IT services, consultancy and cleaning services. Regarding the materials used in the manufacture of our cards, we are aware of their importance, so we choose the best raw materials via a strict approval protocol. Almost all our raw materials come from European countries and, regarding services, we give priority to local suppliers, from Andorra. Every year the Purchasing Department is commissioned with monitoring the suppliers who directly impact the quality of the end product. Monitoring is done via the control of external supply, as per the protocol described in the purchasing protocols policy. In parallel, the Quality Department monitors the arrival of materials where any imperfection or incorrect supply of material is detected, thus avoiding future problems during production. If any defect is discovered, the Quality Department opens a “Quality Non-conformity” file for the supplier, information that is later used in the monitoring. Finally, suppliers are periodically informed of the results obtained from the assessment. Purchases as per supplier’s origin 2017 Sustainability Report 2017 22 6.

Sustainability Report 2017 24 In 2017, we have introduced some improvements and changes that show Tag Systems’ commitment to guarantee quality employment. • Flexible working hours in the offices. • Birthdays should be a special day, so we have introduced a paid half-day off. • Breaks are important so the break areas have been improved and now have free healthy snacks, such as water and teas, among other things. • Healthy Monday. With this initiative, we offer a healthy breakfast on the first Monday of each month. • Casual Friday dress code in the offices. Furthermore, we have introduced a work environment push button device to offer employees an additional channel to communicate their opinions to detect those areas of improvement that inspire new initiatives. All this is part of our commitment for responsible and more participatory management of our human resources. 6.2. Inclusive work environment At Tag Systems, we respect local and international labour standards and the principles relating to employees’ rights. In this sense, we have protocols and policies to guarantee non-discrimination for any reason together with the promotion of equal opportunities and recognition of the diversity of our workforce. During 2017, the Human Resources department has attended specific training on equality and has started to apply actions such as the use of gender-neutral language in internal communications and job advertisements published in the press. Also has started to collect data and indicators separating them by gender. With the aim of having it approved in 2018, Tag Systems has been working on the formalisation of an equality plan, thus moving forward with the future equality law that the Andorran Government plans to pass.

The training plan established at the beginning of the year is modified and adapted as needs arise. Furthermore, there is an internal protocol that enables people to request training they find interesting. Subsequently, the proposal is assessed and approved, if appropriate, or it is partially financed depending on the content.

Occupational Health and Safety One of our priorities is the health and safety of everyone who works at Tag Systems. For this reason, we focus on strengthening the occupational health and safety prevention and management culture, which is established via the OSHAS 18001 management system we have implemented and certified. We have hired an External Prevention Service for all specialities relating to health and safety, including health monitoring. All the workplaces, teams and products are duly assessed and corrective actions planned. Our occupational hazards prevention and safety policy contemplates guaranteeing safe and correctly equipped installations for the performance of the activity. Sustainability Report 2017 27 Tag Systems’ Occupational Hazards Committee comprises 7 people from different Administration and Production departments.

All emergency team members receive first and second response training in firefighting, first aid and evacuation. All in-house staff are represented on the Health and Safety Committee, comprising people from different departments. Year after year, we promote actions to make the workforce aware of health and safety matters to reduce accidents at work.

Sustainability Report 2017 29 7.1. Consolidated environmental management Respect for the environment is an unavoidable requirement for a company aiming to be sustainable, such as Tag Systems. In this sense, we assess the environmental impact and effects of our activity and manage the prevention of environmental risks, aspects that are set out in our policy and that also form part of our business strategy. Since 2012, Tag Systems has implemented an ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. Principles of action of the Tag Systems environmental policy: • Application of environmental and energy efficiency criteria in production processes, through the rational use of natural resources and the reduction of generated waste and emissions. • Compliance with environmental and energy legislation, as well as with other voluntary commitments. • Provide training and allocate the necessary resources to promote employees’ active participation in attaining the environmental objectives. • Continuous improvement of the integrated management system. We constantly invest to reduce energy consumption as much as possible and to improve waste management and processing. We are loyal to our principles and values and make sure that the agents who interact with us also respect them. At Tag Systems, we ensure compliance with the applicable environmental legislation and, therefore, we have all the necessary licences for water discharge, atmospheric emissions and production of dangerous waste. 7.2. Efficiency and optimisation of resources At Tag Systems, we make sure we use resources rationally and efficiently whilst trying to assess and recycle as many materials as possible. Specifically, we focus our efforts on the consumption of raw materials (paper and plastic), energy and water. In 2017, we have managed to optimise paper management in the offices and have reduced paper consumption by 12%. Consumption of materials (kg) 2015 2016 2017 Paper 1,044 912 804 Plastic 180,000 150,000 153,000 Sustainability Report 2017 30 In 2017, three production machines over 10 years old were replaced. The new ones were acquired considering energy efficiency criteria. Electricity consumption relating to units produced has dropped 3.2% compared to 2016, being 0.058 kWh. Energy consumption (MWh) 2015 2016 2017 Electricity 942.81 1,147.86 1,151.53 Diesel oil (heating) 80.89 50.56 80.89 Total 1,023.70 1,198.42 1,232.42 7.3. Minimisation of waste In 2017, awareness, commitment to the environment, and people’s efforts regarding selective collection of packaging, paper and cardboard, glass, batteries, waste, etc., have made it possible to reduce almost all the sections of waste we generate. At Tag Systems, we have a waste producer licence PRP-0029/11, as well as an internal protocol for waste management. We record the waste generated, which is sent to the appropriate authorised waste manager. Most of the waste is recycled, except toners and plastic which are sent for energy assessment. In 2017, plastic, the greatest amount of waste generated, has dropped 8% compared to the year before.

Mitigation of the carbon footprint The main causes generating greenhouse gases at Tag Systems arise from the consumption of energy. For this reason, efforts made to optimise it has enabled us to reduce our carbon footprint. Greenhouse gas emissions (t CO2) 2015 2016 2017 Scope 1 (emissions from the consumption of diesel oil for heating) 21.41 13.38 21.38 Scope 2 (emissions from the consumption of electricity) 152.74 203.17 214.69 Total 174.14 216.55 236.07 Sustainability Report 2017 32 8. Responsible economic management 8.1. Economic performance 8.2. State of added value Sustainability Report 2017 33 8.1. Economic performance The result of the 2017 economic management is considered very satisfactory for Tag Systems. This has been possible thanks to the improvement in income and a greater reduction in costs. In terms of sales, improvement has occurred in the growth of some medium-sized customers and high added value sales, which has been possible thanks to the implementation and sale of Dual Interface cards in most markets where we operate. The triple effort made in the reduction of costs is to: reduce the cost of purchasing the main raw materials, reduce the cost of production wastage and, finally, reduce overheads (maintenance, supplies, human resources, etc.). In 2017, significant changes have taken place that have affected many levels, in both organisation and management terms: • Appointment of a new Head of Production. Improvements have been made to some related processes, which has resulted in greater efficiency and effectiveness in production. • Creation of a new post: Head of Planning. An average of 90% of orders have been delivered within the agreed date, which improves our customers’ level of satisfaction. Improvement of the order management process from start to finish, which started several years ago is still ongoing. • We have started a Productivity Improvement Project, together with an industrial engineering consultancy firm. • Hiring and costs have been reduced by encouraging employee’s versatility. 2017 shows a reactivation of the market and growth in medium and large customers, as well as an increase in the intra-group turnover, which in turn gives more value to the Tag Systems Group.
