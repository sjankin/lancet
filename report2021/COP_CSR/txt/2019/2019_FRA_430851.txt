United Nation Global Compact Communication on Progress – July 2019 Bois-Colombes, 15 July 2019 Statement of continued support I am pleased to confirm that Coface reaffirms its commitment, in place since April 2003, to support the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. The respect of human and socio-economic rights, the preservation of our environment, the ethical management of human resources and the strict compliance with anti-corruption regulations and best practices are amongst our core priorities everywhere we conduct our business. As a global credit insurance company, our ambition is to promote trade nationally and internationally by understanding, preventing, managing and carrying our clients risks. We do so with a constant commitment to ensuring we have a positive impact on our environment, our communities, our clients, our employees and all of the Group’s other stakeholders. Our annual Registration Document serves as the Communication on Progress (CoP) in implementing the Principles. In this Communication on Progress, we express our intent to transform Coface into an example of greater sustainability in the credit insurance industry and we describe our actions to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We are also committed to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication.
