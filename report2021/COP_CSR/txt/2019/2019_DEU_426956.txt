Leonhard Birnbaum ”By bringing Chief Sustainability Officer, E.ON SE our vision to life.” Energy – from the taming of fire to the latest advances in battery technology – has transformed human society for thousands of years. Over time, energy has become more available to more people, making their lives easier and creating countless new possibilities. These advances were achieved by bold, creative, and indefatigable pioneers. Europe's energy system is currently amid an exciting transformation. Energy is increasingly renewable, sustainable, and democratised: it's being put back into the hands of the many. We put customers at the heart of our business. By ensuring that they have a reliable energy supply. By providing them with individually tailored energy solutions. And by deepening our understanding of their needs and building lasting relationships with them. And we want all customers – individuals and families, companies and entire cities – to join us on the journey to a new energy world. To overcome its challenges and enjoy its benefits. To pioneer together in making Europe's energy supply secure, sustainable, and climate-friendly. Our vision is to be the energy company that partners with customers to propel the energy transition, power the digital age, and empower people to be more energy-autonomous. How do you meet the challenge? Jill Lees ”By conserving energy tadoº customer in the UK and E.ON employee but assuring a warm welcome.” A heating system that thinks for itself? Sounds futuristic, but it's already happening. The heating in my house is equipped with a smart thermostat made by tadoº, which E.ON has offered in Britain since 2017. I use it to remotely control the temperature in my house as well as the hot water heater. I travel a lot on business which means I return home at very different hours and sometimes very late. I want to come home to a warm house. And I don't want to heat the house when I'm gone for a few days or a week. That's where tadoº comes in: it turns the heating off when I'm away, but turns it back on in time to make the house nice and warm when I get back. It can also adjust the heat setting to the weather forecast, for example by using less heat on sunny days. Before this I used a heat-control app called E.ON Touch. It inspired me to try tadoº, which I like so much I've already recommended it to friends. It's easy to set up and use. And you can control it anytime and from anywhere using a smart-phone app. Before E.ON Touch and tadoº I reduced the temperature manually when I left and so would come home to a cold house. Both solutions have helped me conserve energy and reduce my heating costs. They're also convenient and have enhanced my home comfort. I recently moved into a new home, and the remodelling plans for it will definitely incorporate more smart solutions.

That's one of the ways we intend to make Malmö, Sweden's third-largest city, its most sustainable. In fact, we aim for Malmö to run solely on renewables by 2030. That will take smart solutions for energy supply, transport, infrastructure, and consumption. Like providing people with easy access to places where they can charge their electric vehicle (EV) with surplus renewable energy. EV ownership here is rising faster than the national average. Moreover, half of our city buses are already electric. EVs running on renewable energy – along with more car-sharing, cycling, walking, and public transport – will make Malmö cleaner and quieter. More EVs, though, will need more places to charge. That's where E.ON comes in. E.ON is installing charging stations in parking facilities so people can recharge their EVs on the go. Malmö has already made huge strides toward becoming a sustainable smart city. People are at the centre of it all, and many have become prosumers. Rooftop solar panels, energy-storage devices, smart meters, charge points in home garages, and biogas plants fuelled by compost from our citizens' kitchens or gardens – they're all a reality around our city and are connected by smart-grid technology. But we know we still have a lot more to do. That's why Malmö is happy to have E.ON as a partner in developing an energy system that will be powered by 100 per cent renewable or recycled energy by 2030. It's a mutually beneficial partnership, one that helps us meet the challenges facing cities today.

Siegfried Espen Eichhöfer/Ostkreuz Moritz ”By using hot steam to CFO, KG Deutsche Gasrußwerke GmbH & Co keep things cool.” What sounds counterintuitive will soon be reality in Dortmund, Germany. My company, Deutsche Gasrusswerke, produces carbon black there for the tire industry. This is a heavy industrial process that generates a lot of waste heat, much of which, for decades, we couldn't use. Unfortunately, that meant the steam's energy potential went to waste. This year we partnered with E.ON and Dortmund, which wants to revitalise its industrial district, to do something about it. For that we needed a new neighbour: a company that could use our waste heat and was willing to build a facility on an open plot of land next to our plant. Happily, we found Coldstore, a deep-freeze logistics specialist that stores frozen food for other companies. To make it all work, E.ON designed an energy-recovery system that will transform our waste heat into cooling that will be piped to Coldstore's freezer warehouse. It's a winwin solution. Selling energy gives us an additional source of revenue, while Coldstore will have access to a cheap supply of recycled energy. The earth's climate benefits as well, because we're reusing energy instead of generating it. That will prevent the emission of a lot of carbon. In future, innovative solutions like this will become increasingly common. They bring together companies with complementary needs and help make tomorrow's energy supply sustainable.

As Germany's first energy company dedicated entirely to the new energy world, we want to focus even more on the most important players in this world: customers. To do so, we decided and announced a far-reaching asset swap with RWE. We intend to transfer substantially all of our renewables business to RWE. In return, we'll receive assets that will greatly enlarge our customer solutions and energy networks businesses. We can then do even more to meet customers' expectations and to make the energy world smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable. In short, to deliver Energy for Tomorrow. Climate protection and sustainable development We are aware of our important role in climate protection and we act on it. In November 2018 we and 16 other energy companies signed a joint declaration reaffirming our commitment to proactively and collectively combat climate change through our business activities. The declaration also advocates a progressive carbon price floor in the power sector to provide clear and predictable long-term carbon price signals, which would do much to spur investment in low-emission technology. Dr. Johannes Teyssen, Since their adoption in 2015, we've recognised the importance of the United Chairman of the Management Board and CEO Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and fully support them. Our sustainability strategy is aligned to the SDGs, and we intend to set new sustainability targets that demonstrate our contribution to the achievement of the goals. For example, we set a target of making all E.ON facilities and offices carbon-neutral by 2030. In June 2018 my Management Board colleagues and I underscored this support by issuing a self-commitment to the SDGs. Core businesses that promote sustainability Our wide range of innovative solutions enables customers of all kinds – residential, small and medium-sized enterprises, industrial and commercial, and public entities – to use energy more efficiently, produce their own green energy, Contents and convert to e-mobility.

Our InterFlex project in Sweden received an international smart-grid award in 2018. In Germany we offer an online tool that shows communities their local renewables output and energy consumption Best wishes, in real time, enabling community decision-makers to take targeted action to promote the energy transformation and to monitor progress. In 2018 our renewables business again added more onshore and offshore wind farms. For example, we completed Arkona, a deepwater wind farm located in the Baltic Sea that we built together with Norwegian energy company Equinor, in record time. Arkona began delivering green power to the grid Dr. Johannes Teyssen in September 2018. As mentioned earlier, we intend to transfer substantially all of our renewables business to RWE. Responsibility for our people We take our employees' well-being very seriously. In 2018 we again carried out numerous measures to ensure their health and safety.

Foreword Introduction About E.ON Sustainability strategy and organisation Materiality analysis 14 Sustainable energy for tomorrow The energy world is steadily becoming more distributed, digital, and decarbonised. And that means: more sustainable. Our core businesses – energy networks, customer solutions, and renewables – are making it happen. Our grids are getting smarter all the time, which enables them to integrate more renewable energy while remaining reliable. Our innovative solutions help customers of all sizes – from families and small businesses to large manufacturers and entire cities – to use energy more efficiently, produce their own renewable energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. Our wind and solar farms make the energy supply cleaner in Europe and North America. Each of our core businesses is about improving people's lives and creating a better tomorrow. The most important players in tomorrow's energy world will be customers. To promote transparency and comparability, more and more companies They'll want sustainable homes, businesses, cars, and cities. They'll want around the world are aligning their sustainability strategies to the SDGs. In efficient, affordable solutions that make them more autonomous. As a 2018 we decided to do so too.

Among the key issues it discussed in 2018 were the social impact of E.ON's planned restructuring, the CSR Directive Implementation Act, and a number of our sustainability measures. The Sustainability team at corporate headquarters is involved in all aspects of our sustainability work. Its main tasks are to coordinate the planning and implementation of sustainability initiatives and monitor their progress, collect sustainability data, and conduct our annual materiality analysis and sustainability reporting. Together with the Sustainability Council, it supports the business units in meeting their sustainability targets. The team also provides advice to employees on sustainability issues and strives to raise awareness across the organisation. In all these tasks it works closely with the Health, Safety, and Environment team.

We identified these topics by means of a materiality analysis, which we have conducted annually since 2006. This report focuses primarily on the sustainability topics that our materiality analysis indicated are of very high relevance. To meet the diverse expectations of our stakeholders and the requirements of sustainability rankings and ratings, this report also presents information about a number of other sustainability topics.

Societies will need to do this if we are to successfully reduce emissions. Energy efficiency and recovery as well as distributed and renewable energy generation have enormous climate-protection potential. The EU and individual member states have passed laws to make sure that this potential is realised. For example, the European Energy Efficiency Directive establishes a set of binding measures to help the EU reduce its primary energy consumption by 20 per cent by 2020. Not surprisingly, our customers – from homeowners and small businesses to big manufacturers, real estate developers, and entire cities – increasingly want smart solutions that enable them to use energy more efficiently, save money, and emit less carbon. Digitalisation helps. It creates new opportunities – like digital energy management and smart-home technology – to make energy consumption transparent and for our customers to make theirs more sustainable.

As part of the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, in October 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its most recent report on global warming. It once again emphasised the urgent need for concerted and decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions so that global warming can be limited to 1.5 to 2 degrees Centigrade. Keeping temperatures within 2 degrees of preindustrial levels is crucial. But it's important to emphasise that it would probably still leave the earth in a chronic, albeit stable, condition. E.ON acknowledges the IPCC's key scientific input at the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December 2018, at which governments reviewed the Paris Agreement. The vast majority of energy consumed still comes from conventional sources and therefore results in significant GHG emissions. E.ON is an energy company focused entirely on the new energy world; climate protection is therefore a crucial issue for us. The transition to a low-carbon economy poses challenges for our competitiveness but also creates opportunities for us to grow our business. Our core businesses reflect the key emerging energy trends and enable us to help our customers use energy more efficiently and generate their own low-carbon energy. Beyond this, the production or provision of all the goods and services as well as customers' use of products results in GHG emissions. We therefore need to take action to reduce our upstream and downstream climate impact. Alongside climate protection, we work systematically to prevent environmental damage and Contents to minimise the impact of our business operations on the environment, the landscape, and biodiversity.

We made the app available to our 350 most senior managers at our Group Executive Conference in September 2018. As part of the campaign, we will issue guidelines for the use of mobile phones in vehicles. By instructing employees, for example, to avoid calls and refrain from listening to machine-read email messages while driving, we aim to reduce the risk of traffic accidents.

In 2018 our employee TRIF of 2.5 was slightly higher than the prior-year figure (2.3). By contrast, contractor TRIF declined from 2.9 in 2017 to 2.1 in Accident statistics 2018.

Contractor LTIF was 1.5, a year-on-year decrease (2017: 2.3). In Contents 2018 we focused on contractor management. This included developing and imSearch plementing contractor-specific programs that likely contributed to the reduction. Back Climate and environmental protection Occupational health and safety Data protection and product safety People and environment Incident and crisis management 55 In 2017 we introduced a new H&S KPI: serious incident and fatality rate (SIF). SIF measures accidents and incidents that have caused, or could have resulted in, serious or fatal injuries. Only incidents that surpass a predefined severity threshold are included in SIF. Combined SIF of 0.6 in 2018 represented a slight improvement relative to the prior-year figure of 0.7. The number of serious injuries and potentially serious incidents decreased by approximately 3 per cent year on year. Fatal accidents at work Despite our intensive safety measures, three E.ON employees and two contractor employees died in 2018. Two of the E.ON employee fatalities occurred as a result of electrical accidents, one in the Czech Republic, another in Germany. A third E.ON employee died in Hungary from a knife wound received during an altercation with a co-worker (crime-related). In addition, two contractor employees died, one in Romania during the hoisting of a pole, another in Sweden while removing fallen trees from a power line. After fatal accidents we immediately initiate investigations to understand the exact course of events. The aim is to identify the root causes and to take all necessary measures to prevent comparable accidents in the future. These principles also apply at subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated, such as those in Slovakia and Turkey. Serious accidents are not acceptable. In 2019 we'll continue to implement our HSE strategy to foster a caring culture at E.ON and also launch a ZERO Major Harm program to reduce the number of serious incidents. Non-Core Business: occupational health and safety at PreussenElektra Our subsidiary PreussenElektra (PEL) is responsible for the operation, decommissioning, and dismantling of our nuclear power plants (NPPs). Its top priorities in all these activities are the health and safety of employees – its own as well as contractors' – and environmental protection. PEL is fully integrated into our safety organisation and embraces our high standards. Its extensive experience in plant operations and decommissioning helps it further optimise its H&S processes and procedures. It strives for continuous improvement through process and operational reviews, improvement plans, and prevention and training initiatives that foster safe work practices and behaviours among employees. All this contributes to the high level of safety at our NPPs, which in 2018 again had no serious accidents.

This includes designing and conducting training and realistic simulation exercises for the crisis management teams around E.ON. Our ICMs share information and experience on an ongoing basis. Ultimate responsibility for preventing and managing crises lies with the E.ON Management Board. Guidelines and policies In 2018 we replaced our existing incident and crisis management policy with a new policy called Legal, Security and Crisis Management, and Data Protection. It stipulates that all parts of the company must report severe security issues and crises to the Response Centre without delay. It also requires each unit to form its own crisis management organisation and, commensurate with its business operations and risk profile, to put in place policies and procedures to prevent, identify, asses, and manage crises. Corporate headquarters provides the units with any guidance or support they may need in establishing these mechanisms. Specific actions We take a variety of steps to ensure that we're thoroughly prepared for incidents and crises. For example, each year we conduct two to three crisis management exercises to simulate a power outage, cyber attack, or other crises as realistically as possible. Participation is mandatory for all crisis management team members, who also have to take part in availability tests at least twice a year. The tests' purpose is to assess our team's availability and reaction speed at any time of the day or night. PreussenElektra periodically conducts nuclear crisis exercises, notifies them to the ICM at corporate headquarters, and reports their results. The exercises are required by law and in some cases may be organised on short notice by Germany's nuclear regulatory agency. Contents Search Back The wolf a loner?

Better complaint management After developing a maturity model for complaint management and conducting a first assessment in 2017, the sales organisations in all the countries where we operate conducted a second maturity assessment on complaint management in June 2018. The goal was to understand and measure the quality of complaint management in all our markets and use the results to improve our customers' experiences, even in cases where they complained. The model has six categories: strategic direction and governance, people, processes, systems and technology, proactivity and action, and data. Our sales organisations used the findings of the first assessment to identify areas for improvement and to design roadmaps to address them. The second assessment showed that all had improved their performance. The main drivers were an increased awareness of complaints (including support from unit CEOs), new automated reporting, streamlined processes, and investment in training and IT. To further improve customer experience going forward, we're working to expand our use of analytical tools like text and voice recording systems for customer feedback and to refine our tone of voice in written and spoken communications.

Equally important is helping our customers, our employees, policymakers, and other stakeholders understand our business activities and their role in propelling the energy transition.

Forward to Zero Carbon In November E.ON held a two-day City Energy Solutions Conference in Berlin to bring together representatives of city governments, the real estate industry, and start-ups. The purpose was to share ideas on sustainability, carbon neutrality, innovation, and the ongoing challenge of how municipalities, and developers working on their behalf, can meet their climate-protection targets. The agenda included panel discussions, networking, pitches by start-ups, and talks by researchers, industry executives, and other thought leaders.

Non-Core Business: stakeholder dialogue on reliable operation and plant dismantling Our subsidiary PreussenElektra is responsible for the safe and reliable operation and dismantling of our nuclear power plants (NPPs). Ongoing dialogue with stakeholders is essential. We communicate with a broad range of stakeholders through press releases and briefings as well as events and forums that provide the opportunity to dialogue directly with stakeholders and to benefit from their feedback. The aim of all these measures is to provide transparent information, particularly on NPP dismantling, and to build trust. We continually expand our communications activities, especially with local stakeholders, and did so again in 2018. In addition to annual dialogue forums and plant visits for members of the German federal parliament and state parliaments, we held a variety of information events at all our NPPs. For example, we invited regional policymakers, administrators, fire-fighters, and police officers to Grafenrheinfeld and Unterweser to familiarise them with the dismantling process. Encouraged by the success of a similar event at Würgassen in 2017, we held two one-day information events on the dismantling progress at Stade.

It uses standardised surveys to measure the influence that different aspects of compliance have on each other. For example, it can show how compliance risk is affected by improved employee compliance.
