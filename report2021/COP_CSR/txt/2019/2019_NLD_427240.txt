Consumer interest in gut health is on the increase. Probiotics are now taken by growing numbers of health-conscious consumers to support the immune system, digestive health, and even newer areas such as mental health. Many health conditions, including intestinal disorders and obesity, are characterized by an imbalance in, or impairment to, the microbial colonies that inhabit the gut. Clinical studies suggest that the consumption of probiotics can help balance the microbiome, combating the adverse effects of these conditions. Our Nutrition business is widely present in the gut health value chain. We make ingredients (such as probiotics, digestive enzymes and vitamins), develop market-ready customized solutions (through our recently acquired and fully integrated probiotic expert BioCare), and deliver end-to-end business-to-business services for owners of consumer brands, from initial concept to finished product. “We are distributing supplements and medical device products from BioCare,” states Karl Parance, CEO at Laboratoire Immubio. “BioCare has proven to be a highly reliable, supportive and competent partner in all spheres of interaction.

In its management letter KPMG shared the outcome of its evaluation of the company's procedures and system of internal controls to the extent necessary within the scope of the audit of the financial statements. The observations of KPMG were presented along the pillars that support DSM's in-control statement (for the 'Statements of the Managing Board' see page 123, and for a visualization of DSM's control environment see page 110). The management letter contained constructive recommendations for further strengthening of DSM's internal controls. The most important element was KPMG's encouragement to continue to take the pillar 'Internal Control Framework' to a higher level of maturity. In line with our own assessment no material weaknesses were reported by KPMG. Finally, in 2018, the Audit Committee formally evaluated the external auditor, and discussed the reappointment of KPMG.

A list of DSM participations has been filed with the Chamber of Commerce (Netherlands) and is available from the company upon request. The list can also be downloaded from the company website. The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The policies that management considers to be the most important to the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations are discussed in the relevant Notes. The same holds for the issues that require management judgments or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management cautions that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates routinely require adjustment. Areas of judgment that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements relate to the categorization of certain items as 'APM adjustments' relating to the alternative performance measures, the identification of cash generating units (CGUs) and the classification of activities as 'held for sale' and 'discontinued operations'. Key assumptions and estimates that need to be made by management relate to the useful lives of non-current assets (Notes 8 and 9), the establishment of provisions for restructuring costs, environmental costs (Note 18) and retirement and other postemployment benefits (Note 24), the recognition and measurement of income taxes (Note 7) and the determination of fair values for financial instruments (Note 23) and for share-based compensation (Note 27). The uncertainty concerning the actual outflows of provisions relates to both the amounts and the timing of potential future events. Furthermore, impairment testing mainly of goodwill and development projects requires judgments by management, among other things with respect to the determination of CGUs, the estimation of future cashflows, growth rates and discount rates to apply (Notes 2, 8, 9 and 10). Significant judgment is also required for the determination of earn-out receivables and payables in business combinations (Note 3) and for the valuation of drawing rights (Note 8). For drawing rights, the most important judgments relate to the estimation of the required maintenance and replacement outlays. Estimates are based on historical quoted market prices, experience and assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. Exchange rates The currency exchange rates that were used in preparing the consolidated financial statements are listed below for the most important currencies. 1 euro = Exchange rate at balance sheet date Average exchange rate 2018 2017 2018 2017 US dollar 1.15 1.20 1.18 1.13 Swiss franc 1.13 1.17 1.16 1.11 Brazilian real 4.44 3.97 4.31 3.61 Chinese renminbi 7.88 7.80 7.81 7.63 Presentation of consolidated income statement DSM presents expenses in the consolidated income statement in accordance with their function. This allows the presentation of gross margin on the face of the income statement, which is a widely used performance measure in the industry. The composition of the costs allocated to the individual functions is explained below. Cost of sales encompasses all manufacturing costs (including raw materials, employee benefits, and depreciation and amortization) related to goods and services captured in net sales. These are measured at their actual cost based on FIFO, or weighted average cost. Marketing and sales relates to the selling and marketing of goods and services, and also includes all costs that are directly related to the sale of goods, but are not originated by the manufacturing of the goods (e.g. freight).

It also relates to business support activities of staff departments that are not directly related to the other functional areas. 2 Alternative performance measures In presenting and discussing DSM's financial position, operating results and net results, management uses certain Alternative performance measures not defined by IFRS. These Alternative performance measures (APMs) should not be viewed in isolation as alternatives to the equivalent IFRS measures and should be used as supplementary information in conjunction with the most directly comparable IFRS measures. Alternative performance measures do not have standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. To provide clear reporting on the developments of the business, APM adjustments are made that impact the EBIT(DA), net profit, ROCE and the EPS. A reconciliation of these Alternative performance measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures can be found on page 174. The APM adjustments to net profit, as included in the APMs, can be specified as follows: 2018 2017 APM adjustments: Acquisitions/divestments 11 Other consolidation changes (11) Restructuring 68 60 Other 11 26 Impairments of PPE and intangible assets 32 14 Income tax related to adjustments (23) (28) Adjustments to result in associates and joint ventures (122) (1,158) Total APM adjustments (income)/expense (45) (1,075) Bright Science.

The PPAs for the 2017 acquisitions of Inner Mongolia Rainbow Biotechnology, Twilmij, BioCare Copenhagen and Amyris Brasil were finalized in 2018. In accordance with IFRS 3, the purchase price was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired. The PPA of Twilmij resulted in a reallocation of goodwill (-€ 31 million) to mainly other intangible assets for customer relations and the brand name. The PPA of the BioCare Copenhagen acquisition led to a reallocation of goodwill (-€ 21 million) to other intangible assets for technology and customer relations. The finalization of the PPA of Amyris Brasil resulted in recognition of an additional contingent consideration of € 50 million. This was reallocated to intangible assets for customer relations, IP and goodwill.

These uncertainties are taken into account in determining the probability of realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Unrecognized loss carryforwards amounting to € 58 million will expire in the years up to and including 2023 (2017: € 77 million up to and including 2022), € 112 million between 2024 and 2028 (2017: € 72 million between 2023 and 2027) and the remaining € 67 million between 2029 and beyond (2017: € 63 million between 2028 and 2032). The valuation of deferred tax assets depends on the probability of the reversal of temporary differences and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized for future tax benefits arising from temporary differences and for tax loss carryforwards to the extent that the tax benefits are likely to be realized. In the Netherlands, tax losses may be carried forward for six years. DSM has to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are reduced if, and to the extent that, it is not probable that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In the event that actual future results differ from estimates, and depending on tax strategies that DSM may be able to implement, changes to the measurement of deferred taxes could be required, which could impact on the company's financial position and profit for the year.

Over the past few years, DSM has acquired several entities in business combinations that have been accounted for by the acquisition method, resulting in recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets. The amounts assigned to the acquired assets and liabilities are based on assumptions and estimates about their fair values. In making these estimates, management consults independent, qualified appraisers if appropriate. A change in assumptions and estimates could change the values allocated to certain assets and their estimated useful lives, which could affect the amount or timing of charges to the income statement, such as amortization of intangible assets.

Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that adverse movements of interest rates lead to high costs on interest-bearing debt or assets, which negatively impact the company's capability to honor its commitments. DSM's interest rate risk policy is aimed at minimizing the interest rate risks associated with the financing of the company and thus at the same time optimizing the net interest costs. This policy translates into a certain desired profile of fixed-interest and floating-interest positions, including cash and cash equivalents, with the floating-interest position not exceeding 60% of net debt. At 31 December 2018, there was neither debt carried at a floating interest rate (same as 2017), nor outstanding fixed-floating interest rate swaps (end of 2017 none). The following analysis of the sensitivity of borrowings, assets and related financial derivatives to interest rate movements assumes an instantaneous 1% change in interest rates for all maturities from their level on 31 December 2018, with all other variables held constant. A 1% reduction in interest rates would result in a € 25 million pre-tax loss in the income statement and equity on the basis of the composition of financial instruments on 31 December 2018, as floating-rate borrowings are more than compensated for by floating-rate assets (mainly cash). The opposite applies in the case of a 1% increase in interest rates. The sensitivity of financial instruments on 31 December 2018 to changes in interest rates is set out in the following table: Sensitivity to change in interest rate 2018 2017 Carrying Sensitivity Carrying Sensitivity amount amount +1% (1%) +1% (1%) Loans to associates and joint ventures 26 193 Current investments 1,277 13 (13) 954 10 (10) Cash and cash equivalents 1,281 13 (13) 899 9 (9) Short-term borrowings (380) (1) 1 (77) (1) 1 Long-term borrowings (2,272) (2,551) Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that adverse movements of foreign currency rates lead to losses on assets or liabilities in currencies, which negatively impacts the results of operations and financial condition of the company. It is DSM's policy to hedge 100% of the currency risks resulting from sales and purchases at the moment of recognition of the receivables and payables. This is realized by transferring at spot rates the respective exposures to the group, which are, consequently (on a netted basis), hedged externally. In addition, operating companies may — under strict conditions — opt for hedging currency risks from firm commitments and forecasted transactions. The currencies giving rise to these risks are primarily USD, CHF, GBP and JPY. The risks arising from currency exposures are regularly reviewed and hedged when appropriate. DSM uses average-rate currency forward contracts, currency forward contracts, spot contracts, and average-rate currency options to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. At year-end, these instruments had remaining maturities of less than one year. For the hedging of currency risks from firm Bright Science.

Hedge accounting is not applied for hedges of recognized trade receivables and trade payables hedged with short-term derivatives. To hedge intercompany loans, receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiaries, DSM uses currency swaps or forward contracts. The following analysis of the sensitivity of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to currency movements against the euro assumes a 10% change in all foreign currency rates against the euro from their level on 31 December, with all other variables held constant.

Fair value of financial instruments The following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of financial instruments: cash, current investments, current receivables, current borrowings (excluding current portion of long-term instruments) and other current liabilities are stated at carrying amount, which approximates fair value in view of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of financial derivatives and long-term instruments are based on calculations, quoted market prices or quotes obtained from intermediaries. The portfolio of derivatives consists of average-rate forward contracts that are valued against average foreign exchange forward rates obtained from Bloomberg and other derivatives that are valued using a discounted cash flow model, applicable market yield curves and foreign exchange spot rates. Inputs for the fair value calculations represent observable market data that are obtained from external sources that are deemed to be independent and reliable. DSM uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value that are not based on observable market data The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value hierarchy.

The grant date of these management share units is the last trading day at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in March. The number of management share units to be granted is based on the face value of the DSM share. The grant value (depending on job level) to eligible employees will be divided by the share price at the beginning of the first performance year. As a result, the number of share units to be granted annually will fluctuate with the share price development. The grant concerns the maximum number of Restricted Share Units (RSUs) and Performance Share Units (PSUs) that may vest. RSUs and PSUs are subject to a vesting period of 3 years starting at the grant date. Vesting of RSUs is subject to continued employment until the vesting date (‘time vesting'); vesting of PSUs is in addition subject to the achievement of predetermined performance goals at the end of the vesting period. The PSUs granted in 2018 are subject to the realization of four equally weighted goals: Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance versus a peer group Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) growth Energy Efficiency Improvement (EEI) Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE) Efficiency Improvement Non-vested share units will be forfeited.

The costs of option plans are measured by reference to the fair value of the options at the date on which the options are granted. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account market conditions linked to the price of the DSM share. Stock-price volatility is determined on the basis of historical volatilities of the DSM share price measured each month over a period equal to the expected option life.
