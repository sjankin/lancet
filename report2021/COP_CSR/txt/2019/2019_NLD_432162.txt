IT MAY CONCERN I am pleased to confirm that Thermopatch BV continues to support the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Thermopatch BV will renew a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the Global Compact COP policy. Sincerely yours, THERMOPATCH BV Mr. J. Bausch Group Managing Director Introduction For over 80 years, Thermopatch constitutes a concept in the world of Laundry and has held a premier position in developing heat seal machines, label solutions, direct imprint equipment, mending material and other related supplies for the laundry, dry clean and garment manufacturing industries. To obtain a challenging position, Thermopatch utilized her knowledge and experience from the Laundry industry and developed herself into a leading company in the promotional market over the years, creating positive brand awareness in Corporate Identity. Today, we are producing crests for a large diversity of markets like for example corporate workwear, promotional clothing and sportswear which require the highest quality and service standards. Promotional wear is an effective and powerful way to promote a business or a brand and contributes to the professional appearance. Thermopatch presents a positive solution to any corporate identity requirement. Product Innovation and Development Product innovation and development; the enhancement of processes and services; and the measurement of operational performances, are fundamental, ongoing activities that help move Thermopatch forward. They solidify the quality and service standards that go into the products Thermopatch manufactures and continue to support customers’ needs. At the same time, Thermopatch is continuously on the look for new products, item formats and design configurations, to build on the large array of embellishment, branding and identification solutions currently available. Environmental Responsibility To maintain a leading role, it is necessary for Thermopatch to continue her research and development activities to meet the demands of her customers and the mandatory requirements set by various authorities. Research and development is an important part of our organization that enables us to produce customer friendly and environmentally products suitable for every need and for every situation. We acknowledge the importance of Thermopatch supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, and encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Thermopatch is actively working on reducing the negative impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. Integrating Sustainability It is important to effectively communicate our business’s vision of sustainability to everyone in our organization. Each and every individual, regardless of his or her role in the company, needs to understand and embrace that sustainability vision. Integration of sustainability into companies has been difficult, especially because sustainability and corporate social responsibility implementation remain the job of a single person or department within many companies. Staff commitment is a vital component of any sustainability strategy. A company’s employees are the front line in implementation of its Sustainability Management System, and understanding, support and a perceived sense of ownership of the strategy among staff can be the difference between the success or failure of any efforts to implement sustainability practices. Staff engagement begins with education and awareness-raising about the link between us as a manufacturing facility and the environment, local economic development, social conditions and opportunities, and cultural traditions, as well as the company’s policy, programmes and activities. It also involves motivating staff to support sustainable initiatives through their roles at work or as volunteers outside of the workplace. Integrating sustainability across functions starts with engaging staff through internal communication including the types of messages that staff will respond to, how to get the message across and ways to involve staff and get their support for the sustainability programme. One of the ways to do this is creating a digital ‘Green Team’ which gives employees the opportunity to create a sustainability initiative, people can share their ideas and decisions can be made regarding which one of the ideas to implement. The Thermopatch Vision Thermopatch has positioned itself as an industry leader in development, innovation and manufacturing of garment branding solutions. We aim to be a global leader with a clear vision of providing the highest quality emblems, transfers and labelling solutions, through sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing practices. Our practices will continue to develop and improve to ensure that our offering continuously evolves in line with market changes and customer requirements. Thermopatch expects and demands that each of its business units, all of its employees, and its Directors carry out their business and perform their duties to the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all relevant legal principles. This standard of behaviour and performance is maintained in the company’s dealings with employees, customers, suppliers, and all other stakeholders. The company and its employees will at all times demonstrate the highest levels of integrity, truthfulness, and honesty in order to uphold both personal and corporate reputations and to inspire confidence and trust in their respective actions. The company will conduct its business in a competent, fair, impartial, and efficient manner. Role, Mission and Strategy Role We commit to aligning our operations and strategies with the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The company’s core values of Safety and Health, Environmental Stewardship, Highest Ethical Behaviour, and Respect for People are directly aligned with the values set out by the UN Global Compact. We not only strive to achieve the sales goals we set out for ourselves such as high quality and great customer service, we also set out a clear vision of what is required to sharing responsibility to achieve the collective goal of sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing in order to making products safe and available, anytime anywhere and establish the conditions within our organization necessary for as one behaviour to take root and succeed. Mission Doing the right thing – being a responsible business and hold ourselves accountable to Safeguarding Tomorrow’s Environment. Promoting socially, economically and environmentally sustainable development programs, building on our core knowledge and experience with an emphasis on individual policy tools and instruments and their effective combination. Through innovative processes and unique garment branding technology, we continue to differentiate ourselves in the market by providing high quality, bespoke services to all of its customers. Strategy Our strategy is shaping and managing our sustainability priorities within a framework that is integrated into our business model and addressing sustainability topics across a diversified group. We will continue to strengthen our position as a leading company by offering the highest quality emblems, transfers and labelling solutions, through sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing practices. To maintain excellent performance in the face of external changes and intensifying competitive pressures, we must be able to keep on transforming our organization to deliver in the long term. Creating a culture of continuous improvement will enable our organization to thrive for years to come. Mastering change will ensure we can sustain it and create an organization that can constantly adapt to and shape its environment. Strategy key elements:  To actively build and support partnerships for development  To employ the knowledge, products and expertise of Thermopatch in development projects  To build local capacity and ensure sustainability by working actively with knowledge sharing and training  To support the development of innovative and cost effective products Thermopatch supports public accountability and transparency and therefore we commit ourselves to The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact COP Policy: Human Rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labour Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-corruption Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Human Rights Our policy: Thermopatch acknowledges the importance of supporting and protecting the UN Human Rights Charter and continues in developing and renewing internal procedures. The respect for human rights is integrated in the Human Resource Policy, which describes clearly the rights and obligations of employees and management. We also refer to our Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) Thermopatch Statement on the Prevention of Slavery and Human Trafficking Activities implemented:  Thermopatch respects and protects human rights in her daily operations.  Thermopatch provides a safe and pleasant working environment to all its employees.  Thermopatch has developed internal procedures such as social media protocol in which the principles of mutual respect to each other is outlined.  Thermopatch has appointed a social media manager who is monitoring these procedures internally and externally  Thermopatch meets with the General Data Protection Regulations which will come into effect in May 2018 on privacy/data protection and data leaks.  Thermopatch respects and takes into account the traditions and rituals that are connected with the various religions and cultures of her employees Measurement of outcomes: Thermopatch has not received any complaints from employees, business partners or clients in relation to (potential) human right violations, nor was the Thermopatch organization involved in any human right incidences before or during the reporting period. Labour Our policy: Our employment policy acknowledges our responsibilities to employees and the importance of creating and maintaining a working environment where the basic rights of all employees are recognized. Our employment procedures are built on the following principles:  Non-discrimination between employees of potential employees and equal opportunities for all:  Recruitment, promotion and development of employees based on each individuals attitude, abilities and skills  Provision of suitable training according to role and responsibilities  Employee remuneration that meets legal national standards  Effective communication with our employees  Provide healthy and safe working conditions for all our employees, including customers that come into contact with our business. Activities implemented: Renovation production and printing department  New machines have been taken into production meeting the highest safety standards to make production work easier and safer and, as a result, will prevent employees from getting health/back problems:  Pallet seal machine and electrical pallet truck  Textile rewinding machine, which rolls up the heavy textile rolls automatically  New slitting and cutting machines  Implementation of electric chain hoists and electric lift for textile rolls  Our office departments are equipped with height adjustable table systems that can be transformed quite simply into a standing workplace, in order to create the best ergonomic working position.  In order to create a healthy environment for employees air purifying plants are placed on every department  We are promoting a flexible working structure  We promote a lifelong development of non-company specific skills in order to support the personal development of employees  Recently a risk assessment has been held in the printing department to make sure there is no exposure to gases, dusts and solvents  We supply corporate clothing that meets highest safety standards for all our employees in the production department  We have effective programs put in place to manage health and to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements.  We make all employees aware of health and safety regulations and procedures that are relevant to their position for which we have appointed a certified Health and Safety Officer.  Thermopatch continually reviews its standards of Health and Safety and complies to European and National Guidelines. Labour  Every 5 year a preventive medical check-up (PMO) is organized for all Thermopatch employees (last medical check-up in May 2016)  Thermopatch has implemented an active ageing policy due to the increase in the retirement age.  Regular review of our safety standards as required by European and national health and safety regulations. By undertaking a periodic Risk Inventory and Assessment, we are constantly reviewing these standards. Measurement of outcomes: The Risk Inventory & Evaluation (RI&E) is mandatory according to labour conditions and is an important tool for Thermopatch to monitor and evaluate the performance in the field of environment, health and safety. Since Thermopatch has a relatively small company structure, employees can report any irregularities directly to the management. Thermopatch has received no grievances of complaints from employees or others in relation to labour rights violations, nor was the organization involved in any labour rights incidences before or during the reporting period. Thermopatch puts her awareness of cultural differences into practice by employing staff of different cultural and religious backgrounds. Thermopatch received a Certificate from Social Services for her help and support. Environment Our Policy: We acknowledge the importance of Thermopatch supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, and encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Thermopatch is actively working on reducing the negative impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. Actions implemented:  Extension of the digital production Resulting in less usage of chemicals (Ink) and wastage  Double-sided printing On all departments printers are set for double-sided printing as standard  Digital Screen Imaging system An environmentally friendly exposure unit which exposes the screen directly from computer-to-screen, through which the copyroom in the printing department is only using UV LED instead of inks. Minimizing heat, energy loss and fuel usage:  Office lighting We have undertaken a planned replacement of older inefficient office lighting by energy saving (40% off the office electricity bill) LED lighting. All light switches are being replaced with automatic office LED lighting activated by movement sensors (when movement occurs, light switches on).  Window panes All exterior windows of our office buildings contain HR++ Ultra-High Efficient (double pane) glass.  Central Heating Introduction of programmable heating controller (24/7 active clock program for energy efficient central heating) and insulating the water supply system to save energy.  Compressor Replacement of an inefficient compressor for manufacturing purposes by an energy saving compressor which automatically reduces compression levels to the all-zero state and provides production machines only compression when required.  Disposal hazardous waste All hazardous waste is disposed of using special recycle containers Environment  Digital archiving Company has a Digital Archiving Policy to minimize waste of paper and create a paperless office. One way to significantly reduce the amount of paper used and wasted is with e-invoices rather than the more traditional paper ones. Also (machine) manuals are being supplied on a USB stick instead of a hard copy.  Recycling Company has disposal containers for packaging materials for recycling purposes when possible.  Collecting toners/cartridges/batteries for charity purposes  Company cars All new company cars meet the Euro-5 norms and are expected to meet the latest standards requirements concerning low CO2 emissions. Gradually we will exchange all our company cars into hybrid cars.  Public transportation Company supports the use of public transportation during business travelling to reduce the amount of air pollution/global warming and transportation costs for the company itself (parking costs at the airport, car hire)  Waste Water Management To manage our global water program, we have implemented the online reporting system H2O Insight Water Tool.  Awareness Policy We have implemented a policy to create awareness among staff of the necessity and yields from operating energy-efficiently. Development of technologies:  Manufacturing Process Thermopatch maintains environmentally responsible manufacturing processes by using water based materials and reduces wastage by optimizing and/or replacing inefficient manufacturing processes to ensure energy and resource efficient production.  Production Process The technological change of one of our production processes not only makes it possible for us to reduce the price of the raw material and work more accurately, at the same time we are able to drastically reduce the waste materials which creates a better working environment (cleaner, healthier) and save energy consumption. Thermopatch implemented a fully automatic silkscreen-washing machine which meets all environmental requirements and saves the employee from heavy and dirty work. Environment  Oeko-Tex Standard Thermopatch products are certified with Oeko-Tex standard which means all components meet the required criteria (environmentally friendly) and conformity is verified by an independent organization (third party).  European Regional Development Fund A part of our innovations is subsidized with support of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the European Commission.  Thermopatch continues changing her manufacturing processes where possible and last year we accomplished a further reduction of 15-20% of ink waste by producing digitally instead of screen printing. Measurement of outcomes: The environmental performance of Thermopatch is set out through our entire manufacturing process and is measured by daily operational procedures. We will continue to strive to the highest level of safety with regard to the impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. Environment Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Print Production Process The EU printing sector operates under strict environmental requirements and undertakes ambitious voluntary initiatives to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability. As with all other areas of business, environmental sustainability is not easily solved but the printing industry can make a difference. Thermopatch offers two different methods of printing, screen printing and digital printing which offer unique challenges in creating more eco-friendly products by using less hazardous chemicals and produce less waste during the production process. Screen printing: Screen printing is a process of printing which includes the use of a screen to which layers of ink are applied that will be pressed through a screen onto the printing surface, one at a time. For each new colour, a different screen is used. Digital printing: Digital printing is a process of printing from a digital-based image directly to a variety of textile media using specialized or modified inkjet technology. Digital printing technologies are by nature more sustainable than traditional analog alternatives, and offer a way forward towards clean, efficient, profitable manufacturing. As an industry all sectors of the textile community are embracing sustainable manufacturing practice, from the fabric preparation chemistry that we use to coat and finish, through to the print machinery and inks formulations with which we print. Massive investment has and continues to be made within every sector, many of which now collaborate to further develop innovative new stream-line processes and technologies. Screen printing remains to be one of the most reliable methods and offers many advantages, even though the digital process has to a large extent replaced our traditional method of screen printing. No matter how strong the influence digital technology has on the world of graphic design, there is also the ability of the screen printing ink, like water based inks, to bond over the material of the garment results in a more durable and clearer image compared to digital printing. Heat-dried screen printing inks are also durable enough to handle repeat washing without cracking or fading. Also, additives and coatings can be added to the ink to make it resistant to UV rays, scratches, chemicals and moisture, allowing the products to last for many years. Environment Screen printing with water based inks The textile industry has been known to use a lot of chemicals for the purpose of printing and processing, owing to the growing awareness and demand for eco-friendly inks, have resulted in adopting new alternatives. One such option has been the use of water based inks for screen printing in the textile and apparel industry. Such inks use water as the basic solvent. Water based inks comprise of pigments, binders, thickeners, and eco-friendly solvents. Also water based inks do not need harmful solvents for the cleaning process. The screens after printing can be cleaned using water. However, the screen printing process with water based inks requires an altogether different set of skills, tools, supplies, choreography, speed, and experiences. The shelf life of water based inks are longer than the conventional inks thanks to manufacturers who have devised a technology to encapsulate water in the ink in a way that it does not evaporate until it is printed. Advantages of screen printing with water based inks: 1. It's a cleaner and more environmentally friendly product: water based inks do not contain PVC or other phthalates that can be harmful to the environment and those working with them. 2. Water based inks are breathable: water based inks typically allow the garment to remain breathable even if you are doing a fairly large print, especially suitable for printing on athletic wear. 3. Water based ink prints are extremely long-lasting: the print will typically last as long as the garment! 4. Water based inks feel amazing: in most instances, water based inks simply feel much softer. Environment Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Energy Quick Scan – Climate Neutral Group In 2016 Thermopatch was offered a Customized Energy Quick Scan by our municipality Almere who have a collaboration with Climate Neutral Group. ‘Energy Works’ is the Program Plan that is targeting fully renewable energy for Almere (renewable energy is generated from non-fossil fuels). The ambition is to be fully energy neutral by 2022. This ambition stems from the realization that energy and its transport are increasingly becoming a scarce commodity and, as a result, prices will rise. This creates an additional financial burden for companies, residents and other users of the city. It is possible to significantly reduce the energy costs of schools, associations, residents and businesses in Almere. In fact, they can benefit from it and even earn money. The ultimate goal is to reduce CO2 emissions. Analyzes show that saving and generating more renewable energy is the most effective way to achieve that in the young city of Almere. The Customized Energy Quick Scan has given us insight in our potential energy savings and provided us with a comprehensive list of our energy saving opportunities and necessary information to prioritize and appraise opportunities in a structured way and rank these according to criteria that make most sense for our business. We considered factors such as overall savings and rate of return, cost of implementation and coherence with other planned organizational changes. Our experience shows that even low and no-cost actions can usually reduce energy costs by at least 10% and produce quick returns. Energy conservation can be as simple as using motion sensor light switches, installing standby killers for computers, replacing fluorescent lighting and halogen spotlights into LED lighting, insulating central heating pipes, placing HR foil behind radiator or simply switch off appliances when you do not need them. Solar Panel Scan Climate Neutral Group This year our municipality Almere offered Thermopatch a Solar Panel Scan, they have set up a Collective Purchasing Program in conjunction with Climate Neutral Group and we are looking into the possibilities of installing solar panels on the roofs of our buildings. First, an independent expert will make a Solar Panel Scan of the roofs to give us insight into the possibilities and business case. We will then receive a design of the Solar System, total costs of investment and the Solar Panel payback period. Anti-corruption Our Policy: Thermopatch acknowledges the importance to work against corruption. We do not offer neither receive any gifts, loan, fee, reward or other advantage to or from any person as an inducement to do something which is dishonest, illegal or a breach of trust, in the conduct of the enterprise’s business. In line with this principle, Thermopatch will include an anti-corruption policy in her Code of Conduct, in which will clearly state that we do not tolerate the direct or indirect offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of bribes in any form. Facilitation payments are also prohibited. Should we discover that bribery or fraud allegations are imposed against any third party performing work for Thermopatch, we will review our relationship with that party and take appropriate action. Actions planned: Further set-up of anti-corruption policy in our Code of Conduct. This will conduct specific instructions to staff, such as requirements to avoid or declare potential conflicts of interest, and others that concern the offer or acceptance of gifts and hospitality. Measurement of outcomes: There have been no cases of corruption in the line of our work over the course of the organization’s existence. If such a situation might arise, Thermopatch will take appropriate action and ultimately withdraw from the assignment.

Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) Thermopatch Statement on the Prevention of Slavery and Human Trafficking Thermopatch is a global organization committed to conducting ethical and environmentally responsible business. Thermopatch fully supports the aims of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”) and is committed to operating free from forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. We have a zero tolerance approach to forced labour, slavery and human trafficking in any form, in any part of our business or supply chain. As part of the worldwide Thermopatch group of companies, sustainable practices are firmly anchored in our corporate culture, based on our company values of being responsible, excellent and innovative. We apply globally-binding principles that require all employees and managers to behave in an ethical, law-abiding manner. We act responsibly to support economic, environmental and social progress. Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. Thermopatch is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all of our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing systems and controls to help ensure that modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our business or in any of our supply chains. We take our responsibility towards the community very seriously and we will continue to apply a zero tolerance approach – you can find more information about our contribution to society in our Thermopatch Business Ethics Policy Statement SDG 5 Gender Equality: eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls and private spheres, including trafficking, sexual, and other types of exploitation. SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth: take immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking and secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour, including recruitment and use of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour in all its forms THERMOPATCH CONTRIBUTION SDG’s Doing our best to bee helpful Thermopatch supports honey bees by adopting a bee hive of sustainable cedarwood containing a ‘Buckfast’ bee colony. By sponsoring a bee hive we are striving to improve bee health and increase food security for people across the globe. Many domestic and imported fruits and vegetables require pollination. Examples include avocados, soybeans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, squash, sunflowers for oil, cucumbers, citrus fruit, peaches, kiwis, cherries, cranberries and melons. Bees are uniquely vital to our natural surroundings and anyone who eats food, needs bees: no bees = no food! And yet, honey bee colonies throughout the world are suffering unprecedented devastation and are dying at an alarming rate. This decline is one of the single greatest threats to our natural environment today. Our world’s most important pollinators are struggling in both agricultural and wild environments. They are facing many threats such as pest infestations like the parasitic varroa mite or toxic pesticides which have been proven to be very harmful and in many cases fatal to the bee population. For every sponsored bee hive in the Netherlands, another bee hive is placed in Nepal or Africa by the Social Enterprise Liquid Nature, founded by Jessica Loudon whose active in various sustainability projects and became a beekeeper due to her fascination for bees. Our own officially bee friendly municipality Almere celibrated World Bee Day on 20th May 2019 together with Jessica Loudon as being City Hall’s own beekeeper, baking away honey waffels. We are happy to report that our Thermopatch ‘Buckfast’ bee colony are being quite productive and results in harvesting the tastiest honey from our very own backyard which doesn’t hurt either. Ensuring healthy hives contribute to the fulfilment of 2030 Agenda – Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s): SDG 1 No poverty: increasing honey bee populations and beekeeping production systems boost economic growth and reduce poverty and inequalities among communities. SDG 2 Zero hunger: ensuring honey bee populations and production systems contributes to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition. SDG 3 – Good health and wellbeing: increasing quality food intake by including honeybee products in the diet, promotes health by boosting the immune system and quality nutrition. SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth: promoting the inclusion of beekeeping activities in agricultural livelihoods to increase food production and the income of smallholders and family farmers. SDG 13 – Climate action: combating the effects of climate change through improving a general environmental health and forestation. Bees are a sensitive indicator to environmental changes. SDG 15 – Life on land: breeding hives increase pollination and environmental biodiversity. Breeding hives increase pollination which is able to increase quantity and quality of crops. Breeding hives thus means to guarantee the productions of the other agro-livestock sectors.
