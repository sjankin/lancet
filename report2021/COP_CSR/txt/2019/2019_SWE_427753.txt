Our warehouse staff had found a pair of luxury-brand sunglasses mixed in with the items she had returned and sent an email that her sunglasses would be returned. This made me think. First, I was happy that our customer shared her experience as we live off happy customers. She told her contacts about what happened with a remark that this was “In our view outstanding customer service. She did not have to, but she did – and I appreciate it. the ‘care-why’ is the difference Second, I was proud of our warehouse staff, who recognised that a personal item was accidently placed in the return bag and took the time and care to make sure Anne got between the it back.

Nobody would have noticed if he had not done it. But he chose to act. To do something about it. To go the extra mile to make sure that Anne would get her sunglasses back and demonstrated what we in our company call “care-why”. In my experience people go through different phases in their professional lives. First, they learn the “know-what”, next they build a “know-how”, and this is followed by a “know-why”. Provided they work long enough; most people will eventually master these three steps. The exceptional people will reach a fourth level that we call “carewhy”, where they demonstrate a passion for their profession, their customers and their company. They not only know why they care. In our view the “care-why” is the difference between the ordinary and the exceptional. It “We are in this is the “care-why” that provides the outstanding customer experience and it is the “carefor the long run, why” that makes the customer return. and we will have A year of many ups and a few downs to accept that Our people have demonstrated “care-why” throughout the year, by not only elevating the profitability the customer satisfaction scores to an all-time high, but by also taking us successfully journey will not through a year of many challenges. be linear.” The seasons this past year in the Nordics were extraordinary, with a cold and long winter followed by an exceptionally warm and long summer. Following this the trading environment has been unusual and has required great agility and flexibility from our people to maneuver during the year. Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 9 Letter to the shareholders With 38% growth for the full year, we continued our strong momentum. We attracted more new customers than ever before while our existing customers increased our share of their wallet. “The categories, Our categories started their lift off during the year, where our sports category got a boost from the launch of adidas and Reebok in September. Our beauty category continued including a reto improve the offering with the launch of strong brands like MAC, Urban Decay, Kielhls launched kidsand Estelle & Thild.

The adjusted EBIT was a tad lower than originally expected, but as our new customer intake was higher than ever and our growth was more than double the market all in all it was okay. After all, we are in this for the long run, and we will have to accept that the profitability journey will not be linear, when you grow aggressively and launch new business ventures. Focus and local scale We have benefitted greatly from being focused as well as local. Our strong focus on the mid to premium priced segment and steadfast focus on the local Nordic market, has allowed us to build a strong local infrastructure, -customer proposition and -brand strength with high efficiencies and economies of scale. We believe that this strong local focus will secure the cost leadership needed to operate in such a volatile business environment. We experienced new heights, peaking with an exceptionally well executed Black Friday Strong local weekend, where we had a record high number of new customers, site visits and orders. focus will We found ourselves stretching our capabilities as has become customary at this time, secure the cost and yet again we succeeded. Our on-site performance as well as our fulfillment and leadership.” distribution were outstanding, witnessed by a Net Promoter Score of around 70 during the weekend and nearly all orders being sent out to the customers by Monday. Meanwhile, we continued the investments in our infrastructure by expanding our warehouse automation and improving our delivery footprint, so more orders are delivered next day as well as improving the same day delivery options. We believe that our delivery proposition in the Nordics is second to none, as most of our customers in the Nordics have the opportunity of getting free next day delivery. Still, we intend to get even better. 10 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 Letter to the shareholders Being good Being a good person has always been part of who we are as individuals and “We are consequently also as an organisation.

In this pursuit, sustainability is becoming more and more crucial for our business’ success and for the industry movement we want to be part of shaping. As we market thirdparty products and do not own or operate any production facility, we are limited in our ability to control our suppliers' own supply chain. This does not excuse us from taking responsibility and we believe our greatest opportunity to contribute to sustainability is by engaging with our supply chain partners. It is the current and future dialogue with our partners and suppliers, such as brands, logistical partners, our customers, and other important stakeholders, that is a focal point for our sustainability work. In addition to the dialogue evolving with our supply chain partners, we work to reduce the direct negative impacts our activities might have on society and on the environment. We are committed to conducting business responsibly, with the highest possible standards of ethics, openness and transparency. Areas of emphasis for our internal sustainability work include high environmental standards at our head office and fulfilment centre through energy consumption and waste management, the working environments of our employees and contractors-, and finally the materials used in our packaging. In 2018, we invested in solar panels for our Boozt Fulfillment Center and took steps toward developing non-fossil biodegradable bags for shipping products to our customers. Internally, we will continue to support and create opportunities for our employees' development. Our employees have an absolutely central role in order for us to enable sustainable change and create results. Continuously improving the conditions for a healthy and efficient workplace is therefore always a priority. Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 21 Management's report Value chain and goals Building blocks for a sustainable future four identified focus areas for sustainable development In 2018, we became a signatory of the UN Global Compact.

We aim to address Goal 9 through: • Promoting innovation and new technical solutions to increase The impact the e-commerce business has on the local resource-use efficiency within our own operations community is hard to estimate. One of the greatest impacts • Promoting and engaging in innovative distribution alternatives is in relation to the transport of goods and how customers transport themselves when picking up packages (or if they SDG 12 choose to receive it by home-delivery). The implications of the e-commerce model contrasted to the brick and mortar shop, where customers transport themselves to the different shops they need to visit, is widely debated but lacking analysis and empirical findings. The true impact in the change of buying patterns is therefore not fully known. But no matter the result we strive to reduce our ecological footprint. Being innovative, especially with respect to distribution, is essential for our operations as well as our ability to stay competitive. This includes finding a more efficient and inventive use of resources, with our packaging material, warehouse technologies and the way goods are transported. Goal 12.

As we market third-party products, we do not own or operate any production facility. Therefore, we consider our greatest opportunity for contributing to sustainability to be through engaging with supply chain partners. 2018 marked the beginning of our efforts to promote sustainable fashion. We began by developing a strategy in order to boost our own awareness about sustainable fashion and enable increased collaboration with brands. The initial focus was on conducting dialogue with our brands and finding ways to better present sustainability information to the customer. In an effort to place the SDGs at the forefront and to align our goals with the UN Global Compact’s business principles, we started to identify partnerships with those brands that could be potential partners for driving our Photo: Marilia Bognandi sustainability agenda forward. Working together for better future brand dialogue In this process of becoming more involved with our brands, Our aim is to support brands that focus on sustainable we will need to address many of the issues within the fashion materials and quality production and design for the industry.

As a retailer, we strive to ensure that any products and goods sold have been produced under safe and fair working conditions.

The implementation of the supplier code of conduct is still ongoing. 2019 – Next level efforts Animal welfare In 2018, we began developing the right parameters for Since 2016, we have declared ourselves fur-free in promoting sustainable choices to our customers.

The Danish and Swedish fashion ethical charter In 2018 we became a member of the Danish Fashion Ethical Charter and the Swedish Fashion Ethical Charter. The purpose of these charters and our commitment is to ensure the well-being of the models within the Danish and Swedish fashion industry.

Brands, in turn, generally put high demands on their suppliers and may be reluctant to take risks that can harm their brand equity, for instance through associations with unproven or sub-scale online retailers. Fulfilment and distribution: Fulfilment and distribution costs are one of the largest cost items for online retailers, in addition to costs of goods sold. These costs are generally improved by local scale, providing lower fulfilment cost per order and better terms with distribution partners. One of the key challenges for online apparel retailers is effectively handling the volume of products resulting from customer returns. Simultaneously, an easy return process is valuable to sustain customer satisfaction and to reduce perceived purchase risk, making return management a substantial entry barrier for new potential entrants. Marketing and customer insight: Efficiency in acquiring new customers is affected by scale, for example, the ability to reach attractive agreements with media providers. Scale also allows for investments in resources to systematically use, analyse and monitor customer data for allocation of resources to those channels that show favourable return on investment.

Risks are identified, assessed and managed based on the Group’s vision and goals. The Group uses the following categories to manage risks; Financial-, Strategic-, Operationaland Compliance risks. Operational risks are continuously evaluated within the daily operations. Management related risks are continuously reviewed by management and documented by the Internal Control Function. Group Management reports monthly to the Board of Directors on potential risk issues. The Board of Directors are responsible to the shareholders for the Group’s risk management and formally assess risks annually or more often when needed. Identified risks are assessed regarding probability of occurrence and impact if occurring. The effectiveness of existing risk responses (such as safeguards, control activities etc.) are qualitatively assessed. The residual risk is illustrated and considers the effectiveness of all current existing risk responses. All identified risks are documented in a risk map and further explained in a risk register, internally called Boozt Risk Library. Risks can be mitigated through proactive actions, such as insurances or legal agreements, and in some cases the Group can influence the likelihood of a risk-related event occurring. Other risks are not possible to eliminate, such as risks dependent on political decisions, or other macroeconomic factors. If a risk is related to events beyond the control of the Company, work is aimed at alleviating the consequences. Overview of identified risks In the following section, we report the identified risks which are considered to have considerable impact on the business as per December 2018. In the Boozt Risk Library we have identified over a hundred risks, however several of them have a relative low risk of occurrence or low possible impact, and therefore are not included in the reported risks below. The relative possibility of occurrence and impact if occurring of the risk changes over time, meaning that the reported risks is to be seen as a snapshot of current risks. The Group disclose the top 20 risk list, which can differ from year to year as some risks might increase in probability or appear for the first time and others might be less probable or is downgraded due to mitigating activities. 84 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 Director's report IMPACT 1.

The differences between the Group's and the parent company's accounting principles are shown below. The below stated accounting principles of the parent company have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the parent company’s financial reports, unless otherwise stated. Subsidiaries Participations in subsidiaries are recognised in the parent company using the acquisition cost method. This means that transaction costs are included in the carrying value of participations in subsidiaries. Financial assets and liabilities Due to the connection between accounting and taxation, the rules on financial instruments in accordance with IAS 39 are not applied in the parent company as a legal entity, but the parent company applies in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the acquisition cost method. In the parent company, thus financial fixed assets are valued at acquisition cost less any impairment loss and financial current assets at the lower of cost or market. Shareholders’ contributions Shareholders' contributions are recognised directly against equity at the recipient and capitalised in shares and participations at the contributor to the extent impairment is not required. Accounting of Group contributions Paid and received Group contributions are recognised as an appropriation. 126 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 Consolidated financial statements Note 2 Audit fees SEK million 2018 2017 Ernst & Young AB Auditing assignments -0.1 Tax advice Other services Deloitte AB Auditing assignments -0.1 Tax advice Other services TOTAL -0.1 -0.1 Note 3 External costs SEK million 2018 2017 IPO related costs -27.1 Other external costs -5.4 -2.5 TOTAL -5.4 -29.6 Boozt AB / Annual Report 2018 127 Consolidated financial statements Note 4 Employees and personnel costs 2018 2017 Average number of employees Average Average number of number of employees Men employees Men Sweden 7 7 7 7 TOTAL 7 7 7 7 GENDER BALANCE AMONG SENIOR EXECUTIVES Board members 8 6 8 5 CEO and other senior executives 7 7 7 7 GROUP 15 13 15 12 Salaries, other remuneration and social costs SEK million 2018 2017 COSTS FOR EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION Salaries and remuneration 51.8 145.4 Social costs 17.2 45.9 Pension costs TOTAL 68.9 191.4 SENIOR EXECUTIVES Hermann Haraldsson (Group CEO): Salaries and remuneration 10.3 46.0 hereof bonuses 0.6 5.7 hereof share based payments 4.8 36.6 Pension costs TOTAL 10.3 46.0 Other senior executives: Salaries and remuneration 36.2 98.7 hereof bonuses 2.8 11.8 hereof share based payments 19.3 76.9 Pension costs TOTAL 36.2 98.7 Senior executives include the Board of Directors, the Group CEO, and other senior executives.
