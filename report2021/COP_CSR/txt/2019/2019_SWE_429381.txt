This is a wise approach when you want to avoid making things unnecessarily complicated; letting moderation and simplicity lead the way, especially when working on sustainable development. That said, in another sense more is always more, and that is when it comes to opportunities. Since both people and companies are unique, a single solution seldom works for everyone. Thanks to our size, we can always offer suitable premises — whatever the tenant’s needs. With more opportunities and options, a broad-minded approach and flexibility in every area, we are a reliable companion to our customers as they move onward and upward. 16 Goals and strategies | Mission, goals and strategy Our mission Business model Wihlborgs has a growth-based business model that rests on two pillars: property management and project management.

At Wihlborgs, we place great importance on creating security for our tenants, employees, partners and investors. We know that a property is built from the ground up. Each building block affects the quality, and if we want to build sustainably then we need to scrutinise the small details that make up the whole. By acting responsibly and taking a long-term view, we can offer the stability needed — an important factor in ensuring both we as people and the company can function and develop. With this security at our core, it could be said that we are delivering a greater future with more options than ever before. 24 Our operations | Market overview Market overview A successful region under way in Brunnshög in Lund, a unique materials research The term “Öresund region” was established in connection with facility based on the world’s most powerful neutron source, the construction of the Öresund Bridge between 1995 and located right next to MAX IV, which is the world’s most powerful 2000, and refers to Skåne and eastern Denmark.

The main part of this increase is due to Energy the fact that we expanded our property portfolio in Denmark Wihlborgs’ energy consumption and choice of energy sources is considerably, and the conversion of our properties there to an area of considerable environmental impact. Wihlborgs’ total renewable energy has not taken place to the same extent as energy consumption was 209 GWh in 2018, which is an increase in Sweden. Furthermore, as a rule it is not possible to purchase of 34 GWh compared with 2017. This increase is primarily based district heating based on renewable sources in Denmark. Of all on growth in Denmark and on now-complete property inforcollected Danish waste, around 90 percent is burnt for use in mation.

We implement energy efficiency-enhancement measures each year in the properties that offer the potential to make savings. It is often a question of fine-tuning each building’s energy system and optimising the ventilation system. Each building is unique, which is why it is important to make an overall assessment of where the measures will have the greatest effect in relation to the investment. The increased proportion of environmentally certified properties, the commitment of our operators and the ambition of the environmental policy are all systematically contributing to highly performing buildings over time. Our own solar power systems Actively exploiting the solar power from our roofs and facades will help us purchase less energy and ensure lower consumption figures. In 2018, we installed and launched new solar panels in Malmö (2 panels), Helsingborg (1) and Lund (1). At the end of 2018, we had solar panels on ten properties with a total maximum power of around 1,000 kWp. During the year, these produced around 600,000 kWh of renewable energy, with the majority being used directly in the building. In conjunction with the redevelopment and extension of Tyréns premises in Malmö, we installed 154 solar panels on the roof.

With support from a digital tool, we will be able to ensure that all environmental instructions are managed and that statuses are registered in every property. We will also introduce a tool governing the treatment of chemicals and decide on a common standard list, as well as install more solar panels as installation costs fall and demand increases among our tenants. The extension of charging options for electric cars will also continue, as will our efforts to enhance biodiversity and comfort in our green spaces. Our ambition is to environmentally certify existing office properties based on SGBC’s new “Miljöbyggnad” — drift & förvaltning” (Environmental building — operation & management) certification and we will likely certify the first new-build project based on the new Miljöbyggnad 3.0 certification. An updated environmental programme and new targets for the area of sustainable properties will also be completed in line with the Group’s overall strategic efforts.
