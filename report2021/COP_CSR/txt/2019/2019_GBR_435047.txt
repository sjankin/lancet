MANAGING DIRECTOR I am pleased to present IMC Worldwide’s Sustainability Report for the year November 2018 to November 2019. This report communicates our progress as members of the United Nations Global Compact (UNCG) and also sets out targets for the year ahead. I am pleased to confirm that IMC Worldwide supports the Ten Principles of the UNCG on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. We are committed to making the UNCG and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals. IMC Worldwide will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognise that a key requirement for participation in the UNCG is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the Ten Principles. This Sustainability Report stands as our COP and will be uploaded to the UNGC website as per the requirements. In line with our company values, we support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the UNCG COP policy. This year, IMC has undergone an internal re-structuring after the temporary suspension of one of our key projects. This led to the need for IMC to announce a proposed restructure involving a collective consultation process. Following closure of the collective consultation, the final restructure was announced in October. This has had a knock-on effect to some of the initiatives being implemented in relation to our commitment to the UNGC and the Sustainable Development Goals. Gavin English Managing Director 28th November 2019 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 OUR APPROACH IMC is a member of the UNCG. Since joining in 2018, IMC has been looking at how we can use the UNGC as a framework for our sustainability efforts and reporting. IMC has taken the UNGC Principles1 as a structure for this report. The Principles are: HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. LABOUR Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Using the four pillars (Human Rights, Labour, Environment, Anti-Corruption) this report summarises the issues or relevance to IMC’s work then discusses IMC’s achievements and targets for next year. 1 https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles 2 1.2 MATERIALITY Last year we undertook a materiality exercise to prioritise the UNGC Principles for IMC. We plotted IMC’s priorities against our stakeholder’s priorities. We then categorised the priorities as follows: P1 Principle P2 P1 e.g. UNGC P4 Principle 1 Top priority P5 Work in Stakeholder Priorities P 10 Progress Not a current P7 priority P8 P6 P9 P3 IMC Priorities Top priorities for IMC and Stakeholders: • Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights • Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses • The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour • The effective abolition of child labour • Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery What IMC can report on and is Work in Progress: • Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges • The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation • Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility What is currently not an IMC priority and will be looked at in the future: • Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies • Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining 3 2 HUMAN RIGHTS Figure 1 Human Rights Pillar progress (percentage) Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the United Nations Global Compact protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principles Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. IMC Worldwide is committed to protecting, securing and promoting SDG’s related to human rights across our work. Our values are integral to the business material issues covered and guides all the work we do. One of our values is ‘Integrity’. We have in this section a steadfast adherence to a strict moral and ethical code. We bring honesty and sincerity to our work, which includes championing for human rights, and not accepting anything less. We do this both through the dedication to the Modern Slavery act, and through zero tolerance on in-country projects. 2.1 ANTI-SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING We have a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains. IMC Worldwide established an “Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy” in November 2017. The policy establishes the company’s commitment to ethical behaviour in the following ways; • our employees and consultants are free to • we prohibit the use of violence, harassment, terminate their employment or engagement intimidation, coercion or bullying, whether physical at any time subject to them complying with or psychological and any threat of any such any lawful contractual obligations which they activities in any circumstances; are required to observe; 4 • we provide clear and transparent information • we prohibit the use of debt bondage or bonded to our employees and consultants about labour; hours to be worked, rates of pay and the • we prohibit the use of disciplinary measures that calculation of legal deductions; include an obligation to work; • wage payments must be paid directly to • we prohibit the practice of compulsory overtime for individuals and at regular intervals in any reason; and accordance with their contract of • we prohibit the practice of workers being charged employment and national law; fees or costs associated with their recruitment – • we do not place any restrictions on the including travel, visa or administrative costs – freedom of movement of any of our staff; irrespective of whether the charges are raised by • we prohibit the confiscating or withholding of an employer, recruitment agent or broker. identity documents or other valuable items, including work permits and travel documentation (e.g. passports, ID cards), bankcards and similar documents; 2.2 DUE DILIGENCE At IMC, we undertake due diligence on all potential collaborators. Due diligence is a process of checks including technical competency, ethical approach and attitude that is carried out to help us make an informed decision about partners, suppliers and Consultants that we work with. The process requires completion of a questionnaire filled by the potential partner, which is checked by IMC before further checks are undertaken. These checks include internet searches and World-Check. The WorldCheck database is part of the Thomson Reuters Risk Management Solutions suite, and contains a list of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and heightened risk individuals and organisations. The database is used around the world to help to identify and manage financial, regulatory and reputational risk. Undertaking these due diligence checks is our first level of assurance that we only engage with ethical and morally responsible partners and individuals. This year, IMC developed a new renewal process for when due diligence expires after a two-year period. Email tracking was also introduced, which allows better central record keeping on our CRM system, Dynamics. 2.3 WHISTLEBLOWING IMC believes strongly in accountability, transparency and respect for individuals. All employees, and programme personnel, company Directors, and third parties are encouraged to raise genuine concerns about possible misconduct in our operations, whether in matters of financial reporting or in any other matter not specifically addressed in our other policies. This is particularly important when the possible misconduct may negatively impact the beneficiaries of IMC Worldwide. Our Whistleblowing policy is designed to: • Support the values and mission of IMC Worldwide. • Ensure that employees, programme personnel, company Directors, and third parties can feel comfortable raising concerns without fear of retribution. • Provide a transparent and confidential process for dealing with concerns including, but not limited to: financial transactions, financial reporting, fraud/corruption, bribery, blackmail, criminal offenses, failure to comply with legal or regulatory obligations; abuse, exploitation, endangering the health and safety of other individuals; endangering the environment; concealment of any of the foregoing concerns. 5 This policy extends to all IMC Worldwide activities and extends to programme personnel, company Directors and other partner and beneficiary organisations with which we work. 6 7 8 9 HUMAN RIGHTS TARGETS Achievements 2019 Targets 2020 Assessed our modern slavery achievements and objectives and Design context specific KPI’s devised a plan to work on any identified improvements Delivered project specific training which Deliver Modern Slavery Essentials included a section on modern slavery training Institutionalise the training of all new starters moving forward Design and deliver specialist training for those designing and managing projects 10 3 LABOUR Figure 2 Labour Pillar progress (percentage) Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; United Nations Global Compact Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and Principles compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. IMC is committed to following best practice when upholding the rights of its workers; recognising that its people are its greatest asset. One of our core values is ‘trust’, and our endeavour to promote this in our working environment is evident in our agile and flexible working policy, which emphasises the SDG’s related to material issues covered importance of a work/life balance and allows in this section considerations for those with younger children. IMC also has a number of initiatives in its Redhill office to promote good health and wellbeing including, Sports and Social committee, walking group and mental health awareness week. 3.1 ETHICAL TRADING INITIATIVE Although IMC are not currently members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), we are still committed to the principles and practices as set out in its base code. As a global business, we are particularly concerned with our actions towards better labour practices in our supply chains, and IMC’s Business Ethics Policy highlights our duty to advocate and adhere to the core labour standards as defined in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998), with our main aim being to eliminate forced, compulsorily and child labour; one of the key principles of the ETI base code. 11 IMC follows a zero-tolerance policy towards Modern Slavery and is committed to ensuring there is transparency throughout our supply chains, consistent with our obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We expect high standards in ethical practices from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners, and they must adhere to the IMC Business Ethics Policy. IMC has made progress to ensuring modern slavery is eradicated in our supply chains in Nepal, with a Supply Chain manager looking specifically into the issue of modern slavery. To reinforce this, our next aim will be to implement modern slavery and child labour audits on all of our high-risk projects. We are also in the process of developing modern slavery training which will form part of the induction process for all individuals, contractors and suppliers and partners who work for any given project with IMC. IMC is dedicated to ensuring that no unlawful ETI Base Code: discrimination occurs against any persons and, as an Equal Opportunity Employer, follows an 1.

Regular employment is provided abuse and harassment from occurring; to protect 9. No harsh or inhumane treatment is people, especially vulnerable adults and allowed children, from that harm; and to respond appropriately when harm does occur. IMC adopts a zerotolerance stance on exploitative and abusive relationships, with Protection from sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and child protection coming under this umbrella term. Safeguarding applies consistently and without exception throughout all of our partners, projects and programmes. IMC’s Safeguarding Policy highlights our governing principles for both our employees, and partner and supplier employees, as well as independent consultants. The purpose of this policy is to protect those who come into contact with IMC employees or programme personnel, with a particular focus on children or at-risk adults. This Safeguarding policy complements our Business Ethics and AntiHarassment and Bullying policies and has been put in place to ensure that IMC, as a business, is taking reasonable steps to prevent harm and to respond appropriately when that harm occurs. Whilst IMC is committed to promoting preventative measures against abuse and exploitation, it recognises that in some circumstances these instances may still occur and that any member of IMC programme personnel might receive a safeguarding report. We are currently in the process of developing essentials safeguarding training for all our employees and working with our programme teams to develop context specific training. IMC is one of the founding members of the Safeguarding Leads Network (SLN). The SLN is a group of committed private sector suppliers that want to work together to share best practice on safeguarding and improve the way the development sector works together to drive up standards. IMC has recently developed our Investigation template and supporting approach for responding to safeguarding cases. This helps to ensure that all cases are handled in a consistent manner and adequate records are kept. 12 IMC often partners with other organisations to deliver our projects. As such we are not always in control of all project operations. Working with our partner organisations to ensure that their safeguarding measures are developed and in place on our projects has been a focus for IMC this year. We have developed a Safeguarding Briefing Note for our partner organisations to assist with this capacity building. 3.3 MANAGING RISK IMC’s RAID matrix is used to identify, analyse and prioritise risks and establish mitigation responses. It now includes mandatory identification of environmental and safeguarding risks. 13 LABOUR TARGETS Achievements 2019 Targets 2020 Finalise and launch Safeguarding Tightened up our safeguarding reporting Investigation Procedures and and investigation procedures implement this as best practice across all of our programmes Conducted a deep dive safeguarding Roll-out modern slavery essentials audit on a partner organisation and training to all staff and integrate this worked with them to improve their training on a rolling schedule systems and processes Modern slavery “essentials” training Implement modern slavery training to developed and ready to be rolled out all independent consultant’s who work next year with us Deliver safeguarding training to all staff Design and deliver specialised safeguarding training to bid and project teams 14 4 ENVIRONMENT Figure 3 Environment Pillar progress (percentage) Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; United Nation Global Compact Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principles Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. SDG’s related to material issues At IMC, we understand the importance of the covered in this section environment, our environmental responsibilities and the need to proactively approach and meet environmental challenges. It is our vision to be an environmentally conscious and sustainable organisation which can be trusted by our clients. It is our objective to carry out all measures reasonably practicable to continually improve our performance to reduce environmental impacts. We have identified seven objectives that will improve our environmental performance and benchmark IMC against the best-in-class to try to ensure we demonstrate leadership in this area. These are: UK Head Office Environmental Management Principal Objectives 1. Increase the use of sustainable transport 2. Improve waste management by reducing waste to landfill 3. Reduce the use of electricity and waste of water 4. All major purchases (fridges, IT equipment, etc) purchased to have high environmental rating and be well maintained. Procurement Objectives 5. Proactively promote environmentally and socially conscious procurement practices. 15 Staff Awareness and Training Objectives 6. Good awareness and compliance of EMS objectives within the company (UK) through delivery of regular internal training events. Overseas Impact Objectives 7. Monitoring annual level of flight carbon emissions, raising awareness of impacts, setting targets and encouraging the reduction of project-related and non-project related flights. We improve and manage our environment through our Environmental Management System (EMS) which is accredited to ISO14001:2015 and part of our wider Integrated Management System (IMS). Our commitment is set out in our Environmental Policy: this demonstrates our environmental responsibility and sets out our vision in regard to managing the environmental challenges. Additionally, we are also integrating environmental issues into our project management processes through continuous project risk assessments. We are part of the Paris Pledge for Action; committing to managing our climate and environmental footprint and recognising our responsibility to support the objectives of the Paris Agreement. As part of this we monitor and endeavour to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our flights. What we are doing We are promoting sustainable practices through encouraging walking, cycling or public transport to/ from work and for business travel. We are also promoting sustainable procurement and use of resources, good recycling behaviours and more. This is undertaken through raising awareness, training, regular reminders to staff and signage. We are managing the carbon footprint from our office, office equipment and flights. We have also introduced a range of incentives aimed at reducing our emissions including monitoring flights taken, introducing better video conferencing facilities and energy efficient office equipment. This has led to a drop in energy usage and the number of flights booked per person. One key success has been introducing food waste. We have also seen reductions of about 10% per year in our paper usage per employee due to the improvement of online tools. We are also moving towards sustainable procurement practices such as purchasing energy efficient equipment and more environmental or social alternatives. We will continue to work on this element into 2020 along with other improvements including training, further work on our flight management and improving the sustainability of our procurement practices. Below highlights our environmental performance for the past year. 16 Highlights of Head Office Environmental Performance We are moving towards energy efficient electronics Rainwater is harvested for use Better Video Conferencing in the toilets.

A business that holds itself to consistent moral and ethical standards earns the respect of its peers and the trust of its clients. Reinforced by a robust code of ethics, business integrity can be achieved in the application and enforcement of a set of guiding principles governing the actions of the firm, its staff and business partners. SDG’s related to IMC has a policy that outlines its approach to business integrity in two material issues covered parts: a Code of Ethics and a Code of Conduct. Our Code of Ethics in this section outlines the ethical principles of IMC Worldwide Ltd, its staff and our business partners, representing the aspirations of the firm at the business level. Our Code of Conduct translates these principles into practical guidance that empowers IMC Worldwide Ltd, its staff, its business partners and their employees to realise these aspirations. Other related policies include: • Gifts and hospitality policy • Whistleblowing policy 5.1 ACCREDITATION IMC has been accredited by the ISO 37001 standard for Anti Bribery Management Systems. Our compliance to this standard covers all our operations – both in the UK and abroad. 19 5.2 LEADERSHIP Gavin English our Managing Director is the Director responsible for Ethical Compliance at IMC. The management system is supported by our Anti-Bribery Compliance Manager and our Business Improvement Team. 5.3 COMMUNICATION Communication around anti-corruption and bribery is very important to the way we work. Our policies are shared on our website, they appear in our Job Descriptions and our contracts. During recruitment we ask questions around ethics and we make sure we have references for anyone who works with us, even if it is for a short or medium-term project. 5.4 MANDATORY TRAINING IMC has invested in online training for all our people. Our CRM system helps us manage this process as we work with lots of different individuals each year. 5.5 DUE DILIGENCE IMC undertakes due diligence on all our partner organisations, independent consultants and new starters. This involves a standard questionnaire that is completed by the prospective external party. Internal checks are then carried out to complete a background search. We use the Thompson Reuter’s Risk Intelligence Software to run our checks – this is an efficient way to look at a great volume of publicly available information. This year, IMC developed a renewal process for after due diligence has expired after the two-year approval period. Email tracking was also introduced, which allows better central record keeping on our CRM system Dynamics. 5.6 RISK MANAGEMENT Our programmes take place in complex environments where corruption risks are high. IMC assesses risk at various stages of our Business Development and Project Implementation cycles. Mitigation measures are reviewed at the corporate level answering the question – are our procedures still adequate? Each programme then has its own risk matrix which is monitored by the project manager on the job. Our head office operations including finance and recruitment are also assessed, mitigation measures are then put in place and monitored. 5.7 AUDIT AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IMC is subject to an external audit against our ISO Standards each year. We also carry out our own reviews throughout the year. Our projects are subject to Project Health Checks, here a project is reviewed against applicable procedures. Where necessary the findings of the Health Checks result in Corrective Actions that are taken forward by the Project Manager. 20 Business Development audits are also being carried out. These determine whether a bid has been completed and submitted following IMC’s standard procedure. This audit involves the use of a RAG rating system which outlines any key trends in non-conformances. These findings are shared with the Board and circulated to the wider company in a monthly bulletin. 21 ANTI CORRUPTION TARGETS Achievements 2019 Targets 2020 Completed and passed our first ISO Senior Management training on 37001 audit with no non-conformances requirements under ISO 37001 New quantifiable scoring criteria added Re-launch due diligence training and to our Master Risk Register that aligns Institutionalise this as part of training for with project risk analysis all new staff moving forward Undertook regular Business Development audits and Project Health Launch new due diligence procedures Checks which looked at due diligence for local (in country) staff and other processes that fall under our Anti-bribery Management Systems A Whistleblowing investigation template Launch newly developed two-tier due was developed and put into action on a diligence process live case 22 6 CHARITY FUND 6.1 BACKGROUND Due to an internal re-structure at IMC and a shift in priorities across the business, the IMC Charity Fund has been put on hold for 2019. The section below provides an outline of the purpose, process and aims of the fund, and also outlines the success of the projects funded in 2018. Launched in 2015, the IMC Charity Fund is an integral part of our CSR initiatives. We will aim to allocate £10,000 to the fund which is used to help charitable and sustainable initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty in the regions where IMC operates. SDG’s related to material The mission of the IMC Charity Fund is: issues covered in this section “To go even further in our goal to eradicate poverty and complement what the international community is already doing.” The Charity Fund and mission was formulated with three key objectives in mind; (1) Support the beneficiaries of IMC programmes, aiming to increase the overall value of our work, (2) Help the most vulnerable become more resilient, (3) Contribute to tackling a range of key issues across the developing world. For proposals to be eligible, they must be located in an IMC project country, and be linked to an ongoing IMC project, while expanding the reach and impact on the poor. All IMC employees are invited to submit ideas. The Charity Fund process contains a series of steps. Firstly, once a member of staff had an idea of a project where the IMC charity Fund could add extra value and impact, a meeting will be scheduled with the Charity Committee team to discuss the potential intervention, including strengths, potential weaknesses and sustainability. Depending on how well formed the idea already was, this could either be a one-off meeting, or one in a series. After a joint effort of ideation and scoping, the applicant staff will produce a one-page document for submission and discussion, including impact expected and budget. The one pager will then be discussed with independent evaluation volunteers, who had not been previously involved, as a level of quality assurance. Finally, the applications are passed to the IMC Board for voting. 6.2 2018 PROJECTS In 2018, we received a total of 4 applications for funding, requesting a total budget of £17,600. Ultimately, two were approved by the Board; Sierra Leone Plastic Recycling Disposal of solid waste in Freetown has become a major problem in the city resulting in a diversity of environmental health hazards. Of particulate concern are the occupational health risks associated with the urban poor who pick out recyclable waste from the waste at the waste dump sites in the city. While a non-profit initiative called LePlastics was originally identified, some issues surfaced afterwards. Suitable solutions are currently being investigated. 23 Yangon Alley Gardens The Alley Garden Project is an urban regeneration initiative aimed at collective stewardship of “wasteland”, enhancing social capital and contributing to community space and city greening. The project focuses on Yangon’s many unhygienic back alleys and intends to demonstrate the possibility of utilising these wastelands for recreation, food production, art and social cohesion purposes, while also raising awareness of better waste management methods. The project will be delivered in collaboration with Yangon City Development Committee (YCDC), who are responsible for the initial clean up, fixing of the sewerage, and repaving of the alleyway; after which Doh Eain completes further upgrades for the space. Example Before Example After For IMC, Doh Eain research indicates that 27th-28th Middle block is ready for a project to begin. The space has recently been repaired by YCDC and we have had interest from local representatives of the area. Work is expected to begin in late 2018 or early 2019. 24 CHARITY FUND TARGETS Achievements 2019 Targets 2020 Relaunch of the Charity Fund after the Not applicable for 2019 pause in 2019 due to the company’s internal re-structuring Approve new projects to continue to improve the lives of the world’s poor 25 7 INDEXES/APPENDICES Table 1: SDG cross reference chart Section Material Issue Related SDG Human Rights Anti-slavery and human trafficking Policy and Statement. 8Decent work and economic growth Labour 2018 UK head office refurbishments, Sport and Social 3 Good health committee, Agile and Flexible working Policy. 8 Decent work and economic growth Supply chain Manager hired in Nepal specifically to look into modern slavery. 10 Unlawful Discrimination Equal opportunities employer with two visa licenses.
