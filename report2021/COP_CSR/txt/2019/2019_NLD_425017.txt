Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 5 Statement of continued support To our stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that Ximedes continues its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we will describe the actions we have made to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Rene Hodde CEO Ximedes Software B.V. Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 6 UN Global Compact The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic alliance between companies. These companies commit to the fact that they connect their operations and organizational strategies to the ten worldwide accepted principles, on 4 domains: human rights, labor, environment and anticorruption. The UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enable these 10 principles in their entire environment. The goal is that people and nature are better treated and this leads to a pure work and living understanding between humans, nature and use of raw materials. Eventually it is the explicit expression of a joint responsibility to not exhaust the world and its inhabitants. For Ximedes the ten principles seem obvious. Unfortunately this is not so obvious in big parts of the world and even within many companies within Europe and the Netherlands. The chance that you engage in business with other companies that do not adhere these principles is always present and Ximedes wants to be aware and stay aware of that fact. With our support we want to explicitly show our support of the Global Compact. Commitment of companies can be a strong engine, especially when united. That is why Ximedes is member of the United Nations Global Compact. Communication of the ten principles The 10 principles of the UN Global Compact are included in our Handbook (code of conduct) and on our internal information site. We have informed our employees about the UN Global Compact during our formal mandatory two monthly community meeting (Tuning). Candidates for vacant positions within Ximedes are also informed about our commitment. Our corporate social responsibilities in general, and the 10 principles in particular, are standard topics in the annual job control meetings. We wrote about the 10 principles on our website and in our newsletter to make our clients, suppliers, employees and partners understand our position regarding these principles. Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 7 HUMAN RIGHTS principles Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Assessment, Policy and goals As a company and on personal behalf of all our employees we state to respect the internationally proclaimed Human Rights and like to go beyond that. We think it is important to stimulate good behavior to others by setting the right example. We aim to cooperate with business partners that think alike. Some of the most relevant rights are: rights to non-discrimination, equal pay for equal work, just and favorable remuneration, a safe and healthy work environment, physical and mental health, rest and leisure, privacy, freedom of association. Implementation In our annually published business plan we address our culture and HR aspects in separate chapters. The business plan is distributed to our employees, major clients, shareholders and the bank. Our Work/Employee council cares for the benefits of our employees. They have regular meetings with the management team about decisions made. Our employees are informed in several ways about the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact, starting with the job interview, in job control meetings, in joint company meetings and finally on the internal information website. Our HR department oversees the principles in our day-to-day behavior and processes. Measurement of outcomes Ximedes holds an employee satisfaction survey amongst all employees. This is filled out during our job control meetings and is therefore measured throughout the whole year. We also hold a client satisfaction survey amongst several customers once a year. No issues have been reported so far in relation to (potential) human rights violations, nor was Ximedes involved in any human rights incidents before or during the reporting period. The HR manager reports to the MT in the MT meeting about ongoing HR issues. Our work / employee council writes a yearly report. Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 8 LABOUR principles Principle 3 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4 the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5 the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6 the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Assesment, Policy and goals In our working conditions document (“Code voor Werken”) we address our culture and agreed policies, conditions and rights and assimilate the Global Compact principles. Every employee has a copy of this conditions. Regularly we update these conditions due to law-changes, improvements and changed or new conditions and rights. In Q1 of 2018 a complete new Handbook with several improvements for both the company and the employees is released. There is no discrimination of race, religion or sexual preference at Ximedes. Men and women are equally rewarded within their position. Within Ximedes and nX, the HR manager serves as confidant / counselor. If necessary there is also a neutral confidant at the Arbodienst to treat complaints of sexual intimidation, discrimination, aggression or violence. Our Work/Employee council cares for the benefits of our employees. They have regular meetings with the management team. They safeguard our employees working conditions and equal opportunities. Ximedes works with various function levels in which the roles that an employee can fulfill within Ximedes are described. Every function level has a salary range (minimal/maximal salary), a maximal set expanse payment and devices that are issued by Ximedes. Ximedes has a diverse workforce. Men and women have equal opportunities. We employ employees from different nationalities. Implementation Ximedes strongly believes that employee satisfaction and shared goals are crucial to achieve the best business result. Therefore additional effort is being made on communication. There are different channels of communication towards all the employees of Ximedes, including our workers in Novi Sad: o management messages o newsletters o emails o formal letters o the internal information website o informal biweekly community meetings (chats) o formal mandatory bimonthly community meeting (tunings) o presentations during lunchtime (lunch sessions) o team meetings o work / employees council meetings with the management o Management meetings with principals o job control meetings Ximedes is a company with a flat organisation structure. We have an open door policy throughout the company. Biweekly we organize an informal community meeting where each team informs everybody about the development in their project. We also organize a formal mandatory bimonthly community Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 9 meeting where a business update is given by one of the MT members regarding the overall state of affairs. During both meetings employees can ask questions about anything they want. During coffee and Friday afternoon drinks employees we have the opportunity to speak informally to each other. Since 2015 we have a new and improved retirement pension insurance for all of the Ximedes employees in the Netherlands. In addition to the pension insurance Ximedes offers a collective WGA / WIA insurance for in case employees become unfit for work and lose their pension rights. Ximedes also decided to a decent healthcare insurance and a pension insurance for our workers in Novi Sad, in addition to the poor social facilities in Serbia. These insurances are implemented in the first half year of 2017. Measurement of outcomes In 2014 we started to do the employee satisfaction survey during the yearly job control meeting, so we measure employee satisfaction during the whole year instead of once a year. In 2016 we scored a 7,3 on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is the best. In 2018 we scored a 7,8. Besides this survey yearly job control meetings and a review session are organized for every employee where we give our employees the opportunity to address issues. These are also powerful tools for HR to monitor how an employee is doing. Employees can always make an appointment besides these fixed formal moments of contact. The HR manager reports to the MT about ongoing HR issues weekly. Our work / employee council writes a yearly report. Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 10 ENVIRONMENTAL principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Assesment, Policy and goals Ximedes values the environment and tries to have as little impact as possible on the environment. We try to do this by creating awareness amongst our employees and by providing them with tools. Our policy regarding the environment is written in our Handbook (code of conduct). Ximedes is housed in an environmentally friendly building. Our Work/Employee council has regular meetings with the management team. They can give suggestions about improvements that can be made to improve our behavior regarding the environment. In 2018 a special working group that is engaged in the further sustainability of Ximedes has been established. Implementation Ximedes implements the following actions: o we choose the most sustainable solutions for mobility, we reduce the number of lease cars every year and we allow employees to choose only hybrid, phev or electric cars o next to our office three double charging stations for max 6 electrical cars are placed o we install only energy saving laptops en computerscreens, 75% of our computer hardware is energy saving o we encourage employees to recycle o we are supplied with green electric power o we have equipped all rooms with sensors that activate the lights when someone is near and turn off when nobody is in the room o we use as many energy saving lamps as possible o we are housed in a building that uses hot and cold storage to save energy for heating and cooling the building. This results in a 40 – 80% save o we recycle old PC’s and printers o we use green datacenters for hosting o our billing process is digitalized to save paper o we use coffee with Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade en biological certificates o all waste is collected separately o we encourage video conferencing instead of traveling to partners and clients o within Europe we prefer to travel by train above the plane o server virtualization is applied o we print as little as possible and when we print we do it double sided o In 2018 we put all employees in possession of a Rocketbook, an erasable and reusable notepad so paper notebooks are hardly needed anymore Regarding activities designed around supporting the local community we firmly believe in employee initiatives that comes up, that we review and then decide to actively support. This year we participated in sponsor cycling events to collect funds for deseases like cancer. We support universities and highschools by offering trainee positions so that young ICT students get acquinted with the profession. We also supported local initiatives with donating a teamtraining for a guide dog and a Christmas Celebration that almost could not be celebrated because of financial problems of a local parish. Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 11 Measurement of outcomes The HR manager reports regularly on progress on mobility, housing and facilities. We have brought down the number of company cars. We also do not offer a company car to new employees who apply for a position which does not require often travel.

Ximedes – UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 12 ANTI-CORRUPTION principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery; Assesment, Policy and goals Currently there are no written guidelines for employees on how to act in case of bribary or extortion. We haven’t yet come across situations that might have corruption risk. We are however very keen on not working together with corrupted parties. Ximedes prohibits the offering, the giving, the solicitation or the acceptance of any bribe, whether cash or other inducement to or from any person or company by any individual employee, in order to gain any commercial, contractual or personal advantage. We have a no cash policy. All payments are done by bank transfers. Our Work/Employee council has regular meetings with the management team. During these meetings issues regarding anti-corruption can be reported or discussed. Our Financial statement and corresponding processes and policies are independently audited by Ernst & Young accountants resulting in a Financial statement report. (see http://www.ey.com/). Implementation Ximedes is very supportive of an anti-corruption policy. We win bids for new assignments because of our knowledge in the market, quality and price. We do not accept bribes. Our actions are completely transparent. There is an active bid/no bid process in which we decide to bring out offers. In that process we also assess the client from an ethic point of view. Measurement of outcomes There have been no cases of corruption in the line of work over the course of the organization’s existence. If such a situation might arise, Ximedes will take appropriate action and ultimately withdraw from the assignment. The situation will be evaluated afterwards. Our work / employee council writes a yearly report. The HR manager reports to the MT about ongoing HR issues weekly. Our yearly company statement report is yearly audited by an external and independent accountant named EY. Their report is in summery published and fully available on request.
