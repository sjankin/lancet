We have combined our sustainability report, which follows GRI standards, and UN Global Compact report. In the combined report, we describe our actions to continuously improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations.

The Global Reporting Initiative Content index is available on page 56 and on our website. 3.1 Reporting period, reporting cycle The sustainability reports have been published every second year starting from the year 2012. An exception was in 2016 (25.10.2016), when the report for 2014-2016 was published. The one-year delay was due to a renewal and implementation of our new corporate strategy. Our sustainability report is available in electronic format as of year 2017 and it is published annually. 3.2 Material aspects and boundaries Our sustainability reporting focuses on our relevant impacts on our entire value chain as well as on topics that are most important to our business. The material aspects reflect Ensto's strategic priorities and our customers' and other stakeholders' sustainability requirements. UN Global Compact principles guide our reporting topics 15 as well as key performance indicators determined in the GRI Standard Guidelines. Material aspects have been defined internally in sustainability framework process. We have concentrated on reporting environmental and social responsibility. As we are a family company, we have chosen not to publish our economic figures externally and therefore only limited amount of financial data is included in this report. 3.3 Ensto's impact on sustainability through the value chain Ensto’s role in the value chain is described below. As an electrical solutions provider and manufacturer, the most important stakeholders for us are material and component suppliers, where our purchases make the biggest impact on economic, social and environmental topics.

The responsible leadership at Ensto is expressed in several areas. For environmental reasons, we adopted a smart heating solution at our Keila factory, where a computer is responsible for optimum heating management, explains Kaarel Suuk, Director of the Ensto Ensek Keila plant. In community projects, the company has actively sought ways to contribute to the goals of the local people, both in Keila and in the Lasnamäe district. The non-governmental organization Responsible Business Forum Estonia issues quality labels in gold, silver and bronze categories. The competition allows businesses to analyze how positive their impact is on their surroundings, in order to find ways to improve this, as well as to profit from it as a company. 4.2 Vision Zero Forum Certificate The Vision Zero Forum has awarded in April 2018 annual safety level certifications to workplaces that have continuously improved their occupational safety.

Vision Zero Forum is a Finnish national network for workplaces sharing a genuine desire for continuous improvement of occupational health and safety. The main principle of the Forum is to share successful practices and to learn from each other. 5 COOPERATION WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS Stakeholders are considered an integral party of the organization, as they are important for us. We find it necessary to understand the needs and expectations of our stakeholder to ensure customer satisfaction, to meet compliance obligations and continuously improve our stakeholder management. Our activities are based on the 18 stakeholder analysis in 2017. The analysis increased our understanding of the needs and expectations of our stakeholders and pointed out the positive, negative and changing influences from a range of stakeholders. For us, being a trusted partner as smart electrical solution provider, contributing to enhance nature's wellbeing is self-evident. We aim continuously to build an open and transparent dialogue with our stakeholders to find together the best practices to achieve a more sustainable and socially responsible world. We are doing this by actively developing our relationships with employees, customers, communities, suppliers, students and other stakeholder groups. Through our sustainable and smart solutions, we are able to create basis for better life with electricity. From sustainability point of view, our key stakeholders are Ensto's personnel, customers, owners and suppliers. We also actively work with students, communities and authorities. 5.1 Communicating with our stakeholders We feel effective and open communication is a critical part of the quality management system. Our key communication objectives are to provide and obtain relevant and accurate information, reach critical stakeholders and fulfil the compliance obligations. With timely information, we want to promote quality, safety and environmental matters and thus encourage the usage of best practices. Our main external communication channel is Ensto's web page (www.ensto.com) and newsletters. We publish a stakeholder magazine Ensto Today once a year. We also use social media, such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, to communicate with our stakeholders and share our news. Environmental aspects are mainly communicated through the sustainability report, web pages and Ensto Today stakeholder magazine. Internally our main communication channels are Ensto's intranet, newsletters, info screens, briefings and trainings. 19 5.2 Our main stakeholders and their expectations STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS OUR ACTIONS Customers  Good service level, quality products  Improving the price-quality ratio product and solution which fulfil the standards, competitive development processes pricing  Involving customers in product development projects  Competitive future offering  Developing sales management  Long-term customer relationships  Making sustainability one of the main criteria in our  Local presence in each market area product development  Sustainable and responsible operation  Training programs for customers  Participating fairs  Technical support Employees  Permanent jobs and long-term careers  Development actions based on employee feedback  Fair and equal treatment  Developing leadership and competence skills  Safe working environment  Job rotation  Opportunities for training and personal  Promoting employee health and safety development  Wellbeing –framework  Professional leadership  Positive work environment Suppliers  Responsibility and liquidity  Conducting business in a reliable and responsible way  Long-term business relationships  Open pricing policy  Clearly defined requirements  Supplier Code of Conduct and Supplier Requirement  Open communication and accurate Guidelines published on our website information  Regular partner meetings  Support in competence development  Involving suppliers in development projects Owners  Long term value creation and strategy  Implementing a new Ensto strategy  Competent employees  Responsible risk management and good management  Responsible risk management and of code of conduct corporate governance  Acting as a trusted partner for all our stakeholders  Excellent global Ensto reputation  Taking care of our employees Authorities  Compliance with laws and regulations  Payment of taxes  Payment of taxes  Compliance with laws and regulations  Reliable employer  Active dialog with regulators and participating work  Active participation in regulation groups definition process  Open dialogue Students and  Trainee and summer job opportunities  Hire students for summer jobs  Thesis opportunities  Offer intern, trainee and thesis positions universities  Visits in Ensto  Sponsoring and taking part in student events  Sponsoring and scholarships  Take part in responsible summer job campaign in Finland  Host visits at Ensto  Cooperation projects with universities in Finland, Estonia and in France  Take part in development of curriculum in Finland and in Estonia Communities  Sponsoring  Sponsoring sport clubs and teams  Open communication  Corporate communication in website  Cooperation round table sessions with  Hosting school visits other companies in same industrial area  Cooperation with local municipalities (Estonia) to share best practices including sustainability topics 20 5.3 Examples of stakeholder co-operations Best Customer Loyalty Measurement Best customer loyalty is certainly one of the pillars of the Ensto strategy and customer satisfaction is one of the major factors that lead to success of the company. That is why in 2018, Ensto started Best Customer Loyalty Measurement, which will provide answers to following questions:  What should be done, in order to get a big picture how customers perceive the company?  What kind of actions should be taken up to improve customer loyalty and overall satisfaction?  How likely are customers to recommend Ensto as such, as well as Ensto products and solutions?  What kind of expectations Ensto customers have regarding joint development of solutions? In 2018, the project started in Finland, Sweden and France, and included definition of customer loyalty at Ensto and drivers that mostly influence it, as well as creation of customer experience metrics and process for feedback collection. In 2018, we had several customer audits where customers either audited our own factories or even audited our suppliers operations. Students and Universities At Ensto, we see students as a valuable resource of future's workforce. We want to influence on young people's attitude towards technology industry and show how interesting and versatile branch of business this is. Students also bring up new ideas and give us a hint in which direction the world is going to. 21 Ensto has cooperation with Technical University in Tallinn and in Helsinki. We participate yearly in different kinds of student events, give lectures, and invite students to visit our factories. In 2018, we had multiple student groups visiting and getting to know Ensto's factories in several countries. During these visits, we tell the young people about our company, our business and future possibilities Ensto can offer them as an employer, e.g. opportunity to do their master thesis, summer jobs, internship positions and working opportunities. In 2018, we had almost 100 summer trainees working in our factories and offices among our regular professionals. Ensto has already in several years joined the responsible employer campaign and got positive feedback from the summer trainees in Finland. Children and youth Children and youth are the most important target groups of Ensto's sponsorships. Ensto wants to support well-being and physical exercise of children and youth in those communities, we are located. As a family company, Ensto wants to support families in the surrounding community, and thus help family well-being. Ensto supports primarily team sports, since this demonstrates Ensto's basic corporate values of interaction and collaboration, as well as supporting team play rather than an individual's performance. One of the main goals of sponsorship for Ensto is to do concrete acts and to be an active and responsible part of society. Through sponsorship, we interact with our stakeholder groups. We collaborate with many good projects and organizations, focus being in social and environment responsibility programs. In 2018, we have supported multiple children sport clubs in the countries we are actively present. For example in Czech we sponsor Junior Football League, in Finland we have supported children athletics teams and associations. 22 60 years and more than 60 good acts In 2018, we celebrated Ensto's 60th birthday by engaging in 60 acts to make the world a better place. All Ensto countries contributed and shared good with local communities. We ended up realizing altogether 63 good acts for better life and for a better future, and affected hundreds and hundreds of lives during the year. For example, a better life with electricity was given to children in playgrounds and schoolchildren in Estonia, and the elderly in the UK, quality of electricity was improved with a phase balancer in Lithuania, and equality was brought to Kenya with solar panels. Electric traffic was supported by dozens of electric vehicle charging points in Finland and Norway, and Finland's first electric aircraft also had its maiden flight with the support of Ensto. In addition, Ensto people took part in the World Cleanup Day in eight countries, planted trees in three locations, ran and cycled to raise money for good causes, and supported dozens of organizations and sports clubs in their important activities. One of the first good acts of the year was also the introduction of Ensto's new, ecological packages. All good Acts and stories are available at ensto.com/60acts, and in addition, they are gathered to a video. Spreading the word on Ensto EVC solutions Ensto offers many excellent solutions for electric vehicle charging (EVC). There have been many great efforts in 2018 to distribute practical information on setting up the infrastructure to enable EVC and increase the awareness on the benefits of electric transport in general. Webinars are a great example on this topic. Ensto EVC webinars are targeted for various people ranging from electric designers to anyone interested in EV charging. We have produced a webinar series based on our own online guidebook on how to how to design EVC infrastructure. Ensto's Solution Manager Päivi Linteri and Janne Kaperi, the host of @Koti on Finnish TV channel MTV Cooperation with networks and forums Ensto works actively in many networks and forums.

With electricity. For us sustainability means responsible operation in all our actions. We constantly seek ways to reduce our energy consumption and operate more efficiently. We concentrate our efforts in the areas that account for most of our environmental impact to effectively enhance our overall performance; namely the use of raw materials, the consumption of electricity and the generation of non-recyclable waste. We contribute to building a better society with electricity by providing smart solutions and services, improving energy efficiency and focusing on sustainable development. To accomplish this, we aim to be at the front line of the electrical systems and supplies industry in producing clean, recyclable, trusted, and innovative products and solutions that have a long lifetime and a low environmental impact over their life cycle. We do our utmost to run our business in ethical manners through the whole value chain. We value human rights, and health and safety working conditions and expect our suppliers to do so too. We are committed to promote responsible practices in our supply chain, while ensuring that our sourcing and supplier relationships deliver a competitive advantage. We expect our suppliers and partners to respect our values, policies and way of doing business when engaging in business activities with us. We see sustainability as part of our everyday actions. 5.5 Our sustainability approach Sustainability at Ensto is guided by various principles. The main principles are defined in the Ensto's Employee Code of Conduct as well as our main policies: Quality and Environmental Policy and Safety and Health Policy. These, together with our values guide our sustainable way of working. Our sustainability framework follows Ensto's new business strategy. We have defined four sustainability themes by focusing on our main stakeholders' needs and requirements. These focus areas are put into practice through concrete action plans that are followed at all levels of the organization. Theme owners have been appointed by the Ensto Management Team members. These persons are responsible for developing and enhancing these themes. We have set sustainability targets within our 4 sustainability themes. Progress is reported annually. 25 6 SUSTAINABILITY TARGETS Progress in our sustainability targets is reported below.

This is done by offering equal opportunities and training to our employees, invest in wellbeing and work satisfaction. This theme also aims at raising the environmental awareness of our employees and other stakeholders. Smart Solution Creation Smart Solution Creation concentrates on supporting customers in sustainability by creating smart and safe solutions with low environmental impact. We seek ways to reduce energy consumption of our products with smart technology. We are embedding sustainability into internal processes by prioritizing materials with low environmental impact and developing product lifecycle management. Responsible Sourcing In Responsible Sourcing we concentrate on increasing transparency in sourcing activities. We aim to set clear, transparent and fair criteria and processes when choosing and managing suppliers and partners. We focus on that supplier criteria is communicated, understood and followed throughout the whole supplier chain. Lean Manufacturing and Delivery Within the theme Lean Manufacturing and Delivery we concentrate on efficient operation by reducing energy consumption and material wastage, minimizing environmental impacts and utilizing circular economy. We put lot of effort on maintaining and improving high quality, energy efficient production methods and ensuring safe working conditions. 29 All of the themes are based on our strategy, which include our values, ethical principles, policies and guidelines, sustainability management, principles of UN Global Compact, well-being of local communities and dialogue with our stakeholders. 7 BEST EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCE At Ensto we see our employees as the greatest asset of the company. As a family business, we value the dedication, motivation, and spirit that Ensto people demonstrate in their daily work. We believe that satisfied, happy and professional employees serve our customers best. We value diversity, openness and competence of our people and meaningful work. We treat each other with respect and welcome new employees warmly to the Ensto family. We truly care for our people and, together with our employees, take responsibility for their well-being. We do our utmost to provide a safe and rewarding working environment and offer a high-quality occupational health care. We want to be an attractive employer for both current and potential employees. We consider close collaboration, based on trust capital, creativity and winning together, with our customers, suppliers, students, and the local communities, as integral part of the best employee experience. 7.1 Personnel – diversity as a strength We believe that engaged and skilled personnel are the key to success. We see diversity as a strength that helps us attract the most talented and motivated people. It is our duty to offer people a working environment where every individual’s contribution and participation is appreciated, rewarded and encouraged. At the end of 2018 Ensto employed 1,575 people of which 1,493 (95%) had fulltime employment contract. Ensto has employees in 20 countries. The majority of our employees are located in Estonia (35%), Finland (24%) and France (18 %). 30 Our employee base is relatively evenly distributed in terms of age and gender and there have not been big changes over the years. At the end of 2018, 43% of our employees were female and 57% male. 95 % of the employees had a full-time employment contract. Factors like one’s gender, nationality, ethnicity or age have no weight in our recruiting decisions. We also consider factors such as nationality, ethnicity, physical ability, in addition to education, and work experience, as important aspects of diversity and provide equal opportunities to all of our employees, but do not actively gather data on these factors. During the past 3 years, there has not been any major changes in the distribution of the employment of genders. Personnel in 2018: total 1575 55% 45% 37% 63% White Blue White Blue collars collars collars collars Male 57 % Female 43 % 7.2 Working with our employees to make Ensto a better place to work One of the tools in caring for the wellbeing of our employees is the employee experience survey. At Ensto we believe that employees give their best when the things that are meaningful to them are taken good care of in the workplace. Our 31 employee surveys help us to gather valuable information about our employees’ opinions and what are the most important things for our people. The survey gives us a tool to develop our activities and identify practices that will make Ensto a better place to work. 72% of personnel is satisfied with Ensto as a workplace Our employee experience survey was conducted in the autumn 2018 to find out what motivates us in our work. The response rate ended up on the level of 72%, which is slightly below the previous year (75%), but still enough for us to get representative results. The feedback will be converted into actions on our journey to make Ensto the best company to work for. 72 % of respondents are satisfied with Ensto as a workplace that is at the same level as in previous year. Highlights of The results showed that 72% (scale: 1-100, 72% = good employee survey level) of respondents are satisfied with Ensto as a workplace. This is a very good result, and indicates that we  Survey response have great potential in creating the best employee rate 72% experience together.  72% of Ensto's employee Net Promoter Score was minus six (-6), respondents are which is an internationally comparable promoter score satisfied with showing how engaged employees are. It is measured by Ensto as a asking how likely is it that you would recommend your workplace employer to a friend or acquaintance. eNPS score over 20 is considered good, so we still have some work to do reach that level. The results of the employee survey were discussed within the teams with a solution finding approach. Each team was asked to discuss about the most meaningful things on team level and plan actions to develop those factors. We also encourage each employee to discuss their personal top 5 meaningful things with their superior to enable influencing individual employee experience. Next employee experience survey will be conducted in autumn 2019. Open communication At Ensto, we believe that open communication plays an important role in building employee engagement. We use multiple channels such as global intranet, team 32 sites, reviews held by CEO, to communicate with our employees. We also send regular newsletters via email and provide printed versions for factories. One of the forms of the open communication is Ensto Council, our own Groupwide cooperation forum, which is organized every year. The role of Ensto Council is to provide an opportunity for overseas units' employee representatives to express their views on various issues as well as to act as a Group-wide discussion and information forum. All Ensto offices and location are entitled to send their representatives to the Ensto Council's meetings. In 2018 the Ensto Council concentrated on discussions about the strategic target Trust Capital – which is the best understood value among the personnel. 7.3 Employee well-being At Ensto we believe that satisfied, happy and healthy employees are more productive and lead to satisfied customers. Well-being at work is a set of preventive, comprehensive and systematic actions where everyone in the organization is involved. The well-being work at Ensto is led by the Well-being Steering Team. Superiors, employees and the work community have their own responsibilities. Health and safety matters have the highest priority and individuals' own responsibility is crucial. Ensto supports employees in this by providing different tools and possibilities to maintain and develop own skills and competences needed in one's daily work, to participate in developing one's own work, and in other development projects. Following means are used to support employee's well-being (local variations possible to enable best fit to the local culture and traditions):  development discussions  employee surveys  early support model  advise and support from HR personnel  occupational health care services  safety tools (e.g. guidelines, trainings, process to inform of safety risks etc.)  supporting sports activities  non-smoking workplace  trainings to ensure needed competences  internal job rotation (e.g. by applying to open positions in intranet, discussing career plans or expectations in development discussion) 33 Motivating our employees to live healthy lives Many different sport events were organized in various Ensto countries and locations, e.g. running events, rowing competition and football games. 7.4 Continuous improvement towards Zero Accidents Main principles concerning safety aspects are set in our Safety and Health Policy. The compliance of our main policies is reviewed at least once a year by the Ensto Management Team in management reviews. The health and safety of our employees is very important to us. We aim at zero accidents and are constantly developing our safety procedures in order to achieve our goal of becoming an accident-free workplace. Unfortunately, zero accidents was not a reality in 2018 despite the improvements. We did manage to reduce the amount of accidents and the accident frequency rate. 13 accidents occurred at work in 2018, meaning that our accident frequency rate was 5.6 accidents per million hours worked (accidents more than 3 days sick leave). The table below shows the occupational accident frequency rates in Ensto´s manufacturing countries. In 2018, we have collected the accident data in a same way from all our manufacturing sites and continue developing coherent more proactive Safety KPI's in 2019. We managed to reduce the accident frequency rate in many countries, in Estonia significantly. We have altogether five factories without any accidents causing sick leave and six factories without serious accidents in 2018. Unfortunately, AFR increased in few factories in 2018 and in the coming years we need to put more effort on reducing the number of accidents in Ensto Group. Key safety figures 2018 2017 LTIF1 9,5 LTIF4=AFR 5,6 13,8 Table: Loss Time Incident Frequency and Accident frequency rate. All manufacturing sites are included in 2018. The 2017 figure is only covering Finland, Estonia, Russia and France. We continuously develop our processes and methods to improve health and safety conditions of our employees. The main development methods are Safety War Room practice in our factories, internal audits, external audits, health and safety walks and risk mappings. We also provide our employees with regular safety trainings. 7.5 Competence management One of the focus areas in our Best Employee Experience theme is to attract, develop and retain the best people. Long-term competence management plays a 34 key role is this work and we strive to have the right competencies in each positions. Ensto personnel are top professionals in their field. To be able to achieve and maintain that position, each employee has a regular development discussion with his or her managers at least once a year. Ensto also offers its personnel highquality trainings in work related areas. In addition, we deploy other development methods such as involvement to projects, rotation etc. CRM trainings to serve customers better Customer Relationship Management system, based on Microsoft Dynamics, is used at Ensto in order to maintain relationships with stakeholders. It provides clarity concerning activities taken up with customers and suppliers, as well as allows responding their needs and serving them better. In 2018, Ensto created a new CRM training concept, in order to improve employees’ skills, and standardize the way, how Ensto people work with stakeholders. A pack of guidelines and tips included in trainings let all the users work easier and more effectively on a daily basis. The concept included:  Basic trainings for employees, who started using CRM tool  Advanced trainings for more skilled users, with more interactivity and emphasis on user specific selection of topics  Face-to-face trainings organized in countries, with emphasis on local needs  A set of presentations and manuals, to let every user find answers to daily questions very quickly. Moreover, Ensto eLearning tool – Ensto Academy will be utilized in 2019, allowing employees to develop their skills in a modern, effective way. The works on Introduction CRM training for newcomers started in 2018, including test questions, which will evaluate actual CRM knowledge and skills by the managers, as well as tailor a personal training plan of improvement for each team member. Sales Excellence Framework workshops to improve Ensto sales management skills More than 50 Ensto sales directors and managers from different countries and BUs participated in 2018 in a series of Sales Excellence Workshops. The target of the program was how to improve Ensto's institutional sales management skills and to share employees’ sales experience with each other. As a result, common understanding of Ensto customers’ needs has grown significantly. The workshops were a result of Customer Connection Must-Win Battle and its Sales efficiency and impact stream, the target of which was to define Ensto customer segments and sales models, including sales roles and process definitions. 35 All the workshops were extremely practical, including cases reflecting everyday sales reality. They predominantly based on discussions and presentations regarding:  Evaluation of shifting buyer concerns and agree topics where to focus in each buying cycles  Definition of Sales Activities by Phase  Opportunity analysis and qualification The model will develop further in 2019. Ensto Academy – competence management platform of Ensto At Ensto, we believe in the power of knowledge and learning. We find it important that our employees have high understanding of our business, solutions, services, technologies and products so that they can help our customers to build added value to their business. We also believe that by providing training to our employees and customers, we can enhance the best employee experience and the best customer loyalty. Ensto Academy is Ensto's competence management systems, which enables versatile personnel and customers trainings online. Ensto Academy was launched in 2017 and all Ensto employees can access the platform in all Ensto countries. The e-courses offering include topics ranging from Ensto's products and solutions to Ensto's strategy and Employee Code of Conduct. Ensto Academy also gives more versatility to our existing Ensto Pro trainings. Ensto Pro is Ensto's technical training concept targeted to customers, partners 36 and own personnel. The aim is to create loyal customer relations and support our own employees by sharing knowledge. Installation trainings Joint Lectures training Ensto Pro Factory visit + Seminars training Ensto Academy enables customers and employees to study the courses online when it is most convenient for them. Time, money and natural resources can be saved as people are able to study at home or their work places. The platform makes it possible for HR and managers to follow up on learning process. We can offer e-learning and face-to-face courses as well as combinations of these two. At the moment the majority of the courses in Ensto Ensto Academy Academy are targeted to internal usage. Currently we are providing 30 internal e-learning courses and 7 e-learning highlights in courses to our customers. In 2018, 396 internal users had 2018 logged themselves in Ensto Academy and completed 246 e-learning courses and 49 face-to-face courses. 26 1520internal customers have access rights to Ensto Academy. users with access rights to system In the coming years, we will utilize the other functions Ensto Academy has to offer. These include e.g. competence management, personal learning plans and 687 e-learning certification control. Team-specific and even individual courses completed learning plans are in some extent already in use. Ensto Academy also enables us to create onboarding packages 30 internal eto our new employees, which will ensure that all the learning courses newcomers are given the required introduction. available 7.6 Cultivating innovative working environment New ways to discover smart solutions 37 Solution Creation Process is a new internal approach introduced in 2018 to test concepts in an agile and lighter way and with minimal effort, without having to develop actual products. It derives inspiration from the startup world where you embrace the uncertainty and fail fast if needed before going into the heavier and often more expensive R&D process. The Solution Creation Process provides a lightweight framework to ensure that the solution concepts truly yield the benefits they promise without spending the time, energy, and material on the creation on physical products. Smart solutions are sustainable. Saving electricity, improving the electrical system to better support renewable energy sources and building the infrastructure required for electrification of transport serve to create a society where energy consumption is reduced or at least the energy used has a minimal environmental impact The Solution Creation Process also aims to change the company culture by encouraging anybody at Ensto to participate and pitch in new ideas. At Ensto, we want to cultivate workplace creativity. We encourage our employees to share their ideas and thoughts on how we could work more efficiently, how we can serve our customers better and what kind of new solutions would benefit our customers. 7.7 Rising environmental awareness Training and knowledge sharing play crucial roles when rising awareness of environmental challenges and risks, with the awareness starts caring. It is shaping the attitudes and behaviors that can make a difference. When you learn that even the small everyday choices can have a big impact on the environment, then you are on the right road. Rising environmental awareness has been a part of Ensto Environmental Program for 2016-2018. It strives to enhance the general level of environmental awareness among Ensto people by the following actions:  Environmental card training for at least 20% of employees in factories  Environmental training for product management and product development personnel  Participating theme weeks such us Energy Awareness Week in fall and Earth Day in spring  Ensto Green Office training for all the Ensto employees working in office or office related environment 38 Trainings continued in 2018. We almost reached the target; there are 145 (85% of the target) card owners in Porvoo and in Estonia. Green Office is active in same locations. Trainings will continue onwards and there are plans for an e-learning module so we have possibility to train people in more locations. In 2018 Ensto arranged two theme weeks; Earth Day and Energy Awareness Week. The main idea of these weeks is to share knowledge, raise common environmental awareness and encourage to more sustainable behavior at work and at home. The weeks are a mean of getting people to think and act in favor of sensible use of energy and environmentally conscious way in their daily life voluntarily. During the Earth Day -week facts about environmental choices we presented in our intranet, on posters and on infographic boards. In 2018 theme of the Earth Day was End Plastic Pollution. Ensto's employees were also asked to share his or her own sustainable tips on the theme week website. During the Energy Awareness Week the theme was Sustainable Mobility. We challenged all Ensto employees to save energy. In our intranet, we provided stories of Ensto people striving for Sustainable Mobility. 7.8 Labor principles At Ensto, we do not tolerate any violation of human rights or labor laws in any part of our supply chain. We follow the ILO (International Labor Organization) minimum age limits for employment and local laws when being stricter than ILO. We also expect our supplier to follow these principles, which has been stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct. We do not use any form of forced labor and expect the same from our business partners. Salaries paid by Ensto are based on individual contracts and/or local collective agreements (if available). We expect our suppliers to follow the local regulations of the minimum wages. All our employees have right to establish and join groups for the promotion and defense of their occupational interests. Regular meetings and consultations are ongoing locally with local labor unions in countries where labor unions are active. There were no labor rights related non-compliances reported in 2018. 39 8 SMART SOLUTION CREATION 8.1 Sustainability in Smart Solution Creation in general We have made sustainability related improvements and updates into our Product Creation Process in 2018. The R&D staff received trainings on the topic and all the changes were taken into daily use. We have also created a totally new process to discover smart solutions. In this Solution Creation Process we can test concepts without developing actual products. Like in the name, the process is aimed for solutions, not for physical products. It is a startup style approach where we discover and test new ideas in an agile way and with minimal effort, making the process itself very sustainable. We have made systematic efforts to emphasize sustainability in our R&D in general. Our solutions designed in a way that the material use of the hardware is optimized, production waste is limited and recycling of all parts at their end of life is made possible to the best possible extent. We use our own components in as many solutions as possible. Most of our solutions are designed for a long life cycle, in some cases even 40 to 50 years. Our solutions are very thoroughly tested resulting less reclamations. We have tested the use of recycled plastic materials in 2018 and even organized an innovation competition on the topic. We provide our customers smart and safe solutions with low environmental impact and minimum life cycle energy demand. We utilize smart technology and digital means to support our customers in reducing energy consumption. We consider durability and long lifetime as key features of our products and solutions. We prioritize recyclable and durable materials to ensure the longevity of our products. We put a great emphasis on easy and fast installation process in order to minimize the amount of excessive material or waste generated. 8.2 Reliability for electricity distribution with Ensto Utility Manager Ensto Utility Manager is smart solution developed by our LVDC team. It was introduced in 2018. It is a cloud-based platform that prevents, controls and locates any possible defects in electricity distribution by analyzing continuous measurement and status information from Ensto LVDC Microgrid, LVAC Power Quality and Network Automation solutions. The Utility Manager permits detailed viewing and controlling of the network and its customer interactions, supporting billing, site priorities and the development of new services. Utility Manager connects LVAC and all its Power Quality devices to the utility's SCADA. Ensto Utility Manager enables predictive maintenance, resulting into fewer interruptions, less reclamations and better quality electricity distribution in a more reliable way. 40 Ensto Utility Manager device statistics 8.3 Modular products make sustainable solutions In addition to good usability, designing solutions with modular features is a good way to enhance their sustainability as well. There were a couple of excellent examples of product systems launched in 2018, which utilize modularity in their design. Ensto Anna product family is a flexible lighting system designed to meet the requirements of a modern office yet being also sustainable. Same LED modules can be used in different product variants, only the number of the modules changes. In addition, the same aluminum profile is used in all the variants and only its length changes. Same applies for diffusors, louvres and accessories. There are number of reasons why modular products like Ensto Anna are sustainable. As the same components can be used in different versions, we need less product variant specific components. This leads to lower stock level of components and more efficient stock usage, better material efficiency due to less scrapping and more efficient production at supplier side due to longer production runs. In addition to increased sustainability, the Ensto Anna System offers better usability due to its modular structure. 41 Another great modular product range launched in 2018 is EnstoNet XL. It is an installation coupler system suitable for higher current ratings. It provides the easiest, fastest, most cost-efficient way to rearrange, expand or re-install an existing network. As no waste is generated and products can be re-used due to their modular nature, an environmentally friendly lifecycle can be achieved and disposal costs avoided. The system is designed in a way that all couplers have the same size and are able to use all the same accessories like strain-reliefs and panel adapters. Like with Ensto Anna, the modular design of EnstoNet XL results into less stocked items, larger production batches and thus less material scrap. EnstoNet XL is also offered in ready-made cable sets resulting into less trash at the installation site. 8.4 Sustainable comfort with new Eco-designed Smart thermostat All Ensto's panel heaters and floor heating thermostats were updated in 2018 to meet the new eco-design requirements. They are now equipped with a smart electronic thermostat and can easily be controlled from a mobile device. The new smart thermostats enable reduced room temperatures when you are not home and very low (< 0,3W) stand-by consumption levels in general. The operation of the thermostats is based on an adaptation feature which precalculates the needed heating time for each temperature increase or decrease so that energy is not wasted on overheating the space. The thermostats also have an easy to use calendar feature where you can plan in advance and drop the temperatures when you are not there. Bathroom is a good example of an overheated space 24/7 but with the new smart feature, the temperature can be reduced during the daytime when no one uses the space. This can save up to 40 % energy in that particular room. And by monitoring your own consumption, you will gradually start to learn about the energy behavior and make changes into your daily patterns and towards more energy efficient life style. 42 9 RESPONSIBLE SOURCING We strive to ensure that our suppliers, sub-contractors and partners uphold high standards for responsible business practices. When selecting suppliers we look for quality, reliability, transparency and ability to foster innovation. We are committed to transparency and strive to build long-term, open, fair and mutually beneficial partnerships with our suppliers and partners as well as seek innovative ways of working together. We take global responsibility for our actions, comply with regulatory frameworks and adhere to best practices, while minimizing our impact on environment. We are continuously developing our processes and the way we are working with our suppliers and partners to reach top performance in our projects. 9.1 Supplier quality Sustainability and proactive supply risk management contributes to higher quality and security of supply for Ensto businesses. Ensto is committed to material compliance, and to ensure high social, environmental and human rights standards including United Global Compact principles. We encourage our internal and external stakeholders to adopt similar standards and to comply with regulatory requirements. Ensto requires all suppliers to make an effort to manage and confirm (affirm) product compliance with regulations such as REACH, RoHS and Conflict Minerals. To support above, a following guidelines; Ensto Employee Code of Contact, Environmental Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct and Mineral Conflict Policy are in use. Supplier evaluation Ensto requires that suppliers' operations are performed in a manner that is appropriate, as it applies to their ethical, legal, environmental, and social responsibilities. We select our major suppliers and subcontractors on their ability to meet our Ethical Principles based on Ensto's values and the principles of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Rights of the Child and the Declaration of the United Nations International Labor Organization. We evaluate our potential new suppliers in accordance with the suppliers’ approval process and our current major suppliers on criteria of quality, operational efficiency, cost, occupational health & safety, social and environmental responsibility. In addition, human rights related criteria, anticorruption principles and labor principles are important part of the evaluation process. 43 We are using supplier scorecard method for supplier evaluation. It is based on the quality performance of suppliers’ products and services. The most important criterion are among others account delivery accuracy, quality, lead-time and payment terms. Automatic Performance reports were implemented to share with supplier results as soon as possible. If the supplier is not fulfilling the set criteria, the supplier site audit is conducted or other development actions are agreed with the supplier in order to ensure the fulfillment of the criteria. If supplier operative location is in risk country, Ensto uses local expertise for audits. The principles of no forced or compulsory labor and no child labor are included in Ensto Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, we conducted 47 supplier audits plus supplier visits and co-operation meetings. Non no-compliance cases related sustainability were reported during these audits and visits. Supplier Code of Conduct Ensto Supplier Code of Conduct defines the minimum sustainability requirements to our suppliers and expectations regarding ethical issues. It is a part of Ensto's ethical code for purchasing and it requires that suppliers act in ethically, legally, environmentally and socially appropriate manner. The Code lists basic requirements on labor issues such as ban of child, forced and indentured labor, working hours and wages and benefits. Supplier Code of Conduct is reviewed regularly. Ensto We expect suppliers are obligated to implement the principles of the our Supplier Code of Conduct across their whole operations. suppliers to We expect suppliers to verify compliance by providing respect and information and allowing possible audits. Ensto's suppliers are also expected to publish their own ethical code of implement practices. the principles of During suppliers approval process Ensto evaluates and our Supplier selects suppliers taking into consideration Supplier Code of Code of Conduct and UN Global Compact principles. If the supplier does not fulfill the requirements, they are either given an Conduct opportunity to conduct corrective actions before they can be approved as Ensto's supplier or in more severe case they are turned down. Supplier requirements Ensto's Supplier requirements are reviewed regularly. The document describes the minimum criteria required from all Ensto's key suppliers. The document is public and is introduced to the suppliers at latest during pre-qualification. Suppliers play a very important role in our value chain we offer to our customers 44 and with supplier requirements we want to ensure the faultless performance of our suppliers. 9.2 Working with our suppliers Ensto's suppliers are an important part of our supply chain. With our supplier, we are able to provide high-quality products, solutions and services to our customers. Ensto currently has active co-operation with around 3,000 external suppliers who supply us raw materials, components, modules, services etc. Out of these 167 are classified as key suppliers. The classification is based annual purchases value as the main criteria. During 2018 we have also implemented Spend Analytics in order to know what we are spending to efficiently manage our suppliers and movements of goods. We have also updated and renewed our Contract Management online tool to have a single repository to organize the visibility into all our commitments and contracts. Through collaboration with our stakeholders, we aim to enhance long-term relationships, ensure the highest quality and create a sustainable supply chain. In purchasing this means specifically that the suppliers shall be treated equally, without discrimination and purchasing decisions shall be based on open and clear criteria. Ensto supplier E-portal As collaborative supply chain is one of Ensto's goals to sustainable success, Ensto has implemented Supplier E-Portal. Our aim is to build a strong supply base with our trusted partners and Ensto Supplier E-Portal offers a great platform to share our requirements and expectations and collect information and needed evidences from suppliers. We believe that implementing shared platform with suppliers we can make co-operation more efficient and transparent. During portal development phase we bench-marked Ensto customers' qualification requirements to guarantee that customer expectations are noticed already in supplier evaluation. We have started to use the portal as are pre-qualification tool also for existing suppliers. We have invited 30 existing suppliers to fill in the questionnaire through 45 our portal. Pre-qualification questionnaire is divided to sections where Sustainability and Compliance questions are mandatory to be answered. We have defined the weights of questions and answers and scoring based on Ensto's general requirements and expectations. The system makes the preevaluation based on supplier answers. To get an approved supplier for Ensto status we conduct final evaluation and decide on follow-up steps if needed. All qualified suppliers have the ability and are required to keep their information up-to date in our portal. In this way we can keep all the information about our business partners, continuously updated and accurate. As a result we have increased the supplier compliance and approval through easy to follow and manage registration & pre-qualification process. Our E-portal in sourcing helps us to keep our tendering process transparent both inside Ensto and for the external suppliers. All our requirements are communicated to suppliers in the same way and at the same time. This allows us to drive the costs down and reduce operational costs in a sustainable way. Increased competition among our suppliers drives higher standards that we require from our partners. Through E-portal our processes became more standardized and clear for all stakeholders. 10 LEAN MANUFACTURING AND DELIVERY Our culture of continuous improvement is based on sustainable, effective and efficient manufacturing. We are constantly working to minimize negative environmental impacts of our operations, minimizing both the resources used and the waste created. We are also utilizing possibilities of circular economy. We focus on efficient and agile delivery capability and keep our promises to customer. 46 We are focusing on providing customers the best possible products at the best possible prices, quality levels and delivery times. Lean does this by focusing on finding and removing waste. Improvement in business needs is seen as a continuous effort at Ensto 10.1 Lean manufacturing at Ensto Efficient and well-organized operations are an essential part of Ensto's company culture. We work hard to reduce delivery lead times, enhance manufacturing flexibility, and focus on delivery accuracy in order to meet our customer's current and future needs. In order to promote lean manufacturing in our operations, we are running a company-wide internal program, “Ensto Operational Excellence (EOX)”. The program is all about continuous improvement and focuses on adding value and reducing waste, which results in shorter lead times, better flexibility and top quality for the benefit of our customers. We have defined and created our own Ensto level standards of each EOX method. These methods have been taken then into action after piloting in plants. In 2018, we concentrated on refining our current EOX processes to be able to get same results by using fewer resources and time, for example by digitalization. Continuous improvement is led in War Rooms War Room is one of the most important initiatives to continuously improve our processes. War Room is used almost in all our operational units and in other Ensto's functions such as customer care, warehousing, procurement, health and safety and environment. War Room is based on the idea that we should continuously identify and measure performance losses in the plants. In this context, losses are defined as lost productive time by machine, people or risks. Ensto production personnel gather regularly for a brief 15 minutes meeting to review the losses. Whenever possible, losses are immediately addressed with corrective actions. Whenever a loss occurs, personnel in production also fills in a so called ‘Loss Card’ where all details about the particular loss is recorded. Loss Cards are then posted to the digital board of the department in question. Systematic pareto-meetings are held to review the accumulated loss cards. Most significant and meaningful problems are identified and focused loss reduction projects (4step projects) are opened to identify root causes of the losses, eliminate the losses and to prevent the losses from happening again. 47 We continuously follow the number of loss cards and improvement project completed. In 2018, 35,667 loss cards were recorded equaling to 50,419 h loss time identified.  In 2018: 211 improvement projects were completed generating 13,745 h/a loss time reduction.  In 2017: 270 improvement projects were completed generating 25,600 h/a loss time reduction.  In 2016: 316 improvement projects were completed generating 21,000 h/a loss time reduction.  In 2015: 309 improvement projects were completed generating 24,400 h/a loss time reduction. Increasing the efficiency of our factories Improving the maintenance of our factory plays an important role in improving productivity and quality through eliminating waste and visualizing risk. Preventive maintenance enables us to increase the reliability of our machines, reduce random failures and improve safety and energy efficiency. We improve our machine intensive work with the equipment effectiveness method. This is done by shortening set-up times, reducing cycle times and eliminating waste times. By focusing on these areas we can: Free up capacity from bottle-neck machines (cycle time reduction, waste time reduction) Improve the efficiency and utilization rate (waste time reduction, preventive maintenance) Make smaller batches more economically (setup time reduction) Decrease the cost per piece (cycle time reduction) Improve our flexibility (setup time reduction) 48 EOX status 2018 Method What is all about?

Quality is embedded in our daily business, as we strive to deliver the best customer loyalty and satisfaction. Our target is to solve customer's problem fast and smoothly in order to ensure satisfied customer. We strive to observe potentially dangerous, expensive and epidemic product faults as soon as possible in order to minimize the effects. We do our best to prevent recurrent problems by affecting on root causes of the problem. By providing high quality products, we meet our customers' requirements. Also less waste is generated, material usage is decreased and CO2 emissions are reduced. We set normally factory specific quality targets and follow key performance quality indicators, which are quality yield, monetary yield, claim costs and number of claims. At Ensto yield is used to measure quality. Yield below illustrates Ensto external quality and it is calculated by dividing the difference of sold and claimed quantities with sold quantities. 10.3 Delivery at Ensto One of our key strategic projects is to improve efficiency and agility of our end-toend supply chain. We aim to improve our service capabilities –such as delivery times, small-orders handling and warehousing strategies, and securing visibility on profitability across our operations teams. 50 When planning our delivery, we take sustainability into account. We try to optimize the sizes of delivery batches and avoid air freights whenever possible. One of the criteria for selecting logistics partners for Ensto is environmental aspect. We require our transportation partners to have clear consciousness of environmental issues and to take concrete actions to decrease the CO2 emissions in transportation. Model of transport is chosen based on the customer needs. In Finland and Estonia we have one carrier partner responsible for approximately 80% of the deliveries. According to them, the carbon footprint of forwarding and freight was 1.3 tons of CO2 (equivalent) in 2018 decreased from 1.8 in 2017. Biggest amount of shipments are done by road and this comprises of most of our logistics related emission. 11 ENVIRONMENT At Ensto, we care for the environment, its protection, and continuous improvement of environmental protection is an integral part of our daily operations, and the premise of our business. Our Environmental Management aims at integrating environmental management into our daily operations and continuously improve our environmental competence. The focus is to assess and reduce the negative environmental impacts of our own operations, as well as the impacts of the entire supply chain. 11.1 Environmental programs In 2015, we established three main projects focusing on environmental themes for the years 2016-2018, which are reducing energy consumption, rising environmental awareness (reported under Best Employee experience) and Ensto Green Office. In the first phase, the scope of these projects was Ensto in Porvoo, Keila and Tallinn. In coming years the programs will be rolled out also to other Ensto countries, like Russia, Sweden, France and Spain. We are currently working on new main themes and implementation plan for environmental projects 20192020. Managing our environmental aspects and risks is another part of the continuous development. The purpose of environmental assessment at Ensto is to identify environmental aspects, environmental impacts, ways to manage them, as well as legal requirements and risks related to aspects. The environmental assessment applies to all relevant Ensto functions and processes. Ensto's environmental aspects and risks are evaluated regularly. Reducing energy consumption Reducing energy consumption is a project where the focus is in reducing the consumption of energy and other natural resources in our facilities and operations. 51 One of the concrete targets is to reduce electricity consumption in our factories by 5% by the end of year 2018 (in relation to number of produced pieces). The base year for reduction is 2015. In 2018 the biggest energy savings projects in Porvoo, Keila and in Tallinn have been the refurbishment of the lighting systems and re-calibration of heating. Small reduction of electricity use was establish. But we did not meet the target due to the project budget cuts. Ensto Green Office Although most of our operations environmental impacts are generated in our production plants, with concrete actions energy and material savings can also be found in the office as well. To increase sustainable thinking and actions in offices we have created the Ensto Green Office concept, which is a part of our ISO 140001 based environmental management system. The aim of this program is to decrease the consumption of natural resources by improving the energy efficiency, by preventing waste generation and by increasing environmental consciousness of employees. With Ensto Green Office we motivate our personnel to act in an environmentally friendly way in their everyday tasks. First pilot for Ensto Green Office started in 2016 in Keila in Estonia. In 2017 Keila was certified and we started to implement Green Office also in Porvoo and Tallinn sites. These sites were certified in 2018. Ensto Green Office will be implemented in all other Ensto offices and it will be integrated to our existing audit systems. Implementation in St. Petersburg and Stockholm was not completed in 2018. Future plans are being developed. 11.2 Environmental performance Since 2010, we have regularly reported our direct and indirect energy consumption. In our environmental reporting, we have concentrated on tracking the most relevant sources of direct and indirect emissions – fuel and energy consumption as well as water consumption and waste disposal. Energy Ensto participated voluntary Energy Efficiency Agreement during the period 20082016 and has decided to continue to be a part of the Agreement also in 20172025. Through the agreements, the aim is to improve the efficient use of energy within industry, energy sector, service sector, property and building sector, as well as regional authorities and municipalities. 52 Ensto's target is to decrease the energy usage at Porvoo site 7% (520 MWh) by 2020 and 10.5% (780 MWh) by 2025 compared to the energy usage in 2015. The main energy saving action in 2018 at Ensto in Finland was lighting renovation projects that continued from 2017. More than 10% of our luminaires were changed to LED luminaires. Electricity and district heating consumption are excluded since no data was available In 2018, Ensto's direct energy use has decreased while the indirect use has increased in compensation. The use of indirect energy sources generate less CO2 emissions, CO2 has decreased due to this.

CO 2 emissions from district heating in 2014 are not included since the data was not available. In 2016 and 2017 emission data of district heating was available only from Porvoo, Finland. Fuel consumption in Lohja, Finland was not available in 2014. CO2 emissions from cooling agents are excluded from the calculation. 54 Waste We are striving to find ways to prevent waste generation by recycling and reusing materials and components. Majority (50%) of the produced waste is metals, which are recycled and reused. Only 7% of the waste produced in 2018 was classified as hazardous waste. We have set ourselves a goal of 0% landfill waste and have gained this target in majority of our locations. In 2018 still around 12% of the waste ended up to landfill. In some of our countries waste collection and management is still under development and therefore waste ending in landfills is inevitable. Waste 3000 Landfill 2500 2000 Incineration and/or 1500 energy generation 1000 Recycling, reusing, 500 recovering and/or composting 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Waste generation in Tonns. In 2014-2016 no data was available from St. Petersburg and from Gurgaon (India) Water Majority of the water is used at Ensto in Finland in our surface treatment process. A lot of water is needed to keep high quality standard since better finished products require more water. Water consumption is fairly stable at Ensto and has decreased from the previous year. 55 Water consumption 41 292 45 485 43 035 43 738 43 525 50000 40000 30000 m3 20000 10000 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 56 GRI standard Disclosure Reference Reported General disclosure 102-14 CEO Statement p. 4 fully 102-15 Description of key impacts, risks and p. partly opportunities 102-1 Name of the organization p. 5 fully 102-2 a.
