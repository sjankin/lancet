LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT “We believe that this 2018 Eldon CSR report represents a significant step forward in our drive to communicate transparently with our shareholders and stakeholders about our commitments and progress in all the areas where we engage with society.” Fredrik Wikström, President and CEO The market developed positively during 2018 with increased sales and stable margins. Eldon grew its home market revenues across its entire product offering including Standard Products, Express Customization and Advanced Customization. All this thanks to branding initiatives, higher efficiency in the sales organization and solid supply chain performance. Other markets grew through our business partners and where Eldon does not have own resources. An improved support structure to simplify the life of our partners has allowed and motivated them to focus their efforts more on internal and external promotion. Eldon also developed marketing plans with key partners to pass on our experience with the aim that their sales organization become more efficient and effective. Eldon’s focus since 2017, on what Eldon calls Development Drivers, to create a user-friendly product for panel builders, machine builders and system integrators is having effect. The delivery of empty enclosures is almost flawless and service levels are high. That means Eldon’s sales organization can allocate more time to demand creation and further increase sales growth. Our corporate sustainability policy focuses on seizing opportunities and effectively managing the risk inherent in economic, environmental and social development. Proof of this can easily be noticed in our Company’s continued support of the Global Compact principles in our corporate philosophy. Eldon strives to continually provide clarity and depth for our Corporate Social Responsibility reporting. To this end, we utilize commonly understood frameworks that provide guidance to corporations in managing, planning and reporting on their CSR performance around topics such as governance, organizational strategy, materiality and stakeholder engagement. We continue to utilize the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles to guide us in our reporting. Eldon became a signatory to the UNGC in 2011 and, in addition to our Sustainability Report, Eldon has produced a specific one as part of our UNGC Communication on Progress (COP). Business signatories to the UNGC are required to annually submit a COP for the UNGC website and to share the COP widely with their stakeholders. We believe that this 2018 Eldon CSR report represents a significant step forward in our drive to communicate transparently with our shareholders and stakeholders about our commitments and progress in all the areas where we engage with society. This report underlines our fundamental belief that, for a company to be successful on long term and create value for shareholders, it must also create value for society. This sustainability report is a supplement to the Board of Directors’ report in the Annual Report of Eldon Holding AB for 2018. Fredrik Wikström, President and CEO Eldon Holding AB 4 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 2. ELDON HOLDING AB Eldon Holding AB has had a strong commitment to its social responsibilities as a corporation from its earliest. Eldon is a leading global manufacturer of enclosures for electrical components, electronics and telecommunications across a wide range of platforms. 2.1. Corporate Profile From our beginnings in Sweden, Eldon has been grown into a major provider of industrial electrical enclosures, yet our core values remain unchanged. Today’s management team fully endorses the same fundamental principles as their predecessors: Design, quality and customer satisfaction. Eldon’s ownership structure is split between staff members and external investors. Eldon’s senior management controls the majority of the shares while a minority is held by external investors and other Eldon personnel. The shareholding structure of Eldon is shown in Figure 1. Eldon is a group of wholly owned subsidiaries, as detailed in Figure 2. Eldon’s Swedish holding company owns the holding company in Spain, which in turn, holds the following companies: Romania SRL and Spain SAU. At the same time, Eldon Holding España SLU owns 58% of CS Eldon Encl. PLC, a company based in India. Eldon CS Encl. PLC has a manufacturing plant in Umbergaon (Distt. Valsad, Gujarat State), with production, distribution and sales activities. The company is a joint venture with a local partner and as it is not a 100% owned subsidiary, it is not included in this report. 5 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Figure 2. Eldon Holding AB ownership structure. ELDON HOLDING AB operations are divided into three large operations areas: Manufacturing Plants, Logistic Centers and Sales Offices. Eldon Headquarters are based in Spain and the group has 2 manufacturing plants, 7 logistics centers and 11 sales offices in different countries as well as an extensive network of agents consolidating its presence in over 45 countries. The distribution and nature of the different work centers is detailed in Figure 3. The sales offices operate in the country where they are based, where their markets then are considered as domestic markets. The sales from the distribution network are considered export sales.

Eldon’s performance is based on the Mission and Vision Statement, which was created by the Management Team and has been made public. The contents of it can be seen in Figure 6. The growth of sales in 2013 compared to the previous year is a sign that the downward trend was broken and that 2014 showed an important growth in sales. The positive trend continued in 2015 and came from a recovering global economy which has seen turmoil in many financial and geographical areas around the world. A slight stagnation in 2016 led to another important growth in 2017 and 2018 looks also to have a growth of > 10% compared to the previous year. The Eldon Group has taken a proactive approach to the uncertainties such as consolidated manufacturing in order to reduce fixed costs and become a stronger global player less susceptible to negative external influences. The number of employees decreased slightly in 2018 compared to 2017 but with more than 30% since 2011. 7 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Figure 6. Eldon’s Mission and Vision. 8 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Products Eldon’s core business is the manufacture and sale of different types of enclosures that accommodate electrical, electronic and telecommunication components. We offer a very wide range of both standard and tailor-made customer specific products. We can adapt all standard products to different hole patterns, colors, sizes and customer fit accessories and also design and create new products from scratch to match customer requirements. Eldon sells our own brand products, but we also commercialize third party products such as accessories (lighting devices, switches, cabling, etc.), which allow our customers to work with one single-source material provider. Eldon’s customers fall into two main categories in line with their size and product performance. In those countries where Eldon has sales offices, the group works with a network of small and medium size distributors and also wholesale sales. For countries lacking a sales office infrastructure, Eldon partners with a specialized agent, usually on an exclusivity basis, who is responsible for the distribution of the whole product range. These relationships are based upon trust as is demonstrated by the fact that some working relationships with distributors date back 15 years. The central sales team manages the key accounts, while there is some specific clients who require branded product manufacturing. Manufacturing plant Eldon has one manufacturing plant in Romania. That works according to the same principles – combining technology and highly qualified technical staff. Opened in 2007, Eldon’s largest factory is the production flagship of the company. Located in Prejmer (Brasov), it manufactures Eldon’s entire product range with the highest number of employees of all plants. The plant best represents Eldon’s environmental, social and economic commitments. It has been certified ISO 14001 compliant. During 2012-2013 Eldon has implemented the KAIZEN quality improvement management system. The Quality Management System has also been certified ISO 9001. 9 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 2.2. Management Structure Eldon Holding AB has a board composed of five members who are permanently informed about the group’s performance. The board comprises two representatives of the organization, two investor’s representatives and one external advisor. The latter holds the presidency so as to have an independent input. The board establishes the annual Strategic Plan and the Yearly Budget, and closely monitors its implementation. Each company within Eldon Holding AB has its own board of directors, responsible for controlling the evolution of the objectives. The management is made up of persons with different profiles in a multidisciplinary approach to ensure and to share the management of the different divisions with the rest of the organization.

CSR REPORT: PROFILE, SCOPE AND OVERAGE The data which appear in this Report describe the evolution of ELDON HOLDING AB in 2012-2018 in terms of corporate sustainability. To compile this publication, Eldon has coordinated and consolidated the information received from each country for each of the qualitative and quantitative indicators. This mechanism allows analysis of each of the Company’s countries of operation in a comparable, weighted and measurable way and the use of these data as a management tool. For the compilation of the qualitative and quantitative information, internal and external tools and programs have been used for matters related to human resources and customers, community and the environment. This process has permitted self-diagnosis and verification of the data from its department of origin, as well as ensuring its traceability, accuracy and reliability at different levels of aggregation. All the information published has in turn passed through internal processes of checking and verification, (Management Control/CFO in some countries). Additionally, the information in this report has been subject to various levels of external reviews. 10 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 The Report follows the principles of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The most reliable and widely used standards in Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility reports. This methodology is used to facilitate comprehension, comparability and maximum transparency for our stakeholders. 4. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 4.1. Performance From the start, Eldon business has embraced corporate responsibility in a natural way. It is an approach the current management team fully endorses and is further building upon. In 2011, the company for the first time decided to implement an audit of the organization from a Corporate Social Responsibility perspective in order to define a strategy building on the initiatives already undertaken. This new report shows the evolution of the group in Corporate Social matters during 2012/2018 as well as some of the new initiatives taken in this respect. Corporate Social Responsibility Annual Report Based on the same principles that the Eldon newsletter has built on since 2009 when communicating with workers and customers, our CSR report has become an important tool in communicating the company’s achievements, actions and targets to different stakeholders. It shows the activities carried out by the organization at social, economic and environmental levels in order to increase stakeholder knowledge about our efforts and the achievements. Newsletter Since 1999 our newsletter has been an essential communications tool. It is sent to customers and employees by email. The web publishing also ensures its availability to other groups of interest. The newsletter is published in 7 languages in order to reach out to all those markets where Eldon has a direct presence. It is also published in Danish because of the traditionally strong importance of the Nordic markets for the company. The English edition ensures it is available to an international audience. The newsletter includes news of a commercial nature, such as launching new products, signing contracts and our attendance at trade fairs. It also includes references to sponsorship and community activities that Eldon has carried out in the different countries where it operates. 11 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Joining the Global Compact Eldon, as part of its commitment to sustainable performance, joined the United Nations Global Compact through the Spanish network of the initiative,with the further objective of contributing to the spread of the philosophy and principles followed. The Global Compact initiative was created in 1999 by the United Nations. The aim is to obtain business enterprise commitment to corporate social responsibility by supporting 10 principles. Eldon is committed to use the Global Compact principles as a benchmark in its own policies and actions in line with domestic commitments already made in the social, environmental and economic area. The UN Global Compact’s ten principles encompass the areas of human rights, labor, the environment and anticorruption and have won universal consensus. They are based on: • The Universal Declaration of Human Rights • The International Labor Organization’s Declarationon Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work • The Rio Declaration on Environmentand Development • The United Nations Convention Against Corruption The UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and enact, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labor standards, the environment and anti-corruption: Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labor Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 12 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 4.2. Involvement of stakeholders Eldon is aware of the strong impact of what we do in different areas, which is why we carried out a detailed audit of our stakeholders as an initial step towards Corporate Social Responsibility. Once we had identified all the various stakeholders involved we audited our existing communication channels in both directions. As a result of this approach, we have endeavored to meet the expectations of stakeholders and integrate them into our strategic planning. Identification of stakeholders Stakeholders are those who are directly or indirectly affected by the development of a business and who also have the ability to directly or indirectly impact an enterprises development (Freeman, 1983). The stakeholders can be internal or external, depending on their role in the organization. Some of the stakeholders have already been mentioned in previous chapters in this report. The family ownership background of the company has attached special importance to our workers and their families. Customers are also key stakeholders because of Eldon’s strong commitment to providing quality and customer-driven products. The following is the set of stakeholders identified by the management team of Eldon on the basis of their activities, see Figure 8. GROUP CATEGORIES Shareholders Owners Venture capital/investors Employees External Workers Staff Trade Union representatives Staff’s families Direct customers (Eldon’s sales offices) Agents and distributors (export) Clients Key Accounts (Corporate ) Brand label customers Plant suppliers Group suppliers Suppliers / subcontracting / outsourcing Subcontractors Health Insurers Local, regional and national auditors Administration and auditing Financial auditors Same sector other providers Competitors Association Local companies Community General population NGOs Figure 8. Eldon’s stakeholders. 13 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 We identified our stakeholder groups when assessing the status of the organization’s CSR position. In collaboration with an external consultant team, a prolific study was made of the different actions that Eldon has already developed regarding the social, economic, and environmental issues involved. This involved diagnostic questionnaires and personal interviews with management and the heads of finance, labor, environmental, health and safety, sales and marketing, and purchasing. Eldon’s performance concerning each interest group is detailed in the specific section. Communication with stakeholders is essential and should be bi-directional, so that they access information about those aspects of the organization’s performance that may affect them (directly or indirectly) or be of interest. It is also important to the company that our stakeholders are able to incorporate their views and demands in strategic and management actions. Communication should be fluid, facilitating the existence of a variety of channels that reflect the characteristics of each group. Figure 10 shows the set of existing communication channels, which are addressed in more detail in the section assigned to each one. This CSR report is a starting point for Eldon. The result of the audit undertaken shows that there is a strong commitment to enhance communication with stakeholders. Future editions of this CSR report will incorporate in more detail the issues raised by each group during the study period.

Customer satisfaction is the core philosophy of the organization, and this embraces customer in markets where Eldon has no direct presence or infrastructure. Below are Eldon’s relationships with regards to owners, customers, agents, suppliers and industry associations. 5.1. Owners Eldon ownership structure includes external investors as well as shareholders who are staff members. All shareholders have access to the financial statements information included in the Annual Report. Annual accounts are deposited in Sweden, which is where the Eldon Holding AB is registered. Financial statements area audited by an independent third-party in order to ensure Eldon’s corporate information transparency. The General Shareholders Meeting is held annually. 15 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 5.2. Customers Meeting customer needs is the essence of Eldon, along with commitment to our workforce. Eldon’s number of customers has been growing as has our product offering and market presence. The sales structure of Eldon is divided into two market areas: domestic and export. Domestic markets are considered those where Eldon has a local presence through a local sales office: Sweden, Spain (includes the Portuguese market), UK (including Ireland), Romania, Belgium, The Netherlands and Norway. Eldon has a comprehensive range of standard products, but also makes products to meet specific customer specifications, which demands maintaining very close contact with such clients in order to meet their needs. Customer specifications are managed through design specification procedures, specific product request forms, and suggestions and claims procedures. The first issue addressed by Eldon’s quality assurance policy is the achievement of customer satisfaction. The ISO 9001 quality management system implemented at each plant includes several procedures for correct orders handling to accommodate specific customer requirements. Customer satisfaction is measured by a variety of surveys and satisfaction questionnaires. The product catalogue is one of Eldon’s most important communication tools as it contains detailed technical information, beyond legal requirements. Eldon products have more than nine different certificates and approvals in terms of quality, including those awarded by Underwriters Laboratories USA, Canadian Standards Association, KEMA The Netherlands, Lloyd’s Register of Shipping England, and Det Norske Veritas, among others. The factory in Romania has implemented the KAIZEN project in certain areas with remarkable success, which has led to its further deployment at the rest of the group’s plants. The KAIZEN system of quality improvement involves customers and employees and is addressed in a specific section of this report. The KAIZEN System which was implemented in the factory in Romania was deployed during 2012-2013. This KAIZEN system of quality improvement involves customers and employees. 5.3. Agents Our agents play an essential role in the business structure of Eldon as they are responsible for the marketing of products in countries where the organization does not have our own sales offices. Eldon seeks agents with proven experience and a good market reputation as they look to establish long-term relationships. Eldon has been working with some of our agents for over 15 years. Agents work on an non-exclusive basis, and they are an important partner for the organization. Eldon goes beyond what is strictly linked to the business and embraces agents in the scope of our CSR activities to demonstrate commitment to Eldon, reinforced by good communication. Suggestions or complaints evaluated and handled by the responsible sales office. 16 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 5.4. Sustainability in the supply chain Managing the impact associated with the acquisition of goods and services has become a key issue in our sector, where companies share ever more links in the value chain with their suppliers and contractors The identification and management of risks associated with the supply chain is an inherent responsibility of each company, as is made clear by the UN’s Guiding Principles on Businesses and Human Rights, and the sector guides created by the European Union, published in June 2013. Eldon Holding AB Group undertook a public commitment in 2012 to sustainability in its supply chain, incorporating social, working and environmental aspects into its purchasing criteria, apart from the ISO9001 quality criteria. The commitment has become a relevant aspect of our global procurement model. This commitment by the Group has let us set out the positive impact of our activity through an international chain of value, but with a high local component. ➜ More than 900 professionals in 45 countries. ➜ Over 25 suppliers from 10 countries used. ➜ Nearly 84% of supplier contracts awarded locally. ➜ Volume of purchasing close to 40 million euros. The relationship with suppliers is included in the Quality Management System and procedures for procurement management are in place. During 2013 we promoted dialogue and exchange of good practices with our strategic partners, to reduce risks to the business and make the most of the opportunities. We recognize that suppliers have a fundamental role to play in achieving a sustainable model, and so we manage not only the potential risks, but also the opportunities, and so we encourage our suppliers to: ➜ Have a sustainability plan, ➜ Comply ahead of time with the law on the elimination of dangerous substances. ➜ Revise their purchasing processes so as to allow greater participation by SMEs and social organizations. ➜ Raise their purchasing levels for renewable energy, in line with market availability, and commit themselves to ongoing improvement in energy efficiency. 17 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 5.5. Industry Associations Eldon is aware that it is possible to establish synergies with other industry related organizations in order to achieve common goals. Eldon is an active member of some of these associations: INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS Spain − AFME (Asociación de Fabricantes de Material Eléctrico) (Eldon España SAU) UK − EEF (Manufacturers Organization of UK) (Eldon Electric Ltd) Figure 10. Industry associations with presence of some Eldon Holding AB societies. AFME is a national non-profit professional organization that covers the various subsectors of the electrical industry. Its three divisions, which are formed by a team of specialist professionals, enable the association to provide suitable response to the sectors needs nationally and internationally. EPS is the only organization in the UK devoted entirely to the manufacturing industry. It offers advice on different aspects of their partners and audits their performance. 5.6. Competition Eldon supports fair competition and is against abusive corporate practices including monopolistic and anticompetition approaches. Also, in line with the above, Eldon does not accept false advertising. In an increasingly globalized market, competition is growing, but that does not justify the adoption of harmful business practices. 5.7. KAIZEN system Eldon’s goal is to constantly produce high quality products, something that requires a continuous improvement policy. This is the objective of the integration of the KAIZEN Management System at the production plant. It is a system of continuous improvement that involves equipment, people, processes, and products. In 2011, Eldon started KAIZEN implementation at some areas of the Romania plant. Today after 8 years of implementing Kaizen in our organization, we continue to work with Kaizen and thus improving our global performance. During this period, we have reinforced our culture of continued improvement and developed our own approach on improvements that is today Eldon Operating System. The Eldon Operating System integrates all specific tools in Kaizen that has made success for Eldon and best expresses our culture and approach. We have gain maturity on looking on to our processes and leading improvement projects. 18 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 The KAIZEN system adheres to the 5S principle and its interaction with the six systems: Total Quality Control (TQC), “Just in Time” Production System, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM),small group activities including Quality Circles, suggestions and system development and communication of policies that emphasize continuous improvement. The 5S toll has been developed into 6`Th S, safety, we have chosen to do so because safety comes first and we are committed always on sustaining safety for all level of our organization. Through the integration of 6S, Eldon wants to create improved working conditions and increased staff motivation. It aims at reducing time and energy costs, reduce accident and safety risks, and improve production quality and working safety conditions. 6. SOCIAL DIMENSION This area concerns Eldon’s performance regarding its workforce and the influence of the group’s activity on the environment. The background of the company as a family enterprise steers Eldon’s approach to caring about the welfare of its employees, who are considered the main asset of the company and whose satisfaction ranks a top organizational objective. For this reason, the company promotes a wide variety of initiatives geared to ease the reconciliation of work and personal life, along with a variety of social benefits. Eldon pursues a non-discrimination policy (sex, age, religion, etc.) both at recruiting level and on an on-going basis. Eldon’s operating facilities have an economic impact on the environment, especially our factory and logistics centers, due to the needs of the workforce and suppliers. The organization is aware of our impact, and is committed to improving life conditions for the communities in which it operates by contributing to a variety of social organizations. 6.1. Employees At Eldon Holding AB, the on-going need to innovate, whether in products, services, processes or people, is growing at the same speed as the transformation of the business. At the core of the transformation are the employees, who must be motivated, attracted and retained, by means of the correct model of recognition that incentivizes change The commitment of Eldon Holding AB to its employees is included within our Business Principles, guaranteeing fair remuneration in accordance with the labor market in which our operations take place. Eldon’s workforce is distributed unevenly among the different countries where the organization is present, through production, distribution or sale sites. The site with the largest number of employees is Romania, home to our most modern facility and is dedicated to the production of a wide variety of products that are labor-intensive. The largest volumes of staff continue to be concentrated at the production site, as it is an industrial assembly activity. The presence of women continues over 30% at the end of 2018, (see Figure 11). 19 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Employees situation at 31/12/2018 Employment contract Professional groups NUMBER OF Indefinite employment Temporary employment Middle EMPLOYEES contract contract Director Blue Collar Staff Other management Full time Part time Full time Part time Men 603 577 0 26 0 23 55 386 119 20 Women 311 290 6 15 0 2 10 222 71 6 <30 years old 170 159 0 11 0 0 10 118 40 2 30‐50 years old 250 242 1 7 0 20 43 301 115 15 >50 years old 494 466 5 23 0 5 12 189 35 9 914 867 6 41 0 25 65 608 190 26 TOTAL Figure 11. Eldon’s employees. 31/12/18 Internal Communication Eldon practices a policy of transparency with its employees. The communication is bidirectional, reflects care about the suggestions and complaints from the staff, which are taken into account by the management. Workers can make claims anonymously through their union representatives, or directly through the established internal communication channels. The communication of company performance is done through multiple channels: • Information panels that show corporate information, labor and safety and health • Newsletter and news magazine. The digital newsletter of the company plays an important role in both internal communication workers and external customers. The factory in Romania has a magazine aimed primarily at employees. It includes information on the evolution of the KAIZEN system implementation, interviews, reports on cultural activities developed (such as the staff photo competition), and improvements in the facilities (rooms, equipment, etc.). The company decided to publish the magazine in Romania in addition to the newsletter in order to better reach out to the large number of staff at the Romanian factory. • Meetings • Communication flows easily within the company allowing employee access to senior managers. The company holds meetings regularly: From team meetings to interdepartmental steering committees. • Internal Releases. 20 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 Equal opportunities Eldon’s staff management philosophy is based on the absence of discrimination. The company respects all its employees at recruiting, treatment and promotion phases. The composition of the workforce corresponds to that of the corporate’s natural evolution, lacking specific quotas or percentages to comply with certain group representation.The hiring and promotion criteria are available to all applicants and staff. Employment of disabled staff is often related to national legislation requirements. There is considerable support for integrating more women into the workforce. The company in Spain in particular has developed a “Protocol for Equality”. This Protocol sets out the Principles of equality for treatment and opportunity and nondiscrimination in employment relations.

All workers can participate in the company’s decision-making through their representatives, present their demands and defend their interests. For a closer relationship and better attention to queries raised by the workers, Eldon delegates dialogue responsibility to the production and human resources department. All the workers are covered by Eldon’s collective labor agreement or similar formula depending on the labor legislationof each country. Health and safety The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees are one of the main areas our company is focused on. Eldon provides safe working conditions for its staff, under the law that is applicable for each location. The factories are especially sensitive to working conditions and have health and safety programs put in place. In the factory based in Romania there is an internal person assigned for local responsibility. Also, in Romania, the Excellence in Occupational Health and Safety is also confirmed by the Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance Body by granting the Occupational Health and Safety Management System certification in accordance with OHSAS 18001 requirements. Regarding the warehouse logistics, Spain, United Kingdom and Romania share the same policies, while the Netherlands and Sweden have specific ones. Excellence in safety and health also extends to the network of commercial offices, such as Belgium and Norway (including the sharing center in Spain, Romania, UK, The Netherlands and Sweden).

ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION We include the environment into our business model, and we work to adopt environmental criteria in our operations in order to reduce environmental risks and promote operational eco-efficiency. We have an environmental policy applicable to all ELDON HOLDING AB subsidiaries and a global environmental management system that lets us ensure compliance with local environmental legislation and improve our management processes continually. While the environmental impacts of our operations are not intensive, we are highly dispersed geographically, making environmental management based on uniform processes highly necessary, and we group this effort around 5 principles: ➜ Measurement of environmental performance. ➜ Global management of environmental risks. ➜ Compliance with environmental regulations in each country ➜ Environmental management system procedures ➜ Eco-efficiency. Eldon Romania Scrap & Toxic Wastes Through the environmental strategy and policy, Eldon SRL Romania has established environmental objectives and targets that ensure respect for the environment, community needs and the resources for future generations. Activities such as collection, handling, storage, elimination and/or capitalizing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated in the production process, is carried out in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, instructions and procedures specific to the production activity. Eldon assessed the environmental aspects and risks associated with significant issues, and implemented an environmental management program that sets out specific measures to limit and/or prevent environmental hazards and achieve the intended performance. An operational control program is being implemented and monitoring of the environmental factors is also performed. This way, Eldon ensures that values of emission resulting from the process are within the limits provided by the law and the applicable regulations are meant for preventing environmental pollution. All the products supplied to our customers meet the requirements of the RoHS2 Directive 2011/65/EU. 26 ELDON HOLDING AB CSR REPORT 2018 All necessary measures and actions have been taken in conjunction with suppliers, to ensure that constitutive materials do not include any substance forbidden by the regulations currently applicable in the market.

Eldon has been closely following the legislative development of the REACH Regulation, and has been working with all concerned suppliers in order to check that all the substances and products delivered to Eldon meet the specifications of the REACH Directive. Energy & climate change We work to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint though developing energy efficiency activities and identifying CO2 emission reduction opportunities. We work to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint, promoting energy efficiency activities in each of our operations, identifying CO2 emissions reduction opportunities and making tangible the results of this effort. This work allows us to reduce our energy costs, improving our competitiveness by being able to offer customer service for the best price. In addition, we help our partners generate business, as they are essential for the development and implementation of energy efficiency projects. Every year we quantify ELDON’S energy consumption and calculate our carbon footprint using a global model based on the GHG Protocol of the ISO 14064 standard. This allows us to identify improvements in our processes and to manage energy and carbon transparently.
