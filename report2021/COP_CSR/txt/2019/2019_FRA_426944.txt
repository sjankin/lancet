ARaymond • GLOBAL COMPACT Communication on Progress 2018 Word from our Chief Executive Officer The ARaymond Network links 7 200 people in 25 countries We believe our enterprise is a social web. Our aim is to develop a meaningful, respectful, useful sustainable enterprise for our collaborators, for their families, for our customers, for our suppliers, for our partners and for the communities we belong to and where we operate. The success of our enterprise is based on the engagement and contribution of people. Our project is to become step by step a global collaborative Network, in which all individual, all teams and all communities roles are important, recognized and empowered. We believe this is the most agile, efficient and sustainable organization in an environment of uncertainty for all stakeholders The cement of a collaborative and contributive organization is TRUST. The trust is generated by a respect of our values in action as well as a leadership of awareness and care. Therefore we continued to extend worldwide our “Servant Leadership” and “Non Violent Communication” trainings. We continued as well to develop and implement our “ATOMS” program in all departments of our organization worldwide. The aim of this program is to develop the empowerment and blossoming of each collaborator, in their role, making them actors and contributors, supported by Servant Leaders. We set up the first bases of our future international CSR policy. We implemented worldwide a full compliance organization in line with the Sapin 2 law. We started our “we cARe” internal initiative to promote “Eco Design”, ‘Eco Conception” and “Circular Economy” We continue worldwide to encourage and develop local charity initiatives. All those intentions and actions are wished, supported and followed up by our Executive Committee composed of 45 Managing Directors and all Corporate Officers of our Network.

Safety Leadership Project Safety: our core value In 2018 we are back with figures in terms of lost time incidents and lost days similar to those of 2016/2017. The incidents mainly concern nonobservance of the PPE wear; our actions are mainly conducted towards the raising of the safety culture awareness. Workshops about « management exemplarity » are being led throughout our network to make safety more vivid in terms of behaviours. Safety Leadership Project Safety: our core value • In 2017 we started a long-term action regarding road risk as it had been identified as one of our major risks. Several actions were taken in 2017 (specific events, flyers distributed). • Actions continued throughout 2018 with a specific group of managers attending a pilot awareness session about safety on the road. This session will be deployed to all drivers with a company car in 2019 and to those who travel a lot between our ARaymond sites: around 30 people will thus be trained. In India as well: road safety is meaningful Employee Volunteering ActivitiesTraffic Awareness in May 2018  Road safety awareness at Alandi Phata  Distribution of Traffic Rules  Appreciation of Rule followers with a small gift www . araymond.com A RAYMOND FASTENERS INDIA Pvt.

After an introduction around their numerous and voluntary-based safety teams, their tool for training, we had the opportunity to visit the plastic and metal plant, to see the Agilox operate. These exchanges are a unique opportunity to make teams meet and grow ! Safety Leadership Project Safety: our core value Because our body is our first working tool ! Focus on our French subsidiary AR Fluid Connection In 2017, we had a lot of lost days due to musculoskeletal disorders. It is the reason why we decided, during the International Day For Safety at work, on the 28th of April 2018, to emphasize this axis through specific workshops. The feedback was very positive from all the employees who pushed to have a warm-up put in place in our company. It is meant for all employees who volunteered. It is deployed today in production, logistics, laboratory and administrative services at specific timeslots during the day. 7-minute exercises at the beginning of the shift during the working time. These exercises are managed by 10 coaches, who have been trained during 2 days by a physiotherapist.
