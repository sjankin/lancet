The importance of these services for society requires specific, constant attention to be paid to the question of economic, environmental and social sustainability. Guaranteeing continuous, secure, fair, full, innovative access to our services is our hallmark, and is intrinsically connected to the sustainable management of our everyday operations, designed to safeguard local communities and their economic activities. This document is the fifth edition of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report. This is an instrument which we believe in and which we willingly dedicate time and resources to, with a view to the transparent reporting of company operations to our stakeholders. Specifically, we have dealt with questions of sustainability, reporting on the 10 key principles proposed by the Global Compact, which we subscribe to each year, by highlighting the link between the Group’s actions and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and undertaking to utilise the Global Compact as a strategic guide for our Group’s operations. The document then goes on to summarise the Group’s performance in economical-financial, environmental and social terms over the course of 2017, and also looks at the future aims characterising corporate decisions in the coming years. It points to an excellent level of performance, with 22 million Euro invested in the Group’s different business units, a profit for the year of over 8.9 million Euro, and a Net Financial Position of 110 million Euro. Since last year we have also been involved in developing the Materiality Matrix, with the aim of getting Stakeholders’ views on key issues. The results are set out in the following sections of the document. The materiality analysis carried out in 2017 represents the start of a journey that will lead to the definition of strategies and objectives that we can share with our stakeholders, to ensure the utmost transparency in terms of the results and impact of our operations. We believe it of crucial importance to reconfirm our Group’s clear commitment to guaranteeing safety right down the value chain. The safety of our employees, of the employees of our suppliers and subcontractors, but also the safety of our customers, who must also be guaranteed fair, impartial access to the services offered. Economic, environmental and social sustainability invariably benefits from a long-term vision that enables us to pursue ambitious aims in keeping with our corporate mission and with the sustainable development of the local communities we are involved with. We hope that your reading of this document is both enjoyable and beneficial, and that each of you manages to gather full, clear information about those areas you are interested in.

It is used to report to, and manage relations and communicate with, all interested parties. The Corporate Social Responsibility Report for the period 1 January 31 December 2017 was drawn up in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G.4) of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and following the drafting guidelines of the GBS Standard (a Corporate Social Responsibility Report Study Group), in particular with regard to the layout and the financial section of the document. The AIM Group has decided to use these two standards as proof of its constant commitment to rendering the reporting process more complete and effective, by increasing the depth of analysis of the issues dealt with, and to render the present document more easily compared to previous years’ versions. Furthermore, the Corporate Social Responsibility Report adopts the principles established by the Global Compact and the objectives of the 2030 Agenda (17 Sustainable Development Goals). The innovative aspect of the 2017 Corporate Social Responsibility Report is its implementation of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016 regarding the notification of non-financial information and information about diversity, aimed at ensuring an understanding of corporate business, its progress, its results and its impact on questions of the environment, society, the well-being of employees, respect for human rights, the fight against active and passive corruption; all aspects deemed of importance, bearing in mind the enterprise’s business activity and characteristics. This document also constitutes the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement that the AIM Group is required to produce in order to meet its obligations concerning disclosure of its operations to the shareholder, not only in economic terms. The Report drawn up thus has followed the basic postulates of the GRI G.4 standard: the materiality of information, Stakeholder engagement in organisational scenarios, the completeness of information, balanced objective debate, the comparability over time and the accuracy of information provided, the clarity of presentation and the technical reliability of information. A list of the indicators provided for by the GRI G.4 are attached herewith, and the corresponding pages of the Corporate Social Responsibility Report in which said indicators are developed are also shown. Since 2012, each year the AIM Group has drawn up its Corporate Social Responsibility Report, and has made it available also on the website www.aimgruppo.it, in the Sustainability section. The document is set out as follows:  Corporate Identity: specification of the mission, benchmark values, strategies and historical development of the AIM Group, its composition and services, the Stakeholders, the Group’s system of governance, organisational structure and certification.  Social Report: containing a description of the projects undertaken, relations with Stakeholders both within and outside of the AIM Group, and the results achieved vis-à-vis the various types of Stakeholder.  The Economic Scale: where Added Value, and its distribution to the principal Stakeholders, are determined. The document is drawn up by a working team of AIM personnel; the information and figures set out in the document are taken from documents officially adopted by the Company, or from reports created by personnel from the various operating areas. In certain cases, the figures set out take account of the three-year period 2015-2017, while the income statement and balance sheet figures are taken from the approved Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 7 Materiality Analysis The AIM Group has prepared the materiality analysis by comparing the importance given by the Group and the Stakeholders to the operations conducted and the material issues reported on in this Corporate Social Responsibility Report. The most important material aspects from the Group’s viewpoint have been appraised, considering them as priorities to be appraised carefully from the economic, social and environmental points of view, together with the importance that these aspects have for the Stakeholders. The material aspects have been identified bearing in mind:  the projects that the AIM Group has developed in relation to the Stakeholders, over the course of the year;  an evaluation of those events held in the geographical area in question;  the involvement of Stakeholders in the proposed issues;  the key documents governing relations in regard to the services provided. In order to get the Stakeholders’ opinions on the priority issues that the company wishes to evaluate, special questionnaires have been prepared containing specific questions regarding the areas in question, relating in fact to the key issues pertaining to each of the chosen categories of investigation. Over 300 questionnaires were sent out, and the results received have been entered in the Materiality Matrix below, after having been reformulated and compared with the company’s internal assessments. The issues that have emerged as material, and the results obtained from the Matrix, are those that the Group will focus and work on in the coming years, as it implements and updates the resulting matrix from one year to the next. In 2017, there were shifts in the value of certain key indicators in the materiality matrix; the top-right quadrant is highlighted to show the most important areas that the company is leaving room for, and will leave room for, in relation to future levels of performance. Many priorities have been reformulated within the framework of those issues deemed significant by Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016, and the present Report shall indicate them using symbols so as to facilitate their reading and understanding. Environmental issues Issues concerning the fight against active and passive corruption Social issues pertaining to employees and to respect for human rights Issues concerning the fight Social issues pertaining to Environmental Issues against active and passive employees and to respect for corruption human rights Emissions Allocated social value Environmental education Transparency Support for projects benefiting Waste management Ethics Stakeholders Sorted waste collection Economic and financial Stakeholder engagement Renewable energy performance Well-being in the company Energy efficiency Agreements with consumer Optimisation of human capital associations Human resource engagement Agreements with the Authorities Health and safety Equal opportunities Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 8 Compared to the previous Corporate Social Responsibility Report, the key issues established by Management have been maintained; there have been changes to the arrangement of priorities within the Matrix, due to the increased care and sensitivity utilised to obtain the evaluations of Stakeholders in our priorities. A more accurate understanding of the dynamics of the shifts in priorities within our Matrix shall be provided next year, when the same instruments used this year shall continue to be adopted.

It establishes the Business Plan and the policy documents, analyses any deviation from the budget, and establishes the corrective actions to be taken. THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE The Management Committee is composed of the General Manager and the senior or middle managers in charge of companies/divisions/services. It meets once a month to examine issues relating to operations. The key role is played by the Management Body of the Parent Company, AIM Vicenza Spa, which is responsible for the management, coordination and control of the companies belonging to the AIM Group. The executive management of the business constituting the corporate purpose is entrusted to the General Manager, who is also responsible for coordinating the operational structure and the organisation of the work of the AIM Group, including the logistical aspects thereof. Dario Vianello was appointed General Manager by deed of 26/08/2011. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 21 The internal control and risk management system The Internal Control and Risk Management System of AIM Vicenza S.p.a. applies the administrative liability management system referred to in Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/2001. Said system consists of a series of rules, procedures and organisational structures designed to permit the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the Group’s principal corporate risks, that is, criminal offences committed in the interest, or for the benefit, of the entity itself by persons vested with representation, administration, management and control functions within the entity, or by the aforementioned persons’ subordinates. The AIM Group has adopted am organisation and control model, and at the same time has appointed the Supervisory Board (SB). The model provides for the initial monitoring of the various operations exposed to the identified risks of crime, and establishes, among other things, a number of specific protocols to be observed in order to prevent those crimes referred to in Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/01 and in other legislation, including the crimes of corruption and extortion. For example, the SB has the following functions:  the supervision of the effectiveness of the Model, by verifying whether actual conduct is in line with that provided for in the Model itself, through the monitoring of those areas at risk of the commission of criminal offences both those characterising the Group’s traditional business activity and those instrumental in the commission of crimes;  the regular control of the adequacy of the Model, that is, its capacity to prevent undesired forms of conduct, and of the Group’s ability to constantly meet the requirements of solidity and functionality, through the continuous monitoring of the system of controls and protocols;  to propose adjustments to the Model in the event that the controls operated call for adjustments to be made. The Group’s companies are constantly busy maintaining the risk control model updated and effective. The Holding Company’s SB has free access to all company documents deemed of relevance, and during the course of 2017 it met 4 times. THE ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE The AIM Group, in order to carry out its operations, has established the following organisational structure subdivided into function, each of which is headed by a Function Manager. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 22 Transparency and Anti-Corruption To further strengthen interaction with all Stakeholders, a special section of the company website has been set up, headed “Transparent Management” (www.aimgruppo.it\amministrazionetrasparente) containing both economic-financial, social and governance-linked information, and up-to-date data and documents of specific interest, enabling Stakeholders to get a multi-disciplinary, integrated picture of the company. The AIM Group possesses an internal policy designed to ensure that each administrative procedure is characterised by transparency and accessibility, in accordance with existing legislation, that is, with Italian Legislative Decree 33/2013 regarding the reorganisation of provisions concerning the duty to disclose and divulge transparent data and information on the part of the public administration and publicly-controlled enterprises, in regard to activity of public interest governed by national or EU law. The business activities governed include the management of public services. Since 2017, the AIM Group has been included in the category of listed public companies, and the Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC), in its resolution no. 1134 of 08/11/2017, set out guidelines, deeming it opportune to “further examine the legislation applicable to listed public companies, as defined by Section 18 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 175/2016, already subject to a separate system of obligations and penalties, and thus to erase that part of the guidelines concerning listed companies, pending the results of such examination”. As a result of the foregoing, AIM Vicenza Spa is exempted from the scope of the provisions regarding transparency under Italian Legislative Decree 33/2013, as are its direct or indirect subsidiaries or investees. The AIM Group, however, continues to disclose information regarding the management of the individual companies, in particular vis-à-vis its Stakeholders, and maintains a level of transparency that is in line with the corresponding legal forms. The AIM Group considers transparency to be a fundamental instrument with which to prevent corruption and to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of its administrative actions. The Code of Ethics is a document expressing a series of “ethical-behavioural” principles that the company adheres to, and which it demands be complied with by its own corporate bodies, employees, collaborators, users and suppliers, and in general by all those who have any dealings with the company. The Holding Company AIM has introduced a series of specific organisational and managerial measures to prevent corruption, and has extended the scope of its own Organisational Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 to those crimes referred to in Italian Law 190/2012, through the adoption of a Three-Year Corruption Prevention Plan and of a Three-Year Transparency and Integrity Programme, as well as the corresponding updates to such, that constitute an Appendix to the Organisational Model itself. The aforementioned Plan establishes the following objectives:  to reduce the likelihood of cases of corruption;  to increase the capacity to identify cases of corruption;  to create an environment unfavourable to corruption. In 2017, 231 hours of training were provided in regard to these subjects, with the aim of creating a more extensive training programme for 2018. Since 2015 the AIM Group has developed and implemented a series of organised actions and activities designed to prevent crimes of fraud against the State and the public administration from being committed, together with the crimes of undue inducement to give or promise benefits, extortion and corruption, in relation not only to public administrations but also to private individuals. Observance of the laws, and the fight against corrupting behaviour, is clearly established in the Group’s Code of Conduct, is implemented in practice and in the operating methods established and adopted through company procedures, and is supported, encouraged and monitored by means of the principal instrument of prevention that AIM has created, namely the Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit (A.T.U.), which mainly:  carries out internal controls in order to monitor company processes and to identify any critical situations or anomalies;  specifically identifies areas potentially at risk;  maps existing processes;  assesses risk; Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 23  identifies appropriate preventive measures. The AIM Group, aware of the importance of the fight against corruption, has decided to strengthen its model of prevention on the basis of the provisions of Italian Law 190/2012 and of the Italian National AntiCorruption Authority's guidelines on the matter. The Anti-Corruption and Transparency Unit meets regularly; in 2017 it met once in that it was awaiting publication of the Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority's guidelines regarding implementation of legislation on the prevention of corruption and on transparency governing Public Administration's investees. Moreover, in 2017 the AIM Group did not bring any legal actions concerning unfair competition, or any antitrust actions, nor were such actions brought by any third parties against the Company itself. Certification The AIM Group, in pursuing the continuous improvement of the quality of services provided, and in order to limit its own environmental impact, has established a system of certification for its own companies based on ISO standards, thus organising the management of certain corporate processes on the basis of specific benchmark standards, and more specifically: REFERENCE DATE OF DATE OF COMPANY NO.

These operations come within the scope of the “Global Service” concession that the parent company, AIM Vicenza S.p.A., signed with the Municipality of Vicenza on 23 November 2009, resulting in the assignment of only the parking management business to the company AIM Mobilità S.r.l. On 25 February 2016, AIM Mobilità S.r.l. and FTV S.p.A. assigned their respective transport businesses to SVT S.r.l., the balance sheet results of which reveal the following equity investments: a 34.66% stake held by AIM Mobilità Srl a 65.34% stake held by FTV S.p.A. Since 1 March 2016, as a result of the assignment of the Local Public Transport business unit to SVT S.r.l., AIM Mobilità S.r.l. has only managed the car parking service. AIM Mobilità S.r.l. has thus continued to manage the car parking service within the Municipality of Vicenza, on behalf of AIM Vicenza S.p.A, this being a service under concession that is part of Global Service. Said car parking service consists of the following:  the management of pay barrier car parks, and street-level car parks (parking spaces marked by blue lines are for pay-by-the-hour parking, while those marked by yellow lines are parking spaces for local residents);  the control of, and the issue of fines in relation to, blue and yellow marked parking spaces;  the maintenance and management of public mobility support systems (information panels, etc.). Car parking spaces in the City of Vicenza are subdivided as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Car parking spaces 634 634 634 marked by yellow lines Car parking spaces 6,521 6,521 6,842 marked by blue lines Parking in blue-marked parking spaces in the city may be paid for not only in cash through the parking meters, but also by smartphone using the “Easy Park” service, after downloading the free APP, whereby payment is only due for the effective parking period. Parking fees vary depending on the area, and they get cheaper the further away from the city centre the parking space is. Payment via APP, activated during the course of the year, accounted for 1% of the total payment transactions made during the year. The yellow-line parking spaces in the city are reserved exclusively for residents, subject to acquisition of the corresponding parking permit. 2017 2016 2015 Barrier car parks 4,488 4,488 4,069 Total parking spaces 11,643 11,643 11,545 In 2017 there are 12 large barrier car parks and 2 interchange car parks, as in 2016, accounting for a total of 4,448 available parking spaces. The shuttle bus service enables people who use the interchange car parks to get directly into the city centre, thus reducing traffic and pollution. 2017 2016 2015 Cars that entered car parks 2,138,020 1,984,459 1,906,566 Cars entering car parks increased by 7.74% compared to 2016. The city of Vicenza has 215 parking meters which people can use to pay for parking their cars. In 2017, POS terminals were installed on 88 payment devices (parking meters and automatic tellers), and these readers can be used to pay by credit card or debit card rather than using cash, thus offering an easy, rapid new payment method. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 28 In 2017, 11% of total annual payments for parking were made using the POS terminals available at the automatic tellers located in barrier car parks. Another new feature introduced by AIM Mobilità at the city’s 12 barrier car parks is the “POSsibile” project, designed to render the use of the city’s car parks even easier and more secure. Vicenza was the first Italian city to introduce this new “Card in – Card out” contactless payment system, which is based on the use of a credit/debit card and a smartphone providing access to and from car parks, without having to use cash and without having to get out of the car. This completely original system, the first of its kind in Italy, can be used by all those who possess a contactless card. In 2017, 2% of transactions were made using this method, which shall be further promoted during the course of 2018. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 29 Environmental services The AIM Group, through its investees, also manages a series of environmental services. Valore Ambiente manages Vicenza Municipality’s urban health service, which comprises the cleaning of public streets and sidewalks and the collection and disposal of solid urban waste. Since 2011 S.I.A. Srl (Società Intercomunale Ambiente), an investee of Valore Ambiente, together with Consorzio C.I.A.T., has managed the operation, construction and extension of the landfill at Grumolo delle Abbadesse. Valore Ambiente remains responsible for the economic exploitation of the biogas drawn from the first part of the landfill. SIT Spa operates in the environmental hygiene sector, where it collects and transports urban waste, is responsible for sweeping public spaces, and provides other urban health services and ancillary services, as well as constructing and operating waste treatment and disposal facilities and landfills. In 2017, the SIT Group consolidates line-by-line the companies TRE V AMBIENTE Srl, a commercial concern that markets environmental services, and BLUEOIL Srl, a company producing energy from vegetable oils. Waste management is governed by Italian Legislative Decree no. 152/2006 the Environmental Decree (Articles 177 et seq.) and by Veneto Region Law no. 52/12. Waste management means the series of policies designed for managing the entire waste cycle:  collection (also through sweeping)  transport  recovery  disposal Waste management is based on the following philosophy:  prevention  preparation for reuse  recycling  other forms of recovery (for example, the recovery of energy)  disposal Our environmental operations are distributed over various different sites: operating sites: Vicenza in Contrà Mure San Rocco, Ca’ Perse, Strada Pelosa; transfer facilities: Monte Crocetta, Biron di Sopra and Casale; landfills: Grumolo delle Abbadesse (VI), Sandrigo (VI), Lonigo (VI) and Grosseto; Municipalities served by the environmental hygiene service: Vicenza, S. Bonifacio (VR), Bolzano Vicentino (VI) and Costabissara (VI); treatment facilities: Sandrigo (VI) and Arzignano (VI). The Environmental Hygiene Service in the Municipality of Vicenza Waste Collection Service The Municipality of Vicenza where Valore Ambiente operates covers a total area of 80.46 km2 and a catchment area of 111,620 inhabitants. For non-domestic users, there is a special “door-to-door” system of waste collection based on the different types of waste produced. Outer areas: the municipal area beyond the outer ring road (Via del Sole, Diaz, Verme, Cricoli, Quadri) comprising the outer neighbourhoods and surrounding villages. Inner areas-boundary area: the municipal area situated between the outer ring road and the inner ring road (Viale Milano, Mazzini, d’Alviano, Rodolfi, Legione Galieno, Margherita) comprising the most densely populated neighbourhoods. City centre area: the area inside the inner ring road. Monumental area: the monumental zone of the city centre. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 30 The waste collection system utilised by 62,170 users of Valore Ambiente during the three-year period 20152017 is subdivided as follows into different types of waste collection: no. of users 2017 2016 2015 Type of Paper Plastic Other Paper Plastic Other Paper Plastic Other collection Roadside rubbish 42,487 42,487 8,996 42,455 42,455 9,699 46,512 45,972 21,327 containers/ bins Door-todoor 19,683 19,683 19,683 19,531 19,531 19,531 15,420 15,960 19,430 collection Cylinder depository system with 33,491 32,756 21,175 magnetic key operated covers In 2017, reorganisation of the system, with the introduction of integrated door-to-door collection, has involved nearly 90% of all customers thus far. Of these, nearly 40% are served with the “door-to-door” system of home pick-up, and extended in large part (80%) to paper and plastic waste collection. The number of containers used for the collection of solid urban waste in the three-year period 2015-2017 was affected by the gradual increase in the number of home pick-up containers and by the concurrent reduction in the number of roadside containers due to the gradual extension of the door-to-door waste collection service. Types of container 2017 2016 2015 Unsorted waste containers 15,976 15,912 15,769 Sorted waste containers 11,206 10,676 10,542 Total number of containers 27,182 26,588 26,311 67,079 tons of solid urban waste were collected in 2017, subdivided as follows: Type of collection 2017 2016 2015 Tons of unsorted waste 16,908 19,991 21,867 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 31 Tons of sorted waste 50,171 48,630 46,308 Total tons of waste collected 67,079 68,621 68,175 In 2017, sorted waste collection accounted for 74.79% of all waste, up 3.17% compared to 2016 (70.87%). (Use of the ISPRA [Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research] Method provided for by Decree no. 146 of 24/06/2016). The kilogrammes of solid urban waste collected per inhabitant per year are around 601, which is equal to 1.65 kilogrammes per day (of which 1.23 kilogrammes is sorted waste). Compared to 2016, the share of waste collected per inhabitant has fallen by 17.97%. The Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research’s report on national figures for 2016 ranks the Municipality of Vicenza 17th out of the 115 municipalities surveyed, and in 4 th place among the 45 provincial capitals with a population of over 100,000. The city’s excellent performance was confirmed in 2017. Furthermore, Valore Ambiente performs an additional waste treatment service on behalf of other municipalities, at the Monte Crocetta transfer plant: 2017 2016 2015 Waste treated on behalf of other 1,463 243 217 municipalities (in tons) Given the new authorisations obtained for the Monte Crocetta and Biron di Sopra transfer plants, in regard to bulky waste treatment, sweeping waste and the treatment of the organic fraction of solid urban waste on behalf of other municipalities, the volume of treated waste increased during 2017. 67,079 tons of waste were collected in the Municipality of Vicenza.

Unsorted waste is sent to the Schio Waste-to-Energy Plant, which is not owned by AIM, and to the landfill at Grumolo delle Abbadesse operated by the investee S.I.A. S.r.l. RECYCLING CENTRES During the course of 2017, Valore Ambiente opened a new recycling centre at San Pio X, in addition to the three such centres already operating in the city. The four recycling centres are at the service of all domestic users for the correct disposal of bulky, recyclable waste such as sheets of glass, plastic containers and objects, paper and cardboard, wood, garden waste, iron scrap and other metals, furniture, books and items of furnishing, car batteries, medicines, batteries, used clothing, nylon, polystyrene, vegetable and mineral oils, empty containers for toxic and flammable waste; furthermore, the North and West recycling centres also take in limited quantities of inert materials, electrical appliances and other durable goods, neon lamps and energy-saving light bulbs, tyres, and cartridges and toner for printers.

The waste to be recovered is separated into the various supply chains, and is then sent to the various recovery plants on the basis of the type of waste. **Disposal refers to any operation regarding the destruction (incineration) or the confinement (landfill) of waste, together with the corresponding preliminary operations (treatment, grouping, initial storage). The waste to be disposed of, composed of the remaining waste from the door-to-door waste collection or the cylinder depository system, or of bulky waste, passes through the Monte Crocetta recovery facility. The adoption of the systems of door-to-door collection and nearby bin collection (cylinder depository system) has encouraged sorted waste collection, and has thus led to an increase in the flow of bulky waste, largely recoverable, to the recycling centres. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 33 For some time now, the recycling centres, in conjunction with the social cooperative “Cooperativa Insieme” that runs said centres, have been recovering waste for its reuse. In regard to this opportunity, a European project has been promoted, in conjunction with said cooperative and five other Italian partners, aimed at the implementation of a model that can be reiterated at the European level, for the large-scale development of the business of the collection of reusable waste and the launch of operations for the preparation of such waste for its reuse. This project is funded within the framework of the LIFE plan entitled “PRISCA”. The tons of waste treated in order to be reused are as follows: 2017 2016 Paper 7.25 3.6 Used clothing 56.54 54.37 Electronic Equipment, Electrical Appliances/Small Electrical 38.35 39.34 Appliances Wood, Furniture 64.68 60.78 Metal, Bicycles, Metal Objects 19.30 15.81 Glass Objects 0.30 0.26 Total in Tons 186.42 174.16 LANDFILL The Grumolo delle Abbadesse landfill, which has operated since 1999 and is currently managed by S.I.A. S.r.l., is 49% owned by Valore Ambiente, and 51% owned by the Consortium of Municipalities C.I.A.T. In the vicinity of the landfill there is a plant for the recovery of the Biogas produced by the old plots of farmland, under the management of Valore Ambiente, with a rated total capacity of 905 kW. In 2017, a total of 4,260 mWh of electricity was produced, of which 3,950 was sold to GSE as renewable energy. 2017 2016 2015 Gross generation of electricity 4,260 5,237 5,133 in mWh Electricity sold in mWh 3,950 4,869 4,805 % of electricity sold from that 92.72% 92.97% 93.61% produced AIM adopts a specific method of treatment for each type of waste, to safeguard the environment. In 2017, following the transport of the waste collected by Valore Ambiente to the facility at Monte Crocetta, 9,532 tons were sent to the landfill at Grumolo delle Abbadesse. 7,376 tons, on the other hand, were sent to the Schio Waste-to-Energy Plant. Other Environmental Hygiene Services provided by Valore Ambiente Washing of rubbish bins 1 standard wash with water every 6 months SUW (Solid Urban Waste) 1 enzymatic treatment every 15 days 1 standard wash with water every 6 months OFSUW (Organic Fraction of Solid Urban Waste) Street Washing Sanitising every 15 calendar days from March to City centre and monumental area October Sanitising every 30 calendar days from March to Boundary area and outskirts October High-pressure water cleaning Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 34 High-pressure water cleaning is an indispensable addition to standard cleaning procedures, and is used to treat important, architecturally prestigious sites, and to rid surfaces of excreta and guano. Mechanical sweeping City centre and monumental area Cleaning from 1 to 3 times a week Boundary area and outskirts Cleaning once every 15 days Manual sweeping and emptying of waste-paper bins Monumental area Cleaning from 1 to 7 times a week City centre, boundary area and outskirts Cleaning from 1 to 3 times a week Weeding Valore Ambiente’s urban health services include the weeding three times a year, between April and September, of the roadsides, pavements and the edges of traffic islands, on behalf of the municipal administration, along the entire length of the city's road network for a distance of approximately 650 km. Instead of using weed-killer, a natural system for the elimination of weeds called 'vapodiserbo’ is employed. In certain specific situations, Valore Ambiente uses strimmers, including electric, low-environmental impact models, to control the growth of weeds. Collection of leaves A seasonal service provided in autumn, to remove dead leaves from the roads and pavements. The service is performed using small and large mechanical or vacuum auto-sweepers, operated by workers who either manually, or with the aid of blowers, move the leaves from the roadsides and pavements towards the area where the sweepers are operating, and if necessary using a truck fitted with “leaf-vacuuming” equipment. The frequency of service provision depends on the quantity of leaves present on the ground. During those periods when fewer leaves fall, they are removed at the same time as the roads are mechanically or manually swept. Cleaning of parks It is the cleaning of green spaces and the regular emptying of waste-paper bins in municipal parks and gardens. The frequency of service provision depends on the location and use of the site; the current programme envisages service provision at least once every fifteen days, and as often as daily if necessary. Other environmental services managed by the AIM Group  The Urban waste treatment and transfer plant situated at Monte Crocetta treats the urban waste collected in the Municipality of Vicenza, together with other smaller quantities of waste from other adjacent municipalities. The plant operates a service for the optimisation of the transport of waste to disposal plants, to reduce the number of vehicles employed. During the course of 2017, the facility treated 23,175 tons of waste, 3,901 tons of which were sent for recovery and 18,643 tons were disposed of.  Special waste selection and sorting facility situated in the Municipality of Sandrigo. The plant, managed by SIT S.p.A., treats special waste from productive operations together with “lightweight multi-material” from sorted waste collection (plastic and metal packaging). During the course of 2017, the plant treated 13,421.60 tons of waste, 63.23% of which was sent for recovery while the remaining part was disposed of. There is a photovoltaic plant on the roofs of the two sheds in which the waste is selected and sorted; this plant produced 145,920 kWh of electricity in 2017, of which 60,487 kWh were transferred to the grid, while the remaining quantity was used in the plant itself.  Plant for composting and treating the dry fraction of urban waste, situated in Arzignano. This plant, managed by SIT S.p.A., has ceased operations. In 2017 operations started on the treatment of 693.34 tons of residual waste sent to the plant during the course of 2016, the year in which the concession for the management of the site terminated; subsequently, cleaning operations were carried out, followed by the disposal of leachate and the securing of the site. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 35  Landfill situated at Masona in the municipality of Sandrigo, that previously dealt with non-hazardous waste, in “Post Operating” phase. The Post-Operating phase of the landfill, which has been closed since 1995, is entrusted to SIT S.p.A. On-going operations in 2017 consisted in the supervision, environmental monitoring and maintenance of the site, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorisation granted by the Provincial Government of Vicenza. Maintenance operations in 2017 comprised the sending to disposal of 1,136.14 tons of leachate deriving from the landfill’s rain-wash.  Landfill situated at Fossalunga, Lonigo, that previously dealt with non-hazardous waste, in “Post Operating” phase. The Post-Operating phase of the landfill, which stopped taking waste in 2007, began in 2010 and is also entrusted to SIT S.p.A. On-going operations in 2017 consisted in the supervision and environmental monitoring of the site, the management of the residual biogas which in previous years had been performed by a cogenerator producing electricity, and since 2017, when there was no longer a sufficient contribution of biogas, directly by flaring. Maintenance operations resulted in the sending to disposal of 1,393.82 tons of leachate deriving from the landfill’s rain-wash. An approximately 1 MW capacity photovoltaic plant, for the generation and sale of electricity, is installed on the landfill, and in 2017 this plant produced a total of 902,525 kWh of electricity.  Landfill for non-hazardous urban waste and SUW, situated at Grumolo delle Abbadesse. This landfill is owned by SIA S.r.l., an investee of the consortium of municipalities C.I.A.T., and Valore Ambiente Srl, the operating partner responsible for the technical management of the landfill. The landfill treats residual urban waste and special waste similar to urban waste; in 2017 it treated 42,363.38 tons of waste, of which 1.42% was recovered and the remaining part disposed of. The landfill generated 4,258,784 mWh of energy, of which 92.92% was sold.  Cogeneration plant for the production of electricity from pure vegetable oil, situated in Bolzano Vicentino. In the early months of 2017, the plant was switched off pending the lease of the business to a specialised company.  Plant for the treatment of leachate, situated in Strillaie, Grosseto. Operations, which are managed by SIT Spa as part of a temporary joint venture with Tecnologie Ambientali Srl of Rimini, consist in the purification of leachate produced by the adjacent landfill (around 34,000 m 3 in 2017). SIT Spa collects waste in two municipalities in the Vicenza area and one in the Verona area Bolzano Vicentino, Costabissara and San Bonifacio which together have a population of 35,000. 11,000 users were served in 2017, and a total of 8,213.6 tons of waste was collected, broken down as follows: Type of collection 2017 Tons of unsorted waste 2,894.56 Tons of sorted waste 5,319.04 Total tons of waste collected 8,213.60 The kilogrammes of solid urban waste collected per inhabitant per year are around 235, which is equal to 0.64 kilogrammes per day (of which 0.42 kilogrammes is sorted waste). 2,904.78 tons of waste, amounting to 35.37% of the total waste collected, were disposed of at the landfill. It should be pointed out that the overall percentage of sorted waste for the Municipalities served by SIT in 2017 was over 75%, a figure that does not coincide with the foregoing in that not all the villages and hamlets’ waste collection is provided by SIT (e.g. at San Bonifacio, paper and sweeping waste are collected by another operator). Natural gas distribution service The gas sector is governed by Italian Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (the “Letta Decree”), which launched the deregulation of the national gas system. The natural gas supply chain consists of the following phases:  procurement  transport  distribution  storage  wholesale operations  retail operations Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 36 The methane gas distribution service involves transporting the raw material over the local gas pipeline network, which Servizi a Rete S.r.l. operates in Vicenza and in certain Municipalities within the Province of Vicenza, as concession holder, and in Treviso on the basis of a service agreement with AIM Vicenza S.p.A, the concession holder, for the delivery of gas to end users. Operations consist in two phases: the pick-up of gas from Snam Rete Gas’ pipelines through first-stage pickup points, followed by its transport and distribution to end users. Sixteen municipalities are supplied with the natural gas distribution service: Altavilla Vicentina, Arcugnano, Bolzano Vicentino, Bressanvido, Grumolo delle Abbadesse, Longare, Montegalda, Monticello Conte Otto, Pozzoleone, Quinto Vicentino, Torri di Quartesolo, Villaverla, Gazzo, Grantorto, Vicenza and Treviso. Using its own infrastructure, Servizi a Rete also supplies other municipalities (Costabissara, Caldogno, Carmignano del Brenta, Thiene) where it operates the service, but only for “overruns”, i.e. for those minimal groups of customers who connect to the network because of their proximity. In the three-year period 2015-2017, the length of the gas network was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Length of the gas network in 1,452 1,447 1,440 km of which Medium Pressure in km 429 410 405 Low Pressure in km 1,023 1,037 1,035 The following materials were used for the gas network: 2017 Gas network in steel km 786 Gas network in polyethylene 482 km Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 37 Gas network in other 204 materials km TOTAL GAS NETWORK 1,472 The gas introduced into the network in the three-year period 2015-2017, in millions of cubic metres, was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 Gas introduced into the network 264.9 254.2 253.9 of which Vicenza and other municipalities within the province of Vicenza 186 177 176.6 Treviso 78.9 77.2 77.5 Gas, which is naturally odourless and colourless, is constantly odorised in the collection and metering plants, so that humans can smell it in the event of a leak or of accidental use. In the case of the gas distribution service, the major factor potentially impacting the environment and safety is the loss of methane gas to the atmosphere. Notwithstanding the fact that the quantity of gas that may be lost to the atmosphere is negligible compared to the total amount introduced into the network, the containment and resolution of the problem of gas losses represent the main aim of those measures designed to guarantee the safety, quality and continuity of the service. The principal monitoring systems distributed are remote control systems that monitor the distribution system’s key parameters, and the alarm systems that discourage or give warning of intentional acts. Moreover, constant checks are made for any gas leaks from piping, together with the routine and extraordinary maintenance of the networks.

During the course of 2017, 6,017 meters were installed, 53.96% of which are electronic. The electronic meters offer the remote reading of a user’s consumption of gas. Within the Municipality of Vicenza, 109 new Redelivery Points were connected up. White Certificates (Energy Efficiency Certificates) The promotion of energy savings through the system of the White Certificates (also known as Energy Efficiency Certificates) was provided for by the Ministerial Decrees of 20 July 2004 (Ministerial Decree 20/7/2004 on electricity, Ministerial Decree 20/7/2004 on gas, as amended). The White Certificates represent an incentive established at European level, for the pursuit of Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 38 the primary energy reduction targets set in the “20-20-20 Climate and Energy” package following the Kyoto Protocol, that is: • reducing CO2 emissions by 20%; • increasing the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 20%; • moving towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency; all by 2020. Distributors of electricity and natural gas are expected to meet certain targets each year in terms of energy savings, measurable in Tonnes of Oil equivalent (TOE) saved; in fact, one White Certificate is equal to a saving of one tonne of oil equivalent (TOE). Servizi a Rete S.r.l. is an obligated party with regard to both the gas sector and the electricity sector, and each year has always met its own set targets through its support for the modernisation, the rationalisation and the reduction in energy costs of the various sectors. In the three-year period 2015-2017, Servizi a Rete was awarded the following White Certificates, subdivided into the two areas of the energy sector: 2017 2016 2015 Gas 18,977 25,961 21,619 Electricity 5,015 10,534 9,036 Total 23,992 36,495 29,560 Electricity management and distribution service The entire supply chain of the electricity market is composed of five phases: The Energy Division of Servizi a Rete Srl is mainly concerned with the transformation and distribution of electricity throughout the Municipality of Vicenza. It also manages a number of electricity generation plants, together with the public lighting service in the Municipality of Vicenza. In the three-year period 2015-2017, the length of Servizi a Rete Srl’s low, medium and high voltage electricity networks was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 High Voltage in km 21.59 21.59 21.59 Medium Voltage in km 445.50 444.20 443.28 Low Voltage in km 643.38 640.82 639.87 TOTAL ELECTRICITY NETWORK 1,110.47 1,106.61 1,104.74 In 2017, the Medium Voltage network was extended by a further 1.97 km, while the Low Voltage network was extended by 7.85 km.

The innovative electronic meters offer the remote reading of a user’s consumption. The generation of electricity, subdivided by source, and the corresponding consumption of such, in mln of kWh, over the three-year period 2015-2017, is as follows: SOURCE OF PRODUCTION (mln kWh) 2017 2016 2015 Traditional non-renewable sources: 67.96 9.84 27.18 Thermoelectric Mincio Power Plant 58.88 1.71 19.26 Cogeneration Cricoli Power Plant 9.08 8.13 7.92 Renewable sources: 1.94 2.10 0.32 Hydroelectric Lobia Local Plant 0.21 0.27 0.32 Group’s photovoltaic plants* 1.73 1.83 Figure not available Total electricity produced 69.90 11.94 27.50 Production of Renewable Electricity as a 2.78% 17.59% 1.16% percentage of Total Energy produced Energy consumed** 1.73 0.10 Figure not available Electricity consumed as a percentage of the total 2.47% 0.84% Figure not available produced * No account is taken of the plant in Sant’Agostino at Valore Città Amcps’ head office because the figure is not available. ** No account is taken of consumption from the Group’s photovoltaic plants because the figure is not available. The Mincio Thermoelectric Power Plant, jointly owned with the companies AGSM of Verona, A2A of Milan and Dolomiti Energia, is the principal source of electric power for AIM (which owns a 5% share in the plant). In 2017 there was a significant increase in the production of thermoelectric energy, because market conditions made production form such source convenient. The Lobia Local Hydroelectric Plant, which is operated by Servizi a Rete, draws on a diversion from the Bacchiglione River to produce green electricity. In 2017 output fell 22.2% from the same period in 2016. The reduced production capacity stems from the collapse in 2013 of part of the masonry structure of the Bacchiglione River intake system. That effectively limited the water flow which could be used for generation of hydroelectric power. The lower output also reflects the machinery maintenance shutdown, which is constantly increasing due to the old age of the plant The saving made was equal to 40 tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE). This production of energy entails benefits for the environment and for air quality in the city of Vicenza, thanks to the absence of CO2 emissions. Finally, it should be pointed out that a construction is currently being designed to disconnect the Bacchiglione River from the industrial canal that feeds the hydroelectric power plant, as required by the Civil Engineering Department, in order to comply with the regional hydrogeological study; the aim of this is to reduce the capacity usable for hydroelectric purposes, while at the same time increasing the flood safety of the area to the north of Vicenza. The electricity produced but not consumed was sold directly to the Electricity Market Operator. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 40 The production of electricity from sources not belonging to the AIM Group, but connected to the Group's network, subdivided according to source, in the 2016-2017 period, is as follows (in mln kWh): SOURCE 2017 2016 Traditional non-renewable sources: 0.63 0.74 Cogeneration 0.63 0.74 Renewable sources: 6.38 6.70 Photovoltaic 5.20 4.66 Hydroelectric 1.18 2.04 Total production of electricity from sources not belonging to 7.01 7.44 the AIM Group The number of photovoltaic plants connected to the network: 2017 2016 2015 Photovoltaic plants 1,108 975 886 of which operated, but 18 18 not owned, by AIM* *Plants installed on schools within the Municipality of Vicenza Public Lighting Service The Energy Division includes the Public Lighting Department that manages the operation and standard maintenance of the public lighting service in the Municipality of Vicenza, on the basis of the Global Service agreement stipulated in 2009 by the Municipality of Vicenza and AIM Vicenza S.p.A. In 2014, work began on replacing the old lighting installations with more modern, energy-saving LED lighting, with a view to replacing all public lighting in Vicenza, should the project submitted to this end be approved by the appointing authority. 24 extra lighting points were added in Vicenza during the course of 2017, and they now total: 2017 2016 2015 16,226 16,202 16,181 93 extra energy-saving LED lights were added in Vicenza during the course of the three-year period 20152017: 2017 2016 2015 1,054 1,023 961 The LED lights have resulted in the saving of energy and the consequent reduction in costs, as well as lower greenhouse gas emissions, which amount, in tons of CO2, to: 2017 2016 92 75.3 The length of the public lighting electrical lines, in km, is: 2017 2016 456 456 District heating service Servizi a Rete manages the production of both electricity and of thermal energy, and distributes and sells thermal energy to customers connected to the district heating network in the Municipality of Vicenza. The district heating service project goes back to 1980, when a market survey involving the entire city of Vicenza was conducted, regarding the consumption of thermal energy for heating and hot water purposes. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 41 The district heating network and the power plant in Viale Circoli were built in the period 1988-1990, and the district heating service was launched in October 1990. To meet increased heating requirements, the power plant was upgraded in 1997 with the installation of two new cogenerators, commissioned in 2000, and a new boiler in 2008, thus bringing the rated capacity of the plant to produce electrical power up to 4.5 MW, and its capacity to produce thermal power up to 29 MW. The thermal energy plants are located in Viale Cricoli and in Via Monte Zebio. In the three-year period 2015-2017, the length of the district heating network was as follows: 2017 2016 2015 22.53 22.39 22.3 In the three-year period 2015-2017, the following energy was supplied (in GWh): 2017 2016 2015 43.06 42.5 39.6 In the three-year period 2015-2017, the equivalent apartments (apartments of 80 m2) were as follows: 2017 2016 2015 11,290 11,179 10,125 28.07% of the buildings connected to the service in 2017 were of a residential type, while 71.93% were of the service-sector type.

Mowing and pruning operations are performed through the acquisition and use of new technologically advanced, high-performance equipment and machinery (chainsaws, blowers, hedge trimmers, hedge cutters, strimmers, pole pruners) that minimise the environmental impact of operations, that is, they reduce emissions and fuel and energy consumption, and considerably reduce noise levels to the benefit both of nearby residents and passers-by, and the operators themselves. Buildings management The buildings service regards the maintenance/repair, renovation and replacement of public buildings’ finishes, the work required to supplement, or maintain the operation of, existing technological systems, and extraordinary maintenance operations involving the renovation or replacement of structural parts of buildings. A total of 222 structures were managed in 2017, as follows: Sports grounds 13 Care facilities 5 Cemeteries 8 Primary schools 26 Nursery schools 30 Middle schools 12 Kindergartens 8 Museums, libraries, historical 19 buildings Historic palaces 12 Gyms 26 Municipal parks 52 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 45 Decentralisation 10 Crematorium 1 Valore Città Amcps possesses a sophisticated remote management system with which it remotely controls the heating systems in the main public buildings, including schools; this technology is capable of optimising consumption on the basis of outside temperatures, and can promptly report any faults or malfunctioning. In maintenance operations, AIM utilises non-toxic, light, insulating materials such as aerated concrete blocks for walls, or insulation panels in calcium silicate or natural fibres. Furthermore, high-heat-efficiency false ceilings and doors and windows are installed in order to reduce fuel consumption, and thus CO2 emissions. Funeral and cemetery service management As from 1 January 2000, the Municipality of Vicenza has assigned Valore Città Amcps Srl the management of funeral and cemetery services. The Company is thus responsible for the routine and extraordinary maintenance of Vicenza’s cemeteries, from the structures themselves to the access roads, during the various phases of design, works management and construction. The Company is also responsible for looking after the green spaces in the cemeteries, such as the flower beds, trees and plants, as well as votive lighting. It also controls the operations of third parties in regard to the cemetery (the transport of coffins, the laying of tombstones, family tombs, etc.). Valore Città Amcps manages 8 cemeteries in the Municipality of Vicenza: Maggiore Longara Casale Polegge Bertesina Settecà Maddalene Acattolico Valore Città Amcps provides all of the cemetery services that the law requires the Municipality to provide, the control and coordination of the fitting, removal, preparation of tombstones and votive lighting, the cremation of bodies at the Maggiore cemetery in Vicenza, and burials.

The Group is increasingly committed to rendering information about its services simple and readily available. These are the key underlying principles that the Group follows in order to ensure that customer relations are long-lasting, through the adoption of a variety of channels of communication with customers. For years now, the Group has undertaken to comply with general and specific quality standards, and to constantly improve the services provided through technological, organisational and procedural solutions designed to further the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations. In recent years, the Group has become increasingly concerned with promoting and supporting projects for improving energy efficiency, increasing the separate collection of waste, teaching the public about the correct use of waste and energy, and in doing so has tried to divulge the importance of the safeguarding of the local environment and of the correct use of resources, through its relations with its own key Stakeholder, the Customer. Relations with energy service customers AIM Energy and CogasPiù Energie are the AIM Group’s commercial companies, and they operate in the sale of electricity and natural gas to various types of customer. In the three-year period 2015-2017 AIM served the following number of customers: 2017 2016 2015 Electrical power 88,030 82,512 75,381 Natural gas 128,028 125,603 98,369 Total 216,058 208,115 173,750 Customers Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 48 81.35% of Electrical Power customers are of the residential type, representing a net increase of 6.69% over the figure for 2016. 93.01% of Natural Gas customers are of the residential type, representing a net increase of 1.93% over the figure for 2016. AIM Energy’s marketing campaign is designed not only to strengthen its own identity in the Veneto region, but also to further reinforce its presence in other Italian regions, such as Lombardy where last year it began a joint project with a marketing agency operating in Milan, Monza and the Brianza area. The activity of CogasPiù Energie is also aimed at bolstering its own identity in the Region of Abruzzo and, through 23 sales agencies, in many regions of Italy.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 49 The offers promoting green energy are identifiable by the following logo, guaranteeing respect for the environment. Access to services The AIM Group operates in the best interests of its customers and the public, and facilitates access to its own services for less well-off families, through the development of a variety of agreements. The “Social Bonus”, included in the energy bill, is offered to those citizens who meet special requirements, as per the ARERA provision. The trend of disbursement of the Social Bonus from 2015 to 2017 was as follows: Disbursement of the Social Bonus 2017 2016 2015 Gas Bonus € 316,444.63 € 370,645.79 € 423,486.63 Electricity Bonus € 202,341.27 € 178,613.53 € 179,397.79 Contracts that benefited from the Bonus 7,126 5,182 5,785 The Gas Bonus is a discount on the gas bill, introduced by the Government and implemented by the Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water (ARERA) with the cooperation of the nation’s municipalities, to guarantee a saving for those families who find themselves in specific difficult circumstances. The Bonus is envisaged for: families in financial difficulties Families with an Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator of no more than 7,500 Euro large families with more than 3 dependent children and an Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator of no more than 20,000 Euro. Also the Electricity Bonus is a discount on the electricity bill, introduced by the Government and implemented by AEEGSI with the cooperation of the nation’s municipalities, to guarantee a saving for those families who find themselves in specific difficult circumstances. The Bonus is envisaged for: families in financial difficulties families with an Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator of no more than 7,500 Euro large families with more than 3 dependent children and an Equivalent Economic Situation Indicator of no more than 20,000 Euro in cases of physical disability and serious illness in cases where a serious illness requires the utilisation of electrically-powered, life-saving medical appliances. Another form of welfare support for poorer families in the Municipality of Vicenza is that offered by the cooperation with the charitable organisation “Caritas”, through the creation of a fund for the association Diakonia Onlus, the operating wing of Caritas, for those families in temporary financial difficulties, intended to cover part of the cost of gas and electricity. The AIM Group, which has renewed this agreement for the past six years now, in 2017 disbursed 12,448.83 Euro, a sum that was used in 135 local situations of social and economic difficulty. AIM Energy also provides for special repayment plans for families in socio-economic difficulties resident in the Municipality of Vicenza. An annual agreement is stipulated with the latter to help with the payment, in instalments, of gas and electricity bills. Furthermore, special educational/informational projects have been agreed on with the Municipality of Vicenza, designed to inform people about the correct use of electricity so as to avoid unnecessary waste. In 2017, agreements were stipulated with 64 resident families. Other forms of help provided to more “sensitive” customers include:  facilitated access to the desks and to the car parks for customers with physical disabilities  the translation of bills in foreign languages for customers from other nations  website navigation in other languages Commercial and promotional activities Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 50 Knowing the expectations of the Customer, the main stakeholder of the AIM Group, offering punctual and innovative services, proposing them to the greatest number of people at favourable conditions, enhancing their communication and facilitating their accessibility are the corporate responsibility objectives that the Group undertakes to achieve with concrete initiatives and offers. The Group's commercial companies offer diversified energy offers and tariff plans, suited to the needs of the various types of customer, comprising households and companies. The offers provide benefits in terms of savings through discounts, support services, energy bonuses, electronic billing, online desk, billing based on real consumption and, to customers that are more attentive to the sustainability issue, also the sale of electricity produced from certified renewable sources with social awareness campaigns. In 2017 AIM Energy and CogasPiù Energie introduced two new promotional campaigns, such as: Natale120: it rewarded customers who chose AIM Energy with 120 Euro in store credit that can be spent at a major local retailer; IperSpesa: it rewarded new gas or electricity customers with 25 Euro per commodity in store credit that can be used at a major local retailer. Furthermore, in 2017 AIM Energy created the Servizio Energia Base brand in order to comply with Brand Unbundling provisions. The campaign, aimed at illustrating the difference between protected market and free market, promoted the offers and services developed by AIM Energy in the free market, with a view to brand loyalty and brand reputation consolidation. For the sale of electricity, AIM Energy and CogasPiù Energie continued to promote green energy in 2017 in order to serve end customers in the free market with the supply of electricity produced entirely from certified renewable sources, or with certifications (Guarantees of Origin) that attest to the green source of production. The end customers are therefore guaranteed 100% renewable energy with no additional costs or contractual changes. Other active commercial offers are: Energia Più with which a 10% discount is applied to the selling price of electricity; Idea Fissa Luce on the other hand allows the customer to set the price of the commodity for a whole year, while Sempre Luce allows the customer to save with a 10% discount on the energy price set by ARERA, and Business Light offers a discount on the electricity market price for small and medium-sized businesses. For the sale of natural gas, the Easy Winter promotion is active, which involves sending monthly bills from November to April, and on a bimonthly basis for the remaining months of the year. This billing method allows the payment of the winter bills, those in which most of the consumption is concentrated, to be spread out. On top of this is the advantage of reporting self-reading, obtaining a 5 Euro discount each, and paying only for the actual consumption. Idea Fissa Gas allows to set the price of natural gas for a year and obtain a further discount through self-readings. Solido Risparmio grants up to 80 m 3 of natural gas free of charge for customers with consumption greater than or equal to 1,000 m 3 and who pay by bank account or otherwise of 60 m3 in case of payment by postal payment slips. Ben Spesa offers customers 50 Euro in store credit that can be used at a major local retailer. Another active promotional offer is Sconto Vero which offers a discount to the billing of the customer's real consumption for the supply of natural gas. Among other active commercial campaigns in 2017 is also Porta un Amico, through which the customer who invites a friend to sign a contract for the supply of electricity and natural gas in the free market with AIM Energy receives 30 Euro in store credit that can be used at a major local retailer. Agreements The Group's commercial companies entertain relations based on an effective collaboration with the representatives of the various consumer associations operating in the territory concerned. As mentioned, in 2017 AIM confirmed the agreement with Caritas Diocesana in Vicenza, providing the association Diakonia Onlus with a fund needed to help the less fortunate families of the City of Vicenza. For several years an agreement has been in place with the Christian Association of Italian workers (ACLI) of Vicenza, which provides exclusive discounts to members in relation to the supply of natural gas and electricity, as well as the agreement in the supply of information on energy consumption to raise citizens' awareness of the correct use of energy. Desks Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 51 In 2017, the AIM Group made available, for energy services, 9 sales desks, of which 7 are located in the Veneto region, 1 in Abruzzo and 1 in Lazio. Furthermore, CogasPiù Energie makes 23 sales agencies available throughout Italy, specifically in the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Lazio, Puglia and Lombardy. In all relationships with customers, the AIM Group ensures compliance with the Privacy Code in the management of personal data (Legislative Decree 196/2003). In the 9 physical desks open to the public, customers can find numerous information leaflets concerning the self-reading service, consumer education campaigns and the many promotions active in the electricity and natural gas market.

Customer Satisfaction Survey on Gas and Electricity sale services The knowledge of citizens and customers’ needs is the basis from which the AIM Group starts to continuously expand the quality of its services, analysing the data that are periodically collected through customer satisfaction surveys. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 53 The customer satisfaction survey, carried out in 2017, was conducted by an independent research company through interviews, telephone calls and visits to desks and shows overall very satisfactory results. It was carried out by breaking down the customer base into residential and business customers and the results gathered are as follows: RESIDENTIAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS Overall satisfaction with the service offered 8 7.85 Average retention value 8.23 8.18 Values from 0 to 10 In summary, the overall assessment shows that both residential and business customers have shown a good level of satisfaction with the service offered and highlights the excellent image and reputation enjoyed by AIM Energy, especially in its historical reference context. Customers positively evaluate the multiple contact channels with the company and the ease of interaction with the same company, showing appreciation for the work done in terms of optimisation and continuous improvement of the user experience to which AIM Energy is particularly attentive. All these elements contribute to increasing customer retention, with customers who state their conviction to remain loyal to AIM Energy in the coming years as well. Customer support In order to improve the quality of the service, AIM provides customers with a Customer Relations department that handles customer requests with care and punctuality, including those that can be classified as Complaints. The objective of the ongoing monitoring of complaints by the AIM Group is to identify critical issues and define and implement corrective actions. In particular, the department handles, through a specific system, the written requests of customers, replying in a maximum of 8 calendar days in 2017, which is fully within the maximum limits set by ARERA (a maximum of 40 calendar days for complaints and billing adjustment requests and a maximum of 30 days for information requests). The customer who finds the email address reclami@aimenergy.it or info@cogaspiu.it in the bill, to which reference should be made in the event of any reports, automatically receives information on the method and timing of the reply. In addition, a complaint form or other written report can be found at AIM's customer service desk.

In 2017, out of 2,561 files received from AIM Energy channels 308 Thank-you notes came in, equal to 12.03%. Quality in the electricity and natural gas distribution service The AIM Group, through its subsidiary Servizi a Rete Electricity and Natural Gas Division, manages the electricity grid of the Municipality of Vicenza and the natural gas network in the city and in other 12 municipalities in the province of Vicenza, as well as two other municipalities of the province of Padua and in the municipality of Treviso. For the distribution of electricity, with Resolution 646/2015/R/eel, which came into force on 1 January 2016, AEEGSI approved the Integrated Output-Based Regulation of Electric Power Distribution and Metering Services” for the period 2016-2023. The AIM Group annually reports all indicators requested by the Authority, and these were fully satisfied in 2017. Compliance with commercial quality standards is constantly monitored through the use of dedicated software that can transmit alerts at the same time as every anomaly that is recorded and may generate an order for automatic compensation to be paid. In 2017 Servizi a Rete served over 71,000 users on a 1,110.47 km network.

For the distribution of natural gas, Servizi a Rete manages gas transport through local pipeline networks, for delivery to end users through two phases: the pick-up of gas from Snam Rete Gas’ pipelines through firststage pick-up points, followed by its transport and distribution to end users. Gas distribution activities are carried out by the AIM Group according to the rules of functional unbundling envisaged for vertically integrated companies in the sector, in compliance with the principles of economy and profitability and the confidentiality of company data for the purpose of promoting competition, efficiency and adequate quality levels in the service provided. Overall, in 2017 Servizi a Rete, for the division relating to the distribution of natural gas, managed 133,853 users, introducing more than 264 million cubic meters of natural gas into the network. USERS SERVED 2017 2016 2015 no. of users served 133,853 133,578 133,527 The natural gas distribution service makes reference to the commercial quality parameters set by ARERA. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 55 In 2017, the minimum times and levels required by the Gas Distribution Service Quality Regulation (RQDG) were widely complied with. Maximum time ARERA quality standards expected by 2017 2016 ARERA Estimation for simple works 15 business days Estimation for complex works 30 business days Execution of simple works 10 business days Supply activation 10 business days Supply deactivation 5 business days Reactivation following deactivation due to lack of 2 business days payment Gas losses no. 263 250 Gas network interruptions no. 405 418 Gas network interruptions users 1,070 1,101 The interruptions in the gas supply service take place mainly during the execution of renewal works on the network, upon switching of user connections from the old to the new pipeline. They are divided into scheduled interruptions, if the works are scheduled in advance and citizens can be promptly notified of the interruption, and interruptions without notice, usually in case of breakdowns with immediate operations, or those for which it is not possible to notify all customers involved at least one day prior to the interruption. To limit the duration of the interruptions as much as possible, Servizi a Rete intervenes with the timely scheduling and rationalisation of operations. In all cases in which it is technically feasible, however, Servizi a Rete informs the users involved in the interruptions in advance through the affixing of information posters and, in some specific cases, through telephone contact. The safety of the network is key. The inspection of the networks, an effective emergency response service and the right concentration of the level of odorisation are basic elements for the correct management of the gas distribution system, which is supported by the continuous modernisation of the networks. ARERA envisages obligations for gas distribution companies in relation to network safety, including the inspection of high, low and medium pressure networks with the aim of greater control over losses. It also imposes minimum levels of odorisation for the protection of people and property from damage resulting from accidents caused by the distributed gas. In 2017 Servizi a Rete Gas Distribution carried out 202 call-outs for odorisation checks. The Electric Power, Gas and Water System Authority (Resolution 574/14) establishes that gas distribution companies are required to comply with safety service obligations, including those concerning the frequency of network inspections. The current regulation provides for a differentiation of the obligation depending on the type of network and operating pressure, requiring compliance with the following criteria: 1. 100% inspection of high and medium pressure networks: 3 years 2. 100% inspection of low pressure networks: 4 years 3. 100% inspection of HP/MP and LP networks in materials other than cathodically protected steel, polyethylene, re-cast iron and cast iron with joints not in hemp and lead: 1 year. The scheduled inspection of the gas networks also leads to greater control over losses. The initiatives taken by the company to reduce gas losses in the network are focused on the search for leaks, preventive maintenance of the gas pipes and the replacement of the grey cast iron network with hemp and lead joint.

There are many initiatives promoted and developed in 2017 to raise citizens' awareness of collection and more effective consumption. Valore Ambiente, in order to meet the demand for more information to foreign citizens living in the city, has distributed and included on the website www.aimambiente.it 9 guides on waste collection in as many foreign languages (French, Spanish, English, Arabic, Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Bengali, Chinese). In order to prevent the dumping of waste on the ground, Valore Ambiente has strengthened its supervision through video surveillance systems on a police car and provided, for more than 200 hours, a resource on the street to carry out training at strategic points of the city of Vicenza. Over 900 people have been contacted for mutual listening and dialogue. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 57 Valore Ambiente began to conduct an additional lay-by cleaning service on Monday mornings to remove any dumped waste. It developed and implemented the service for door-to-door paper and plastic collection lines for commercial users, recreational places such as sports facilities in the city, local festivals and events. A collection service has been set up for special waste in the city's neighbourhoods, through a structure that provides for the controlled delivery of small waste that users, who habitually adopt the door-to-door service, hardly hand over to recycling centres: used clothing, batteries, expired pharmaceuticals, neon tubes... Other initiatives carried out for citizens in 2017 the extraordinary street cleaning service with towing that, in the first week of each month, provides for the simultaneous washing and sweeping of the road and the pavement, as well as the external washing of any bins, in addition to the routine street cleaning and hygiene services that are already carried out throughout the city. Two important communication tools have been made available to users: a reminder hanger and a convenient free SMS messaging service that notifies in advance in which streets the washing service will take place and what roads need to be vacated. The free distribution by Valore Ambiente, for the campaign for the collection of waste cooking oil, of a 3-litre container, equipped with a sieve and airtight cap, for the collection of domestic oil, which can then be emptied at one of the 3 urban recycling centres. The company sought to invest energy and resources in service and practicality, bringing collection points closer to users. Therefore, in collaboration with some supermarkets and businesses, ten green containers were placed in ten strategic points in the city, with a capacity of 500 litres each, equipped with special systems designed to prevent the leakage of liquid. Another service dedicated to users is the collection of garden waste at home. The collection of garden waste is a service offered to users free of charge.

Valore Ambiente, in collaboration with the Municipal Administration, provides a collection and disposal service for waste containing asbestos (e.g. Eternit) from households in the municipal area. Customer Satisfaction Survey on environmental services offered in the Municipality of Vicenza The knowledge of citizens and customers’ needs is the basis from which the AIM Group starts to continuously expand the quality of its services, analysing the data that are periodically collected (usually every two years) through customer satisfaction surveys. The customer satisfaction survey, carried out in 2017, was conducted by an independent research company through interviews, telephone calls and visits and shows overall very satisfactory results. It was carried out by breaking down the customer base into city centre domestic, business and domestic with cylinder depository system and door-to-door system.

Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 61 Suppliers Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 62 Supplier Relations The suppliers of the AIM Group Companies occupy a strategic position in achieving the Group's growth and sustainability objectives. The AIM Group Companies are subject, in the various sectors, to the regulations governing public procurement contracts, the acquisition of assets and the assignment of services and the execution of works to third parties, the main legislative reference of which is the Public Contracts Code. The selection of Suppliers is therefore carried out in compliance with the principles enshrined in the EU Treaty for the protection of competition, as well as the general principles of sound governance, effectiveness, efficiency and economy, aimed at ensuring that acquisitions and awards of contract are carried out with transparency and at the best conditions. The internal rules of awards of contract and performance are also inspired by the legislative principles of proportionality, rotation, non-discrimination and equal treatment between economic operators. The AIM Group, through its Tenders Portal, manages a centralised Supplier Register, which allows online registration and subsequent qualification during the tender phase of the economic operators concerned. The economic operators to be consulted are identified on the basis of information regarding compliance with requirements related to general qualification, professional ethics, characteristics of economic-financial and technical-organisational qualification, and in particular, recently, minimum environmental requirements. For some types of supplies and services, the AIM Group Companies require candidates, within reason and where permitted, to possess specific technical, organisational and economic-financial skills, as objective as possible and always proportionate to the nature and the subject of the contracts, as well as, more and more frequently, to prove the fulfilment of the quality standards issued on the basis of the European standards of the UNI EN ISO 9000 series and others. All suppliers and contractors are required to comply with environmental and safety standards, to protect work conditions, and finally to adhere to the Code of Ethics approved by the Group and the management model pursuant to Italian Law No. 231/2001. The AIM Group is implementing the dissemination and promotion of sustainable issues and criteria related to procurement and contracts, especially for specific types of purchases and for the performance of works, including through the application of CAMs, the Minimum Environmental Criteria required for a contract to be identified as green according to the guidelines of the PAN-GPP, National Green Procurement Action Plan. In 2017, the Group Companies supported numerous collaborations for the development of sustainable information campaigns targeted at local trade associations interested in the various CAMs. The tenders conducted in 2017, containing sustainable criteria, came to 13 for a total value of over 2.8 million Euro. The AIM Group considers it important to spread knowledge and use of environmental certifications, not only referred to products and services but also within the scope of other processes and projects, a requirement that is now consolidating in many tenders, through ISO 9000, ISO 14000, OHSAS and other certifications. The Group aims, in conclusion, to build a transparent, proactive and cooperative relationship with suppliers, involving them in the compliance with the quality, environmental and safety standards adopted by the Group. In 2017 the AIM Group Companies placed orders with a value of 27,836,394.15 Euro through Public Tender or Direct award of contract/non-public tenders. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 63 EUR million *understood as public tenders with a value of over 40,000 Euro Public tenders The criteria for the selection of economic operators normally concern: a) professional competence requirements b) economic and financial standing c) technical and professional skills The awarding of tenders mainly takes place with the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to evaluate, according to different parameters based on the type and characteristics of the award, economic, qualitative, social, environmental, ethical and safety aspects. The Group Companies undertake to inform the supplier in a correct and timely manner regarding the characteristics of the contracts, the payment methods and times in compliance with current regulations and internal accounting procedures, contents and contractual clauses in general. The AIM Group guarantees its suppliers that the performance of the contract is carried out in a manner consistent with the principles of equality, fairness, diligence and good faith in compliance with current legislation, the contracts signed and internal company procedures. The professional and technical suitability of contractors or subcontractors in relation to works, services and supplies to be awarded either under a tender or by works contract or manpower supply contract is scrupulously verified, providing contractors with detailed information on specific risks in the environment in which they are intended to operate and on the preventive and emergency measures taken in relation to their activities. Where applicable, the Companies prepare the risk assessment document which indicates the measures taken to eliminate or minimise the risks from interference; they draft the interference risk assessment document which includes an evaluation of the standard risks related to the type of work that could potentially derive from the performance of the contract. The companies cooperate in the implementation of the measures designed to prevent and protect from risks on the work site that have an impact on the work activity subject to contract, coordinate the operations aimed at the protection from and prevention of the risks to which the workers are exposed, thereby exchanging information, in order to eliminate risks due to interference between the activities of the different companies involved in the performance of the overall work (Articles 14 and 26 of Legislative Decree 81/2008). The electronic Supplier Register is available on the portal http://gareonline.aimvicenza.it/portale/index.php and can be accessed by all economic operators wishing to collaborate with the AIM Group. The Group Companies, through AIM Vicenza Spa, in particular, use the specific and innovative electronic Portal for a more prompt and functional management of the procedures for the acquisition of goods, services and for the assignment of works. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 64 Thus, communication between AIM Vicenza Spa and companies is more straightforward and access to tender procedures is made easier. The registration system of economic operators within the Portal, and their subsequent profiling, contributes to expanding the list of potential suppliers, as well as making the supply of goods and services and the assignment of works more open and competitive. Registering suppliers are assigned unique and confidential credentials, which allow access to the Portal and the respective files. The number of public tenders conducted by the Group in 2017 came to 113* for a total awarded value of over 16 million Euro. *tenders starting from an amount greater than 40,000 Euro 88 tenders with an amount greater than 40,000 Euro Purchases on the territory In 2017, the AIM Group issued 2,737 orders to 2,647 suppliers for a total value of 27,836,394.15 Euro.

The financial management objective is to guarantee the Group an adequate current and future balance between investments and capital use on the one hand and sources of financing on the other hand and, for the latter, negotiate sustainable conditions, both in terms of repayment plan and rate type and extent. For the performance of its activities, the AIM Group resorts to self-financing, as well as to short-term debt capital (to be repaid within the following year) and long-term debt (to be repaid beyond the following year). The debt capital structure at 31 December 2017 stood at 170.02 million, up 14.32%. EUR million 2017 2016 2015 short-term financial payables 34.63 49.02 56.06 medium/long-term financial payables 135.39 99.70 100.57 Total financial debt structure 170.02 148.72 156.63 The Group's financial structure shows an increase mainly due to the Bond issue and over 79% consist of medium/long-term debts. The credit facilities are not concentrated on a single lender but are distributed among the leading Italian banks with which the Group has entertained consolidated relations for years. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 67 The Net Financial Position amounts to 110 million Euro, up compared to 2016. The overall position was substantially unchanged net of the accounts settled with the City of Vicenza, which is typically done at the end of the year. The AIM Group is among the first Italian companies operating in the local public services sector which the European Investment Bank has involved in the new loan programme called Medium Sized Utilities Programme Loan”, intended to support companies’ medium-term development plans. The important banking institute, based in Luxembourg, has approved a credit line of 45 million Euro, to directly finance investments in the environment, gas, electricity and heat sectors planned in the five-year period 2014-2018, period in which the AIM Group is called upon to face the challenges of the free market resulting from the withdrawal from the in-house arrangement, especially in the distribution of methane gas, but also in the business units relating to the management of company assets and the environment. The financial expenses accrued on debt capital in 2017 also fell by 4.71% and amounted to over 5 million. The AIM Group, for over 5 years, has entertained relations with the Banca Etica credit institution which recognised the Company’s corporate and environmental requirements, thereby allowing the opening of some credit facilities aimed at the company’s economic-corporate sustainability. In September 2017, AIM Vicenza completed the process of issuing an unsecured bond amounting to 50 million Euro through listing on the regulated market of the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE), one of the reference trading venues at the European level for the corporate bond market. The unrated private placement was fully subscribed by institutional investors. The bonds will have a duration of 7 years, expiring in 2024, and an annual coupon of 1.984%. The principal will be repaid according to an amortisation schedule divided into constant annual principal amounts. The proceeds from the issue will be used to fund the important investment programme, in the various business areas, envisaged by the Business Plan approved by the Municipality of Vicenza and will allow, through a diversification of the sources of financing, to continue the Group’s financial consolidation process pursued in recent years. Among others, complex operations will be carried out on the electricity networks and part of the financial resources will contribute towards the upcoming tenders for the award of the methane gas distribution service. The operations planned in the environmental sector are not of secondary importance, among which the construction of a major centre in eastern Vicenza stands out.

In particular, 36 students participated in the innovative teaching method implemented by the AIM Group called School-Work Alternation , which provides, through specific projects in line with their study plan, a first significant contact with the employment world. Incentive system Incentive payments are linked to the achievement of profitability, quality and production effectiveness objectives of the individual companies and of the AIM Group, in the presence of positive results. By profitability, quality and production effectiveness objectives is meant the orientation towards implementation of the development and rationalisation guidelines contained in the Business Plan, as defined and articulated in the budgets of each individual Company. The indispensable elements for payment or otherwise of the incentive are achievement of a profit in the financial statements of the Company and consolidated financial statements of the Group. Once the condition has been fulfilled, payment of the incentive will depend on the achievement of the profitability, quality and production effectiveness objectives of each Company, Division or Service, for 90% of the amount established per capita for the 2017 incentive. The incentive will therefore be correlated as follows:  45% with the Profitability parameter;  45% with the Production Effectiveness and Quality parameter and, in particular, with the results obtained in the implementation of projects or objectives;  the remaining 10% will be allocated to individual workers according to the assessments made by their respective managers based on the objective criteria agreed and submitted to the approval of the Senior Managers of the individual Companies, Divisions or Services and validated by the Parent Company. Managers have been trained, in specific sessions with external experts, in order to make application of the assessment criteria as homogeneous as possible. For payment of the latter component of the incentive, the criteria are:  effectiveness and continuity of collaboration;  technical operational support in achieving company objectives;  results achieved;  initiative;  proactivity.

As regards accidents in the workplace, in order to prevent them and minimise their number, AIM Group companies carry out the following activities, in line with legislative requirements regarding safety in the workplace:  information on risks in the workplace;  health surveillance (periodic examinations);  preparation of risk assessment documents;  preparation of internal emergency plans;  provision of personal protective equipment (accident prevention equipment);  health and safety training. The main accident indicators of the AIM Group are as follows: (the calculations used for the indicators refer to overall accidents with commuting and 0 days accidents) ACCIDENT INDICATORS 2017 2016 Severity * 0.98 0.93 Frequency ** 35.12 28.93 Incidence *** 57.75 48.25 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 81 Duration **** 27.97 32.30 * (total days of absence/total hours worked)*1,000 ** (total accidents/hours worked)*1,000,000 *** (total accidents/average number of employees)*1,000 ****(total days of absence/no. of accidents) The accident incidence indicator shows a small increase due to the increase in commuting accidents and similarly there is an increase in the frequency indicator. The accident duration indicator decreased compared to 2016, indicating a lower severity of individual episodes, while the severity indicator increased slightly. Meetings are scheduled during the year involving the Management, the Health and Safety Department, the Company Doctor and workers' safety representatives to manage actual or potential problems related to workers' health and safety. Among the human resources employed by the Group, it is believed that the jobs most exposed to high incidence and high risk of specific occupational diseases are those related to construction, road and urban health activities. In 2017, the AIM Group signed a trade union agreement to protect workplace safety concerning adoption of the man on the ground system for isolated or solo workers. Personnel Costs The costs that AIM incurs for its employees mainly take into consideration:  both immediate (personnel remuneration and miscellaneous expenses) and deferred (severance indemnities) direct remuneration;  indirect remuneration (social security contributions borne by AIM Group companies);  remuneration for non-employee personnel. In the performance of their activities, in addition to employees, AIM Group companies make recourse to the professional services of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors (non-employee personnel), the former with management and the latter with control functions. These personnel costs, reclassified, were as follows in the three-year period 2015 – 2017(€/000): Personnel Costs 2017 2016 2015 Employees 34,216 36,819 45,999 Wages and salaries 23,048 24,891 31,373 Employee severance indemnities 1,525 1,795 2,245 Employee pensions and similar obligations 247 247 302 Miscellaneous services for employees 1,706 1,368 1,771 Other personnel costs 237 389 245 Total direct remuneration 26,765 28,690 35,936 Social security contributions 7,451 8,129 10,063 Total indirect remuneration 7,451 8,129 10,063 Non-employee personnel 474 472 547 Board of Directors fee 275 287 237 Board of Statutory Auditors fee 199 185 220 Total personnel costs 34,690 37,291 46,546 These costs are a significant indicator of the contribution of the AIM Group to employment in the local area (Vicenza and province) in which 88.92% of its employees reside.

Indirect energy consumption, i.e. the electricity that the Group purchases and consumes, refers to the Group's production sites and plants. The electricity used by the energy production plants is partly self-produced and the related values are included in the direct fuel consumption. All the Group's electricity was purchased by the investee AIM Energy and is entirely green energy, i.e. deriving from renewable sources. 2017 saw the following figures: 2017 Consumption from energy sources for production uses Biogas engines – Grumolo delle Abbadesse Purchase of electricity – kWh 5,255.00 Self-consumption of electricity – kWh 300,844.50 Cogeneration plant Cricoli Purchase of natural gas – Scm 6,471,406.00 Purchase of electricity – kWh 1,594,233.00 Lobia hydroelectric power plant Purchase of natural gas – Scm 11,765,375.00 2017 Consumption from energy sources not for production uses Public Lighting Purchase of electricity – kWh 8,268,876.00 Purchase of natural gas – Scm 148,109.97 Company sites Purchase of electricity – kWh 1,141,619.00 Electric car charging stations Purchase of electricity – kWh 6,055.00 Car park management (parking meters, cameras, Purchase of electricity – kWh 876,926.00 signs, etc.) Fuel consumption for the Group's vehicles Group vehicles Petrol Litres 80,334.58 Group vehicles Diesel Litres 769,056.41 Group vehicles Methane Litres 4,587.00 Waste production Correct management of the waste produced in the performance of its activities is a concrete example of the Group's attention to the protection of the local area. The production of waste derives in particular from operations, routine and extraordinary maintenance and production carried out in the various Group sites. The management of waste and its disposal takes place in compliance with current legislation. In all the Group's sites, sorted waste collection systems have been installed, aimed at increasing recycling. With regard to disposal methods, most of the waste produced is treated and recovered. In 2017, a total of 1,616,491 Kg* of waste was produced by the Group. *waste deriving from the activity in company sites, not constituting urban waste. Special waste collected separately from urban waste. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 87 Company vehicle fleet The company vehicle fleet is subject to particular attention by the Group, which is committed to reducing atmospheric emissions deriving from road traffic, through the systematic renewal of the most polluting vehicles. In 2017, the Group's vehicle fleet consisted of: Fuel used by company vehicles 2017 Petrol 157 Diesel 364 Petrol and Diesel 28 Methane 9 Electric 10 Total company vehicles 568 Vehicles using traditional fuels account for over 96% of the company fleet, but as from 2016, the Group is adopting a policy of disposing of the most polluting vehicles and purchasing vehicles powered by alternative fuels with a lower environmental impact. Biodiversity protection The AIM Group operates in an area rich in Biodiversity, also due to the fact that the services provided are many and varied in terms of type and location, and therefore all personnel undertake daily to safeguard the environment in which they operate, be it a protected or urbanised area, implementing control and monitoring actions. Before implementing new projects and maintenance activities of a certain importance, which could give rise to environmental impacts in particular areas, the Group submits the intervention to more specialised assessments for the safeguard of the area affected by the service. The Group's electricity generation activities, in particular for the Lobia local Power Plant, have an impact on water resources the Bacchiglione River from which water is taken and in which it is subsequently discharged, and all the activity is managed in compliance with the concession issued by the competent Authorities and with current legislation. In particular, the safeguard of the restocking of the fry is of interest to AIM; this is a regulatory requirement for operators of run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants, since the dam can be an obstacle to the reproduction of freshwater fish which run up and down the river. Therefore, the Veneto Region requires the signing of a contract with its agency Veneto Agricoltura for restocking the rivers with newborn fish ( fry ), produced on farms and then released upstream of the dam and in tributaries, according to a defined criterion. For the other waste production and management activities carried out by the Group, there is no environmental hazard since the areas of the sites are not of the protected type. The Grumolo delle Abbadesse landfill is managed in harmony with the vegetational climate of its location, also as regards the biogas plant. For the natural gas and electricity distribution service, there is no impact on biodiversity, other than the utmost attention to the materials and equipment used to manage the network to guarantee there is no environmental impact. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 88 The social commitment of the AIM Group The AIM Group has been serving the city and the Vicenza area for over 110 years. It has always been attentive to socio-economic and environmental changes, committed to the responsible management of natural resources, to the improvement of its results, to the use of increasingly efficient and low environmental impact technologies and to communication respectful of and attentive to the needs of the Vicenza community. In 2017, the External Relations and Communication Department produced over 80 press releases that generated over 120 television broadcasts and nearly 700 articles in the local and national press. The Department manages relations with the third sector associations that have always made Vicenza one of the cities and provinces most rich in volunteer opportunities. 2017 was characterised by an attentive promotion of initiatives that generated social integration, fairness and development sustainability. The AIM Group in fact contributed to the socio-cultural growth of people and the local community, ensuring opportunities for getting together, strengthening the identity of places and people, implementing proactive policies for the local area and increasing its visibility, competitiveness and attractiveness. 2017 saw the participation of the AIM Group in the 34 th Annual Meeting of ANCI, the association of Italian municipalities that met from 11 to 13 October at the Vicenza Trade Fair Area, with the theme “City dot zero. Imagine tomorrow, govern today”. For three days Vicenza was the capital of local government officials from all over Italy, who welcomed the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella and numerous other guests and members of the political, industrial and communication world. During the year, the AIM Group also sponsored numerous events of national importance for an amount exceeding 280,000 Euro, such as the Biblical Festival, the Municipal Theatre season and cultural and sport associations that carry out their valuable social activity in the Vicenza area. The impact on the Community of the AIM Group INITIATIVES (thousands of Euros) 2017 social support 1,495 educational for children 45 cultural 187 sport 18 environmental awareness 32 Total sponsorships provided 1,777 Social support VALORE CITTA’ AMCPS HELPING THOSE AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKE IN NORCIA Valore Città Amcps, with a convoy of 4 trucks, delivered 4 x 4.5 and 6 m long, 2.40 m deep and 2.75 m high containers to the Civil Protection Agency of Norcia. The structures were used as a warehouse and storage for the materials and equipment that were previously situated inside the municipal gym. In this way, the sports structure was freed and restored for the activities of the students and inhabitants of Norcia. ELECTRICITY AND GAS SOCIAL BONUS AIM Energy provided the Electricity and Gas social bonus introduced by AEEGSI (now ARERA) in collaboration with the Municipality of Vicenza to help families in financial difficulties and large families with the cost of gas and electricity. ASYLUM SEEKER PROJECT The AIM Group coordinated the activities and work of over 200 asylum seekers who were employed in sweeping the streets and green areas of the city and in the maintenance of public parks with the assistance of Valore Ambiente and Valore Città Amcps personnel. AIM-CARITAS AGREEMENT Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 89 The collaboration between the AIM Group and Caritas Vicenza continues: for the sixth time an agreement, in which AIM makes available to the association Diakonia Onlus (operating unit of the diocesan Caritas) 20 thousand Euros for individuals and families in momentary financial difficulties, was renewed. The agreement promotes a service that is aimed at people and families who cannot meet their economic and financial commitments with regard to basic necessities and services, such as electricity and gas, due to unemployment, job instability or reduction of their income. The purpose of the intervention is to renegotiate the debt with AIM companies, making the instalments sustainable, as part of a personalised tutoring, first of all with regard to awareness of one's spending capacity. The agreement is open to those with an electricity or gas contract with AIM Energy. Among the requirements of the agreement is also the fact that people in financial difficulty can benefit from the support and repayment plan in exchange for the commitment to reconsider their consumption styles and habits, thus increasing energy savings. AIM will prepare a handbook or identify training courses in order to make users more aware of the correct use of the services provided, so as to encourage the saving of energy resources. Activities with students SOCIAL DAY More than 160 students from the high schools of Vicenza were involved in voluntary activities during the annual Social Day event, designed to raise funds for solidarity and development cooperation projects. Helping them was also Valore Ambiente which provided the necessary material and support and coordinated a dozen or so asylum seekers in the cleaning of some of the green areas of the city. In particular, students from the Fogazzaro, Canova, Boscardin, Quadri, Rossi and Lioy high schools with the collaboration of the Insieme and Tangram social cooperatives and the Inter-School Committee of the Social Day consisting of about thirty students were involved. Valore Ambiente helped about fifteen students from the Fogazzaro High School and nine asylum seekers in cleaning the Fornaci park. SCHOOL-WORK ALTERNATION AT CANOVA Within the scope of the school project that promotes school-work alternation, Valore Ambiente collaborated with the Canova Institute for Surveyors in a project whose objective was the improvement of sorted waste collection and identification of the related communication campaign. The Company was in fact involved in the simulation of a start-up for the design and creation of containers for sorted waste collection made of cardboard and, as part of this simulation, the planning of a series of thematic meetings related to the implementation of this process. This project is expected to lead to the production of about 500 cardboard containers for the separate collection of paper and plastic that will be distributed in the school. LIOY PROJECT “Hands up for sorted waste collection!” is the slogan chosen by class 3 AS of the Lioy High School of Vicenza which set out to analyse and reorganise the collection of waste in its school, in collaboration with Valore Ambiente. The objective of the project, which took place from 15 May to 1 June, was to introduce a more rigorous system of sorted waste collection in the school, in order to reduce the ecological and economic impact due to the incorrect disposal of waste by students. VISITS TO THE MONTE CROCETTA TRANSFER PLANT As part of the “Hands up for sorted waste collection!” project, visits were made to the Valore Ambiente transfer plant in Monte Crocetta, in order to directly verify the evolution of the urban waste treatment system implemented at the plant, according to the development of sorted waste collection and of the forms of material recovery, also downstream of sorted waste collection itself. The visit then continued to the Grumolo delle Abbadesse landfill, managed by S.I.A., Società Intercomunale Ambiente: here the methods of construction of the plant, the safety devices and the related monitoring and control plan were illustrated. The students were accompanied inside the area and were able to observe how a landfill is organised on an industrial scale. ROSSI HIGH SCHOOL PROJECT The collaboration with the Rossi High School in the field of ecology and reuse of materials was again renewed in 2017: Valore Ambiente organised three workshops for the first and second classes, dedicated to repairing and re-using bicycles, to disassembling the components of a computer, with the relative separation of the various materials, and to the mapping and reorganisation of sorted waste collection in the school. During the workshops, the approx. 150 students involved were supported by two specialised operators who used manual work as a teaching tool for education in the reuse and recycling and exploitation of goods. These workshops are linked to the national awareness-building campaign on the reuse of objects and the dissemination of the 'Reusebox', an initiative promoted in Vicenza by Valore Ambiente, in collaboration with the Insieme cooperative. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 90 SCHOOLS AND MUNICIPAL THEATRE PROJECT In order to improve awareness in schools of environmental sustainability, Valore Ambiente took part in the project promoted by the Municipal Theatre of Vicenza aimed at promoting education in theatrical communication. The phases included a workshop conducted by specialised professionals assisted by the class teacher, aimed at producing a small theatrical event with the preparation of the show EMOTICON: The country of my emotions , which then went on stage at the Municipal Theatre. AIM ENERGY CAMP AIM Energy supported the summer camps called AIM Energy Camp for children and teenagers aged 6 to 13 years who took part in many interesting sports activities, including football, basketball, tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, rugby, athletics, fencing, hip-hop, baseball, handball, wrestling, tai-chi and ultimate frisbee. The initiative was also enhanced by the participation of the Piccoli punti association which carried out training on the prevention of skin diseases caused by the sun. Cultural initiatives There were numerous cultural initiatives in which the AIM Group, also with its companies, was among the partners and main supporters of the following initiatives: “Viva Verdi” summer concert: an evening dedicated to Classical Opera, organised by the City of Vicenza in Piazza dei Signori with the support of AIM Energy that provided its customers the opportunity to sit in the front row during the show; “Biblical Festival” which involved the dioceses of Vicenza, Padua, Verona, Rovigo, Vittorio Veneto and Trent. The event attracted thousands of people over 11 days in meetings, workshops, exhibitions and biblical dialogues on the theme Happy is he who has the way in his heart ; “Treviso Plays Jazz”, event held in the city centre of Treviso with concerts, meetings and workshops. AIM Energy was able to make available to the numerous customers of Treviso free tickets to participate in the festival; the theatrical season of the “Municipal Theatre of Vicenza” increasingly appreciated and rich in cultural initiatives and events for the citizens of Vicenza; the “Che impresa (What a company) exhibition: AIM took part in the original format that brought together eleven internationally renowned illustrators, with the aim of involving children in the narration of the products and services of the companies that have made and will make the Vicenza area great. The exhibition itinerary was designed for children : illustrations, content and guided tours were designed to be enjoyed by children, the real protagonists of the event; “la Rua (the Wheel)”: on 8 September, for the patron saint's day of Madonna di Monte Berico, Valore Città Amcps created the magnificent setting of the Rua, rebuilt by the Company of Viale sant'Agostino in 2007 based on on a drawing by Francesco Muttoni. La Rua is 21 metres high, weighs 20,000 kg plus 10,000 of ballast. The supporting structure is made of steel and weighs over 16 tons. La Rua is covered in wood and embellished with 14 life-size statues and other decorative elements, made of plastic, plaster or wood. It was created by 30 company employees; AIM supported the photo exhibition SOS decay, views of Vicenza and its surrounding area organised by Italia Nostra and dedicated to raising awareness and education of the new generations on protection of the landscape and the historic-artistic heritage of our area; the AIM Group was also sponsor of the successful exhibition “Van Gogh: between wheat and sky” which took place from October 2017 to April 2018 in Basilica Palladiana and which attracted thousands of tourists from all over Italy and foreign countries to the city. The AIM intervention facilitated the improvement of the service area of the Salone delle Zavatteri, ensuring visitors easier access to the exhibition. 2017 ROCK FESTIVALS Not only music and entertainment at rock festivals but also caring for the environment, thanks to attentive sorted waste collection that saved some organisers more than 60%. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 91 In fact, the initiative promoted this year as part of the 2017 Rock Festivals was very successful: Valore Ambiente, in line with its industrial strategy which envisages financial investments for the promotion of a culture and sensitivity attentive to recycling. bore the costs of sorted waste collection, asking the organisers to make a financial contribution only for the disposal of unsorted waste. Sports initiatives Also sport, as a moment of social aggregation and inclusion, was at the centre of attention of the AIM Group and in particular of AIM Energy, which in 2017 supported the AIM Amateur Sports Group and in particular the second edition of Ultra & Wild Trail a footrace in the hills of Malo and Monte di Malo that has attracted the participation of over 900 athletes. Also the second edition of AIM Energy Trail, therefore, was a great moment of celebration and friendship in the name of nature and passion for authentic sport, the hard version but always so full of satisfaction and real emotions. In 2017, AIM Energy and Cogaspiù Energie Srl supported other sports initiatives and events such as the Vicenza International Tennis Championships, the sports season of the Vicenza Women's Basketball Team, the Via dei Berici, the Vicenza Rugby Association and Sword Club, Ortona volleyball, Chieti Basketball and the Ortona Rally. Environmental awareness building M’ILLUMINO DI MENO (I'LL LIGHT UP LESS) Also this year the AIM Group took part in the initiative to raise awareness on energy savings promoted by Radio Due by switching off the lights in one of the city's most significant monuments for an hour. 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WEST RECYCLING CENTRE Great success, in the month of November, for the twentieth anniversary of the West Recycling Centre in Vicenza, in Via Delle Fornaci 5. From 11 am to 7 pm it was a continuous and joyful series of visits and entertainment for the celebrations entitled We have been thinking about today for 20 years , with workshops and stands on reuse and recycling for adults and children. The initiative, supported by Valore Ambiente and promoted by the Insieme Cooperative that manages the recycling centre, was part of the European Week for Waste Reduction. CHILDREN AND FAMILY Valore Ambiente took part in the fourth edition of Children and Family, the event, entirely dedicated to the world of children and the family, which, on Saturday 28 and Sunday 29 October, attracted over 20 thousand visitors, about 10 thousand more than last year, to the Vicenza Trade Fair Area. Three halls, 5 thousand square metres of area occupied by 160 exhibitors, a hundred or so areas reserved for workshops and games. At the entrance to the second hall, that dedicated to teaching and education, there was also a large and diversified stand animated by Valore Ambiente, in collaboration with the operators of the Ecotopia cooperative, experts in recreational and educational activities in schools. In the two days of attendance at the fair, several hundred children passed through the various points of interest of the stand while the adults were involved in providing information on the activities carried out by Valore Ambiente and the many methods for the collection and correct disposal of waste. INAUGURATION OF THE SAN PIO X RECYCLING CENTRE The new city recycling centre in San Pio X, the fourth, which will join the other three already operating in the city, was inaugurated. The identified site covers an area of approximately 530 square metres. The structure is equipped to collect 12 different types of recyclable and reusable materials such as paper and cardboard, wood, garden waste, bulky waste, clothing, mineral and food oils, batteries, fire extinguishers, packaging and various containers, thus providing citizens with a place to dispose of special waste. The site is managed by the Elica social cooperative of Longare. CONTAINERS FOR SORTED WASTE COLLECTION IN PARKS Valore Ambiente placed a special container in each of the eight protected parks of District 3 for the separate collection of paper, glass, plastic and wet waste. The initiative stems from a proposal presented by the District in the context of the Participatory Budget project promoted by the Municipality of Vicenza, in order to allow the many users who frequent the parks to separate their waste and to educate them in terms of responsibility and respect for the environment. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 92 FESTAMBIENTE Valore Ambiente and AIM Energy were the sponsors of Festambiente 2017, an event held in Campo Marzo from 28 June to 2 July. The theme was regeneration : i.e. obtain something new from what has so far been considered waste. Valore Ambiente took part with two gazebos, proposing to the numerous visitors workshops and activities on recycling and reuse of waste. NEW PICTOGRAMS FOR ROAD COLLECTION CONTAINERS Valore Ambiente replaced all the pictograms on over 2000 structures, such as bottle banks, bins and containers. With this intervention, Valore Ambiente intends to standardise and modernise the symbols of the stickers that indicate the material to be inserted, thus improving understanding and facilitating all operations related to sorted waste collection. The new pictograms, in fact, were designed and defined with the collaboration of a specialised communication agency, and are more stylised and even more clear, visible also from a distance or with poor lighting. Not only that, but in each sticker a code (QR code) has been inserted that, once focussed on with the smartphone, links to the page of the Valore Ambiente website that explains which materials can be inserted in that structure and which not. SECOND WASTE FORUM Valore Ambiente took part in the second edition of the Waste Forum, organised by Legambiente Veneto and open to 576 municipalities in the region. In the annual 2017 Best Recycling Municipalities Dossier, Vicenza was mentioned for its excellent activity, coming top of the ranking of the seven regional capital cities. Valore Ambiente launched an intense communication campaign on educating not to dump waste, to raise awareness and inform citizens on the convenient system for collecting and disposing of bulky waste with the campaign “MI RIFIUTO” (I REFUSE, a play on words with refuse also in the sense of waste). To raise awareness and improve sorted waste collection, on the website www.aimambiente.it, very popular is the service “Where should I throw it away?” in which the user, having entered his/her address, can obtain all the necessary information on where to dispose of the waste. Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 93 The Financial Dimension Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 94 The corporate social responsibility report, in its financial dimension, aims to illustrate the production and distribution of the financial effect of the company's activity to the benefit of all its financial and social stakeholders, using the result of the added value. The added value can therefore be analysed from two points of view:  that of the wealth produced by the AIM Group (production of added value);  that concerning its distribution among the stakeholders involved in the activities of the AIM Group (distribution of added value). In order to reach the results shown in the added value tables, AIM reclassified the income statement prepared as part of the financial statements. The reclassification of values followed the principles established by the Corporate Social Responsibility Report Study Group (GBS). Determination of Added Value DETERMINATION OF GLOBAL ADDED VALUE (€/000) 2017 A) Value of production 257,547 Revenue from sales and services 234,627 revenue adjustments 3,306 Changes in inventories of work in progress, semi-finished and finished 106 products (and merchandise) Change in contract work in progress Other revenue and income 4,154 Grants related to income 11,860 Revenue from typical production 247,228 Additions to internally produced non-current assets 10,319 B) Intermediate cost of production 177,933 Consumption of raw materials and/or consumables 84,674 Services 75,051 Leases and rentals 4,603 Provisions for liabilities 313 Other provisions 1,592 Other operating costs 11,701 Gross characteristic added value 79,614 C) Ancillary and non-recurring components 1,393 Ancillary revenue 1,788 Ancillary costs 167 Ancillary operations balance 1,621 Non-recurring revenue 995 Non-recurring costs 1,222 Non-recurring component balance 228 Gross global added value 81,008 Depreciation/amortisation of operations for homogeneous groups of goods 24,070 Net global added value 56,938 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2017 – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 95 Allocation and distribution of Added Value to Stakeholders The amount of Added Value distributed to Personnel is equal to 61% and consists of wages and salaries, for both employees and collaborators; 11% was distributed to the Public Administration through the payment of direct and indirect taxes; 10% to Lenders through financial expenses paid to credit institutions; 12% to the Shareholder in the form of dividends and reserves; for the Group's capitalisation, 3% was allocated and, finally, 3% was disbursed to the Local Community, mainly through contributions to social, cultural and sporting initiatives and to consumption and environmental education. 61% of the net global Added Value generated by the AIM Group in 2017 is distributed to personnel. Considering that 88.92% of AIM Group employees live in the municipality of Vicenza or in other municipalities in the province of Vicenza, a full 30,846 million in wages and salaries paid by the AIM Group contribute to the economic growth of the territory.
