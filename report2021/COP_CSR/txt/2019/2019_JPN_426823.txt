As existing initiatives, but about how to use new innovations in for myself, I consider SDGs as a “constitution” of all human establishing sustainable businesses. To discuss how Taisei What Does “SDGs” Mean? ● An acronym standing for “Sustainable Development Goals” ● Goals for sustainable development by 2030 adopted at the United Nations summit in September 2015 ● Contains 17 global goals and 169 targets ● All the United Nations member states are asked to make efforts; actively promoted in Japan. 29 T A I S E I ANNUA L R EPORT 2018 Corporation’s innovation should be in light of SDGs’ Team’s projects are roughly divided into three groups. The About the Taisei Group perspective, first I would like to know about the innovations first group is about a scheme of business matching in which that Managing Executive Officer Hombu thinks about. we research industry-ready technologies. The second is Hombu: When I was previously involved in the innovation about establishing an OI promotion structure and its support policy, an innovation didn’t mean an R&D achievement/ activities, such as appointing internal OI supporters, in order outcome but was defined as follows: such achievement/ to materialize ideas to solve mediumand long-term outcome is released on the market as a product, it is widely challenges. And the third group is about activities to create spread, and then it brings about the transformation of a place for conversing with various partners by organizing economic society. This idea that a technology doesn’t co-creation sessions in order to search for future challenges Value Creation Story of the Taisei Group become an innovation until it is widely spread is very and ideas for budding businesses/new business seeds. important to the present Taisei Corporation, in my opinion. There are possibilities for innovations created from new ideas we come up with in the course of setting future goals higher, such as SDGs, and repeating trial and error with a variety of partners to that end. As a place for the creation of such innovations or for fostering innovators, I believe open innovation activities as such are important. Kashiwakura: In the OI activities, we held co-creation sessions four times with IHI Corporation in 2017. We have had more than 100 participants in total from inside and Special Feature outside the Company; they are from different industries or entrepreneurs that we have never had a chance to get Also, in order to achieve CO2 emissions targets for involved with in our daily operations and have come Japan under the Paris Agreement, energy consumption by together in the hope of creating something with us. companies and households must be cut by about 23 million I realize that co-creation out of partnership with the kiloliters in terms of crude oil by 2030. This is hard to achieve most distant outside parties from us trigger the broadening unless some radical innovations come up in the construction of unexpected ideas and creation of innovations. industry. In this sense, I have hope for Taisei Corporation’s Business Section open innovation (OI) activities, which are built on cooperative relations with outside companies (see the column below). Promoting Open Innovation with Society Kawaguchi: How about innovations in the OI activities? Hasebe: To me innovation in the OI activities is value creation through an invention on the premise of its permeation/ diffusion, as Managing Executive Officer Hombu said. The OI ESG Section Taisei Corporation’s Open Innovation (TOI Lab.)

It is a method to make and grow a forest of “patient capital or a stance to wait and see if there is vegetation suitable for the project site over the three years, business growth” or “tolerance toward investing at a different site in advance, before replanting.

About the Technology Managing Executive Officer Hombu? Center’s projects, about how Taisei Corporation’s unique innovation should be led from SDGs’ perspective, I would like to know what is on your mind, Technology Center Chief Nagashima. Nagashima: To us at the Technology Center, innovation means technology development, naturally. For example, our urban ZEBs, “ZEB Demonstration Building” at the Technology Center and JS Hakata Watanabe Building (see pp. 32–34) are one of those projects with the theme of SDGs as a Gold Mine of Innovations bringing value creation that responds to their own SDGs. Hombu: “7. Affordable and Clean Energy,” “11. Sustainable Also, we need innovations in every process of the Cities and Communities,” and “13. Climate Action” are construction industry, from design to construction, and related to the fields where new values can be created and operation and maintenance. While the mass retirement of offered through the things Taisei Corporation produces. In aged skilled construction workers is becoming an issue for other words, we should realize socioeconomic activities that the construction industry, productivity improvement has require less energy, solutions to climate changes with become a pressing matter. Currently, we promote productivity reduced CO2 emissions, and more disaster-resistant cities improvement and work style reforms under the “TAISEI through structures and buildings. To provide these new i-Innovation®” (see p.35), including mechanization and values could be the most important thing we can do. automation at production sites and streamlining with BIM/CIM.

Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Taisei Corporation (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the About the Taisei Group “Group”) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reformatted and translated into English (with some expanded descriptions) from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information, included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translations of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2018, which was ¥ 106.24 to U.S. $ 1. The translations should not be construed as representations of what the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be when converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. Value Creation Story of the Taisei Group 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Consolidation and equity method The Company prepares the consolidated financial statements including the accounts of the Company and those of its majority-owned subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly controlled. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 31 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2018 (29 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2017). PT. TAISEI PULAUINTAN CONSTRUCTION INTERNATIONAL and other 1 company are included in the scope of consolidation because the companies were newly established. Exclusion of certain small-scale subsidiaries from the scope of consolidation does not have material impact on the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized gains or losses have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of non-consolidated subsidiaries, and investments in affiliated companies in which the Group does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements in 20 subsidiaries, mainly consist of TOKYO ACADEMIC SERVICE Co., Ltd. and EHIME HOSPITAL PERTNERS Co., Ltd. are accounted for by the equity method for the year ended March 31, 2018. 1 non-consolidated subsidiary newly established is included in the scope of equity method. Investments in 40 affiliated companies are also accounted for by the equity method for the year ended March 31, 2018 (41 affiliated Special Feature companies for the year ended March 31, 2017). 1 affiliated company that was newly established is included in the scope of equity method. 2 affiliated companies are excluded from the scope of equity method because the Group sold its shares. Exclusion of certain small-scale non-consolidated subsidiaries (TAIMEI INDUSTRIES Ltd. and the other) and the affiliated company (NIGIYAKASHI RESIREIT BRIDGE TWO, LLC.) from the scope of equity method does not have material effect on the consolidated financial statements. All consolidated subsidiaries other than 10 consolidated overseas subsidiaries have the same balance sheet date, March 31, corresponding with that of the Company. As for the 10 consolidated overseas subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends at December 31, their financial statements as of December 31 are used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Significant transactions, if any, in the period from January 1 to March 31 have been adjusted in the consolidated financial statements. (b) Valuation of Assets and Liabilities of Subsidiaries In the elimination of the investments in subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries including the portion allocated to nonBusiness Section controlling interests are recorded based on their fair value at the time the Company acquired control of the respective subsidiaries. (c) Goodwill Significant excesses of investment cost over net equity of consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method are recognized as goodwill (negative goodwill, if credit balance), and amortized principally over the estimated useful lives or less than twenty years on a straight-line basis. However, immaterial goodwill is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Negative goodwill is credited to income upon occurrence. (d) Foreign Currency Translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at year-end exchange rates. The resulting exchange gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of income. All revenues and expenses associated with foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing when such transactions are made. The financial statements of consolidated foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies under the equity method are translated into ESG Section Japanese yen at exchange rates prevailing at the respective year-end dates except for shareholders’ equity accounts, which are translated at historical rates. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are presented in accumulated other comprehensive income in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheets. (e) Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows In preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash on hand, readily available deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months at the date of purchase and with insignificant risks of change in value are considered to be cash and cash equivalents. (f) Securities Securities held by the Group are classified into (a) debt securities intended to be held to maturity (hereafter “held-to-maturity debt securities”), (b) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and (c) all other securities that are not classified in any of the categories above (hereafter “available-for-sale securities”). Data Section Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost. Equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at moving-average cost. Available-for-sale securities with available fair market values are stated at fair market value. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of applicable income taxes are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the net assets section. Realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are computed using moving-average cost. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at movingaverage cost. TA I SE I A N N UA L R E P O R T 2 0 1 8 68 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) TAISEI CORPORATION and Consolidated Subsidiaries Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 (g) Revenue Recognition of Construction Revenue associated with construction contracts of which the outcome can be reliably estimated is accounted for by the percentage-ofcompletion method; otherwise contract revenue is accounted for by the completed-contract method. The percentage of completion at the end of the reporting period is determined by the percentage of the cost incurred to the estimated total costs. (h) Inventories The Company and its certain subsidiaries develop real estate projects on their own account. Cost on development projects in progress are mainly stated at the lower of cost based on the specific-identification cost method or net realizable value. For this purpose, the cost includes the purchase cost of land, incidental costs, direct development costs and (in relation to certain developments by one of the subsidiaries) interest expenses. Cost on uncompleted contracts is mainly stated at cost based on the specific-identification cost method. (i) Property, plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment except for buildings and structures are recorded at cost and depreciated principally by the declining-balance method over the standard useful lives prescribed in the Corporation Tax Law. Buildings and structures are principally depreciated by the straight-line method. (j) Accounting for Lease Transactions Finance leases, except for certain immaterial or short-term finance leases in which ownership is not transferred to lessee, are capitalized. Capitalized leased assets whose ownership is transferred to lessee are depreciated by the same method of depreciation applied to property, plant and equipment. Capitalized leased assets whose ownership is not transferred to lessee are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method over a useful life period corresponding to the lease contract period. (k) Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments until related losses or gains on hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedge and meet certain hedging criteria, net amounts to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contracts are added to or deducted from the interest on liabilities for which the swap contract were executed. (l) Income Taxes The Company and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries apply the system of consolidated tax returns. (m) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided to reserve for probable losses from bad debt. It consists of the estimated uncollectible amount of certain identified doubtful receivables and the amount estimated on the basis of the past default ratio for normal receivables. (n) Allowance for Warranty on Completed Contracts Allowance for warranty on completed contracts is provided as the amount estimated using an actual ratio of related losses during the past certain periods. (o) Allowance for Losses on Construction Contracts Allowance for losses on construction contracts is provided with respect to construction projects for which eventual losses are reasonably estimated. (p) Allowance for Losses on Order Received Allowance for losses on order received is provided with respect to orders (excluding construction contracts) for which eventual losses are reasonably estimated. (q) Retirement Benefits for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Retirement benefits for directors and audit & supervisory board members of certain consolidated subsidiaries have been set up in accordance with each company’s regulations. (r) Allowance for Losses on Investments in Subsidiaries and Affiliates Allowance for losses on investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is provided for estimated losses from certain subsidiaries and affiliates in liquidation. (s) Allowance for Environmental Spending Allowance for environmental spending is provided based on estimated costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (“PCB”) waste, which is obligated to dispose by the Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (t) Allowance for Losses on Anti-Monopoly Act Allowance for losses on Anti-Monopoly Act is provided based on estimated payment for penalties under the Anti-Monopoly Act. (u) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefit Net defined benefit liability is provided for severance and retirement benefits for employees and executive officers of the Company’s certain consolidated subsidiaries based on estimated amounts of projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the year-end. In calculating projected benefit obligations, the method of attributing estimated amounts of retirement benefits to the period until this fiscal year is based on the benefit formula basis. Past service costs are amortized using the straight-line method (some consolidated subsidiaries use the declining-balance method) over 1-10 years, which is not longer than an average remaining service period of the employees when the costs are incurred. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from the subsequent fiscal year (some consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses from the current fiscal year) using the straight line method (some consolidated subsidiaries use the declining balance method) over 1-10 years, which is not longer than an estimated average remaining service period of the employees when the gains or losses are incurred. 69 T A I S E I ANNUA L R EPORT 2018 (v) Net Income and Cash Dividends per Share Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares About the Taisei Group outstanding during the year. Cash dividends per share shown for each year represent dividends declared as applicable to the respective years. (w) Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings. (x) Accounting standard issued but not yet effective The following standard and guidance were issued but are not yet effective “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29, March 30, 2018) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30, March 30, 2018) (1) Overview The IASB and the FASB jointly developed and issued a converged Standard on the recognition of ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ Value Creation Story of the Taisei Group (IFRS 15 for IASB and Topic 606 for FASB.) in May, 2014. IFRS 15 will be applied from the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be applied from the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Under these circumstances, the ASBJ developed the converged standard for revenue recognition and issued the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” along with “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition”. In developing the ‘Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,’ the principal policy of the ASBJ is to incorporate the basic concept of IFRS 15 from the perspective of comparability between financial statements, as one way to establish consistency with IFRS 15. The ASBJ will add alternative treatments in the case that there are different accounting treatments prevalent in accounting practices in Japan that require consideration, to the extent that they do not impair comparability. (2) Effective date Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. (3) Effects of the application of the standards The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries are currently in the process of determining the effects of these new standards on the consolidated financial statements. 3.

Financial Instruments (1) Policies for using financial instruments Business Section The Group restricts investments to the low risk assets such as deposits, and raise funds by the indirect finance such as loans from bank as well as by the direct finance such as issuing corporate bonds or commercial papers. Derivative financial instruments are employed mainly for hedging fluctuation in interest rate and foreign currency exchange, and not used to speculate. Receivables: trade notes and trade accounts are exposed to the credit risks of customers. In order to reduce such risks, the Group conducts strict credit examinations when orders are received, and afterward manage the receivables individually and make effort to detect reduction of credit risks early. For investment securities which are mainly held-to-maturity debt securities and shares held to keep the relationship with business partners, the Group regularly monitors the fair values or financial positions of the invested companies, and revises the portfolio timely (except for held-to-maturity debt securities) considering the relationship with them. Debts, trade payables: trade notes and trade accounts are debts mostly due within one year. Loans, commercial papers and bonds are primarily for working capital, and have maturity dates of five years or less. Although the loans or bonds issued at variable rates are exposed ESG Section to interest rate fluctuation risk, the risk is hedged by derivative transactions (interest rate swap contracts). The Group primarily utilizes derivative transactions related to interest rates in order to mitigate the fluctuation risk in interest rates or to reduce financing costs, and derivative transactions related to currency in order to mitigate the foreign exchange risk. These transactions are exposed to the fluctuation risk in interest rates and the foreign exchange risk. However, the Group is exposed to limited risk, because most of them are hedged by the corresponding transactions. They consider the credit risk to be low, because they conduct derivative transactions solely with reliable international financial institutions. The Group executes and manages derivative transactions in accordance with internal rules. Their Finance Departments are responsible for conducting, evaluating transactions and managing related risks.

See the notes on “5. Securities” for notes pertaining to securities categorized by the purposes for which they are held. LIABILITIES Value Creation Story of the Taisei Group ∙ Notes and accounts payable, trade, Short-term loans and Long term loans due within one year and Deposits received The fair values of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value, due to the short term settlements; although, the fair value of long-term loans due within one year is based on the same method as that for long-term loans. ∙ Long-term loans The fair value of long-term loans is based on the present value of discounted cash flows by the interest rate which may be applicable when the same kind of loans is conducted. ∙ Bonds The fair value of marketable bonds is based on the quoted market value, otherwise the fair value of nonmarketable bonds is based on the present value of discounted cash flows by the interest rate reflecting the estimated redemption terms and issuer’s credit risk. [Derivative financial instruments] See the notes on “14. Derivative Transactions”.

( ii ) Long-term expected rate of return Current and target asset allocations, historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets have been considered in determining the long-term expected rate of return. (8) Actuarial assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions as of March 31, 2017 and 2018 were as follows: 2017 2018 Discount rate The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries 0.5∼1.5 0.4∼1.5 Consolidated overseas subsidiaries 5.7∼8.5 6.3 Long-term expected rate of return 0.8∼3.5 1.0∼3.0 3. Defined-contribution pension plans Amount payable for defined-contribution pension plans of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries were ¥ 2,436 million and ¥ 2,490 million ($ 23,438 thousand), for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Special Feature 12. Net assets Net assets comprise three subsections; which are shareholders’ equity, accumulated other comprehensive income and non-controlling interests. Under Japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, designate an amount not exceeding one-half of the price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law (“the Law”), when a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying Business Section consolidated balance sheets. Under the Law, appropriations of legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital generally require a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Law, however, all additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Law. The number of treasury stock owned by the Company, consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies adopting the equity method as of March 31, 2017 and 2018 were 1,408 thousand shares and 290 thousand shares, respectively. The consolidation of shares at the ratio of 1 share for 5 shares was implemented on October 1, 2017. Total annual dividends per share as of March 31, 2018 is ¥ 85.00 (U.S. $ 0.8),which is the sum of the interim dividend per share of ¥ 10.00 (U.S. $ 0.1) and the year-end dividend per share of ¥ 75.00 (U.S. $ 0.7). Due to the consolidation of shares at the ratio of 1 share ESG Section for 5 shares implemented on October 1, 2017, the year-end dividend per share of ¥ 75.00 reflects this consolidation, while the interim dividend per share of ¥ 10.00 does not. If the interim dividend per share is calculated based on the consolidation of shares, it would be ¥ 50.00 (U.S. $ 0.5), making the total annual dividends per share ¥ 125.00 (U.S. $ 1.2).

Segment Information (1) Segment Information (a) General information on reportable segments Each reportable segment of the Group is a business unit in the Group, whose discrete financial information is available. Reportable segments are reviewed periodically at the Board of Directors Meeting in order to determine distribution of management resources and evaluate business result of each reportable segment.

Moving detailed data to the website is effective; however, Kanji Tanimoto Value Creation Story of the Taisei Group with respect to the composition of the report, I believe there are Professor, points that are easy to understand and points that should be Ph.D. in Business Administration School of Commerce, improved. I would also like to point out some areas that seem to Faculty of Commerce, be issues with regard to compliance-related disclosure. Waseda University Issues time, the Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors discussed in detail the Taisei Group’s compliance system (in Firstly, the connections linking the corporate philosophy, policies, particular, prohibiting interaction with other companies in the and top message to specific management initiatives, and the industry, in-house leniency, etc.), and stricter rules are being connections between the Medium-term Business Plan targets and considered as future measures to address bid-rigging suspicions. the value creation process based on ESG, are explained more I believe it would have been better to disclose that process and its clearly than they were in the past. In addition, dialogues and contents. Finally, regardless of what the prosecutor decides in the Special Feature interviews occupy many pages of the current report in an effort to end, I hope that the circumstances surrounding these events will convey the Company’s message and value creation story. be disclosed in the next fiscal year’s report. However, the purpose of an integrated report is to disclose what kind of management was carried out during the year and what kind of economic and social outcome was gained as a result, and Going Forward I believe it would have been better to devote a few more pages to show in detail the results of specific initiatives (“ESG” section, In general, it is difficult for individual employees to think about CSR “Data” section). management when engaging in their daily activities unless In addition, compliance-related disclosure should have been organizational initiatives and check functions are clearly working. Business Section emphasized a little more in this report. The misconduct at TAISEI Furthermore, CSR is an area that is evolving year by year, and new ROTEC was mentioned only in a small box article in the previous standards and terminologies are appearing. While the Company fiscal year’s report, and the current fiscal year’s report also strives to reflect these new developments and to demonstrate its confined itself to simply describing future efforts. A suspension of understanding of them in the report, they may not be properly business due to violation of the Anti-Monopoly Act is serious, and assimilated unless they fit with the actual conditions in the calls for more than just an apology. The Group’s report should lay organization. Specific efforts related to CSR, how the message out why such a problem occurred, the circumstances that led up and story presented in this report are connected to daily business to it, and what measures will be taken in future as a result. activities, are found in individual business activities. Furthermore, the suspicions related to bid-rigging in With regard to CSR procurement activities for example, Taisei ESG Section connection with the Linear Chuo Shinkansen Project, which Corporation continues to carry out steady efforts aimed at Souyubecame a major problem in the previous fiscal year, are also kai member companies. In addition to conducting surveys of referred to only in a box article. The Company has not disclosed suppliers, I have heard that CSR officers visit worksites and that any official information other than issuing a short press release individual branch managers strive to communicate CSR in their stating “This is utterly unacceptable” after the Company’s own words. The accumulation of work such as this is vital. counsellor was arrested and indicted. Although the Company may In conclusion, with regard to CSR initiatives, the Taisei Group have been unable to comment in detail because the matter was set out its philosophy and Action Guidelines in the report, and it under investigation in the period from April to June when this must continue efforts to promote the collection and integration of Data Section report was being written, it is questionable whether it was right to non-financial data for all Group companies going forward. As a make no disclosure at all. On the other hand, the President’s New foundation of such initiatives, the Group is called upon to continue Year’s Reflection to employees and the President’s Message in to thoroughly improve understanding and implement initiatives this report talk about efforts to thoroughly implement compliance with regard to CSR in each business division, at the branch office in order to avoid raising this kind of doubt. Moreover, at the same and business office level, as well as in Group companies.
