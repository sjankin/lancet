A global law firm’s perspective on responsible business Freshfields’ UN Global Compact 2018 report As a global law firm, we believe we have a shared responsibility to support a sustainable future for all. We can contribute in a number of ways – we can improve the way we do things ourselves, by promoting integrity and ethics, and by being a diverse employer that manages its environmental footprint. We can have a positive impact in society by encouraging community investment and doing pro bono work. But we are also the oil that keeps the world’s economies going: the rule of law, clear ownership of assets, supporting our clients’ transition to a sustainable future thus enabling business to be successful are all part of the ways in which we can contribute to the sustainability of the world.

Activities such as mentoring, hosting work placements and sharing knowledge in areas of professional expertise enable us to offer opportunities to our target groups and complement the financial contributions we make to our community partners’ work or through matched giving. But the benefits of such programmes don’t just go one way. For businesses looking to address their challenges around diversity, inclusion and talent retention, the community investment programme is a good place to start. Responsible businesses typically have more engaged staff who feel greater pride and trust in their employer. Further, input from younger generations has also accelerated the impact of community investment, as they are likely to make a stronger connection between their employment and their personal values, participate readily, and can articulate responsible practices inside and out. Spending a day with Big Issue sellers was an insightful and humbling experience. It allowed me to gain a personal insight into Community investment activities offer volunteers the struggles faced by vendors every day and to break down the personal and professional development opportunities barriers and misconceptions that surround them. outside of traditional training programmes.

In Germany, we recently joined forces with Deutsche Bank to launch an online mentoring programme with our existing partner Volunteer Vision. Together, we are offering 1:1 online language training to 100 employees across Germany with a refugee background, who are working in small and medium-sized companies that have little or no resources to provide such job-tailored language training. This joint project is a result of our previous, ongoing global engagement with Volunteer Vision where so far 50 Freshfields employees from over 10 different countries have supported refugees as online mentors.

In the UK, one in four people is affected every year. The human and financial impact of mental health is vast, yet until recently it has been a taboo subject – surrounded by stigma and a lack of knowledge, understanding and service provision. It has been, and remains, a serious potential cause of discrimination in the workplace. Only in the last decade have societies, governments and organisations opened up the conversation. So what role can organisations play in dealing with but this is just a start.

United Nations Global Compact principles 1 4 5 6 8 9 14 RESPONSIBLE A POSITIVE IMPACT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS WORKING ON SOCIETY AND CLIENTS What does ‘access to justice’ really mean? The rule of law – with ‘access to justice‘ one of its key components – is essential for business to thrive. Naturally it underpins our work as a law firm, and is also a necessary foundation of many of the UNGC principles.

Social mobility is a national conversation in the UK. For some groups, their background and lack of connections mean that the odds are heavily stacked against them. Despite their talents, they are held back from achieving and contributing to society as they should. At the same time, businesses are faced with similar challenges. How do they ensure their sector more closely matches national demographics? How do they become more representative of those they serve? How do they achieve the equality in employment and economic inclusion that are at the heart of many international goals? This issue has been particularly noticeable in the law. And where there are few role models for those outside the profession’s traditional educational, social and ethnic groups, individuals can quickly dismiss a legal career as something that is ‘not for me’. We have been considering these difficult questions for many years. How do you solve a problem like social mobility? How can business make a real impact? And what will make a difference in the most challenged groups, for instance where social mobility and ethnicity intersect? Our experience has shown that the easy solutions will not move the dial, and that deeper thought is required to break the problems down and find a more effective approach. This article continues on the next page 18 RESPONSIBLE A POSITIVE IMPACT RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS WORKING ON SOCIETY AND CLIENTS How do you solve a problem like social mobility? For example, we remain convinced that giving money via traditional scholarships doesn’t on its own improve social mobility. Our results show that individuals must be at the core of any efforts to challenge the status quo. We have achieved greater impact from co-creating programmes with participants – problems such as these demand bespoke conversations and high-quality, tailored content. Target groups should determine the timing of meetings and work experiences on offer within the context of the financial and other pressures they face. Mentoring may be as much about coaching individuals through significant life issues as it is about career development, but pastoral conversations only happen where there is trust.
