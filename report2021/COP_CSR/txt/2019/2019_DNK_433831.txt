On the positive side, 2018 marked the year in which we made our first sale of United States Marine Inc.’s (USMI) 11mtr Naval Special Warfare (NSW) Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIB) to the Danish Defence. This is a big milestone for us, and we hope to be able to sell more units to customers in Europe in the years to come. Our business model is and always will be that of a facilitator and broker – bridging the gap between reputable manufacturers and customers. By being able and skilled to work in remote and hostile locations, we add value to both our business partners and customers. We go anywhere and see opportunities in the difficult. Supporting international organisations and national governmental bodies worldwide with products and services from cradle to grave remains our core business focus.
