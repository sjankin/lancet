The history of Mekoprint began, when Erland Kold bought a share of Aalborg Klichéand Metal sign factory. The metal sign factory became Mekoprint, who produced etched metal signs and self adhesive transfers for marking of motors, pumps and agricultural machines. In 1973, Esben Kold took over the management, and with a background as a chemical engineer and a graduate in business administration, the company developed into a high-tech, growth oriented company with a wide range of technologies, competences and product solutions. After more than 40 years, Esben Kold passed on the baton to his son Anders Kold, who since March 1st 2015 has been in charge of the company as the third generation in the company. > GROUP FACTS Mekoprint is a 100% order producing high-tech company with a focus on innovative, partner based relations with customers and suppliers. The customer specific solutions, created together with the customers, are based on a close cooperation, a common goal, and the ideal combination and exploitation of our own and customers’ strengths. Mekoprint primarily work with customers who have special requirements for customer specific products and total solutions within user interfaces, high volume flexible foils, EMC shields, cable harnessing, metal signs and manufactured metal parts. Mekoprint offers more than 30 manufacturing technologies, have more than 20.000 customer specific part numbers and supply to all major industries from industrial automation to medico. Mekoprint is headquartered in Støvring and has around 550 employees within 40.000 m2 production areas with majority of the manufacturing in Denmark. Aside from three factories in Støvringg, Mekoprint has one factory in Aalborg and two factories in Poland in Szczecin and Warsaw. In 2012 Mekoprint further established an office in Hong Kong in order to engage with the increased activity in Asia with regional partner production, logistics, sales and customer service. The engagement with Asia, however, goes all the way back to the early 1990’s when Mekoprint signed the first partnership agreement with an Asian supplier. Since then the focus has been on producing high quality, at a competitive price. Organizationally, Mekoprint is divided into four divisions each with their own specialized product focus: Graphic Electronics, Chemigraphics, Mechanics and Cables. 4 Mekoprint Graphic Electronics develops and produces industrial user interface solutions, foil based high volume products, printed electronics like flexible touch and LED foils, industrial graphical design, production of labels, front foils and transfers based on highly automated digital and silk screen printing. The manufacturing is mainly in Støvring, Denmark, but also with production partners in Asia. Mekoprint Chemigraphics Chemigraphics develops and produces micro precision metal parts, EMC shields and metal signs to everything from pumps to microphones and hearing aids. The manufacturing is primarily in Støvring, Denmark with etched metal parts in low to medium volume and punched parts in high volume. Additionally Chemigraphics has a highly automated setup in multi axis micro machining of micro precision parts. Mekoprint Mechanics develops and produces cabinets, chassis components, front panels and heatsinks through a range of in-house technologies. These technologies include fiber laser cutting, milling, punching, bending, progressive deep drawing, anodizing, powder coating and graphical printing. The manufacturing takes place at two sites in Denmark and one in Poland. Mekoprint Mekoprint Cables develops and produces cable solutions for industrial use from single wire to complex cable harnesses for use in larger appliances within several industries eg. Industrial automation, pumps and machines. The manufacturing takes place in Poland with around 200 employees while sales activities are centered in Denmark. 5 > OUR VALUES Every day Mekoprint strives to create a more sustainable production together with select customers by creating the best solutions that maximize value with a minimum of resources and environmental impact. We can only do that by abiding by sustainable values: We are… …tirelessly curious and ambitious in finding better ways to engineer, produce and deliver, by constantly having focus on optimizing resources throughout the entire value chain. …actionable actionable in everything we do, not least our social responsibility. This is why we measure specific indicators that ensure that we focus on the right pointers, so we constantly advance in a sustainable direction. responsible by showing a high level of respect and attention towards our …responsible customers, colleagues, suppliers, the environment and society. 6 > MEKOPRINT CSR TIMELINE > SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY Addresses UN Global Compact principles 1-6 & 10 7 > CREATING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE TOGETHER Mekoprint has a proud history of conducting its business to the highest ethical degree, but it was not until recently, that we started to describe and put our achievements on paper. Our work with Corporate Social Responsibility reporting is thus more of a description of the work already being done as well as a tool to keep our eyes on the ball in terms of sustainable development more than a sudden marketing idea. We believe that it’s not only possible to be highly ambitious in terms of sustainability while operating a successful business – it’s a prerequisite. Following a brief followup on our 2018 targets, we will delve into our work with social responsibility as well as our environmental and climate impact. 8 > INCREASED HR EFFORT AND EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION This year we made a serious commitment to our HR effort through hiring of an HR Development Director on January 1st 2018. An important new HR project – Mekoprint Academy – with focus on management development in the initial phase. The purpose is to enhance our management and its competences in leading teamwork to ensure employee satisfaction and focus. In the coming year the management development will be evaluated in cooperation with an external management advisor, after which the focus will be on employee development. The overall purpose of Mekoprint Academy is to co-create continuous improvement, clarify our LEAN culture and create a culture of improvement in our daily life where all employees are conscious of Mekoprint’s mission and strategy. > HEALTHY EMPLOYEES Our ambition to become one of the best workplaces in Denmark also entails being one of the healthiest workplaces. In 2018 there has been numerous inspirational presentations with focus both on mental and physical health with Stress Coach Pia Callesen among others. In order to boost the physical fitness, all employees are offered an annual health check-up, which will be a recurring non-compulsory event. Employees are encouraged to make daily small exercises and stretches with specific instructions on how to perform these. > INCREASING TRUST At Mekoprint we have an ambitious goal of having a Trust Index of 96% and being in the top 10 of Denmark’s best workplaces for mid-sized companies by 2020. Mekoprint has participated in the Great Place to Work initiative since 2015 and has been certified as a “Great Place to Work” every year. 97% of Mekoprint employees expressed that “all in all I consider Mekoprint to a really great place to work”. We can only humbly be proud of this achievement. In our latest employee satisfaction survey from the fall of 2018, our Trust Index has increased from 89% to 90% and we’ve moved 9 spots up the list from 2017, and now rank as an notable 14th place. We are well on our way towards our goal of getting a top 10 position in 2020. See appendix 2 for our target focus areas of this year’s Great Place to Work analysis. Our customers also gain trust in our ability to give them competent development advice in terms of material selection and product integration in the customer’s production line. This is also verified by an increase in the Net Promoter Score from 29 in 2017 to 35 in 2018. 9 > WORK ENVIRONMENT When we say we work towards a sustainable future, we especially focus on our environmental and climate impact. Relative to our revenue growth of 17%, we have increased our use of resources marginally compared to the previoius year. This primarily due to increased activities on water-using manufacturing machines. This is a two-edged dilemma in the case of our rollto-roll etching machine which uses a lot of water, but produces sustainable LED panels. We are continuously changing to low-energy solutions where possible, and are measuring our power consumption in special areas and for specific machines in order to monitor and act as needed. See appendix 3 for energy consumption and climate impact for each division. Mekoprint has had shortand long term environmental impacts on the agenda, particularly since being certified in the internationally renowned environmental management system ISO 14001 in 1999. In October 2018, Mekoprint A/S was converted to DS/ISO 45001:2018 (OHSAS 18001:2008), and Mekoprint Mechanics in Hornslet was simulatenously certified according to DS/ISO 14001:2015 and DS/ISO 45001:2018 (OHSAS 18001:2008). Our ambition to be CO2 neutral in 2020 must not solely be redeemed through buying carbon offsets. That is why we have partnered up with EnergyTeam (EnergiTeam) in order to prioritize the most important target areas to become CO2 neutral. In the long term our ambition is that our energy consumption is covered by a combination of wind and solar power. This process is currently in progress, and we are looking in to possibilities of establishing a solar park. 10 > SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY We are commited to engange and support our local communities and have a specifici focus on young people with welfare problems. Mekoprint continues to support Land of Wishes (Ønskeland) with around EUR 3.000, which gives troubled kids a chance to get a break from their daily life. Aside from this we annually support the Christmas Seal Foundation and have in 2018 supported Team Rynkeby’s fundraising bicycling trip which is donated directly to Childrens Cancerand Childrens Lung Foundation. We also continue to nudge our customers to help us help others by donating EUR 10 to Unicef for each answered customer satisfaction survey conducted annually. This resulted in a donation of around EUR 3.000 in 2018. In the coming years we will continue to expand our cooperation with the University of Aalborg (AAU) and University College Nordjylland (UCN) with educational collaboration, so we will have even more apprentices and interns throughout the divisions. In the coming year we will work towards a formalization of our cooperation with AAU, UCN and Tech College Aalborg. > PUSHING SUPPLIERS We have a 2020 goal of having all supplier products classified in terms of sustainability. This contains both criteria for sustainable raw material and work processes. We have little by little started this process, but we will make a serious push in this direction in the coming years. In relation to Conflict Minerals (3TG), the CFSI Conflict Minerals declaration was updated from rev CMRT5.01 to CMRT5.10. Simultaneously we have collected new declarations from suppliers of surface treatment of gold and tin. > SUSTAINABLE GROWING BUSINESS Since 2015, Mekoprint has worked with an ambitious growth strategy to double our revenue and profit in 5 years through an annual growth of 15%. This year we met this ambitious target and revenues increased by 17% to EUR 62 mill. and earnings are up 35% to EUR 27 mill. Our 2020 goal of ensuring profits for long term investments in sustainability and resilience to cyclical fluctuations are thus within reach. As an order producing manufacturing company, our customers determine our future, so it is of utmost importance that our customers value our flexible service, our high quality products and development advice regarding product optimization to minimize total costs and minimize environmental impact. This is why we’re proud of our latest result in our annual customer satisfaction survey which counts a Net Promoter Score of 35, up from 29 last year. We are well on the way towards our goal of having 50 percent net promoters in 2020. 11 > APPENDICES > APPENDIX 1 – UN GLOBAL COMPACT AND MEKOPRINT How we work with the principle SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY CERTIFICATION: OHSAS 18001 Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the With our code of conduct and audits, we ensure that protection of internationally proclaimed our suppliers live up to internationally proclaimed human rights; and human rights.
