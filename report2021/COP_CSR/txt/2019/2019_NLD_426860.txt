In the context of an investment portfolio, a carbon footprint measures the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and intensity associated with the underlying portfolio holdings. The footprint is measured in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). Scope of our carbon footprint disclosure The carbon footprint of NN Group’s proprietary fixed income and listed equity holdings was measured as per 31 December 2018, and is based on the latest carbon dioxide emissions data for governments and companies available to us. In 2018, the assessed AuM was EUR 108 billion. This represents 58% of NN Group’s total proprietary investment portfolio. The main asset categories that were not in scope of this carbon footprint analysis included mortgages, real estate, private equity, and cash. The fixed income holdings that we assessed included government bonds and corporate fixed income securities. The Corporate Fixed Income portfolio comprised mainly corporate bonds, but also asset-backed securities and loans (although the data availability on these two asset categories was limited). The analysis is based on emissions data provided by ISS-Ethix Climate Solutions, a leading global provider of investment climate data. The coverage, or the percentage of (assessed) portfolio assets for which (actual or estimated) emissions data was available, is 86%. The methodology for the footprint measurement of Government bonds was changed compared to last year(s) reflecting an alignment to the methodology recommended by the Platform Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). We now allocate emissions to a sovereign bond by taking into account the emissions that are directly caused by the government’s own activity, as well as the emissions from government financing in other sectors within a country.

NN Group N.V. 74 2018 Annual Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 Facts and figures Assurance report of independent auditors Assurance report of the independent auditor To: the Stakeholders and the Supervisory Board of NN Group N.V. Our conclusion We have reviewed the Non-Financial Information in the Annual Review 2018 (hereafter: the Non-Financial Information) of NN Group N.V. (hereafter: NN Group) based in Amsterdam and headquartered in The Hague. A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Based on our procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information relating to material non-financial topics (for selection of topics, see page 13) is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as described in ‘Our approach to reporting’ (page 67). The Non-Financial Information comprises a representation of the policy of NN Group with regard to corporate responsibility, and the thereto related business operations, events and achievements during the year. Basis for our opinion We have performed our review on the Non-Financial Information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N: ‘Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen’ (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports). We are independent of NN Group N.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Reporting criteria The Non-Financial Information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. NN Group is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. 1 KPMG Accountants N.V., registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity. 1402256/19X00163134AVN NN Group N.V. 75 2018 Annual Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 Facts and figures Assurance report of independent auditors continued The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Non-Financial Information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied internal reporting criteria as disclosed on page 67 of the report. Key review matter Key review matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our review of the Non-Financial Information. We have communicated the key review matter to the Supervisory Board. The key review matter is not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. This matter was addressed in the context of our review of the Non-Financial Information within the scope of our engagement as a whole and in forming our conclusion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. Key review matter: Balanced reporting Description NN Group applies the GRI Standards and the <IR> Framework for the Annual Review. These frameworks require amongst others that the report provides an unbiased and clear picture of NN Group’s (non-financial) performance and that discussion of topics provides a complete view of the relevant aspects of these topics. In 2018, the integration of the Delta Lloyd operations and personnel into the NN Group organisation was a key focus area for the Executive Board. Furthermore, NN Group strengthened its approach to responsible investing. Therefore, we consider balanced and complete reporting on key topics (e.g. the Delta Lloyd integration and the responsible investment process) as significant to our review. Our response We have performed assurance procedures aimed at the balance and complete representation for key topics in the report of NN Group. Those procedures started by obtaining an understanding of the processes NN Group applied to collect and document information as the basis for preparing the Annual Review. We interviewed relevant staff responsible for preparing the Annual Review and assessed proper inclusion of both achievements and challenges in the reporting. Furthermore we have reviewed underlying documentation. We have also assessed the Annual Review on the balance between the different material topics. For the Delta Lloyd integration and responsible investing, we reviewed the information in the report on whether this provides a balanced and a complete picture of the activities and occurrences for 2018 and future plans and activities of NN Group as applicable. 2 KPMG Accountants N.V., registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity. 1402256/19X00163134AVN NN Group N.V. 76 2018 Annual Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 Facts and figures Assurance report of independent auditors continued Finally we performed an overall assessment of the Annual Review based on our knowledge of the company and evidence obtained to determine whether the Annual Review presents a balanced overall picture of NN Group’s (non-financial) performance and activities over the year. Our observation We concluded that the Annual Review reflects a sufficiently balanced and complete view of the performance and activities of NN Group for the year 2018 on selected key reporting topics (e.g. the Delta Lloyd integration and responsible investing). Limitations to the scope of our review The Non-Financial Information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations and estimates, and risk assessments. Inherently the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the Non-Financial Information. Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Non-Financial Information The Executive Board of NN Group is responsible for the preparation of the Non-Financial Information in accordance with the GRI Standards and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in ‘Our approach to reporting’ on page 67, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The choices made by the Executive Board regarding the scope of the Non-Financial Information and the reporting policy are summarised in ‘Our approach to reporting’ of the Annual Review. The Executive Board is also responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the Non-Financial Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing NN Group’s reporting process. Our responsibilities for the review of the Non-Financial Information Our objective is to plan and perform the review in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determining the plausibility of information and vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in review engagements with a limited level of assurance is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in audit engagements. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users taken on the basis of the Non-Financial Information. 3 KPMG Accountants N.V., registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity. 1402256/19X00163134AVN NN Group N.V. 77 2018 Annual Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 Facts and figures Assurance report of independent auditors continued The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our review procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion. We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen’ (NVKS, Regulations on quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the review, in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our review engagement included, among others, the following procedures: — Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant societal themes and issues, and the characteristics of the company; — Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the Non-Financial Information. This includes the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialogue and the reasonableness of estimates made by management; — Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes for the Non-Financial Information, including obtaining a general understanding of internal control relevant to our review; — Identifying areas of the Non-Financial Information with a higher risk of misleading or unbalanced information or material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. Designing and performing further assurance procedures aimed at determining the plausibility of the Non-Financial Information responsive to this risk analysis. These procedures included among others: — Interviewing management and relevant staff at corporate level responsible for the nonfinancial strategy, policy and results; — Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information for, carrying out internal control procedures on, and consolidating the data in the Non-Financial Information; — Obtaining assurance information that the Non-Financial Information reconciles with underlying records of the company; — Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant internal and external documentation; — Performing an analytical review of the data and trends in the information submitted for consolidation at corporate level. — Evaluating the consistency of the Non-Financial Information with the information in the report which is not included in the scope of our review; — Evaluating the presentation, structure and content of the Non-Financial Information; 4 KPMG Accountants N.V., registered with the trade register in the Netherlands under number 33263683, is a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (‘KPMG International’), a Swiss entity. 1402256/19X00163134AVN NN Group N.V. 78 2018 Annual Review 1 2 3 4 5 6 Facts and figures Assurance report of independent auditors continued — To consider whether the Non-Financial Information as a whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of the reporting criteria used.
