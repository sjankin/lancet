Measurement of Outcomes For the 2018-2019 reporting period, the Chambers Federation has successfully continued to invest into the women-led organization, the Fair Congo Initiatives, and begun to research its entry into several new CAHRAs to expand its social impact model. To date, the Fair Congo Initiatives have: recycled over 7 tons of wood waste to produce office and home furniture; produce and export the DRC’s first premium chocolate and confectionary ingredients also grown and produced entirely by women; export the first responsible gold from a CAHRA to the US and European markets; begun producing the first woman-made jewelry in-country from responsible gold.
