In addition, in early 2019, Greece returned to the international markets with five-year and ten-year bonds, the government’s first issuance after the conclusion of its third adjustment program, drawing strong demand from institutional investors. Confidence is gradually returning to the Greek banking sector and this is evident across banking operations and especially in terms of liquidity, as reflected in the steady deposit inflows. Asset quality remains top priority for Greek banks. Significant progress was made in reducing the NPEs in the last year. The enhanced institutional framework contributed in this direction, along with the important actions undertaken by banks to manage NPEs. Emphasis should be placed on accelerating this positive momentum to achieve the consolidation of the banking sector at the lowest cost for the Greek economy and society. At Piraeus Bank, we continued in 2018 a major effort to return to profitability and strengthen the balance sheet, always with determination to operate within a framework of strong corporate governance and internal controls. The effort has begun to bear fruit, and for the first time in many years, in 2018 the Bank returned to profitability. And, most importantly, the foundations for sustainable and profitable growth of the Bank have been set. 10 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 In 2018 the Bank successfully launched its new corporate values, aiming to build a new, strong, common corporate culture for the benefit of customers, employees, shareholders and society in which it operates and will continue to be active in the future. Piraeus Bank, with its continuing presence in Green Development, is aware of the important role it plays in addressing the challenges facing the planet, has been voluntarily participating in the UN Global Compact since 2004, actively supporting its principles, which pertain to human and labour rights, environmental protection and anti-corruption. In addition, recognising the importance of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and their widespread acceptance, the Bank has adopted in this year’s Sustainability and Business Report these goals, contributing to the flourishing of this ambitious project in Greece. Based on the above, these goals have been integrated into our business activities, which gives us the opportunity to play a leading role in the sustainable development of the Greek economy and to support these goals in practice. In addition, Piraeus Bank is the first Greek bank that participated in the formulation of the Principles for Responsible Banking, along with 27 other member banks from around the world, embracing the initiative of UNEP FI. The six Principles for Responsible Banking launched in Paris on 26 November 2018 have been put under global public consultation and will be signed by banks from around the world at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this autumn. This direct response has been a self-evident choice, as the principles of sustainable growth, social contribution and responsible banking behaviour are fundamental elements of our strategy and resonate with the Bank’s business model and its new Values: Accountability, Meritocracy and Transparency. The role of the financial sector is fundamental in shaping the future. Two-thirds of global funding comes from banks, and banks are asked to channel this funding towards sustainable development, contributing in the achievement of the 17 SDGs and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Piraeus Bank already has a long experience in promoting sustainable development, and takes action: 01. Possessing the necessary know-how, the Transparency. Bank provides comprehensive support to 05.

The Report was reviewed by an independent third party, which demonstrates the Management’s commitment to transparency and alignment with internationally recognised best practices. Everyone at Piraeus Bank works hard so that the Bank can respond to the challenges of the current circumstances and works towards a sustainable economy for a better future for us and for the next generations. George Handjinicolaou Chairman of the BoD CEO’s Note In the face of significant challenges in 2018, we made progress towards our goals of derisking our balance sheet, optimising operational efficiency and refocusing the business model on creating sustainable returns. Profitability recovery gained traction in 2018, as the Bank recorded pre-tax profit of €80 mn for the first time in a number of years, supported by operational cost containment and reduced expense of impairments. Piraeus Core Bank recorded accumulated recurring pretax profit of €644 mn in 2018, achieving an annual return on assets (RoA) of 1.6%. The liquidity profile of Piraeus Bank has been improving consistently for two years. Domestic deposit inflows in 2018 amounted to €3.6 bn, an increase of 9% yoy, allowing us to fully eliminate ELA reliance in mid-July 2018. ECB eligibility status for the Bank’s covered bond pool, allowed us to replace interbank repo financing with ECB main refinancing operations, supporting the Bank’s net interest income. We have fulfilled our commitment to further strengthen the Greek economy by disbursing €3.1 bn in new loans in 2018. With a loan-to-deposit ratio of 85% at the end of 2018 from 103% a year earlier, we can facilitate the expected demand for loans and enable the gradual normalisation of the Bank’s performing loan book, which stood at €24.0 bn over the 2nd half of the year. We are leveraging on efficiency and digitisation to transform our operating model, with an improved cost reduction performance in 2018. Operating expenses on a recurring basis, CEO’s Note 13 dropped 8% yoy in 2018, and the cost-to-income ratio stood at 54% from 55% a year earlier. In terms of asset quality, in 2018 we decisively continued de-risking our balance sheet. We accelerated the NPE reduction process with a €5.5 bn decrease in NPEs in 2018, meeting our targets. The NPE cash coverage ratio stood at 49%. During the year, we concluded two NPL portfolio sales with a total gross book value of €1.8 bn. One portfolio comprised secured corporate loans and was a landmark transaction and effectively kick-started the secondary market for NPL corporate portfolio sales in Greece, the other portfolio comprised unsecured consumer loans. Motivated by our asset quality track record, in March 2019 we revised the commitments regarding NPE operational targets in our NPE strategy plan, which calls for a €15 bn reduction in NPEs to €11 bn by the end of 2021. The Bank’s overall strategy in managing NPEs is to strike a balance between ambitious NPE reduction and managing the stock of NPEs in such a way to create long-term value. 2018 was a year of significant regulatory developments in the banking sector and Piraeus Bank. First Time Adoption of IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018 had a €2.0 bn impact on the Group’s Total Equity, with the largest part being gradually phased in over a period of 5 years. The conclusion of 2018 EU-wide Stress Test signalled the end of a long period of uncertainty for the Greek banking sector. For Piraeus Bank the results of the Stress Test reflected the significant efforts undertaken to transform the Bank at all levels. This was most evident in the assumptions of the baseline scenario, under which the Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio reached 14.5%. Piraeus Bank has been implementing a Capital Strengthening Plan to ensure that it has sufficient capital to satisfy the regulatory capital requirements which are growing for the sector across Europe. With more than 94% of planned internal capital generating actions already concluded, the Group’s CET1 ratio stood at 13.65% on 31 December 2018, or 14.0% pro-forma for the disposal of the subsidiaries in Albania (completed in February 2019) and Bulgaria (to be completed in the second half of 2019). Following the conclusion of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) by the ECB in 2018, the Pillar 2 Requirements (P2R) for the Bank have been reduced by 50bps. The Overall Capital Requirement (OCR), including the implementation of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) and the Other Systemically Important Institution Buffer (O-SII) stood at 14%, as of 1 March 2019. Piraeus Bank is pursuing a number of planned capital actions that are expected to result in capital levels that satisfy supervisory requirements and the Bank’s risk appetite. In addition to the organic capital generation budgeted for 2019 and the scheduled Tier 2 debt issuance, for which the Bank is fully prepared in a gradually improving market sentiment, Piraeus Bank’s management is working on a number of additional initiatives to strengthen its capital position, creating buffers above supervisory requirements. Growth prospects for the Greek economy in 2019 are favourable, as the recovery is expected to maintain its momentum despite the increased uncertainty that comes mainly from the external environment. Most international funds and institutions are projecting Greece to achieve a GDP growth between 2.0% and 2.5% for 2019, driven by business investment, exports and private consumption. 14 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Piraeus Bank, as part of its business planning, focuses on all opportunities for recovery. Its main objectives for 2019 are: a) enhancing revenue streams and operating efficiency to create sustainable profitability b) improving the asset quality through the consistent implementation of the NPE reduction plan towards 2021 c) strengthening of the capital base and d) supporting the economic development of our country. We remain focused and aligned to implement our plan, responding to our commitments and business goals, while at the same time we are moving forward with the de-risking of our balance sheet. For 2019, we are working to deliver our business goals while aiming at a profitable result for our stakeholders.

Customer deposits of the Group continued to recover for another year, reaching €44.7 bn as at 31/12/2018, posting an increase of 4.7% compared to 31/12/2017.

Savings deposits constitute 34.2% of the total domestic deposits of the Bank with time deposits at 38.9% and sight deposits at 26.9%.

Gross loans as at 31/12/2018 amounted to €53.1 bn. Total gross loans in Greece stood at €52.0 bn, of which €1.6 bn was related to the disbursement of an agri-loan towards OPEKEPE for the distribution of European Commission subsidies towards approximately 700 thousand farmers (which was repaid in February 2019). The domestic market share of loans was 29.3% at the end of 2018. Loans stemming from the Group’s international operations amounted to €1.1 bn as at 31/12/2018 from €2.0 bn a year earlier.

The Bank’s domestic loan book consists of business (63.2%), mortgage (27.8%) and consumer loans (9,0%).

In the direction of better management of NPEs, the institutional framework has been enriched and the Greek banks have taken important actions. In particular, electronic platforms have been put in place for the out-of-court debt settlement mechanism and for property auctions and show signs of progress after a slow start. The institutional framework for debt management companies has been adapted, 16 credit management companies have Group’s Financial Data Analysis 33 already been licensed, and efforts have been made to improve interbank co-operation (eg NPL Forum). Meanwhile, the secondary market for NPE has begun with positive results, with more than 10 transactions being completed or at an advanced stage of implementation in one year. The Bank completed the sale of two NPE portfolios totaling a combined gross book value of €1.8 bn, the first regarding secured corporate loans (Amoeba) and the second non-secured consumer loans (Arctos) in the 4th quarter of 2018. The Bank is already working towards the sale of two new NPE portfolios, of €1.3 bn gross book value. The overall decline in NPEs amounted to €5.5 bn over the past 12 months, with the balance reducing to €27.3 bn at the end of December 2018. The NPE ratio declined to 53,1% in 2018 from 56,0% in 2017. The corresponding NPE coverage ratio from accumulated provisions remained at 49%. Based on the performance of Piraeus Bank in the management of NPEs, in March 2019, a new NPE business target was set for the end of 2021 at €11 bn, suggesting a total decrease of €15 bn compared to Dec.2018, both through organic and inorganic actions. Profit & Loss The Group’s net interest income eased to €1.4 bn in 2018 from €1.6 bn in 2017 -despite the improvement from the reduction in the cost of fundingdue to asset deleveraging and the effect of the IFRS 9 FTA and the standards for loan exposures in Stage 3 resulting to lower accruing loan balances. Net fee and commission income amounted to €0.3 bn in 2018, with a small annual rise compared to 2017. Total net income for 2018 amounted to €1.9 bn from €2.1 bn in 2017. The Group’s total operating expenses in 2018 stood at €1.2 bn, compared to €1.1 bn in 2017, as a result of the cost of the Voluntary Exit Scheme through which more than 1,300 employees left the Bank. Excluding the VES cost, total operating expenses amounted to €1,0 bn, a reduction of 7.6% versus the previous year respectively. As a result of the above, Group profit before provisions, impairments and income tax for the full year 2018 amounted to €0.7 bn, compared to €1.0 bn in 2017. The results of 2018 were burdened by ECL impairment charge on loans amounting to €0.6 bn, compared to €2.0 bn in 2017. The normalisation of the ECL impairment charge can be attributed to the large amount of accumulated past provisions, the IFRS 9 FTA impact, the sales of NPE portfolios, and the loan deleveraging. In addition, other assets were impaired by €124 mn in 2018 from €151 mn in 2017. The Group’s profit before income tax in 2018 amounted to a gain of €80 mn from a loss of €1.2 bn in 2017, while profit for the period from continuing operations attributable to shareholders amounted to a gain of €185 mn in 2018 comparable to a loss of €9 mn in 2017, positively affected from the recognition of deferred tax asset on the difference between the ECL allowance and the tax base. 34 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Consolidated Data (amounts in €mn) 31.12.18 31.12.17 Δ yoy Selected Balance Sheet Figures * Assets 61,880 67,417 -8.2% Deposits 44,739 42,715 4.7% Gross Loans before adjustments * 53,091 60,260 -11.9% Cumulative Provisions 13,333 15,541 -14.2% Total Equity 7,506 9,544 -21.4% Selected P&L Results** 2018 2017 Δ yoy Net Interest Income 1,410 1,639 -14.0% Net Fee & Commission Income 339 331 2.5% Core Banking Income 1,749 1,970 -11.2% Net Trading & Inv.

Piraeus Bank has been presenting non-financial information in line with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) since 2006, setting out a comprehensible framework of principles that facilitates the dissemination of information and communication of sustainable development issues both for the Group and for stakeholders. Additionally, adopting these principles contributes to a better ranking of the Bank, which is actively involved in international initiatives and included in corporate sustainability indices. Through these initiatives and based on international standards and practices, the Bank is regularly assessed and continuously upgrades its sustainable development practices. Since 2004 Piraeus Bank Group has been voluntarily following the guidelines for the publication of annual and progress reports as indicated by the UN Global Compact. In addition, recognising the importance of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their widespread acceptance, the Bank links the most material issues identified in the materiality survey with the Group’s most important goals. Material issues are those that reflect the economic, environmental and social impact of the Bank or that significantly influence the assessments and the decisions of stakeholders. 42 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Piraeus Bank defines the stakeholders, i.e. customers, employees, suppliers, investors/ shareholders, investment analysts, media, supervisory & regulatory authorities, investment community, community/environmental/cultural bodies, NGOs. The Bank then enters into a dialogue with them, to address their needs and expectations and to highlight current issues related to Sustainable Development. These issues are the basis for designing and activating mechanisms to continuously improve the Bank’s operations. In addition to the regular communication and collaboration with each stakeholder group, Piraeus Bank has also adopted a hierarchy of material issues. This involves conducting a survey and discussion with focus groups to highlight current material issues related to Sustainable Development and based on the principles of Materiality, Stakeholder Participation, Viability Sustainability Context and Completeness. The Materiality Survey is based on a structured questionnaire designed to investigate issues that are related to the legitimate expectations and interests of stakeholders, and which consequently have an impact on society, the economy and the environment. These issues arise from Piraeus Bank’s systematic communication with the interested parties and are shaped by current events, prevailing market conditions, existing CSR practices and surveys, and the corporate responsibility indices in which the Bank is included. Material issues might change over time and as deeper knowledge of these is acquired. Piraeus Bank re-evaluates their materiality once a year, in the context of compiling the Sustainable Development Report. The Bank addresses the questionnaire to a sample of internal and external participants, and organises a focus group discussion, thus benefiting from the direct communication and the opportunity for an open discussion and collection of observations. The discussion is coordinated by external partner of the Bank in the presence of representatives from an independent audit firm, thus ensuring alignment of the consultation process with the principles of AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard and validity of the process. The sustainable development practices are ranked in order of importance for each stakeholder group, depending on the type of relationship they have with the Bank. Participants were asked to assess an extensive range of corporate responsibility issues regarding the level of materiality, using a standardised materiality scale (from 1=not at all to 5=strongly). Issues are ranked on the basis of their relevance to the judgment and decision of the stakeholders and their contribution to sustainable development. At the same time, participants may make suggestions for improvement and/or change, which the Group considers. The results of the materiality survey are presented in the materiality map. The horizontal axis represents the way in which stakeholders perceive the materiality of each issue and the vertical axis represents the assessment by Piraeus Bank Group on the significance of the impact of these issues on sustainable development, society, the economy and the environment. The whole process as well as the Report itself are assured by an independent body, which is proof of the Bank’s commitment to transparency and alignment with internationally recognised best practices. Based on the results, both sides agreed on the following 12 material issues, presented below in order of materiality: Sustainable Development 43 1.

In the framework of its activities and operations, the Group promotes regular communication with its stakeholders, the frequency of which is determined by the nature of the relationship with the stakeholders, in order to fulfil their needs and expectations and to promptly and effectively respond to issues concerning them. Through its involvement in the formulation and adoption of the global Principles for Responsible Banking, the Bank emphasises at each stakeholder individually and evaluates each respective communication as very important. As a result, through the continued dialogue in 2018, the Group recognised that the most material issues for stakeholders include the protection of their personal data, the use of new technologies to better serve their needs, the respect for human rights, the accessibility to financial services and the respect for the environment and culture as factors contributing to sustainable development, as well as issues related to corporate culture and corporate governance, value creation for the society and risk management.

The adoption of the Principles will make a decisive contribution to the global banking sector’s alignment with the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement. The Principles for Responsible Banking are fully harmonised with the Bank’s Purpose and Values. Following a public consultation, they will be signed in New York in September 2019. The Principles were presented by the Chairman of Piraeus Bank Mr G. Handjinicolaou and the CEO of Piraeus Bank Mr C. Megalou on 16/01/2019, for the first time in Greece, at an event organised by the Bank, with the Governor of the Bank of Greece as a keynote speaker.

Corporate Sustainability Indices and Distinctions The corporate sustainability indices track the stock performance of the world’s leading companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria (ESG), and promote the best performers in Corporate Sustainability.

The Corporate Governance System of Piraeus Bank adopts and complies with the laws and regulations governing the Bank’s operation. Specifically, Piraeus Bank, in its capacity as a Soci t Anonyme company listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, applies the provisions on Law of Societ s Anonymes, its Articles of Association and the institutional and regulatory framework of corporate governance of listed companies, as in force. Furthermore, Piraeus Bank, as a financial institution, supervised by the European Central Bank, applies the most stringent special institutional and regulatory provisions regarding principles of operation of credit institutions and the criteria for evaluating their Internal Control System. Furthermore, Piraeus Bank has established and applies the Corporate Governance Structure and Operating Regulation ( the Regulation ), which constitutes an internal document of the Bank. The Regulation incorporates the regulations arising from the mandatory institutional framework and adopts the international Corporate Governance practices. The Regulation refers in detail to the area of competence and responsibility and to the functioning of key bodies of the Bank, in particular to the Board of Directors, the Board of 64 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Directors Committees, the main Executive, Administrative and other Committees and also to the Internal Audit, the Risk Management and the Regulatory Compliance Units. It is noted that the Bank’s Articles of Association and its Regulation, which are posted on the Bank’s website (www.piraeusbank.gr), are currently under review following, inter alia, the adoption as of 01.01.2019 of the new Greek Law for the Societ s Anonymes (L. 4548/2018), which replaced the Codified Law 2190/1920 and the need to fully abide by the provisions of the new Law. Moreover, in the context of the provisions of Law 3864/2010, a Relationship Framework Agreement (RFA) dated 27.11.2015 was entered between the Bank and the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). The RFA regulates the relationship between the Bank and the HFSF on matters related to, amongst others, the Corporate Governance of the Bank, the rights and obligations of the HFSF’s Representative on the Board and the obligatory approval of the HFSF on material matters. The Bank’s administrative, management and supervisory bodies as well as the Systems of Internal Audit, Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management, as mentioned below, exist and operate in accordance with the aforementioned institutional and regulatory framework of Corporate Governance and Operation. General Meeting The General Meeting of the Shareholders of Piraeus Bank is the supreme body of the Bank and among other functions, it is responsible inter alia for electing the members of the Board of Directors, the external auditors and for the approval of Annual Financial Report that incorporates the Board of Directors’ Report and the Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements. The responsibilities of the General Meeting are as provided by the legislative provisions in force and the Bank’s Articles of Association. The Bank maintains Investor Relations, Shareholder Information and Corporate Announcement services, entrusted with the task to inform investors, shareholders and appropriate regulatory authorities, accordingly. The aim of the aforementioned services is the ensuring of communication and the transparency of information.

During 2018, a total of 651 meetings/briefings were held with investors and analysts in Greece and abroad. Piraeus Bank received important distinctions in the Extel’s annual investment services survey during 2018. The survey is conducted through direct voting from the investment community (investors, analysts, stockbrokers, fund managers, etc.) and the Bank was ranked second in the CEO and IRO categories for its investment services in Greece.

The Bank’s announcements are sent to the Hellenic Exchanges in order to be recorded in the Daily Official List and to inform the investors. Shareholder Structure Piraeus Bank shareholder structure presents great diversity. In December 2018, the total number of Piraeus Bank’s common shareholders stood at 28,000. The HFSF held 26% of the outstanding common shares (436,659,164 shares of a nominal value €6.0 each) and the remaining 74% was held by the private sector (65% by legal entities and 9% by individuals). Board of Directors The Board of Directors (BoD) represents the Bank and is qualified to resolve, without any restriction, on any issue concerning the Bank’s management, the administration of its property and the promotion of its business scope in general. The Board of Directors may not resolve on issues which, in accordance with the law or the Articles of Association, fall into the exclusive competence of the General Meeting. In accordance with the Law of Societ s Anonymes, the Bank’s Articles of Association and the RFA, the current Bank’s BoD is composed of eleven (11) members, including the representative of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund, as well as in accordance with the provisions of Law 3864/2010. The composition of the Bank’s BoD is in line with those applicable to executive, non-executive and independent members. The BoD consists of two (2) Executive members and nine (9) non-Executive members. Executive members shall be those engaged in the daily management issues of the Bank; non-executive member shall be those entrusted with the promotion of corporate affairs.

Simultaneously, the elected members of the Bank’s Board of Directors are also subject to evaluation by the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) of the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as by HFSF, according to the current legislative and regulatory framework.

The current BoD was elected on the General Meeting held on 28 June 2017 and consequently its term of office expires on 28 June 2020, to be extended according to the aforementioned. If a Board member resigns, passes away or forfeits his/her office in any way, or whose office is declared forfeited by resolution of the Board of Directors due to unjustified absence from meetings for three (3) consecutive months, the Board may continue to manage and represent the Bank without replacing the missing members if the remaining members are at least nine (9). If the members of the Board fall below nine (9) the Board shall elect a replacement for the remainder of the term of the member being replaced to make up the minimum number of nine (9). The decision of the election shall be published, according to the applicable Law and the Board of Directors shall announce it at the next General Meeting. The BoD of the Bank consists of members with international leadership expertise and knowhow in strategically-important sectors of financial activity, such as banking, auditing, risk management, management and restructuring of non-performing loans, management of public interest entities and financial management, as well as environmental and social issues. Moreover, the Bank provides the appropriate financial and human resources to implement proper educational and informative programs on an ongoing or ad-hoc basis for the members of the BoD. The current Bank’s Board of Directors has the following composition, as such was formed following amendments (resignations, replacements of Members) the reconstitution of the Board as a body and the appointment of executive and Νon-Executive Μembers pursuant to Law 3016/2002: George Handjinikolaou, son of Petros Non-Executive Member Chairman of the Board, Non-Executive Christos Megalou, son of Ioannis Member CEO, Executive Member Karel De Boeck, son of Gerard Georgios Georgakopoulos, son of Gregorios Vice Chairman of the Board, Independent Executive Member 68 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Venetia Kontogouri, daughter of Gerasimos Alexander Blades,son of Zisis Independent Non-Executive Member Non-Executive Member Arne Berggren, son of Sten Per Anders Fasth, son of Jöergen Independent Non-Executive Member Non-Executive Member, Representative Enrico Tommaso Cucchiani, son of Clemente of the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund to Independent Non-Executive Member the Board of Directors pursuant to Law David Hexter, son of Richard 3864/2010 Independent Non-Executive Member Solomon Berahas, son of Albertos Non-Executive Member According to the revised RFA, an HFSF Observer attends the Board of Directors meetings without voting rights. It is noted that following the Second Economic Adjustment Program for Greece and in the context of the commitments undertaken by the Hellenic Republic towards the European Commission, KPMG was appointed as the Monitoring Trustee of the Bank. The Monitoring Trustee was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Bank’s Restructuring Plan and all the commitments accompanying it, in line with EU state aid rules. This included, inter alia, verifying compliance with proper corporate governance rules (Commitments on Corporate Governance and Commercial Operations). In this context, representatives of the Monitoring Trustee participated until 31.12.2018 (end of the restructuring period) as observers in the meetings of the Board and in executive committees and other important committees, including the Risk Management and Audit Committees. As of 1.1.2019, said Observers are no longer present in any Board of Directors or Committee meetings. The Piraeus Bank’s Board of Directors is constantly alert by exercising due diligence in the exercise of its duties. In particular, the BoD, through organized actions, supports healthy entrepreneurship, invests in targeted vocational training, assists young people to become dynamic in the market, collaborates with the production and business sectors of the Greek economy, including Small and Medium size Enterprises –particularly the tourist and agricultural sector– and supports responsibly and consistently the efforts towards the restarting of the Greek economy. At the same time, the achieved diversity of the BoD members, in line with areas mainly related to skills, educational and professional background as well as the ethnic origin of every member, with respect to the operation of the BoD, contribute to the expression of different views, the constructive dialogue between members and the avoidance of group thinking . It is noted that the Bank has adopted a Policy on the Nomination of Board Members and the Board of Directors Diversity Policy. In any case the Bank recognizes and embraces the importance and the benefits of diversity for safeguarding and improving its competitive advantage and innovation as well as for the achieving maximum team performance and effectiveness. In this context, when nominating new Board members or top management executives, a combination of elements is taken into consideration, including inter alia: skills, abilities, qualifications, experience, educational background, professional training, professional experience, the gender, the age and other qualities, which may vary depending on the identified weaknesses and the business or strategy needs of the Bank.

Based on the framework defined in BoG’s Act 2650/19.01.2012, as well as later regulations of Law 4261/2014 (concerning remuneration policy), article 450 of EU Regulation 575/2013, EU Regulation 604/2014, the Remuneration Policy is in line with the Group’s corporate strategy and supports a performance-driven culture that aligns the organization’s goals with those of interested parties, employees, management and shareholders. The remuneration setting procedures are clear, written and internally transparent Basic Principles The Remuneration Policy is based on the following principles: 01. Performance maximization 04. Compliance with the regulatory 02. Attracting and retaining talents framework 03. Aligning remuneration and rewards with 05. Internal transparency profitability, risk, capital adequacy, risk to 06. Avoidance of excessive risk taking liquidity and sustainable growth The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the preparation, the monitoring of the implementation and the periodic review of the Bank’s Remuneration Policy. The Committee takes into consideration the long term interests of shareholders, investors and other stakeholders of the Bank, and is oriented towards the long term prudent management of the institution and the prevention or minimization of potential conflicts of interest that could burden such management. Other involved parties The Remuneration Policy is designed by Group Human Resources assisted by Legal, Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit. It is submitted to the Remuneration Committee which in turn, proceeds with any potential necessary changes or alterations, before submitting it to the Board of Directors for approval. The non Executive Board Members approve the Remuneration Policy. Control Units contribute to the design and preparation of the Remuneration Policy. The implementation of remuneration policy, in terms of compliance and remuneration procedures is subject to central and independent internal review by the Group Internal Audit at least once a year. Group Compliance examines how the Remuneration Policy affects Bank’s compliance with the regulatory framework, the legislation and the internal procedures. The non Executive Board Members could, if and when they deem it necessary, co-operate with external consultants for the preparation/review of the policy. It should be noted that during 2018, no external consultants participated in the preparation or review of the Bank’s Remuneration Policy. Remuneration structure Total remuneration may include -besides fixedvariable components too, ensuring a link between compensation and long-term business efficiency. Under all cases, the fixed component represents the basic proportion of an employee’s total remuneration. 78 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Variable remuneration can be provided to reward performance based on pre-defined quantitative and qualitative objectives. Such objectives are linked to the employee’s performance, the business unit’s performance, the overall organization’s/Group’s performance and longterm business goals. The criteria used to assess the award of variable remuneration include indicatively among others, profitability, capital adequacy, efficiency, change management, staff development etc. The variable remuneration, including the deferred portion, is paid or vested only if it is sustainable according to the financial situation of the Group and is justified based on results. It should be noted that the performance evaluation of staff in Control Units (i.e. Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit), is not connected with the outcome/performance of the processes/units they control in order to secure employees’ objectivity and independence. In order to enhance the connection between variable remuneration and the Group’s longterm objectives, the award of variable remuneration is spread over time and the amounts awarded for both deferred and not deferred variable components, are not only paid in cash, but in other instruments as well (e.g. shares). Criteria for Cancellation/Refund of Variable Remuneration The Bank has the right to cancel the award of deferred variable remuneration, if certain performance indicators are not satisfied. The same can happen in cases of detected and verified incidents of non-compliance with existing rules and/ or processes or other serious cause (participation in/or responsibility for conduct) which resulted in significant losses. In addition, in cases where it is proven ex-post, that variable remuneration has wrongfully been awarded, the total amount of deferred variable remuneration can be cancelled. Without prejudice to the general principles of national contract and labour law, in cases of proven bad intent or deceit for the award of variable remuneration, the Bank can claim back from an employee a full refund of any paid variable compensation. Proportionality principle The Bank applies the existing regulatory framework on remuneration using the proportionality principle, by taking into account its nature, size, internal organization and complexity of activities.

Supervisory Relations informs the Bank’s Management about the requested data and reports on areas that require Management intervention to improve the Group’s image vis-vis the Supervisory Authorities. It analyses and identifies areas for improvement and coordinates the preparation of cross-sectional strategic projects that enhance the overall financial position and value of the Group as a whole. Until the end of 2018, the sub-unit was responsible for coordinating the process of capitalising projects and monitoring the costs of projects included in the Bank’s Action Plan portfolio. It supported the operations of the Expenditure Committee on approving expenditure and sales of real estate, on producing management reports, coordinated Committee initiatives and centrally monitored consultant costs. 2018 Key Actions 01.

Risk management Piraeus Bank Group is fully committed to monitoring and managing risk, at Group and solo level, so as to maintain stability and continuity of operations. The prudent implementation and constant development of the risk management framework is a priority and forms an integral part of the Group’s business strategy-setting process. The BoD is fully responsible for developing and overseeing the risk management framework. Corporate Governace, Risk & Controls 85 The Risk Management Committee (RMC), as one of the BoD committees, convenes on a monthly and/or an ad hoc basis, and is charged with ensuring that the risk management framework is fully aligned with the Group’s business objectives. The RMC evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the strategy on risk undertaking and capital management, as well as the capital adequacy requirements in relation to the amount and form of the risks assumed. The RMC reviews and assesses the Group’s strategy and relevant goals regarding the management and reduction of troubled assets. The RMC convened thirteen (13) times in 2018. Group Risk Management (GRM) is an independent administrative unit responsible for the Bank’s policy on risk management and credit risk control, in accordance with the BoG Governor’s Act No. 2577/2006, as in force, and the CRD IV regulatory framework. The Head of the GRM (Chief Risk Officer, CRO) is appointed by the BoD, upon recommendation of the RMC, and his appointment or replacement, following the approval of the RMC, is communicated to the regulatory authorities. The CRO acts as the Executive Secretary of the RMC and is a member of the Group Executive Committee and of all the Bank’s major Executive/Administrative Committees. In the Senior Credit Committee, the Asset-Liability Management Committee (ALCO), and the Recovery Credit Committee, the CRO has veto power and may prevent acts/decisions in possible breach of the Bank’s approved Risk and Capital Strategy. The duties of the main Executive/Administrative Committees in which the CRO is involved are described in the Corporate Governance Structure and Operating Regulation www.piraeusbankgroup.com/el/investors/corporate-governance The Group has established detailed procedures and adequate risk control mechanisms to identify/manage/monitor/report such risks. The procedures in place foster the independence of risk taking, risk management and control functions. The Group’s organisational structure ensures separation of tasks and aims to prevent instances that could lead to conflicts of interest. The Risk and Capital Strategy sets out the principles of an integrated risk-management and risk-taking framework to achieve the Group’s strategic and business goals, as determined by the BoD. The risk management framework is continually evaluated and evolving, taking into account the current economic environment, business plans, historical data of the Bank, market dynamics, new supervisory and regulatory requirements, the Group’s Corporate Governance Framework, international best practices and the shareholders’ interests. GRM uses a set of indicators/metrics for each type of risk to review and assess the effectiveness of the risk management framework and informs the Administration accordingly. The Group’s corporate governance and risk management framework are supervised and assessed by the competent authorities. Since November 2014, the Bank, as well as the other Greek systemic banks, is under the control of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which is composed of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Greek Competent Authority (BoG). GRM designs, sets and implements the Bank’s risk management policies, in accordance with 86 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 the Group’s Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), as approved by the BoD, and in compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. In 2018 the following Risk Management units operated within the Group: 01. Credit Risk Management 05. Group Risk Coordination & Model 02. Capital Management Validation 03. Operational, Liquidity & Market Risk 06. Risk Data Office Management 07. Risk Management Office 04. Credit Control GRM duties include, inter alia, developing, implementing and periodically reviewing the adequacy of the methods, models and tools –tailored to product and service pricing risk– and supporting business units in using them. In addition, GRM actively participates in strategic and business planning, makes investment decisions (in accordance with the risk appetite), ensures the continuous familiarisation with the risks assumed and cultivates a risk management culture across each hierarchical level of the Group. Group Risk Management activities are subject to the independent audit of the Internal Audit, which assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of the processes in place. For more information on Group Risk Management, see: www.piraeusbankgroup.com/en/documentation/pillar-iii-disclosures#2018|1 Credit Risk Management The Credit Risk Management unit (CRM) designs, sets and implements its credit risk management policies, in accordance with the Group’s RAF, as approved by the BoD, and in compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Credit risk is defined as the risk of incurring financial losses to the Group, arising from a borrower’s or counterparty’s potential inability to fulfil their contractual/transactional obligations. Exposure to credit risk is the leading source of problems for Piraeus Bank and therefore its effective monitoring and management is one of senior management’s top priorities. The Group’s exposure to credit risk arises mainly from corporate and retail loans, its banking book and its trading book, Over-The-Counter (OTC) transactions, derivatives transactions, as well as from the settlement of transactions. The degree of risk associated with such credit exposures depends on various factors, including the general economic and market conditions, the borrower’s financial condition, the amount, type and duration of exposure and the existence of collateral and guarantees. The implementation of the credit policy, which describes the Group’s credit risk management principles, ensures that credit risk is treated in a uniform and effective way. Piraeus Bank Group applies a uniform policy and practice with respect to credit assessment, approval, renewal and monitoring procedures. All credit limits are reviewed and/or renewed at least annually, and credit approval authority is assigned to the credit committees, taking into account the size and the type of credit risk undertaken by the Group for each borrower or group of connected borrowers. Measuring and Monitoring Credit risk The continuous development of infrastructure, systems and methodologies for measurCorporate Governace, Risk & Controls 87 ing and monitoring credit risk is a precondition for the timely and effective support of Management and Business Units in relation to decision-making, policy formulation, and compliance with regulatory requirements. Measuring and monitoring credit risk of the Group’s loans and advances entails: 01. Regular assessment of the borrower’s default. The assessment takes into account creditworthiness and the potential risk of underlying collateral and guarantees, default. expected recoveries and potential curing 02. Assessment of the Group’s recoverability from forborne loans. of the credit, in the event of counterparty The Group evaluates the creditworthiness of its borrowers and measures the potential default risk, using credit risk models that take into account the types and characteristics of the borrowers. These models combine financial and statistical analysis with the expert judgment of responsible officers. An initial credit rating is assigned to each borrower when setting the credit limit, that is renewed periodically (at least annually). The credit ratings are updated when conditions change and new data may have a significant impact on the level of credit risk. The predictive capability of the credit rating models is reviewed at least annually. Thus, the Group ensures that the credit ratings are consistent and accurately reflect any credit risk and promptly address problems for remedial management. For more details about measuring and monitoring credit risk, see: www.piraeusbankgroup.com/en/investors/financials/financial-statements Credit Limit Management and Credit Risk Reduction Techniques The Group manages, reviews and limits its credit risk exposure and concentration, by applying a credit limit management system that establishes the maximum risk exposure limit. The Group’s total exposure to borrower credit risk, including credit institutions, is further monitored against established sub-limits covering on and off-balance sheet exposures. When establishing customer limits, the Group takes into account any collateral or guarantees to mitigate risks. The Group categorises credit risk into risk classes, based on the underlying collateral or guarantee and the potential to liquidate them. The BoD sets the maximum credit limits to be approved per risk class. Across the Group, no credit is approved by one sole person, since the approval process requires the approval of at least two Executives or a Credit Committee. Credit Committees are set up based on the level of risk exposure. The roles of Credit Committees are set out in the Credit Policy Manual and are particularly important in shaping the overall quality of the Group’s loan portfolio. Credit limits are valid for up to twelve months and are subject to annual or more frequent review. The responsible or senior approval officers of Credit Committees may, under special circumstances, opt for a credit period of less than twelve months. Outstanding balances are monitored against set limits and any exceedances are reported and addressed timely. Impairment and Provisioning Policy The Group regularly assesses whether there is reasonable and objective evidence of a financial asset’s impairment. Loan impairment tests are carried out at each reporting date, 88 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 in accordance with the general principles and methodology described in the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as included in the Impairment and Provisioning Policy, and loan provisions are established. An asset is impaired if its carrying amount (book value) is higher than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as the present value of expected cash inflows and the present value of the liquidation of any collateral/guarantees in the cases of the debtor’s inability to repay the loan, as well as by the probability of returning to cured status. When there are indications that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms, provision is made for the impairment of the asset. The amount of the impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount of the asset. Impairment and provisioning are carried out individually at a loan level for all exposures which the Group considers riskier than a certain level, and collectively at the level of a group of loans e.g. mortgage, consumer credit, etc., for all other cases. The Group proceeds with a collective assessment of impairment for exposures (debt portfolios) with similar credit risk characteristics, which are not considered significant on an individual basis. Risk-Based Pricing In the context of strengthening corporate culture and investment decision-making processes, the Bank developed a Risk-Based Pricing methodology. This methodology calculates the minimum potential cost of each possible investment, taking into account three individual key costs: 01. Credit risk 03. Cost of holding funds 02. Liquidity risk The methodology determines the desired profitability/return, taking into account the underlying risks, and aims to optimise the Bank’s balance sheet and make rational use of shareholders’ funds. In 2018, the Bank designed and implemented Risk-Based Pricing models for Large Businesses, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Project Finance, and revised the Mortgage Loan model. Forbearance and Restructuring Policy Forborne loans are defined as exposures arising from loan agreements that have been subject to forbearance measures. The measures are considered as a concession by the Bank to a borrower who faces or is about to face financial difficulties in fulfilling his/her financial obligations. Forbearance may involve a change in the contractual terms and conditions and/or a debt refinancing. Group Risk Management also monitors the forbearance process and assesses the relative risks by portfolio and forbearance type. The Group’s Chief Risk Officer is updated on a monthly basis about the evolution of RBU portfolio and reports to the Risk Management Committee. Capital Adequacy The Capital Management unit (CM) designs, sets and implements the Group’s capital adCorporate Governace, Risk & Controls 89 equacy strategy and policies and the management of supervisory and internal capital in the Group, in accordance with the Group’s RAF, as approved by the BoD, and in compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. The Group’s capital is defined in accordance with the regulatory and supervisory framework, the Directive (EU) No. 2013/36 and the Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, approved by the European Council (CRD IV/CRR). The regulatory framework requires financial institutions to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital related to the undertaken risks. The table below presents selected capital adequacy data for Piraeus Bank Group on 31.12.2018, as calculated under the existing regulatory framework, taking into account all relevant transitional period provisions applicable under Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013. The capital adequacy ratios cover the minimum regulatory requirements.

The liquidity risk experienced by a financial institution is the risk that it will not be able to meet its financial obligations when they become due. Piraeus Bank recognises that the effective management of liquidity risk contributes substantially to its ability to cover its financial obligations. All the Bank’s Units apply a uniform Liquidity Risk Management Policy which is consistent with internationally applied practices and supervisory regulations and has been adapted to the Group’s activities and organisational structures. This policy sets out the key definitions and methodologies for liquidity risk assessment, defines the roles and responsibilities of the Units and personnel involved, and sets out the guidelines for liquidity crisis management. The policy also defines a Contingency Funding Plan to be implemented in the event of a liquidity crisis. In order to manage liquidity risk effectively, the Bank monitors and manages, inter alia, the amount, quality and composition/diversification of its liquid assets, the cash flow from its assets and liabilities (inflows, outflows) in time buckets, the composition/diversification and cost of its funding sources, the composition/diversification and funding capacity of its unencumbered collateral and its funding needs in local and foreign currencies. As part of the reporting requirements under the SSM Regulation, Piraeus Bank submits a wide range of reports on a regular and periodic basis. Piraeus Bank calculates the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio on a monthly and quarterly basis respectively, as defined by Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, in the framework of implementation of Basel III on a European level and the harmonization of the EU Single Rulebook. In addition, under Directive (EU) No.2013/36, credit institutions are required to have comprehensive strategies, policies, procedures and systems to ensure adequate monitoring of liquidity risk. The annual report on the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) contains the procedures governing liquidity risk management and the main results of the assessment of the Bank’s current and future liquidity position. Within the framework of the ICAAP and ILAAP processes the Bank examined stress test scenarios (Stress Testing) and assessed their impact on the liquidity position and on the mandatory liquidity ratios. Corporate Governace, Risk & Controls 91 ECB funding was significantly reduced to €3.2 bn at the end of 2018, from €9.7 bn on 31/12/2017, due to the increase in deposits, the return to the interbank repo market, the further deleveraging of the loan portfolio and the participation of the Bank in the EFSF bond exchange program with cash (nominal value €1.5 bn). ELA funding was eliminated in July 2018, from €5.7 bn at the end of 2017. Access to the interbank market with the use of collaterals reached €1.9 bn on 31/12/2018 from €1.5 bn on 31/12/2017. In August 2018, the ECB lifted the waiver for the Greek government bonds that were used as collateral on the interbank repo market. The bank’s Global Covered Bonds Program credit rating was upgraded (BBB low). As a result, €4.0 bn of own-use bonds became eligible for refinancing from the ECB, strengthening the Bank’s liquidity. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was maintained at positive levels, reaching 60% at the end of 2018 (2017: 0%). Along with fully eliminating its ELA exposure, Piraeus Bank maintained an adequate cash reserve on 31.12.2018 for raising liquidity from sources other than the ELA of up to €3.6 bn, while maintaining an additional reserve for ELA funding of €18.3 bn. Market Risk The Market Risk Management unit (MRM) designs, sets and implements the market risk management policies, in accordance with the Group’s RAF, as approved by the BoD, and in compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Market risk refers to the possibility of losses due to a change in the level or volatility of market prices, such as stock prices, interest rates or exchange rates. The Risk Committee of the Bank has approved a market risk management policy that applies to the Bank and outlines the basic definitions of market risk management and defines the roles and responsibilities of the units and executives involved. Piraeus Bank applies generally accepted techniques for measuring market risk, in particular, sensitivity indicators, such as PV100 (adverse impact on the NPV of all balance sheet items for a parallel shift of 100 basis points in the yield curve for all currencies), and Value at Risk (VaR), that incorporates all risk factors. Suitable market risk limits have been established for every activity that bears market risk, and are monitored systematically. Market risk management is not confined to trading book activities, but covers the entire Statement of Financial Position. The VaR measure is an estimate of the potential loss in the net present value (NPV) of a portfolio, over a specified period and within a specified confidence level. The Bank implements the following three (3) methods for calculating VaR: 01. Parametric VaR methodology, assuming weight on recent market observations a one-day holding period and utilising (exponentially weighted moving average a 99% confidence level, with historic volatilities and correlations, λ=0.94). observations of two years and equal 03. Parametric VaR methodology, using weighting between observations. volatilities and correlations gathered 02. Parametric VaR methodology, assuming during a crisis period (Stressed VaR), a one-day holding period and utilising while the estimate is assessed on current a 99% confidence level, placing more positions. 92 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 The variables and the correlation table are calculated on a daily basis. The VaR methodology does not measure risk attributable to extraordinary market conditions, hence the risk assessment process also includes a number of stress test scenarios. The stress scenarios are based on the primary risk factors that may affect the value of the balance sheet’s figures. The Group tests the validity of the VaR estimates, by conducting back-testing on the trading book VaR. On a daily basis, the VaR estimate is measured against the actual change in the value of the portfolio, due to changes in market prices. The VaR estimate for the Group’s trading book and the exponential volatility on 31 December 2018 amounted to €4.38 mn. This estimate consists of €4.47 mn for interest rate risk, €1.17 mn for equity risk, €0.16 mn for foreign exchange risk and zero for commodities risk. By structuring the trading portfolio on 31/12/2018, the VaR estimate is reduced by €1.43 mn due to the diversification effect in the portfolio. VaR ranges at low levels and is in line with the Bank’s RAF. Bank Trading VaR VaR Equity VaR VaR Diversification Amounts Portfolio Interest Rate Foreign Commodity effect in € mn Total VaR Exchange 2018 4.38 4.47 1.17 0.16 0.0 -1.43 2017 11.52 11.45 0.21 0.28 0.0 -0.42 2016 8.03 8.25 0.67 0.54 0.0 -1.43 Piraeus Bank applies an Interest Rate Risk Management Policy and adopts risk assessment techniques based on the Interest Rate Gap Analysis. Interest Rate Gap Analysis allows for the assessment of interest rate risk through the Earnings-at-Risk measure, which expresses the negative impact on projected annual interest rate over a specified period caused by a change in interest rates across all maturities and currencies. Operational Risk The Operational Risk Management unit (ORM) designs, sets and implements its ORM policies, in accordance with the Group’s RAF, as approved by the BoD, and in compliance with all regulatory and supervisory requirements. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, from people or from external events. Piraeus Bank Group recognises its exposure to operational risk and aims for the implementation and constant development of an effective and integrated ORM framework across its operations. The main activities for managing operational risk include: 01. The Risk and Control Self-Assessment 02.

Recovery Credit also monitored the effectiveness of forbearance measures, and the effective application of credit policy and approval processes. In 2018, efforts continued to restructure NPEs for cooperating and viable RBU customers, through a variety of debt restructuring and forbearance measures under the Bankruptcy Code and the complex supervisory environment.

The new product incorporates automated and innovative features, changing the way consumers used to borrow, providing them with an excellent banking experience. Through a simple process, the customer designs the loan that meets his/her own needs, submits his/her application, monitors its progress, signs his/her loan agreement with authorised electronic signature (OTC) and the approved amount is disbursed to his/her account. The whole process is completed at winbank easily and quickly without requiring the customer’s visit to a branch. At the same time, given that loans through affiliate dealers are an important pillar for consumer loan support, particular emphasis was placed on penetrating strategic markets, creating new products and developing core partnerships. Taking advantage of the know-how and experience of the Bank’s executives in these markets, the Bank provides high quality services to its partners and customers. The task of fully redesigning the consumer lending process through its branch network is a milestone. Using automation and the latest technology for credit risk assessment, the Bank aims to improve the quality of services provided to enhance its comparative advantage. In 2019, these improvements will be commercially exploited and expanded to other products and channels, launching a new era in consumer loans. 114 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 In the context of green growth , following its successful participation in the Energy Saving at Home I program, in 2018, Piraeus Bank actively pursued the Energy Saving at Home II program. The Bank, through coordinated marketing activities and with proper planning, received more than 13,000 loan applications, acquiring a 45% share in the project’s funding applications. In addition, Piraeus Bank financed one (1) out of three (3) new mortgages disbursed to the market in 2018, contributing to meeting consumer needs and supporting the economy. The bank will follow up on these targets in 2019. At the same time, taking into account the developments in the property market and the growing customer interest, the Bank is developing models for optimising its lending processes, to further enhance its loan portfolio and to improve customer service. The Bank has transitioned to the new supervisory framework regarding credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property, as set out by Law 4438/2016, and is ready to serve and inform its customers with absolute transparency. Taking advantage of the positive credit market conditions, Piraeus Bank seeks to provide substantial and credible solutions to cover all consumer and housing needs. Implementing its strategic guidelines, the Bank aims to expand its leading shares in these loan categories. In Greece, loan balances at the end of 2018 amounted to €14.5bn for mortgage loans and €3.8bn for consumer loans (excluding credit cards), while the Bank’s market shares at the end of December 2018 stood at 26% and 23%, respectively. Loans and Product Packages and Services for Small Businesses and Professionals In 2018 the Bank’s business objective focused on two (2) key pillars, integrating marketing strategy and developing holistic solutions for Small Businesses and Professionals with a turnover of up to €2.5 mn.

Innovation 03. Speed and automation 02. Modern credit assessment method 04. Reduced operating costs Card Issuing Following the imposition of capital controls, the implementation of Law 4446/2016 on building tax-free income, on the obligation for all businesses to have POS terminals and accept cards in transactions, on the reduced limit for cash transactions, as well as the increased use of digital services, the card market has seen significant growth in recent years. Cardholders have since discovered the benefits of using a card, namely the convenience, security and related reward schemes, and are becoming more familiar with its use for smaller payments, significantly increasing the average number of transactions per card. Nevertheless, the average level of card use in Greece remains below the EU average, which reinforces the expectation for a continued upward trend in card payments. In Greece, the credit card loans’ balances reached €0.9bn at the end of 2018, while the Bank’s market share stood at 29.1%. 2018 was another good year for Piraeus Bank, with remarkable performance in terms of card issuance. Cards in circulation reached 5.2 mn (+7%) and the value of purchase transactions reached €8.5 bn (+20%). At the same time, commission income from cards increased by €5.5 mn (+20%). The Bank also introduced more cards to its customers, while increasing the proportion of customers using their cards for purchases. More than 74 out of 100 Bank customers own at least one debit card. As a result, the Bank managed to maintain its market share in terms of the value of market transactions and consolidate its position as market leader in the Greek card market since 2017. In 2018, for the first time in its history Piraeus Bank was listed among 150 of the largest debit card issuers and 150 largest credit card managers worldwide, based on the ranking of the specialized global edition Nilson Report3 for 2017. At the same time, a great effort was made to rationalise card-related operating costs, through automation and process optimisation, and negotiation of trade agreements with suppliers and strategic partners. At the same time, the Bank focused on updating existing commercial practices, aiming to improve customer experience and service. As far as the development and promotion of new products/services is concerned, important initiatives were carried out to promote the new Business 2 Business (B2B) closed circuit credit card, the development of the new block/unblock service via winbank, and the prepaid-card charging service at the Bank’s ATM network. 116 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Finally, a series of projects related to compliance with the new institutional framework [(Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), General Data Protection Regulation GDPR)] and the Bank’s obligations to the Global Payment Companies (VISA, Mastercard) were implemented. In 2019, aiming to better serve customer needs, the card payment strategy will be enhanced with new products and services. Merchant Acquiring In 2018, in line with its strategic commitment to play a leading role in the growth of the Greek economy and to support professionals and businesses, Piraeus Bank continued to invest in infrastructure and resources to serve the payment network. This, coupled with the shift from cash to plastic in Greece, resulted in Piraeus Bank still being the first choice for merchant acquiring. The Bank offers a full range of services covering the needs of a modern business, and its portfolio includes major organisations, which use e-payments for their main activity. Card transactions increased compared to the previous year (7% in terms of turnover value and 37% in terms of transactions volume), with the Bank maintaining its high market share in the Greek market, serving professionals and businesses. At the end of the year, the Bank recorded a record-breaking network-wide coverage, with more than 226,000 EFT/POS terminals installed in more than 190,000 points of sale. Thus, Piraeus Bank supports card transactions in all types and sizes of businesses in the Greek economy (physical or online stores) operating in Greece and/or abroad. In the field of eCommerce, the Bank retained its leading position in the Greek market transactions, a position it has held for more than a decade. In 2018, transactions through the ePOS Paycenter increased by 25% yoy, and new partnership agreements were signed. One of the Bank’s strategic priorities is the creation of a profitable and sustainable business model; electronic transactions (using cards or other means of payment) are an important source of revenue in the form of fee income and value-added services, such as paying in instalments, Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC), and an opportunity for crossselling to a broad customer base. As a key participant in the payment ecosystem, the Bank remains committed to creating an even more upgraded environment with a high level of service, new capabilities and personalised solutions able to support start-ups and boost business and economic development. e-Payments In 2018, transfers to third party accounts through the Bank’s branch network and digital channels increased in terms of both collaborations and commission income. One in three payments in Greece is made through Piraeus Bank’s channels, demonstrating the customers’ confidence in its payment system. During the year, the number of businesses served by Piraeus Bank in its capacity as Creditor Bank increased by 26% compared to 2017 (including more than 200 organizations in the DIAS Interbank Electronic Payment System). Piraeus Bank assisted businesses in modernising their payment collection processes and laying the foundation for multi-faceted banking co-operation throughout their trading cycle. The total revenue from credit transfers increased by 14%, with the number of credit transfers increasing 9% yoy.

Transactions grew significantly compared to 2017 (77% in terms of turnover value and 71% in terms of payments volume). Bancassurance Products and Insurance Brokerage – Bancassurance Piraeus Bank’s Bancassurance was set up in 2008 to sell bancassurance products through the branch network and the digital channels (contact centre, winbank e-banking platform). In 2018 the Group’s total portfolio under management amounted to €321 mn (gross written premiums), with total gross profits from insurance brokerage activities amounting to €40 mn. Piraeus Bank remained market leader in the Greek bancassurance market, with a 36% market share. With its specialised know-how, innovative products and optimal service quality, the Bank capitalised on its strategic partnerships with insurance companies NN Hellas and ERGO, maximising value for the Bank and its customers. In 2018, the Bancassurance agreement with ERGO Hellas for the exclusive distribution of general insurance products was renewed for ten years, with a further five-year extension possibility. ERGO Hellas has been active in the Greek insurance market for more than 25 years. Munich Re, a global leader in risk management, is its main shareholder. Since 2016, ERGO Hellas is the largest general insurance company in Greece in terms of gross written premiums. The partnership extension confirms the confidence shown by the international insurance company to the Bank and its operations. In 2018, aiming to expand its cross-selling opportunities, the Bank capitalised on its customer base and the dynamics of its Branch Network and its employees. Qualified and certified executives (one of the largest certified Networks) are available at each Bank Branch to help customers understand and choose insurance plans that cover their needs and desires. The platform, designed and developed in collaboration with ERGO, has enabled the Bank to offer customised insurance products per segment (Mass, Afluent, SB, Agri) to meet the needs of its customers. In the course of 2018, six (6) new Life & Health and General Insurance products were introduced, and existing products were enriched. In addition, preparation for harmonisation with the new Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) started in 2018, with the project expected to be completed in 2019, within the set deadline.

Corporate Banking Large Corporates The corporate loan portfolio in Greece, for companies with a turnover exceeding €50 mn stood at €8.4 bn at 31.12.2018. Despite growing competition, the loan portfolio expanded in 2018 through new disbursements to healthy businesses and sustainable investment programs, with emphasis on the tourism industry, wholesale and retail trade, industry and infrastructure. In 2018 the Bank entered successfully into contracts with new customers, mainly in the tourism sector, and extended its cooperation with existing customers with emphasis on import/export financing and other operations, as well as on credit support through letters of guarantee (LGs), projects abroad (construction, infrastructure, energy).

In this context, the customer base was reorganised, with bad debts transferred to specialized units of the Bank (Recovery Business Unit). Despite the intense competition and the limited liquidity, in most sectors of the Greek economy, during 2018 the Bank retained the deposits of Large Corporates’ customers. Moreover, during 2018, Large Corporates also placed emphasis on the further utilization-penetration of the customers’ total portfolios, aiming to strengthen cross-selling and increase revenue from parallel operations, setting common goals with the Bank’s product units.

Shipping Finance Piraeus Bank has maintained a steady presence in shipping finance for a number of years, offering a wide and comprehensive range of financial services to Greek shipping companies. The balance of funding in this category stood at €1.4 bn at 31/12/2018. Shipping Finance finances the purchase of second-hand vessels of the main shipping sectors (dry bulk, tankers and, to a smaller extent, containers), offers comprehensive services to cover the specialised operating needs of shipping companies (issuance of Letters of Guarantee, working capital financing, cash management, e-banking, currency conversions). At the same time, the Shipping Finance develops additional services and promotes the Bank’s entire product portfolio. After the stabilisation at a reasonable level in 2017, conditions improved further for the dry bulk market in 2018, with positive developments in the supply-demand balance leading to a relative increase in ship revenue and their values. The dry bulk market’s fundamentals are looking good for 2019, indicating an overall balanced outlook for the supply-demand dynamic. Important geopolitical developments are expected to affect the industry in 2019, such as the outcome of the US-China trade negotiations, and China’s overall high growth rate. On the contrary, the tanker market deteriorated further in 2018 –compared with an already weak 2017– in terms of revenues and values, heavily influenced by the reduction in transport activity. The reduction in transport activity originated mainly from the reduction in oil production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), from the significant shale oil production by traditional consumers, and from the delivery of many new-built vessels from shipyards. Optimism about the future stems from the improvement observed in the last 3 months of 2018, due to the gradual restoration of the supply-demand balance, which is expected to continue in 2019. 120 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 In this context, the Bank’s approach remains conservative, focusing on the optimal management of the existing portfolio, and on improving its quality, by providing targeted new financing. Shipping Finance key strategy includes pooling the portfolio of selected and acclaimed customers, attracting and preserving deposits, and developing collateral operations. Real Estate Finance Recognising the growing dynamics in the Real Estate market, in 2018 the Bank created a Real Estate Finance unit to provide its customers with Commercial Real Estate Investment and Development Finance. Capitalising on its know-how, customer network and knowledge of the domestic real estate market, the Bank intensified its operations in the sector, participating in significant financing projects, picking up a significant share of that market. Particular attention was paid to strengthening professional relations with existing customers and to developing new relationships with domestic and foreign real estate investors, aiming at the qualitative expansion of its customer base and at the balanced development of its loan portfolio. More specifically, the activities focused on supporting both institutional investors, such as Real Estate Investment Companies (REICs), as well as eminent real estate developers, mainly hotel and office buildings. In 2018, the Bank provided significant financing to REICs for their investment activities, such as the credit lines provided to NBG Pangaea REIC (€120 mn), Grivalia Properties REIC (€75 mn) and Trastor REIC (€24 mn). The primary focus of the Real Estate Finance strategy is to create added value for the Bank and its customers through the provision of high-level, specialised services and funding in the field. Given the expected growth in investment activity and real estate development projects, the Bank continues to pursue the expansion of its real estate finance portfolio and to support a key sector of the economy, such as Real Estate. Loan Syndications The Loan Syndications Unit (LSU) is the central unit of Piraeus Bank, which serves the entire Syndicated Loan Portfolio, covering all of the business loan units. LSU aims to create added value through organising, structuring and monitoring syndicated loans and to act as Agent Bank. Piraeus Bank has been undertaking the role of lead arranger and agent for corporate syndicated bond loans, structured financing for infrastructure and energy projects, convertible bond loans, debt restructuring and merger and acquisition financing, over the last four years, between 2015 and 2018. In 2018, through the LSU, Piraeus Bank participated in most transactions in the Greek syndicated loan market, acting as Coordinator or Mandated Lead Arranger (MLA) in 19 syndicated loans, with transaction volumes reaching €3.4 bn, contributing significantly to the Bank’s income from commissions and from parallel operations. Piraeus Bank Group Business 121 In 2018 the LSU strengthened its international presence. Piraeus Bank was appointed as the Onshore Account Bank in Greece of the syndicated financing scheme for the construction of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline-TAP. Piraeus Bank is the only Greek bank to be actively involved in the syndicated facilities scheme. TAP project financing –one of the most important European infrastructure projects– amounted to €3.9 bn and was provided by a group of 17 commercial banks, alongside with the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The aforementioned projects affirm Piraeus Bank’s prominent role in supporting strategic energy and infrastructure projects that contribute to Greece’ s opportunities for development and economic growth. Transaction Banking Aware of the great challenges faced by SMEs and Large Corporates in a complex and demanding economic environment, Piraeus Bank created the Transactional Banking unit in 2016. The aim was to collect and provide a comprehensive package of products and services to cover the daily banking needs of the specific customer base, previously fragmented into different units of the Bank. Transactional Banking provides holistic support to the business needs of corporate customers through a comprehensive package offering high value-added products, including payments and collections, cash management, trade finance, supply chain, and factoring services. The unit aims to be the only point of communication between corporate customers and the Bank, covering all their commercial needs and providing a high level of service through a flexible and personalised model. During its first two years of operation, targeted initiatives have been carried out to promote, improve and create new products, resulting in a cumulative increase of 20% in commission income (11% per annum) from Transactional Banking products and services, contributing significantly to the Bank’s profitability. In line with the Bank’s strategic priority to increase efficiency through digitisation and use of new technologies, in 2018 Transactional Banking placed emphasis on promoting electronic transactions and payment channels, resulting in an increase of 9% compared to 2017. At the same time Transactional Banking works in the direction of digital transformation of all the services offered. Moreover, in line with the Bank’s broader strategy to support export-oriented Greek enterprises, Transactional Banking successfully promoted trade tools, building on its partnerships with EIB and EBRD. Financing was also provided to companies in the importing sector. In 2018 €250 mn were disbursed for facilitating imports and international letters of guarantee. Commercial Banking For almost two decades Piraeus Bank has been offering banking products and services to Greek SMEs, always one of its business plan’s key priorities. Currently, 13 specialised Business Centres offer their services across the country to SMEs with an annual turnover between €2.5 mn and €50 mn, operating in all sectors of the economy. 122 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Historically, Piraeus Bank has a well-established and significant presence in Commercial Banking, using a customer-centric approach in its growth model, and implementing a profitable and sustainable business model. Maintaining a leading position in the financing of SMEs (Working Capital, investment loans, Leasing/Factoring), and focusing on cross-selling opportunities, and low or zerorisk fee-generating activities, Piraeus Bank is the main bank for a large number of SMEs, doing business with more than 85% of SMEs in Greece. The balance of SMEs financing in Greece stood at €5.8 bn, including €1.6 bn of the seasonal loan OPEKEPE, which was repaid in February 2019. After the prolonged recession in Greece that affected the growth of SMEs, the Greek economy is showing signs of recovery. This is reflected in the results of Piraeus Bank’s Commercial Banking, which plays a leading role in the restart and growth of the Greek economy. In this framework, Piraeus Bank, building on the trust of large international organisations such as EIB, EIF, EBRD and extending its cooperation with them, draws funds to provide liquidity to the SME market through modern financing tools (e.g. Covered Bond issuance, COSME Loan Guarantee Facility, etc.). In 2018 Piraeus Bank’s total disbursements to SMEs exceeded €1 bn, with a significant percentage of these made available through the aforementioned financing tools. An element that suggests the Bank’s opening towards the SME market is the number of new borrowers, which amounted to 480 with new credit limits >€250 mn. There was also a further increase in commissions of 6%, mainly (>90%) from low-risk products. Finally, the average product/customer index is stabilised at 6 products per customer. The target for 2019 is that SME financing to continue at an even faster pace. The aforementioned, combined with the harmonisation of specific credit standards and targeting better loan-quality control, are signs of improvement and a sample of the Bank’s transformation, which aims firstly to reduce risks and, secondly, to increase its deposits and revenues.

The Bank monitors changes in the external environment, market trends and customer requirements and provides farmers with the means of production they need, offering targeted financing.

In particular, Piraeus Bank Contract Farming The Contract Farming program run by Piraeus Bank since 2013 is a contemporary initiative launched as part of the Bank’s wider strategy to support and modernise the agro-food industry, a key pillar of the Greek economy. The Bank then expanded its contract farming program to include Livestock Farming and Fishing. This is a financing model that creates the conditions for the efficient operation of the value chains of agricultural products and food. The Farming and Livestock Farming program supports the production of quality products through funding for the first part of the agro-food chain, for the purchase of production machinery, raw materials and primary production. The program, in the context of a controlled mechanism providing targeted liquidity to commercial/manufacturing enterprises, cooperatives and individual farmers/producers, contributes to the rationalisation and efficient operation of farms, to the development and extroversion of processing plants, to the creation of synergies for the parties involved, to the modernisation of the trading circuit and to the creation of an extended network of retailers encourages the development of local markets. Over the course of the program, the number of participating commercial enterprises/cooperatives/producer groups and individual producers from all over the country has increased significantly and the range of financed products and sectors has expanded. The above elements mark the program’s dynamics and its substantial contribution to the country’s agricultural sector. Through its successful implementation the program contributes to the growth and export activity of Greek enterprises, to the stimulation of employment in the country’s rural areas, to enhancing the sustainability of sectors of the rural economy. 124 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 The Bank has made an important contribution to maintaining the country’s social web in remote island regions, and to utilising its natural wealth. In 2018 the Bank expanded its partnerships in the Contract Banking for Hotels program, which links hotel units and food suppliers, offering mutual benefits to both parties, establishing strong partnerships and promoting Greek agricultural products to tourists who visit our country. With the Contract Banking for Hotels program the Bank offers working capital to hotels to procure branded certified products from businesses and cooperatives registered with the Contract Farming and Livestock Program. In addition, in 2018 through the Contract Banking Agricultural Inputs program the Bank provided working capital to agricultural supply stores, in order to help reduce the cost of production of agricultural products. The Bank’s ultimate objective is to ensure the rational operation of the market and the fair distribution of the benefits to all its participants, from the producer to the company. Finally, in 2018 the Bank continued offering the Contract Banking for Retailers program. In particular, the Bank financially supports retail businesses so that they can buy on better terms from suppliers/companies who participate in the Contract Farming and Livestock Program. The Bank’s initiative aims at developing a new model linking retailers and suppliers, so as to create stable relations of cooperation and synergies, to rationalise the pricing process, and to create and promote competitive Greek agricultural products of high quality standards. Support to Agricultural Bodies Focused on serving the Agricultural Sector, Agricultural Cooperatives and Agricultural Business Agencies, Piraeus Bank continued to provide a wide range of high quality and value-adding products, services and transactions for the agricultural segment in 2018.

The certification was renewed in 2018, satisfying the quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria set at the inspection by the competent body, proving that the Bank maintains a leading position in the business. The same certification was also renewed for the payment service of the Early Retirement Program for Farmers, which the Bank manages on behalf of the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Food. In 2018, the Bank successfully carried out a significant number of payments to support the agricultural sector in the country, concerning financial support through Pillars I and II of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the year. The largest amounts were disbursed to finance basic and green business, and initiatives related to the setting-up of young farmers, to the modernisation of farms, to the transition to organic farming, to agro-environmental aid, etc. In particular, in 2018 total EU and State aid payments made to the agricultural sector amounted to a total of €2.7 bn.

Piraeus Legacy Unit Restructurings and Troubled Assets Management The management of the Bank’s troubled portfolio remains one of the major pillars of the Bank’s strategic plan.

The changes were implemented following a review conducted by an external consultant during the previous year, commissioned by the Bank to study its operational model and to identify areas for improvement. At the same time, new products were developed for managing loans in arrears; enhancing management policy for retail exposures. More specifically, as part of the ongoing investment in innovative projects for viable solutions, strong forbearance measures were developed, combining restructuring policy with the potential for collateral liquidation, given consistent and prudent use of write-offs. In 2018, emphasis was placed on the development of specific tools standardising the process for assessing borrowers’ financial standing, thus facilitating the search for the most suitable restructuring measures or accelerating legal action in cases of non-cooperating, unsustainable borrowers. The Bank continued participating and actively supporting the new interbank platform for Out of Court Workouts (OCW) a strategic project whose success will contribute to the consolidation of viable businesses. Responding to the requirements of the new legal framework for auctions, RBU Management Units have timely adjusted their internal processes and joined the online auction platform, participating in electronic auctions from the very beginning, ranking first among the four systemic banks with over 3,000 auctions. Piraeus Bank Group Business 137 Managing the NPE portfolio included non-organic initiatives, such as loan sales and forming strategic alliances with specialised servicers. Specifically, in the context of strategies to reduce NPEs and to protect the sustainability of SMEs, in order to revive the Greek economy, the Bank, along with the other three systemic banks, entered into an internationally innovative servicing agreement with a credit institution specialised in servicing NPLs, doBank SpA (doBank). doBank will support the four systemic Banks in the exclusive management of common NPEs of more than 300 Greek SMEs with a nominal value of €1.8 bn, by facilitating the effective search for viable restructuring solutions when feasible. This cooperation, considering doBank’s significant experience and know-how, is expected to substantially contribute to the resolution of SMEs and the improvement of the recoverability of their debts. In addition, in collaboration with other main units of the Bank, the RBU has improved and automated even further the model for target-setting and forecasting the evolution of NPEs over the period 2018-2021, in line with the guidelines provided by the ECB’s SSM to all Greek Banks, and the implementation of IFRS 9. A new mechanism calibrating the NPE operational targets was developed with the assistance of a specialised consultant, taking into account macroeconomic assumptions, risk indicators and specific actions envisaged in the strategy for each portfolio segment. This target-setting was accompanied by RBU’s detailed strategy and management methodology, which is the guide for the RBU teams. Taking advantage of the continuous improvements in its operating model, the Bank achieved its key financial targets for a second consecutive year, creating a clear path for achieving its official targets by the end of 2021. In particular, the Non-Core Business & Restructuring Portfolio unit exceeded its 2018 targets for SSM, implementing total restructurings of €7.5 bn, and reducing NPLs and NPEs by €3 bn and €5 bn, respectively. Forbearance and Restructuring Policy The Group adopted the Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) of the European Banking Authority (EBA) on supervisory reporting on forbearance and NPEs, in compliance with regulatory requirements of BoG Executive Committee Act No. 42/30.05.2014 on the Supervisory framework for the management of exposures in arrears and non-performing exposures . The Group’s restructuring policy is fully aligned with the relevant EBA definitions and BoG guidelines. New structures and processes were created, new information systems were developed and existing applications were modified. Focusing on sustainable restructuring solutions and monitoring the effectiveness of various types of forbearance, the Group aims at the effective and reliable management of loans in arrears. Forborne loans are all loans for which a conversion of the original contractual terms and conditions or refinancing of the borrower’s debt on more favorable terms due to current or expected financial difficulties has been done and are not applicable to borrowers of similar risk profile. According to EBA technical standards, in order for the forborne flag to be removed, all the relevant criteria of the regulation must be met, including the minimum required probation period (at least 2 years from the date of classification as performing exposure). Forborne loans are assessed for impairment either individually or collectively, in accordance with the Bank’s impairment policy. 138 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 The Recovery Banking Unit (RBU) manages the past due loans, aiming to find the optimal sustainable restructuring solution for each borrower, to ensure fair treatment of all borrowers and to maximise value for the Group. Customer-driven models are used towards this goal, such as decision trees , pilot measurements and assessment of results on selected portfolio samples, and appropriate processes and types of restructurings are applied according to the number of days past due and the risk undertaken. The Supervisory & NPL Management Council, which among other things, is responsible for providing strategic guidance and monitoring past due loans management, collaborates with the GRM to arrive at a common understanding and to develop the appropriate methodology to assess the risk of the RBU portfolio. The GRM Committee is updated at least once per month on the evolution of the RBU portfolio. It monitors the evolution of each portfolio, independently and with respect to the Bank’s obligations towards SSM and the HFSF, and the effectiveness of the RBU.

Risk Assessment In the framework of the Security Framework, and as a prerequisite for ISO 27001/2013 and PCI DSS/v3.2.1 certifications, an annual risk assessment of the Bank’s IT resources is carried out. A specialised methodology based on internationally recognised practices and methodologies is used. The methodology is in line with the Risk Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) conducted by the Operational Risk Management Unit. Employee training in IT Security Aiming to minimise internal risks and to fulfil the prerequisites for ISO 27001 and PCI DSS certifications, seminars were organised throughout the year to train the Bank’s staff on information security issues. The seminars were held in the Bank’s Central Buildings and Auditoriums in Athens. Participating employees learned about the concepts of cyber-security, cyber-threats and cyber-attacks so that they can deal with them in the working environment. In addition, a special seminar entitled Take care Be security @ware was organised for the children of the Group employees and the children from the SOS villages. Central Operations The purpose of the unit is to provide high quality services to its internal and external customers combined with a commitment for more efficient management of available resources. The above are achieved through the best possible organisation of daily tasks, the optimal utilisation of employees, shortening the time for processing requests, and finally the revision-optimisation of processes and technological infrastructure where this is necessary. In 2018, the unit carried out increased volumes of transactions across its operations, excluding confiscations, where there was a decrease due to the targeted sending of e-confiscations by the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR). Indicative initiatives implemented during the year concerned the following: 01. Support for the Out-of-Court Work Out Office (DGO) regarding correction of Mechanism (OCW), by checking and customers with loans in arrears. identifying customer codes. 03. Redesign the confiscations management 02. Support for the Group’s Data Governance application (work in progress). In June 2018, Central Administration Units were set up to carry out administrative work on a centralised basis, aiming to make a positive contribution to Bank projects such as Data Governance, Commercial Remittance, etc. and cost savings from tasks that had been outsourced for several years. Piraeus Bank Group Business 151 Cash Management Piraeus Bank is the leading bank in Greece in the provision of cash and securities management services, providing high quality services to businesses and individuals who trust the Bank’s credibility for managing their cash. At the same time, Piraeus Bank is the main specialised provider and forex trader in the Greek market, and is the only commercial bank in the country specialising in Gold Bars & Sovereigns. Cash Centres Given that the Bank has an expanded network for executing cash transactions (Branches, ATMs, APS, e-Branches, Deposit Devices), the optimal management of the cash cycle is crucial. A central role in managing the cash cycle is played by the five Cash Centres operated by the Bank, which in 2018 managed over 66% of the cash needs of the branches and ATMs and 69% of the cash of Corporate Clients. The results of the Cash Centres were also impressive compared to 2017. The average fund balances dropped by 13%, while the recycling and direct recirculation rates of the notes reached 54% of inflows, contributing to a spectacular 38% drop in money transfer costs compared to the previous year. Total Money Transfer Costs The results of the effort to optimise the overall cash management of the Branch Network and off-site ATMs were impressive. In 2018, the total cost of money transfers charged to the Bank for the needs of its Networks declined by 17%. The reduction in costs is of particular value since it was achieved without a proportional burden on the amount of standing money, which at branch level showed a marginal increase of 1% and at Bank level a 6% increase. Automation of Cash Centres The Bank invested in cash management automation and reducing the high cost of cash management. In 2018 the technological upgrade of the Cash Centres started. Coinage management is already fully automated, with the production capacity of the space up 70% and the management costs down by 43%. The automation of operations is extending to the management of banknotes. Piraeus Bank, the only cash management institution in Greece using the Vault Management System to track the processing stages of individual transactions, is the first financial institution in Greece to introduce complete and automatic banknote processing using Header Card technology. Header Card technology coupled with top cash management systems automates even more the production process of banknote handling, delivering unique quality and reliability, and lowering the cost of centralised management by more than 33%. The banknote management automation project is expected to be fully implemented during the first half of 2019. Funds Transfer In 2018 the increase in the results for Funds Transfer was significant, in terms of business and revenue, recording an increase of 5% and 7% respectively compared to 2017. Recognising the needs of its customers in Funds Transfer and with a view to creating sustainable value for them, Piraeus Bank added another possibility, by developing a new service, Commercial Remittance . This new service concerns the ability to send a wire transfer abroad for the purpose of trading via winbank e-banking, enabling the customer to easily 152 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 and quickly manage the business payments that require approval under the capital control framework, submitting a request online and attaching the supporting documents, something which required his/her physical presence in a branch until recently. A pioneer in innovative services and products, Piraeus Bank has confirmed its active role in the global banking community by embracing Swift’s Global Payments Innovations (GPI) platform, a modern service allowing continuous, uninterrupted and unobstructed tracking of the transaction at all stages, faster payment execution and immediate availability to the beneficiary. At the same time, Piraeus Bank is the first Bank in Greece to offer this service, by exchanging GPI payments in cooperation with the world’s largest banks. It also participates in the design and implementation of a new GPI added-value service, the GPI pre-validation service along with 14 other global banks around the world. At the operational level, optimisation and service upgrades have been completed with automated processes and complete IT systems. As a result of this successful effort, the degree of automation of the Funds Transfer operations exceeded 96%. Finally, the increase in the use of electronic means over traditional remittances compared to 2017 was remarkable. In particular, electronic transactions reached 91%, compared with 87% in 2017, with 48% of the total fees from electronic channels compared to 40% in 2017. 2019 Key Targets 01. Increase penetration of Retail and Small 03. Adopt new payment technologies, such Business and Professionals. as pan-European instant payments and 02.

Custody Services In 2018, Custody Services focused on providing the full range of post-trading services to its institutional and retail clients, in line with its strategic direction. By combining market knowledge, years of experience and know-how and following the latest trends in financial markets and the regulatory changes, Custody Services continues to support its institutional customers responsibly and actively, in such a way that the services offered are affordable and innovative, and upgrade their daily activities. Improving operational efficiency by automating systems, reviewing processes, minimising the risk of mistakes and reducing management costs were a priority throughout the year. The significant investment in training Custodian executives, the flexibility, adaptability and active response to the challenges, have resulted in the best possible service to institutional and private customers in the environment of investment constraints. The dedication to the provision of high quality products and services for yet another year was sealed with the international Custody Services award received by the Bank, winning the first Global Excellence Award in Relationship Management & Client Service awarded by the Global Custodian international organization. Piraeus Bank is the only Bank to receive the award for two years in a row. Numerous international banks participated in the evaluation process, while the rankings came from the responses of 7,000 institutional customers to relevant questionnaires drawn up by the organisation. Piraeus Bank Group Business 153 This award is the acknowledgment of Piraeus Bank’s commitment to the high quality of its Custody & Securities Services and the ability to create and cultivate long-term relationships with customers both domestically and internationally. Piraeus Bank Custody Services is committed to providing high quality services, with a primary focus on seeking a trust-based partnership. The satisfaction of the multidimensional needs of modern investors requires specialised solutions offered by Piraeus Bank while contributing to the modernisation of the Greek banking system in the capital market.

All of the above actions are part of the Group’s strategy with Group Credit to continue offering excellent customer service, acting as custodian of collateral for credit, and monitoring securitised/assigned portfolios to safeguard their terms and conditions. Organisation, Central Support & Operation Quality Group Organisation & Operation Quality, consistent with supporting initiatives to develop and offer innovative products and value-added services to customers, is geared towards optimising operations and enhancing efficiency. In 2018, fully aligned with the Bank’s strategic objectives, Group Organisation & Operation Quality focused on projects and supported initiatives in the following fields: 01. Compliance with regulatory and supervisory availability of infrastructure and detailed obligations and adaptation of the operating processes for effective data governance. framework for implementation of the new 04. Strengthening the framework for risk rules. monitoring and auditing by systematically 02. Optimising, automating and simplifying the recording and updating processes processes to enhance performance and and recording specifications for the reduce operating costs. implementation of systemic interventions. 03. Ensuring the quality, completeness and Automation and IT support of operations In August 2018, the payment order functionalities were included in the e-signature service across the Branch network, contributing to the reduction of printouts, the reduction of the corresponding customer service time and freeing the branch from administrative work. The effort to integrate existing and new products and services into the e-signature service will continue throughout 2019 further enhancing the benefits of using new technologies in day-to-day operations. In the context of reaching out to the Bank’s broad customer base, with regard to investment services offered, innovative investment proposals were created through the creation of Optimum Portfolios and the new Investments Online System (IOS) digital platform. The Group Organisation & Operation Quality systematically supported the effort and participated in the implementation of the Investment Products & Services project by recording operational specifications to support new investment portfolios, to perform tests on their functionality, and Piraeus Bank Group Business 155 to document the relevant processes. In 2019, the Group Organisation & Operation Quality will continue to support this initiative by looking into the possibilities of expanding the functions and services provided. In order to support the implementation of the Bank’s credit policy rules, an automatic mechanism for sending orders for real estate appraisals to Piraeus Real Estate has been created. In addition, the introduction of new input fields in the Real Estate Management System (REMS), such as the Property Marketability Index (PMI), improves the decision-making process of the PLU with regard to loan restructurings. The development of new automated processes, making use of the Appian platform, was an important priority in 2018, covering a wide range of banking operations, with the number of requests served amounting to almost 1.5 mn requests for platform-integrated processes. As part of enhancing operational risk recording and monitoring infrastructure, six new risk incidents were included in Appian, contributing to an increase in the percentage of risk incidents and loss events tracked by automated flows to 72%, compared with 30% in 2017. The design and implementation of workflows bots for monitoring additional categories of risk incidents and loss events is underway. Supporting the efforts of business units to upgrade products and services, the automated Merchant Acquiring Management process was enriched with new functionalities. The service experience was improved by integrating, in the current workflow bot, innovative services (e-signature) and the ability to electronically monitor the Branch’s inventory of POS devices. In the same direction, a series of actions were implemented and the infrastructure was created for the automatic reception of requests for changes to credit, prepaid and debit cards, and for the automatic request processing for specific types of changes with the possibility of immediate online execution. These automations improve customer service, reduce the Bank’s operating costs, and provide the option of monitoring the progress and timing of requests regardless of channel (Branch, Call Centre). In 2018, the Unit completed its business analysis and recording the specifications for the automatic processing of additional legal work, including the underwriting of corporate loans, real estate research, the retraction or cancellation of an underwriting agreement in support of a loan, and the handling of legal assistance claims from the Loan Restructuring Unit. In the framework of more effective credit risk monitoring and management and compliance with the regulatory and supervisory framework, an appropriate infrastructure was developed in the LOS for the early recognition and effective monitoring of the Unlikeliness-to-Pay for business loans or business credit exposures and their respective predicted classification. Geared towards the efficient management of the arrears portfolio, specifications for an automated workflows bot have been created for processing arrears-related requests through the LOS system, with significant benefits, including the reduction in operating costs and request-servicing time, and the improvement in controlling the associated operational risks. In 2018, aiming for the continuous improvement of corporate customer credit rating models, a new feature was introduced into the LOS system, through the creation of a Specialised Lending Scorecard for Project Finance loans, using best international practices and the Internal Rating Based Approach. 156 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Improvements to Processes and Operations New infrastructure was developed and the necessary processes were created for immediate delivery of POS terminals to businesses at the Branch. The Bank once again contributes, inter alia, to the efforts of professionals to remain consistent with their regulatory obligations, by enriching its services. As part of the Bank’s harmonisation with the new requirements set by Law 4465/2017 (Payment Accounts Directive) for payment accounts, a new form entitled Fee Information Document was prepared, common for all banks, which as of 1 November 2018 is handed to natural persons when opening a new payment account, for the purpose of informing customers about the fees for using the main services linked to the payment account. In 2018, Group Organisation continued monitoring and coordinating the project for ensuring the Group’s compliance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR). Several projects were carried out to collectively inform customers about the changes in the implementation of MiFID II/MiFIR, to redraft the contract agreements and the customer suitability and appropriateness assessment questionnaire, and to start replacing all customer contracts. Additionally, the process of reclassifying professionals and eligible counterparties was concluded, a product approval process for each financial instrument was set in place, identifying the target market for each product, with an upgrade of the Trade & Transaction Reporting infrastructure. In 2018 all the actions required to meet the requirements of the regulation on Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance Products (PRIIPs) were finalised, the new Key Information Document (KID) for PRIIPs was introduced and the pre-contractual information requirements were included in the processes. In order to improve process efficiency and reduce operating costs, employees now have the ability to instantly digitise the certification documents presented by the customer at the Branch. The new functionality is currently piloted at selected Network Branches, simplifying their operations and improving customer service. In the context of attracting and developing the relationship with new clients-natural persons (Individuals & Individuals Enterprises), product package functionality (Deposit Account, Debit Card, winbank, Yellow Loyalty Program) has been developed. Through this implementation, the Bank seeks to meet the needs of these customers and to become their main bank by offering them the basic products with a simplified start-up process and consolidated contract documents. In view of providing improved services to specific categories of individuals, the required functionality has been developed and the interventions required to support the service of visually impaired people have been developed. In this context, the debit card may be issued and canceled/re-issued through the Bank’s Branch Network, while their registration in the online banking service winbank may alternatively take place without requiring attendance at the branch, provided they have the appropriate voice support equipment on their electronic device. Additionally, in order to support the monitoring and controlling of their transactions, the Notification Service is available now, as far as the cash transactions are concerned. They are enabled to complete the transactions without the need for witnesses to be involved, as they are informed by the sound alerts they receive on their mobile phones of the transactions in order to verify their correctness. Piraeus Bank Group Business 157 In line with the Bank’s strategic priorities to reduce NPLs and NPEs to internationally accepted levels, in 2018 Group Organisation actively participated in all phases of preparation for the sale of loan portfolios, to ensure that the content of the loan files was complete. At the same time, Group Organisation co-ordinated the digitisation and delivery of the physical file to investors/buyers, the transmission of customer data, loans and guarantees and completed the necessary actions for implementing the agreements. In line with the Bank’s strategy to reduce bad debts and to satisfy the terms for the implementation of the agreement between the four Greek systemic banks and doBank S.p.A. for the management of a portfolio of NPEs with a value of €1.8 bn, Group Organisation is contributing to the completion of the necessary preparatory work by participating in the relevant Interbank Committee and supports the attempt to adopt standardised methodologies, to form an interbank operating model, to exchange files with common design and creating a payment circuit. At the same time, the Group Organisation coordinates the creation of the internal operating model, records the specifications for adaptation, performs tests on good operating system performance (internal and interbank) and formulates the detailed instructions for informing the involved Units. With the establishment of the new Group Procurement Unit and to ensure a smooth transition to the new operating model and its reinforcement, Group Organisation coordinates the review of the overall framework of basic principles and rules governing procurement management and the updating of existing and setting up new procedures. In 2018 work continued on the creation of a central database covering the Bank’s entire loan portfolio. All insurance contracts will be kept and monitored with the possibility of linking them to a loan contract, loan account, mortgage or another collateral, to optimise the overall process and to strengthen the mechanism for their systematic monitoring. With a view to improved and faster customer service, the Bank promotes the implementation of mechanisms for monitoring the performance of its main processes and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between the units involved. Against this background, it has also included the lending processes for the agricultural sector through the implementation of reports that monitor the execution times, both per stage and on a cumulative basis. At the same time, the Bank has launched the implementation of the mechanism in the process of servicing requests for changes of cards, loan restructuring, as well as loans to small businesses. Implementation of the supervisory framework and support for regulatory and operational reporting In its implementation of the GDPR, the Bank changed the rules for processing of personal data and notified its customers/natural persons of these changes. Group Organisation initiated a project for identifying and assessing the Bank’s affected operations, in cooperation with the other units, to assess the relevant impact and to identify the required changes, in terms of operations and service. In this context, Group Organisation, in cooperation with the relevant units, has ensured the timely adaptation of processes, systems and other documents in order to incorporate to its operations the provisions of the new Regulation, to strengthen the framework for the collection and processing of the Personal Data of the data subjects. Group Organisation has undertaken the management and co-ordination of the project on automatic data exporting for calculating the funds that the Bank has to pay to the Bank of 158 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Greece under Law 128 on the contribution. The purpose of the project is to redefine the calculation methodology in order to rationalise the Bank’s expense for this obligation. Part of the project pertains to the recalculation of the funds that were paid by the Bank in previous periods (2009-2014) and the return of funds from the BoG, if required. During the first phase of the project, for the period 2016-2018, the BoG returned to the Bank, upon submission of its detailed request, a significant amount as unduly paid, which substantially strengthened the results and the Bank’s capital in 2018. In 2018, Group Organisation undertook the revision of the operational specifications and the coordination of the work related to the First Stage of Review by the Hellenic Deposit and Investment Guarantee Fund (TEKE) of Single Customer View files (SCV). At the same time, Group Organisation successfully coordinated the Stress Test conducted by the BoG and TEKE at the end of 2018 to assess the Bank’s readiness for timely and valid submission of requested data. In addition, Group Organisation participates in the expansion of the Ministry of Finance’s Bank Accounts Registry (Phase Three), currently in progress, which concerns the automatic transmission of bank customer loan transactions. Group Organisation also undertook the revision of the operational specifications and the coordination of work related to sending loan restructurings details to Tiresias S.A. In order to comply with the supervisory obligations and to meet the revised supervisory reporting requirements (e.g. SRB, ECB, BoG), Group Organisation updated the operational specifications for extracting the required information and reporting in accordance with the revised instructions sent by the supervisory bodies. New Products/Services and Payment Transactions As part of the initiatives for emphasising the importance of savings, Group Organisation contributed to the development of new savings proposals and innovative savings services, aiming to make them available through the Branch Network and winbank e-banking. Group Organisation also participated in the development of new operations for the promotion new deposit and time deposit products. Fully aligned with the Bank’s goal of providing new and innovative services, Group Organisation contributed to the creation of a new pioneering feature, available via winbank e-banking, offering personal financial management solutions. Customers have the ability to control and program monthly spending and to achieve personal savings goals. For payment services and transactions, new transactions were developed for more than 300 new partnerships and the Easypay Point Direct service was expanded to 313 new merchants. In addition, the infrastructure was created for extending the DCT Online payment service to the Easypay kiosks (APS), and the range of transactions available at the Bank’s ATMs was enriched, expanding customers available services through alternative channels. In the context of attracting and developing the transactional relationship with new customers, natural persons can now buy and sell Gold Sovereigns and Gold Bars. Customers can buy Gold Sovereigns and Gold Bars at all Piraeus Bank branches, while customers can only sell Gold Sovereigns and Gold Bars at Piraeus Gold spots, which have been created for the time being in Athens and Heraklion, Crete. Piraeus Bank Group Business 159 In an effort to increase market share and Trade Finance services, Group Organisation actively participated in recording the specifications and processes, in system customisation and in performance audits to support Trade Finance products, such as the early payment of letters of credit available through the Branch Network of the Bank in Greece and the Frankfurt Branch. Data Governance Aiming to enhance the value of data as Group assets, through the promotion of new capabilities to improve their quality, all the Bank’s data areas are gradually assessed and a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are defined to capture the level of quality of Critical Data Elements (CDEs), and to systematically monitor any changes. In 2018, a set of revised rules, policies and procedures for data governance was introduced, ensuring the alignment of Bank practices with the relevant regulatory framework. In terms of customer data, the analysis of the information has been completed and 31 KPIs have been implemented. In terms of collateral data, the analysis has been carried out at 80%, 14 KPIs are in use and 12 are under implementation. Analysis of the loan data area has been completed at 50% with 13 KPIs in use and 3 under development. Geared towards data optimisation, the analysis of data on limits and contracts has started. In 2019 an action plan analysing 4 new data areas will be implemented. ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 5 ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 5 165 Customers Customer Relation Piraeus Bank, the leading bank in Greece in terms of deposit and loan market shares, as well as number of branches and personnel, participates actively and dynamically in the improvement and development of the economy, contributing to the prosperity of both its customers and the communities in which it is active. With a vision of being the most trustworthy bank in Greece, Piraeus Bank aims to create long-term value for its customers in response to their needs and always takes into account the economic, social and environmental factors. Providing qualitative services to customers remains a top priority for Piraeus Bank. The relationship of trust is based on clear information, governed by transparency in terms of co-operation, and enhanced by the security of transactions across all service channels, including digital channels. The Bank has introduced specialised control mechanisms at every stage of creation, promotion and placement of its products and services, thus ensuring compliance with the principles of the regulatory framework and the rules of the HBA’s Code of Banking Ethics. In order to eliminate any possibility of exploiting the public’s ignorance, inexperience or fears, the Group ensures that its products and services are clearly defined, without exaggerations, inaccurate or misleading statements, excessive promotion or attempts to conceal any features. The contribution of the Marketing and Advertising Committee and the 166 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Group’s Compliance unit is invaluable, the former for assessing and approving the content and style of the campaign and the latter for ensuring that the content of each campaign is in full compliance with the regulatory framework. In addition, the Bank’s customer service takes measures to enhance its customers’ financial literacy. Banking terminology and business are explained, so as to facilitate customer access to the Bank’s services. Particular emphasis is placed on informing and educating customers on the use of new technologies and the digital service channels. New technologies have changed the way of doing business and e-banking transactions now constitute a significant percentage of total transactions. In 2018, the Bank continued promoting its technologically-advanced service model; Bank employees use digital devices and free wifi access in the branches, to show customers how to use e-banking. Bank employees assist customers in familiarising themselves with the ATM machines and easypay kiosks, the e-branches, winbank web, mobile and phone banking and their applications. Piraeus Bank places great emphasis on Retail Banking customer experience. A specialised team has been formed to assess, record and measure customer experience, satisfaction and loyalty to Retail Banking products and services, aiming to improve banking operations. Customers are contacted within 48 hours from their bank transactions, to ensure that the experience is as recent as possible. Some of the metrics used to measure customer satisfaction are NPS (Net Promoter Score) and CES (Customer Effort Score). In 2018, 37,000 Retail Banking customers completed the Voice of the Customer questionnaire, which resulted in the Bank taking 596 actions to improve customer experience in 19 fields of Retail Banking. At the same time, the Bank uses a specialised online reputation tool to collect feedback from customers, through comments on the Bank’s social media and on third-party websites and blogs. The Bank recognises the importance of knowing what’s being said about its products and services. Personal Data Protection In 2018 one of Piraeus Bank’s key priorities was to comply with the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was put into effect on 25 May 2018 in the EU. In the context of identifying and assessing potential data privacy risks through specific tools such as the Data Register and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), the Bank has taken all steps required to ensure that any processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the GDPR. The GDPR aims to ensure a coherent and uniform implementation of the rules on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data replacing the relevant existing legal framework (Law 2472/1997).

In addition, in order to manage GDPR-related issues across the Bank more effectively, the Management designated a Data Protection Office (DPOffice), and is working in co-operation with the HR to appoint Data Protection Coordinators (DPC) in all Business Units that process personal data. In particular, the DPO must: 01.

The DPOffice is a group of employees supporting and assisting the DPO in all actions and 168 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 initiatives required to monitor the Bank’s implementation and compliance with the legal framework on data protection. The employees of the DPOffice have knowledge and indepth understanding of Piraeus Bank’s activities and processes, its business needs, and a proficiency in data protection law and practices. The employees of the DPOffice have successfully attended and completed GDPR training. Indicatively, the 6-week GDPR Workshop (Methods, Processes & Technologies) organised by the Athens University of Economics and Business. In addition, the Bank has designated a DPC in all business units that process personal data. The DPC is the contact point between his unit, the DPO and the DPOffice, and plays an important role in the implementation of the Bank’s data protection program and framework. In addition, the DPC is responsible for ensuring data protection in the business unit of his responsibility and its compliance with the applicable regulatory framework. Policies and Procedures The Bank has reviewed existing and developed new data protection policies and procedures, to comply with GDPR principles and rules, as well as relevant data protection laws including: Data Protection Policy The Bank’s Data Protection Policy (DPP) has been developed to cover all GDPR rules. The DPP, pending approval from the Bank, aims to lay down the rules for implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures, for effective personal data management and protection, and for safeguarding the privacy of data subjects (natural persons and sole proprietorships). In addition, the DPP sets the rules for data processing, including collection, storage, use, transmission, disclosure or deletion, in compliance with the relevant regulatory framework. The DPP is currently being finalised, pending approval. Notification of personal data breaches Piraeus Bank is updating its privacy policy to ensure compliance with GDPR rules. In particular, information on what constitutes a personal data breach has been included, to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to identify, assess, investigate and disclose potential personal data breaches, as soon as possible. The notification process and channels in the event of a possible personal data breach have been communicated to all the Bank’s employees. In 2018, Piraeus Bank did not receive any substantiated complaints about customer privacy violations and reported no data leaks, theft or loss. Managing data subject requests Piraeus Bank has developed a process for managing data subject requests, since under GDPR it must provide information on action taken without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. Specifically, this process describes the identification of the data subject, the actions to be taken for the efficient management and processing of a request, what exceptions apply for each request, and a series of response patterns to ensure that communication with data subjects is compatible, consistent and adequate. In 2018, Piraeus Bank accepted and responded to one hundred and sixty-three (163) data subject requests for GDPR violation. The Hellenic Data Protection Authority (HDPA) received two (2) requests from Piraeus Bank customers. Customers 169 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) Piraeus Bank has developed a DPIA processing procedure to assess the impact of the processing operations on the protection of personal data, in compliance with the requirements of Article 35 of the GDPR. Through this procedure and with the use of the relevant tool, the Bank can assess the data privacy risk and the potential impact on data subjects of processing data that have been described as high risk . Other Technical Measures In 2018, in compliance with the current legal framework (GDPR), Piraeus Bank designed and implemented a series of appropriate technical and organisational measures to comply with the GDPR. Data Privacy Notice The Bank informed its customers, through press releases, by post and on the Bank’s website, on the main issues of the GDPR: the purposes of data processing, who are the recipients of personal data, data subject rights, the measures taken to ensure data protection, and the DPO and the DPOffice contact details. Record of processing activities The Bank has developed and maintains a record of personal data processing activities under its responsibility, in its capacity as Controller and as Processor of personal data. This record is required by Article 30 of the GDPR to be used as a tool of accountability. It consists of individual files that are kept at all Business Units that process personal data. 27 records of processing activities have been created in Business Units covering the Bank’s entire personal data processing flows. Lawfulness of processing Piraeus Bank has thoroughly considered the legal basis for all purposes recorded in the record of processing activities, to ensure that each legal basis is appropriate for the purpose of processing. Receiving and managing consent Within the framework of the GDPR, the Bank has strengthened the mechanisms for receiving and managing customer consent. It created an integrated management system to receive requests through its Branch Network, e-banking or the customer service call centre, following customer identification. Thus, the Bank ensures that data subjects understand how and why their data is collected and processed by the Bank. For example, in 2018, 1.526 mn bank customers had responded to a request for consent, with 75% consenting and 25% non-consenting. In addition, Piraeus Bank offers data subjects the right to withdraw consent at any time, and is able to prove at any time that the data subjects have given their consent to the processing of their personal data. An example is the receipt of Bank customers’ consent to be informed about marketing activities. Contracts/Agreements with Processors Part of personal data processing is carried out by third parties (processors). Piraeus Bank reviewed its contracts with the processors, stipulating their obligations to the Bank and to the data subjects. In addition, the Bank carries out diligent reviews, using a specific questionnaire, to assess if processing is performed in accordance with GDPR requirements. The Bank carries out reviews both at the start and during its contractual relationship with each 170 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 third party/processor. Additionally, a special application for maintaining and managing Additional Acts and Questionnaires was created. New contracts were signed with external partners which include the relevant terms regarding the protection of Personal Data. Marketing Activities Compliant with the GDPR, the Bank applies strict rules to exclude customers who have not consented from its marketing campaigns. In addition, prior consent by the DPO is given for any marketing campaign. Piraeus Bank participates in the Committee of the Hellenic Bank Association for GDPR-compliance in the Greek Banking System. The HBA’s new Code of Banking Ethics has been revised and is currently being reviewed, setting out the general principles of compliance. At the same time, the Commission communicates with the HDPA on GDPR-related issues. As a result, Piraeus Bank continues to ensure the protection and security of personal data and to provide a consistent approach by implementing appropriate technical and organisational measures.

The robust increase in active users, especially of the mobile app, confirms this strategy and is a guide for constantly offering day-to-day solutions to customers wherever they are, in a simple and clear way. In 2018 the initiative for migrating banking customers to digital channels continued and intensified, with a significant increase in the transaction migration index. As a result, the target initially set was met. In 2018, the transaction migration index was 84%, compared with 77% for 2017 and 67% for 2016. The progress of this project is monitored by systematic quantitative measurements, which record the percentage of transactions made at the cashiers’ desks compared to those made through digital channels. Therefore, measurements are made and targets are set at branch level to monitor the overall migration index, for all transactions that can be made both through digital service channels and at the branch’s cashiers’ desks. Piraeus Bank Group is committed to stepping up its efforts to further increase the use of the winbank e-banking and Winbank mobile apps during 2019, by providing new and innovative services to these channels. Piraeus Bank, committed to continuously improving its customer services, renewed its ISO 9001: 2008 certification for winbank. winbank web banking New subscriptions in 2018 continued their upward trend, with the number of registered winbank users increasing by 19% since 2017, 10% of whom became winbank users via online registration.

ATM Piraeus Bank’s ATM network covers the entire country and serves its customers 24/7. At the end of 2018, Piraeus Bank Group’s ATM network in Greece amounted to 1,943 ATM machines, covering urban centres, provincial cities and even remote locations in Greece. Through its extensive ATM network Piraeus Bank demonstrates in practice its support to all socio-economic classes. EasyPay kiosks In order to provide faster and easier customer service for daily transactions (deposits, bill payments, loan instalments, loading prepaid cards), 574 easypay kiosks have been installed in branches and partnering businesses. e-branch Taking into account the successful e-branch model, the Bank continued setting up e-branches in selected locations, offering more customers the experience of a quality banking service, with innovative solutions that make their daily life easier. Additionally, training of non tech-savvy customers in the use of ATMs continued. In 2018, e-branches contributed to the de-congestion of neighbouring branches, as evidenced by the transaction migration index, i.e. the percentage of transactions executed in each e-branch in relation to all transactions executed at the respective Affiliate Branch, and by the increase in the use of digital channels by senior citizens and non-tech savvy customers, following their familiarisation with the tools. In addition, customer satisfaction (CSAT, NPS) indicators, as derived from the Satisfaction Pad entries, show that the quality of service and customer experience remained stable at high levels due to the flexibility and speed of carrying out transactions in a pleasant and friendly environment. In order to improve information on e-branch customer experience, the Satisfaction Pad, a customer satisfaction survey device has been introduced for customers to enter their improvement suggestions. Customers 173 The Bank’s profits increased, due to a decrease in operating costs by customers switching to digital channels, an increase in the number of transactions with a corresponding increase in commission income, and a return of deposits. Contribution to society is also significant; Piraeus Bank gives customers the opportunity to execute transactions even on Saturdays and cover the special needs of banking services for the disabled (see below). Due to its wide and warm acceptance by customers, e-branch is one of the most successful case studies of the European banking market. Customer satisfaction is one of Piraeus Bank’s key goals and in Digital Banking customer satisfaction is tracked through: 01. The Annual Report Our Clients Say Voice application; of the customer. • CSAT & FCR indicators for customer 02. Tracking and responding: service and satisfactory immediate • to the Google Play Store & App Store customer complaints management. user feedback for winbank mobile Access to Financial Services for all Recognising the customers’ need to enjoy the benefits of technology, especially the use of digital channels, Piraeus Bank redesigned the winbank mobile application ( winbank app ), simplifying its use; even non-tech savvy customers can use it. Users may design their own personalised access to the most visited sections by selecting the products they frequently use. Even customers who do not have the winbank app installed on their phones can access the digital services through their phone’s web browser, as winbank e-banking is fully responsive and instantly accessible in its full functionality. Piraeus Bank, in the framework of its Corporate Responsibility, aligns its business operation with social solidarity, to serve its customers. It maintains branches in 17 border areas (as of 31.12.2018), as defined by the provisions of the Law 287/1976, in fact the only branch within a radius of 10 km (for 2017 the respective number of branches amounted to 38, -55% annual change). It also maintains branches on small islands with permanent residents of <10,000, that amounted to 11 in 31.12.2018 versus 13 in 2017 (-15% annual change). Permanent residents are all natural persons who declare one of the islands as their place of residence in their income tax declarations, as identified by TAXIS of the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR). In addition, seeking to protect and support population groups with specific needs, such as farmers and border residents, the Bank provides ATMs in their areas of residence, as a fulfillment of its duty and social obligation, aiming at the continuous facilitation of their everyday life. Piraeus Bank has ATMs in border areas (Law 287/1976), covering major daily transactions, and supporting customers in remote areas in Greece, that amounted to 329 in 31.12.2018 versus 302 in 2017 (+9% annual change). The contribution of e-branch to society is also important. The extended hours of e-branches make it possible for employees as well as companies to carry out transactions, which until recently were difficult. The experienced service staff, who are always present, help customers, including older people and non-tech savvy people, with their transactions, inform them about the services provided, and train them in the use of the Bank’s machines and digital services. Thus, yet another innovation is introduced in the banking service, with the em174 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 ployee not being seated opposite the customer, but on the contrary standing upright next to him/her, giving a sense of equality, trust and security. The most significant contribution of e-branches is the fact that they cover specialised banking needs of sensitive social groups, such as people with disabilities. Piraeus Bank is particularly sensitive towards people with vision, hearing and mobility impairment, and has taken the initiative to simplify technological innovations and facilitate their banking transactions. Thus, customers with disabilities can conduct transactions 24/7, such as deposits, withdrawals and payments, through ATMs and easypay machines, in easily accessible and indoor areas. In particular, the services provided are as follows: People with vision disabilities 01. Customer guidance by a facilitator 03.

For example, visually impaired people can now visit any Bank branch to request and acquire a debit card, to carry out cash debit/credit transactions without the need for witness presence and signatures, provided that they can receive sms alerts on their mobile phones, since this is the means by which they are informed of the transaction and can verify its accuracy. In addition, they can subscribe to winbank e-banking services without having to physically sign a contract. The design and implementation of existing and future services for disabled people is carried out in collaboration with the respective Associations and the Hellenic National Confederation of Disabled People, to ensure that their needs are truly covered, and to continuously improve processes and services. New services are currently being implemented, Customers 175 such as improving the accessibility and use of ATMs for visually impaired customers. In this way, Piraeus Bank protects their right to privacy, one of their main issues of concern. Statistics from e-branch employees are gathered on a daily basis on the number of disabled people visiting each e-branch and the number of transactions they carry out. E-branches due to their wide acceptance by customers of all categories and ages are an integral part of the Bank’s Branch Network and has become a reference point in international articles. Customer Complaints Management With a view to maintaining and enhancing customer loyalty, optimal practices are applied in managing disputes between customers and the Bank, geared towards prompt response, fair and impartial complaint-handling, continuous improvement of the products/services provided, preservation of the reputation and good image of the Group and ensuring compliance with the current regulatory framework. In 2018, the number of complaints submitted by customers either directly to the Bank or through Alternative Dispute Resolution Agents (ADRs) and managed by the Customer Complaints Service amounted to 4,349, maintaining approximately the same level with 2017. The majority of the complaints were submitted directly to the Bank, while a small percentage (18%) of customers chose to contact the ADRs and Consumer/Other Organisations.

In addition to handling complaints, during the year, initiatives and targeted actions were designed and implemented to strengthen the Bank’s complaints management mechanism. In this context, operational risk and internal control officers were appointed as points of contact with Customer Complaints Service for their fields of responsibility. Their roles support the timely and effective management of complaints and limit operational risks and related impacts. Corporate Communication and Marketing The Group Marketing, Customer Experience & Loyalty unit supports the promotion of the products and services of the Bank and of Group subsidiaries, through multiple, specially-designed promotional campaigns and advertisements. At the same time, the Unit ensures that corporate communication, both internal and external, is implemented in accordance with the Group’s Vision and Values. In 2018 the Unit supported the Group’s strategic choices in view of the continuous strengthening of the Bank’s customer-centric culture and the maintenance of a long-lasting relationship of trust with the general public, shareholders, customers and employees. This was achieved by promoting reliable messages, by the responsible, clear and honest promotion of products and services, and by linking all stakeholders to a common field of cohesion. 2018 Advertising Campaigns The advertising campaigns designed and implemented were geared towards promoting and marketing the most important initiatives developed during the year, such as innovative e-services, which are now an integral part of the customers’ daily lives –offering security in their transactions– the yellow loyalty scheme, which rewards customers for maintaining a stable relationship with the Bank, all card categories, savings products, where the Bank is a market leader, and the financial tools for SMEs.

The Check In Class marketing campaign, launched in 2015 continued in 2018 at 64 public and private academic institutions, promoting products and services that meet the needs of students. Built on the premise of Rewarding the presence of the student at the Educational Institution in which he/she is studying , the initiative involved digital promotion of banking operations, providing information about loyalty and engagement program.

Through the Check In Class Notes app feature, with a motto You become great when you share knowledge , students can find information on the curriculums of all the country’s Academic Institutions, listing approximately 36,000 courses. Student-users have the opportunity to exchange with their fellow students their course notes and knowledge, winning Note-Points that they can convert to yellows. Already, more than 4,000 course notes have been exchanged between students-users with an ever-increasing trend. Children of the Bank’s employees studying at Academic Institutions actively participate in the interaction.

In 2018, aiming for Customer Experience Excellence, the team focused on strategies for managing and improving customer experience, and successfully completed the yellow reward scheme. Bank Wide Loyalty / yellow The yellow reward scheme continued its great commercial success in its second year, constituting the largest and best Loyalty program in the market, due to three key factors: 01. The true value that Piraeus Bank 03. The simple, easy and enjoyable attributes to the customer. experience of the customer. 02. The participating companies. In particular, in 2018, the number of the Scheme’s new members and its market penetration increased progressively, with members exceeding 1,400,000 by the end of the year and continuing to grow at the same rate. At least 90% of the members live the whole experience from collecting up until redeeming yellows using bank products and services and at the same time 50% redeem them at the 21 companies participating in the Scheme. The Program has been developed further to include new point-gaining attitudes, such as Rewarding Consistency of Loans Payments and the yellow kid account. In cooperation with the Bank’s Business Units and the Scheme’s Partners, 43 portfolio management advertising and marketing campaigns were realised. At the same time, the point award system changed 184 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 for debit cards, without compromising the scheme’s comparative advantages, but with a significant reduction in its operating costs. Yellow also had a positive impact on the results of the yellowday, the e-platform for redeeming yellows, with 80% of its transactions made by members of the Scheme. In particular, turnover increased by 10%, while at the same time operating costs dropped by approximately 30%, applying all the modern optimisation and communication techniques.

Finally, the re-design of the Bank’s Intranet portal was launched, aiming to provide full and specialised information to the Bank’s users, and is expected to be completed in 2019. Customer Experience Voice of the Customer In 2018, the Customer Experience (Voice of the Customer (VOC) & Complaints Management) team continued working towards improving customer experience. VoC analysts measured the experience of 37,000 customers at 19 Moments of Truth.

In 2019, the Customer Experience & Loyalty teams aim to significantly boost Piraeus Bank’s strong competitive edge, by creating an exceptional experience for its customers.

Piraeus Bank’s goal remains to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction. In 2018, KANTAR TNS used a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) quantitative research approach to measure customer satisfaction. A computerised 12-minute questionnaire was administered to a sample of 15,300 active customers (natural persons, at least 1 transaction in the last 6 months), across the country. The survey was conducted in accordance with the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market, Opinion and Social Research and the Data Analytics and Association of Greek Market & Opinion Research Companies (SEDEA) code of conduct, and the quality control specifications defined by PESS (Quality Control in Data Collection). Both the customers’ overall satisfaction with Piraeus Bank and their preference for Piraeus Bank over other banks remain at high levels for another year. Customers 187 More specifically, with regard to overall customer experience, the results are positive, with 70% evaluating Piraeus Bank as excellent/very good , 24% as good and 5% as moderate , and only 1% rating it as poor . It is noteworthy that 9 out of 10 Piraeus Bank customers strongly prefer Piraeus Bank to any other bank. According to the 2018 survey, all satisfaction indicators at the customers’ main branch of service remained high, at 2017 levels. Focusing on satisfaction regarding the servicing experience at the customers’ main branch of service with individual indicators, courtesy of the staff and staff expertise scored the highest. In terms of providing full and accurate information –a key indicator of transparency– 74% of customers rate it as excellent/very good and only 1% of customers consider it as poor . Keeping the promises was considered excellent/very good for 74% of customers at the main branch of service. Regarding web banking, 89% of customers rate it as excellent/very good . These results justify the Bank’s focus on effective customer service. As part of the survey customers were asked to identify areas of improvement in the standard of service provided by the Bank. The results were taken under consideration and are being used in the implementation of the respective corrective actions. In the following graphs, the percentages have been rounded to the nearest integer. 188 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Customers 189 190 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 ΛΕΥΚΗ ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 6 ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 6 199 Human Resources Piraeus Bank Group invests in creating strong relationships with its employees, ensuring a framework based on respect for human rights and equal opportunities, transparency and co-operation.

We create value in all we do 03. We enthuse our customers 02. We challenge frontiers 04. We build relationships of trust Aiming at the cascading of the values throughout the Group and their understanding in action, a rodamap of initiatives was developed with strong impact on culture.

Major initiatives linked to culture transformation include: Become & Achieve The new People Performance Management (PPM).

At the same time, it is in line with the Code of Banking Ethics published by the Hellenic Banking Association, and the Group’s Regulatory Compliance Policy and Principles.

The Code applies to all employees across the Group with emphasis on the principles of responsibility, meritocracy and transparency. The revised Code of Conduct & Ethics has been co-signed by the CEO and the members of the Group’s Executive Committee. In the revised Code, special reference is made to the new Whistleblowing procedure, whereby employees have the obligation to disclose any misconduct detected or any act that opposes to the Bank’s internal policies and procedures, using the relevant communication channels, in order to safeguard the Internal Control System. A brief presentation of the Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) is also included, aiming at assuring a healthy working environment.

The terms and conditions of the VES were formulated on the basis of socially responsible options and the criterion of achieving the optimum long-term benefits for employees, assessing at the same time the Bank’s existing operational needs and the conditions of the banking market. 210 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Under the terms of the VES, eligible employees were given a choice between immediate termination of contract or a five-year leave, on a reduced salary, with termination of contract at the end of that period. In total, approximately 1,300 employees of Piraeus Group Greece (Bank & Subsidiaries) participated in the scheme, with 70% of applicants opting for immediate exit. The average age of VES applicants was 46 years, with 53% of the population from the Branch Network and 47% from the Bank’s Administration Units or its subsidiaries. In the context of supporting VES applicants, the Bank will provide private health insurance for five years to the employees and their family members. At the same time, exiting employees may use the advisory services offered by the Employee Assistance Programs for one year, as well as attend one-to-one meetings and group training provided by an external provider for pursuing alternative professional paths. Health, Safety and Modern Work Place Human Rights at Work Framework, Communication and Training on Human Rights In 2004, Piraeus Bank embraced the UN Global Compact’s human rights principles. Respect for human rights and the principle of equal opportunities governs all policies, processes and practices of managing the Group’s human resources, ensuring a working environment that accepts and integrates diversity. The human rights framework makes clear reference to the following: 01. Equal opportunities, and health and safety 04. Complaint reporting and resolution for employees. mechanisms. 02. Right to collective representation. 05. Confidentiality principle. 03. Promoting open communication at work.

In 2018, there were 15 incidents of human rights violations, none of which concerned a case of discrimination; 14 of the incidents were dealt with and resolved within the year, in accordance with the established procedure for addressing named and anonymous complaints. Collective Representation There are six employee unions active in Piraeus Bank, representing approximately 90% of human resources. The Management respecting the legislative governing its relationship with Unions seeks to strengthen the dialogue with the collective bodies of employees through which the continuous upgrade of the working environment is achieved. In the framework of regular and continuous consultation with the employee Union’s representatives, representatives of the Bank’s Management had multiple meetings with them in 2018, in order to resolve Human Resources 211 institutional and financial demands. The most important of these demands were included in the Collective Labour Agreement, signed in July 2018 between the Union representatives and the Management for the period July 2018-July 2019. Pioneering Health and Well-being Practices for Employees and their Families Piraeus Bank provides a wide range of preventative health, safety and well-being services for its employees and their families.

More specifically, 16.2% used up to 3 months cumulative leave, 22.7% used a 6 months cumulative leave and 61.0% a cumulative leave exceeding 6 months. Safety at Work Fully aligned with the relevant legislation on ensuring safety at work, Piraeus Bank employs Technical Security services that cover all of its facilities. It systematically provides data to the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) on workplace accidents that lead to an employee’s absence of more than three calendar days, according to the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) methodology. In 2018, four accidents were recorded in the Bank’s branches, the Authorities were notified, and the incidents were dealt with in full compliance with the law. At the same time, security systems were upgraded across the Bank (Branch Network and Administration buildings), and new Fire Safety and Fire Protection teams were set up. The 212 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Fire Brigade Service offered 120 hours of fire-fighting raining, and fire drills were scheduled across the Bank (1,577 in the Branch Network and more than 103 in Administration buildings). Social Policy Piraeus Group’s compensation and benefit package offers employees a stable standard of living, while, at the same time, motivating them to be productive. On 31 December 2018, total payroll expenses amounted to €616.00 mn, allocated as follows: Payroll Expenses (€ mn) Employee Compensations 350.13 Social Insurance Contributions 92.70 Other Expenses * 26.03 Voluntary Exit Scheme Expenses 154.01 Retirement Benefits Expenses -6.87 * O  ther expenses include: medical care, employee insurance with death and/or permanent disability coverage (Insurance Scheme), routine medical check-ups for executives, nursery schools and employer contributions other than social security funds. Consistent with the Bank’s strategic goal of shaping a single working framework, during the last quarter of 2018 the Group’s Human Resources worked systematically towards the creation a single modern group pension scheme. Under the new single group pension plan, retroactively in force as of 01.01.2019, all employees will be able to save a significant lump sum for their retirement. For the immediate transition to the new single program, the nine (9) existing different group pension plans were discontinued and the necessary actions were taken in cooperation with the collaborating insurance companies to ensure that the insured members received the amount they were entitled to under the terms of each contract. Recognizing the contribution and importance of its employees, and aiming to support them in coping with the ever-changing daily challenges, the Bank fulfils its commitment to provide substantial support, by offering tailored loan products on preferential terms, thus contributing substantially to improving their standard of living. In 2018, a total of 4,636 new loan applications were examined. With regard to loans falling under the terms and prerequisites of the 1984 Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Greek Federation of Bank Employee Unions-OTOE (first home mortgages and salary in advance loans), the amount disbursed in 2018 reached €14.6 mn. As of 31/12/2018, the number of this category was 11,199 loans with a balance of €175.4 mn. Professional Development Framework: Job Family Model In October 2018 the project for creating a Job Family Model (JFM) was launched. It is a recognized methodology that acts as a single platform and framework for human resource policies. Managing the evolution and development of employees, their promotions and their rewards become more effective; by recording the distinct tasks and roles and grouping them together (job families), employees are assessed according to their role’s contribution to the Group’s goals. The implementation of the model is expected to create dual career paths, enhance internal mobility, lay the foundations for a more structured Human Resources 213 promotion system based on enriching/increasing competencies, and create a more competitive compensation and benefit package, to retain talent. In designing the model, the Human Resources team, in collaboration with an external consultant, conducted interviews and workshops with the management to identify the required attributes in people’s roles, knowledge and skills, according to the strategy and the Group’s most important challenges, now and in the future. As a result, six job families were defined and developed, the purpose of each family was identified, as well as indicative tasks for each role in the family. With the active participation of representatives from all of the Bank’s units, from approximate 3,000 work positions in the Organization, 700 distinct roles were recorded with a brief job description, irrespective of the Organisational structure. At the same time, as part of the JFM, 3 distinct types of roles were designed to identify the necessary skills, knowledge and attributes for employee development. In addition, for each of the 6 families differentiation criteria were defined by role, according to the level of complexity. The aim is, at a later stage of the project, for all roles within the Organization to be integrated into a single hierarchical structure. Rewarding Employees Piraeus Bank Group encourages productivity and efficiency, recognising and rewarding the additional effort put in by each employee. The evaluation process is clearly defined and based on objective criteria. Special reward schemes, both short-term and long-term, are implemented. The schemes are structured so as to promote both individual and team effort. Along with efficiency, employee contribution in other fields is also rewarded, such as: 01. Innovative ideas/actions. 03. Social responsibility. 02. Integrity. 04. Exceptional professional conduct. Employee Training & Development Piraeus Bank Group is committed to ensuring that its people have the appropriate skills, knowledge and competencies to achieve their professional goals, to add value and to behave, reflecting the Group’s values and strategy. The Bank’s training activities have been structured in four (4) distinct portfolios, so as to meet the needs of the business units in the best possible way. Leadership Development The new Become & Achieve PPM was the main initiative for Leadership Development in 2018. Aiming to establish a common approach, in alignment with the Group’s new corporate culture, 1,833 managers attended a one-day workshop on how to influence, empower and improve the performance of their teams. At the same time, 1,895 team leaders and high-level executives attended in-house and external programs aimed at developing their leadership and management skills or preparing them for taking on additional tasks. In addition, 186 mid-and high-level employees were assigned to the renewed Harvard Manage Mentor course, with completion expected in the first half of 2019.

It is based on three principles: high performance, accountability and trust. It includes two main dimensions: WHAT , relating to personal contribution to team goals, and HOW , focusing on the Bank’s values. It links day-to-day work with the Bank’s strategy in a systematic manner, it recognises individual contribution to the team’s common goals, and it creates continuous growth opportunities for all employees. The new PPM’s main features are: 01. Performance dialogue. 03. We are all professionals with options 02.

In addition to training the management executives in the philosophy of the new approach, an informative campaign was conducted to inform and raise awareness regarding the new PPM, through direct mail, through the creation of a page on internal networks with information packs and infographics video. The first Become & Achieve PPM cycle started in June 2018 and will be completed in the first half of 2019. Talent Development In order to strengthen employees’ dynamics and potential, the Organization offers different skill development channels. Executive coaching Executive coaching is addressed to senior executives aiming to enhance their professional development, and strengthen an authentic leadership style, with a direct impact on the profile of the executives and their team members. In this context, PB, in cooperation with certified external providers, offered Executive Coaching to two senior executives, representing 3% of Senior Executives, managing units with increased complexity of responsibilities. The program is expected to expand in 2019. Development/Assessment Centers With the Group’s leadership model as a guide, the methodology of the Management Development Centers aims to develop and enhance the skills of the executives who are already managing or who are to undertake the management of groups of employees. The focus is on personal development and the design of individual actions by the participant themselves, while also connecting every action to their performance and professional development.

Through this platform each employee sets professional development goals, an action plan to achieve them in co-operation with the supervisor, with direct personal benefit to the lifelong strengthening of his/her skills and professional development in the Group. In particular, a focus group was held with the participation of 40 colleagues from different units and functions of the Bank, finalizing the form and content of the Plan. At the same time, we achieved the congruous connection of the Individual Development Plan with the employee performance and the available educational programs. Using Technology to Improve Employee Experience The Human Resource Management System (HRMS) continues to focus on delivering high quality and prompt service to employees and reliable information to Bank executives. In 2018, the new employees’ evaluation system of the Bank Become & Achieve has been implemented in the system through a sophisticated, user-friendly environment, pioneering for the Bank’s HR applications. At the same time, was completed the analysis and the basis for the implementation in 2019 of two new projects: The new Individual Development Plan, in the spirit of the Become & Achieve as well as the Bank’s new eRecruit system. 218 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 7 ΕΙΚΑΣΤΙΚΟ 7 225 Society Economic Value Creation In the framework of its corporate social responsibility and motivated by solidarity, Piraeus Bank Group has voluntarily included social and environmental initiatives in its business activities and its contacts with stakeholders.

Social Initiatives – Volunteering Sponsorships In 2018, Piraeus Bank’s goal was to remain responsible towards people and society, by supporting sustainable development. The goal was achieved, with the Bank supporting local communities, vulnerable social groups, the young generation and entrepreneurship. In order to align business goals with social progress and solidarity, as one of its key Corporate Responsibility principles, Piraeus Bank was a great supporter of ELEPAP’s awareness raising campaign, entitled The Brave Children are unbeatable . Piraeus Bank reinforced ELEPAP’s services to more than 1,000 children with mobility disabilities. In the framework of implementing CSR actions, Piraeus Bank supported the Greek National Opera in organising the Isadora Duck Experiential Workshop, an experiential workshop about dance, and music, and also about the concepts of every person’s uniqueness, the acceptance of diversity and artistic expression aimed at primary school pupils. Through the support of the Piraeus Bank Cultural Foundation the Bank contributed to the protection and promotion of culture, causing direct and indirect catalytic effects on the local communities and contributing to employment and increased tourist activity. Piraeus Bank also supported local communities and municipalities in Athens and the provinces, such as the Municipality of Thessaloniki and the Municipality of Naxos and the Small Cyclades. In the field of education, more than 600 computers were donated to more than 300 schools and academic institutions all over Greece. Finally, approximately 2,500 pieces of office equipment were donated to more than 60 schools and approximately 40 other institutions. Society 227 The Bank supported institutions either directly or through dedicated research funds, including the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, for the creation and operation of the Centre for Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and the American Farm School, sponsoring two annual scholarships (tuition fees, accommodation and meals). The Group continued for another year its sponsorship of the savings program for pupils living on Lipsi and Arki islands, whereby every child, upon entering adulthood, receives a sum of money to help start adult life. In the context of promoting entrepreneurship, which is vital to boosting employment and job creation, the Bank supported institutes and associations in organising important conferences, such as the annual conference of Hellenic American Chamber of Commerce on The Time of the Greek Economy , the Capital Link Invest in Greece Forum and the Delphi Economic Forum . Finally, the Bank made contributions to the health sector by covering the operational needs of various state hospitals, such as the General Hospital of Thessaloniki Agios Pavlos , the General Hospital of Chania Agios Georgios and the University General Hospital of Heraklion. CSR Program: Project Future Piraeus Bank, serving its mission to have a positive impact on society, launched Project Future, a CSR program that seeks to link university graduates to the job market, contributing to the expertise of new graduates in fields that meet current market requirements. The aim of the program is to bridge the gap between young people who have completed their studies and companies looking for qualified university graduates. In this way, the program gives graduates additional competitive skills to reclaim their position in the job market and at the same time creates opportunities to gain valuable practical experience and contacts in the professional field. Project Future has been created by Piraeus Bank in cooperation with ReGeneratlon Academy, Excelixi-Centre of sustainable entrepreneurship, Google, Facebook, Code.Hub and the Association of Chief Executive Officers. In 2018, the first cycle of the program took place from October to December of that year and was crowned with success. With the completion of the first cycle, the process of preparing the second two-month cycle started, which began in March 2019. During the two cycles, the new graduates acquired expertise in the fields of Data Science, Customer Experience, Digital Marketing, Sales and Java. The response from the new graduates exceeded all expectations since 6,500 applications for participation in the program were submitted. About 1,100 young people were trained, while more than 300 attended specialized trainings. More than 200 young people were admitted into the labor market with six-month long contracts for paid work until May 2019, and it is estimated that the number will increase to 300 after the completion of the second cycle. Piraeus Bank will continue to embrace new graduates through Project Future and will responsibly provide them with the appropriate skills for a promising future. 228 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 Corporate Responsibility and Volunteering Activities I care, I participate, I volunteer in actions that make the difference in Society, Culture and the Environment Through dialogue with partners and access to open information on corporate responsibility activities, the Groups’ volunteers choose to contribute to meaningful projects that have a significant impact on the lives of fellow citizens.

For more details, regarding the link among Culture, Environment and Corporate Responsibility see: Chapter “Environment”, p. 247. Promoting Intangible Cultural Heritage The Cultural Foundation focuses on the protection, promotion and study of Greece’s intangible cultural heritage. The Foundation has scientifically supported and contributed to the first two Greek inscriptions on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Know-how of cultivating mastic on the island of Chios and Tinian marble craftsmanship. These two elements of the country’s intangible cultural heritage are presented in two Museums of the PIOP Network, the Chios Mastic Museum and the Museum of Marble Crafts in Tinos. In this way, PIOP contributes substantially to the promotion of the intangible cultural heritage as well as to the support of the regions where its Museums are located. For this reason, in recognition of its offer, PIOP has been certified by the General Conference of UNESCO’s Member States as advisor to the Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage. At the same time, 38 targeted activities were implemented in the Foundation’s Museums, aiming to promote intangible cultural heritage. Culture and Entrepreneurship Aligning itself with EU policies related to linking entrepreneurship and culture, through Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs), the Foundation initiated the following initiatives: 01. Participation in the Corallia Social Innovathens (Hub of Innovation & Responsibility (CSR) network, in the giEntrepreneurship of Technopolis City Cluster, the first creative industries cluster of Athens), and a series of parallel established in Greece. informative and networking events, for 02.

Creating spaces for culture and lifelong and educational activities. learning; organising cultural, scientific The Network consists of nine thematic technological Museums that preserve and promote local artisan tradition and industrial production, as well as the tangible and intangible cultural heritage. In addition to contributing to the increase in tourism in distant or island regions, PIOP also contributes to the economic development of local communities by creating new jobs, and cooperating with local suppliers for goods and services sold in Museum canteens and shops. The Museum staff (42 people) are mostly hired from the local communities and undergo regular training, thus upgrading the standard of services offered to visitors. Visitors to the Museum Network reached 333,450 in 2018, (277,498 Greeks and 55,952 foreigners), up 5.91% from 2017. Of these, 75.15% were admitted free of charge. The number of visitors reflects the support from the local communities, in recognition of the benefits from promoting their cultural identity and the local economy. This number of visitors is also a result of the continuous organization of cultural events, by means of periodic exhibitions, lectures, conferences and a variety of other cultural events. All the Museums are equipped with Multi-Purpose Halls, vibrant cultural cells, for hosting educational programs, exhibitions, lectures, seminars and other events. The Halls are a valuable asset for the operation of the Museum Network, for reaching out to the local communities and for promoting the Foundation, serving as centres of cultural production and as everyday places in their areas. In particular, in 2018, 164 educational actions and 455 regular educational programs for children, 191 cultural events (21 exhibitions and 170 cultural events) were organised, as well Society 233 as 150 collaborations with third parties. The social role of museums is multidimensional. Apart from their key role in promoting cultural goods, they are charged with raising public awareness and safeguarding the cultural heritage for future generations. In addition, museums contribute to the economy of the regions where they are located. In 2016, PIOP commissioned the Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE) to conduct a research study on the economic and social impact of the operation of the Museums on the local communities. The results of the study prove and quantify this contribution in specific sectors: 01. Increase in tourist spending in the effects, the total contribution of museums respective regions of the country (2016: at to Greece’s GDP exceeds €13.4 mn, while least €5.5 mn, with a conservative estimate taking into account an optimistic estimate of the catalytic effect and up to €11.3 mn of the catalytic effects total contribution with an optimistic estimate of the catalytic reaches €23 mn). effect). 03. Contribution of museums to employment 02.

Using the most optimistic €4.3 mn, while in terms of employment it estimate, the overall impact on employment is equivalent to 103 job positions). Using is the equivalent of 600 job postings. the conservative estimate of the catalytic The contribution of the museums to the economy is linked to their ability to attract visitors. PIOP Museums have been increasing their number of visitors for several years. In 2016, approximately 220,000 people visited PIOP’s museums, up 14.25% compared to 2015, while in 2017 the Museums welcomed more than 314,000 visitors (up 43.1% yoy). In 2018, the number of visitors increased by 5.91%, to 333,450. Based on the aforementioned, and given the increasing trend in visitors of the PIOP Museum Network, a similar upward trend is expected in coming years. Historical Archives The PIOP Historical Archives houses and safeguards the historical archives of the banks absorbed by the Piraeus Bank Group, as well as the archives of important organisations and companies that were connected to the absorbed banks throughout their history. It hosts 7 bank archives, 5 archives of state organisations, 55 company archives, 5 personal archives, 3 archives of collective bodies. The Historical Archives can provide answers to the key question of the evolution of Greece in the 20th century, in terms of both the economy as a whole and its regions. 234 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 PIOP aims to operate its Historical Archives with the highest organisational and operational principles, making it accessible to everyone, and promoting the value of preserving the collective memory of society through archived sources. The Historical Archives organises activities making it a key research point and aiming to become a unique spot on the cultural map of Athens. Indicatively, in 2018 7,950 people benefited from the Historical Archives services. In 2018, the following tasks were performed: Archives 01. Volume: Material measuring more than 05.

The PIOP Library features a Children’s Reading Room, open to children aged between four (4) and twelve (12) years old. The children’s collection comprises a rich collection of classic and more recent children’s stories and of novels for children and youths by Greek and foreign authors. It also includes books of a more general interest and of an encyclopaedic nature. The Children’s Reading Room is also used to host the Foundation’s educational programs, organised by a library employee (28 activities).

At the same time, the possibility is examined for integrating collective works which are referenced in the international bibliography regarding the three new thematic axes of the PIOP: Intangible Cultural Heritage, Cultural Landscapes and Historical Centres. Research Programs PIOP’s research programs are an integral part of its threefold strategy: Research, Exhibition, Publication . The results of the research are used in all of the Foundation’s activities. As far as research themes are concerned, emphasis is placed on traditional technologies, the management of the country’s natural resources, the tangible and intangible cultural heritage of the recent past.

The Principles for Responsible Banking, developed by the UNEP FI members, set the new framework for banking worldwide. They emphasize governance, transparency, accountability, cooperation with all stakeholders to set targets that will have a positive impact on society, so that the banking sector contributes to achieving the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement. A working group of UNEP FI member banks published jointly developed methodologies and scenarios to be used by banks to assess climate risks. The UNEP FI Working Group drew on the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) set up by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop banking strategies and actions for addressing climate risk. In Europe, the Action Plan: Financing Sustainable Growth is progressing with legislative proposals that will set the path towards achieving the Paris Climate Agreement, by steering funds in low carbon technologies and services. Piraeus Bank’s environmental framework The Bank monitors, and in some cases co-shapes, international and European trends. Piraeus Bank is one of the 28 banks worldwide that developed the Principles for Responsible Banking under the auspices of UNEP FI. By participating in the UNEP FI Positive Impact Initiative, the Bank forms a framework for promoting environmental and social impact-based Environment 249 financing. At the same time, by participating in the EU Business@Biodiversity the Bank works with pioneering companies in Europe to develop business tools and approaches that integrate natural capital and biodiversity considerations into business practices. The Bank has implemented environmental policies and strategies and its Environmental Management System (EMS) is certified under ISO 14001 and EMAS. The Piraeus Bank Group Cultural Foundation (PIOP) also has an EMAS-certified EMS, while four Industrial Parks run by ETVA Industrial Parks SA also have EMS with ISO 14001:2015 environmental certification. At the same time, the Bank operates an Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) to limit exposure to potential environmental and social risks of its borrowers. Sustainability Support Structure Piraeus Bank Group has dedicated business units, such as the Sustainability Unit (former Environment Unit), Green Banking & Development Programs and Corporate Responsibility & Internal Communication that cooperate with other units to achieve the sustainability goals. The Group Environmental Management Officer coordinates the Environmental Management Team (EMT) of the Bank and PIOP and is on the Environmental Council of ETVA Industrial Parks SA. Monitoring and Analysis of Environmental Legislation & Case-Law The subject-specific Database on Environmental Legislation and Case Law (DEL&CL) that has been developed in Piraeus Bank constitutes an innovative legal tool. The DEL&CL includes the necessary legal information and relevant documentation, as well as numerous opinions on legal issues that are of particular interest to the Bank. It serves the specialized legal support to the implementation of Piraeus Bank Group’s Environmental Policy and its compliance with applicable environmental legal requirements, including climate commitments. It also facilitates Bank’s proactive response to environmental regulatory developments. Improving Environmental Performance The Bank develops strategies to improve its environmental performance and minimize the environmental impact of its operations. Environmental Management System (EMS) The Environmental Management System (EMS) systematically monitors, manages, and effectively reduces the environmental impact associated with the Bank’s operations in administrative buildings and its branches in Greece. Since 2011, Piraeus Bank is registered in the European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). In addition, the EMS is certified according to ISO 14001:2015. Reduction of Piraeus Bank’s Environmental Footprint The environmental impact of the Bank’s operations is monitored on an annual basis. The methodology used in the calculations is based on the principles set out in the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Piraeus Bank’s environmental performance in 2018 was assessed using specific Energy Efficiency Indicators, as shown in the following paragraphs. The results refer to Piraeus Bank’s operations in Greece. 250 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 2014 is used as the Energy Consumption 6 base year, as a series of significant bank mergers The main energy sources used for the Bank’s operations are electricity, heating oil, and took place in 2012-2013. fuel for employee travel. Specifically: Electricity Consumption Electricity is consumed across the Group for lighting, for operating electrical and electronic equipment, for air conditioning, while in most buildings it is also used for heating purposes. Electricity consumption is the Bank’s environmental aspect with the greatest environmental impact. In total, more than 55.93 GWh were consumed in 2018, of which 555.217 kWh were generated by solar PV systems installed in 29 branches (net-metering). Electricity consumption per square metre and per employee was reduced by 9% and 3% respectively. In total, since 20146 electricity consumption per square meter decreased by more than 17%. Fuel Consumption Heating Oil: In 2018, 76 buildings consumed 212,456 litres of heating oil, 34.38% less than in 2017. Employee road travel (petrol/diesel/LPG): Total fuel consumption due to employee road travel is estimated on an annual basis taking into consideration the average monthly prices of unleaded petrol, diesel and LPG (work-related business travel). Educational travel is calculated based on the distance covered by each employee from the workplace to the training centre and back. In 2018, fuel consumption for business travel reached 1,802,000 litres of petrol, 480,000 litres of diesel and 43,000 litres of LPG, for more than 30.8 mn km of road travel. Aviation fuel: In 2018, employees travelled approximately 5 mn km by plane. As a result, 200 tonnes of jet fuel were consumed for air travel. Energy Saving Projects Every year, energy and cost saving projects are implemented across the Bank. Energy-saving Interventions at Branches In 2018, the Technical Projects and Administration Unit carried out energy efficiency renovations in 153 branches. The most important energy upgrades were: 01. Replacement of conventional light bulbs Management Systems (BEMS). with LED lighting. 03. Installation of motion sensors in WCs. 02. Installation of Building Energy Environment 251 Replacement of lighting in buildings During the renovation of the Bank’s facilities, energy-efficient LED lighting were installed, wherever possible. The Installed Lighting Power Density (ILPD) reached 6.18 W/m2 in 2018. This is a reduction of 69%, which led to a saving of 1.295 MWh of electricity over the previous year. Outdoor Sign Lighting in Branches Installation of LEDs In 2018, the replacement of outdoor sign lighting with LEDs in 351 branches was completed. Since 2017, outdoor sign lighting have been replaced in 500 branches. This switch to LED results in an annual cost-saving of €510 per branch. The energy saving from replacing the outdoor sign lighting is approximately 50%. In addition, the total energy consumption per branch has improved by 5%. Installation of PV Systems Net-metering In 2018, the installation of PV Systems was completed in 33 branches, with 29 of them connected to the national grid. It is estimated that 33% of the branches’ electricity needs is covered by the PV Systems. Energy Office The Energy Office uses a web-based, real-time, monitoring software, unique in the Greek banking sector. It records the energy and water consumption in more than 350 of the Bank’s buildings. It is an innovative environmental program designed to save resources, reduce environmental footprint and operational costs. It enables: 01. Remote intervention in case of energy 02. Comparative energy data reporting. errors, failures and over-consumption. Paper/Toner Consumption Paper consumption is the second most important environmental aspect for the Bank after electricity consumption. On an annual basis, supplies of all paper consumables, newspaper subscriptions, and total quantities of paper used for communication and display purposes are recorded. Specifically: 01. Printing paper (A3, A4 and A5 sizes) Ecolabel or FSC certified. needs are covered almost exclusively 03.

Managed Printing Services (MPS): In 2018, the Bank avoided printing more Solid Waste Management The Bank cooperates with licensed recycling companies and systems for its recycling. In 2018, more than 4,000 collections of materials were made from all branches and administration buildings and approximately 860 tonnes of solid waste were recycled. GHG emissions For the calculation of the Bank’s total CO2 equivalent emissions, the operational control method has been applied and the following sources of emissions are taken into consideration: Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1): 01. Consumption of heating oil. 02. Consumption of petrol and diesel used by company cars. Indirect GHG emissions related to electricity consumption in the Bank’s buildings (Scope 2): 01. Consumption of electricity in all buildings and branches. Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3): 01. Investments (Participations). services, etc.). 02. Purchased goods and services (e.g. fixed 03.

Employee commuting. 7 Categories included in 04. Waste generated in operations (including 06. Business travel (rental or privately-owned GHG Protocol Corporate management/transport). car, air travel, sea travel). Value Chain Standard . In particular, in 2018, an external consultant completed a study on other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). The aforementioned categories of indirect emissions7 were calculated for the years 2017 and 2018, as they are assessed as the most significant for the Bank. 8 Location-based methodology. The GHGs included in the calculations are: Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). The resulting emissions from the combustion of petrol and heating/motor oil are based on the IPCC and EMEP/EEA Guidelines for national emission inventories. Emissions resulting from electricity consumption are calculated taking into account the national energy balance, as well as the emissions of GHGs and other gases recorded in the most recent annual National Inventory Report8. Finally, for all other emissions the relevant published input-output tables were used. In addition, Piraeus Bank purchased Guarantees of Origin (GOs) from IRON THERMOELECTRIC SA and PPC SA for 100% of the electricity consumed on its premises and its subsidiaries. In particular, GOs for 76,661 MWh were cancelled in the electronic certificate registry, thus confirming that the specific quantities of electricity derived from Renewable Energy Sources (RES). In total, in 2018, total CO2eq emissions exceeded 82,421 tonnes.

Recognizing the loss of biodiversity as one of the planet’s biggest environmental threats, and having included the protection of biodiversity in its Environmental Policy, in September 2018 Piraeus Bank completed the five-year European co-funded LIFE-Stymfalia project. The aim of this innovative project was to restore important wetland habitats at Lake Stymphalia and create the appropriate conditions for their long-term protection and management, linking business and biodiversity protection for the first time. LIFE-Stymfalia organised workshops, educational programs and events, highlighting the need for restoring Lake Stymphalia and enhancing the value of the region, for engaging the local community in the sustainable management of the Lake. The project inspired initiatives for sustainable development and innovative business activity suitable for Natura 2000 sites. Environment 257 A two-day International Conference on Sustainable Management and Financing of Wetland Biodiversity –the first such event in Greece– was held in Athens and Stymphalia. The Farmers’ Network of Stymphalia was created to promote sustainable farming entrepreneurship and innovation. The environmental and cultural interpretation trail Man and Nature on the Paths of the Time , which leads visitors from the Environment Museum to the wetland and the archaeological site, has attracted more than 5,000 people in two years. The path received the European Natura 2000 Finalist Award for 2018 for its dual identity, since biodiversity intermingles with antiquity along the path. The educational suitcase Mission... Stymphalia , was borrowed by eleven schools of the region, raising the awareness of 630 children on issues related to the problems and threats to wetlands. A study on the economic evaluation of ecosystem services was carried out for the first time for a small Natura 2000 site, where the ecosystem services of the area are depicted and considered as rare and their degradation entails a considerable cost. The total value of Ecosystem services in Lake Stymphalia amounts to more than €6,500,000 annually, based on current estimates. The Business Plan for Lake Stymphalia was completed, where the comparative advantages of the protected area were recorded and business opportunities were assessed, with a view to sustainable management. For more information, see: www.lifestymfalia.gr With the experience gained from the LIFE-Stymfalia project, the Bank participates in the EU Business@Biodiversity Platform. In the framework of this Platform, the Bank also engages in the EU CoP Finance@Biodiversity working group, where financial institutions (FIs) discuss how to address the challenges and opportunities arising from financial activities. In addition, Piraeus Bank participates in the IUCN initiative Incubator for Nature Conservation for identifying business opportunities for the sustainable development of protected areas worldwide. Addressing Climate Change Piraeus Bank applies processes for assessing the impacts and opportunities of climate change, especially in sectors of the Greek economy that have a significant share in its business portfolio. Piraeus Bank Group responds promptly to the global challenges of climate change. It continuously monitors and actively participates in developments, having drafted its Climate Change Strategy (2010), which aims to reduce its environmental footprint as well as to enhance investing in RES and green entrepreneurship. The Bank monitors international climate change trends and participates in international initiatives such as the UN Global Compact’s Caring for Climate: The business leadership platform , the Positive Impact Manifesto on the transition to inclusive green economy and the Paris Pledge for Action initiative launched in the framework of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (2015). Following the decisions taken at the Paris Conference, initiatives that are rapidly developing at both international and European level highlight the strategic role of financial institutions in tackling climate change and sustainable growth. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures – TCFD of the Financial Stability Board has analyzed the risks, opportunities and economic impact of climate change and has come up with a series of recommendations for financial institutions concerning 258 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 the 4 pillars of their operations: Corporate Governance, Strategy, Risk Management and Targets. Based on these recommendations, a group of banks, members of UNEP-FI, proceeded with the issuance of method frameworks for approaching climate risk assessment. Piraeus Bank has proceeded with recording, and assessing the risks and opportunities arising from climate change. Based on the recommendations of the TCFD, it analyzed the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the Bank with a view to identifying the actions to be taken in relation to climate risk management. In addition, Piraeus Bank, in collaboration with an external partner has conducted a Gap Analysis on the capabilities of the Climate Risk Management Model and identified changes that are required for the Model to be compatible with the TCFD recommendations. Piraeus Bank’s Climate Change Strategy The Climate Change Strategy, which is an integral part of the Sustainable Development Strategy, recognizes the impact of climate change on the economy, society and the environment, and it has four axes: 01. Gradual reduction of Piraeus Group’s companies, carbon footprint, 04. Provision of solutions to businesses 02. Support of investments in renewable in order to adapt to the new climatic energy and energy saving projects, conditions. 03. Climate change risk assessment for Greek Climate Risk and Exposure Piraeus Bank carries out economic assessment on the climate exposure of its business portfolio in Greece. More specifically, the Bank through the Climate Risk Management Model (CRMM) it has developed, calculates the annual climate exposure of business borrowers from significant sectors for the Bank, that may be economically affected by climate change. The following tables show the sectors of the 2018 business portfolio affected by climate change, as well as the structure and characteristics of the sample taken. Characteristics of Sample loan-holders Total Number of Sample business borrowers 12,821 Total Turnover from Sample business borrowers €54,439,147,543 Structure of Subject business borrowers per Sector of Economic Activity Offices 5,736 Agriculture 2,695 Energy Production 1,399 Processing 1,480 Hotels 1,336 Shipping 120 Hospitals 55 Total climate exposure of the Bank’s business borrowers was estimated at €926.22 mn for 2018 (2017: 541.5 mn), or 1.7% of their total turnover. Physical exposure constitutes Environment 259 39.3% and regulatory exposure 60.7% of total climate exposure. With regard to almost doubling the cost of the climate exposure of the specific business borrowers in 2018, it should be taken into account that the average annual green-house gas emission allowance price of €16/tonne was used to calculate climate exposure compared to price of €7/tonne of emissions by which the climate exposure was calculated in previous years. The configuration of the corporate loan portfolio over the last three years (2016-2018), based on the climate exposure lending economical sectors, is as follows: Composition of the Business Loan Portfolio Based on Climate Exposure of the Economic Sectors with Loans Climate Exposure Sector Category Percentage Percentage Percentage 2018 2017 2016 Sectors of Negative Climate Exposure (benefit) 1.3% 1.1% 1.1% Sectors of Zero Climate Exposure 59.8 % 69.4% 73.7% Sectors of Low Climate Exposure 30.2 % 17.1% 12.8% Sectors of Medium Climate Exposure 7% 5.7% 5.7% Sectors of High Climate Exposure 1.6% 6.7% 6.7% It is noted that 91.3% of loan portfolio relates to sectors with negative to low climate exposure and only 8.6% of loan portfolio relates to sectors with medium and high climate exposure. Climate Risk Management Model The goal of the Climate Risk Management Model is to assess the climate exposure of Greek businesses and evaluate solutions to reduce exposure. The Model can be applied to calculate: 01. The cost of climate risk (physical and borrower in order to reduce its climate regulatory) related to climate change at exposure. economic sector, sub-sector and business 03. The environmental footprint of the sector level. (gaseous emissions, liquid waste,solid 02. The cost and benefits of measures waste) at a sub-sector and business level. that can be implemented by a business Climate Risk Physical Climate Risk is the financial impact to a business due to the change in climate conditions (increase/decrease in average temperature or average rainfall,rise in sea levels, extreme weather conditions, eg. heat waves, flooding etc). Regulatory Climate Risk is the financial impact to a business due to the reforms in the institutional framework in order to deal with climate change (eg. participation in the EU Emissions Trading System-EU ETS). For annual assessment of climate exposure, data are collected from the total of the Bank’s business portfolio. Following that, a sample is selected from businesses 260 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 in specific sectors of economic activity, which are exposed to climate change and are of particular interest for the Bank’s loan portfolio, and Typical Units are developed. For the assessment of climate exposure, the turnover of the business borrower is assessed, as well as the parameters according to the sector or subsector of economic activity. Indicatively: 01. For the agricultural sector: the manufacturing it is involved in (steel type and method of cultivation, industry, oil refinery, aluminum geographical region. production, etc). 02. For services: the climate zone and 04. For electricity production: the fuel for hotels in particular the season and the technology utilized as well duration, year of construction, type as the installed power density and of energy utilized. annual electricity production. 03. For manufacturing: the type of Additionally, the business borrowers are categorized according to whether they participate in the EU emissions Trading System (EU-ETS), a factor which is taken into account in calculating climate exposure due to regulatory risk. In order to categorize financial sectors according to climate exposure, the Economic Sector Climate Exposure Index (ESCE) is calculated as the ratio of climate exposure in relation to the total turnover of the business borrowers, and the sectors are divided into categories as follows: 01. Negative climate exposure: sectors 04. Μedium climate exposure : sectors with ESCE<0%. with 1%<ESCE≤5%. 02. Zero climate exposure: sectors with 05. Ηigh climate exposure: sectors with ESCE=0% (mainly concerns sectors ESCE>5%. not exposed to climate change). 03. Low climate exposure: sectors with 0%<ESCE≤1%. Within the Group’s business objectives, the assessment, valuation and measurement of change risks, in a transparent manner and integrated into a comprehensive risk management strategy, prepares the Bank for the increased risk monitoring requirements expected to come into effect by the competent supervisors. At the same time it enhances the environmental profile of the Bank and the Group in the market, maintaining a competitive advantage in Greece and Europe Collaborations Piraeus Bank has collaborated with the Society for the Protection of Prespa in the implementation of the European LIFE-Stymfalia program, which started in October 2013 and was completed in September 2018. In the framework of the participation of the employees in volunteer programs, in 2018 the Bank cooperated with the Organization Earth , while the Bank’s cooperation with the Climax plus social cooperative continues for the collection of paper for recycling in Attica. Environmental Awareness and Education Internal Communication Environmental Awareness and Employee Training Special e-learning courses were developed to promote key environmental concepts, the Environment 261 Bank’s environmental work and the Environmental Management System. In 2018, 129 Environmental Management Coordinators followed the e-learning course to learn about EMAS and the Bank’s Environmental Management. 702 Bank executives completed the new course on Environmental and Social Risk . In 2018, a total of 2,581 training manhours were spent on environmental e-learning. Annual Recycling Competition Every year, Piraeus Bank launches a recycling competition Green behaviour wins! to reward the best environmental performance within the Bank. The winners receive environmentally friendly gifts in line with the competition’s object which is to improve the Bank’s environmental performance, as well as employee awareness. Green News Green News are uploaded to the intranet on a monthly basis. Employees reading the news range between 130 and 950 each month. Culture, Environment and Corporate Responsibility Principles In 2018, a series of energy studies and targeted interventions was completed regarding the building and electromechanical equipment of the PIOP Museum Network and its buildings in Athens, aimed at improving their energy efficiency and, by extension, improving the Foundation’s environmental footprint. The Foundation’s 5th Environmental Statement was verified, in accordance with the requirements of EMAS Regulation, on 24.09.2018, with environmental verifier registration number EMAS ELV-0009 (Certificate No. 549). The Foundation, in accordance with Ministerial Decree No. 50486/1466/27.10.2014, is registered on the Greek EMAS Register (registration number EL-000110). PIOP’s Environmental and Energy Management System has received the following certificates [Reg. no. EMAS ELV-0009 (Certificate No. 549)]: CYS EN ISO 14001:2015/ No. ES.N.14.007, CYS EN ISO 50001:2011/ No. EMS.17.001, and IQNet CY. ES.N.14.007. Environmental Management at ETVA VIPE The environmental parameter affects all ETVA VIPE fields of activity (water supply, solid and liquid waste management, noise level assessment, environmental compliance), and is the basic criterion for organisation and centralised management in the company’s overall operation. The Environmental Management System (EMS) of ETVA VIPE has ISO 14001:2015 environmental certification for its headquarters (since 2016) and for four industrial areas. In 2018, the EMAS certification was renewed by an external certified body and the process of inclusion on the EMAS register by the Ministry of the Environment and Energy is currently under way. Wastewater Treatment ETVA VIPE processed a total of 3,676,735 m³ industrial wastewater in the seven (7) Industrial Wastewater Treatment Units (IWTUs) it manages. The waste-sludge generated and handled by the company in 2018 was 6,686.51 tonnes. The implementation of bio-treatment in the Patras and Komotini IWTUs results in a 22% saving of resources. 262 Sustainability & Business Report 2018 With regard to wastewater management, the company, using its software applications (e.g. electronic platform for environmental data) and on-line cash registers, has upgraded its ability to monitor the contaminated cargo to handle heavy cargos. Above all, these tools can meet the requirements of the environmental monitoring procedures, as set out bythe ISO standard systems and the requirements of environmental legislation. Water Management ETVA VIPE drew a total of 6,081,918 m³ of water for the needs of its Industrial Areas, while 67,469 litres of chemicals (i.e. sodium hypochlorite) were used to decontaminate it. The company provided water to 873 enterprises in the secondary and tertiary sectors within its areas. In 2018 ETVA VIPE also undertook to provide water to the Industrial Area of Heraklion, which has a significant turnover of established businesses. The management of the water supply of the Heraklion Industrial Area was transferred from the Municipal Water Supply and Sewerage Company of Heraklion to ETVA VIPE. The challenge for ETVA VIPE in the Heraklion Industrial Area lies in reversing water losses (which increased by 489,620 m³ compared to 2017) and the negative financial results. In the context of the continuous improvement of the operation of the water supply systems managed, in 2018 the company carried out work for the maintenance, repair and upgrade of equipment and networks to reduce natural water loss. Their implementation is expected in conjunction with systematic inventory, to further contribute to the identification and reduction of natural losses. Environmental Management Performance Indicators ETVA VIPE applied for one more year its environmental monitoring program with the following indicative figures: 01. 101 analyses (on average 100 04. 3,408 regular chlorine determination parameters) to ensure the quality of the measurements for on-site water quality water network on a regular basis. control. 02. 654 analyses (on average 4 parameters) 05. 1,678 regular inspections and of waste samples in established corresponding analyses (on average enterprises in the Industrial Areas 15 parameters) to confirm the proper of Thessaloniki, Patras, Komotini, operation of IWTUs in the Industrial Heraklion, Lamia, Larissa and Drama to Areas of Thessaloniki, Patras, Komotini, monitor the status of the network and Heraklion, Lamia, Larissa and Drama at the processed waste. the company’s laboratories. 03. 87 regular final outflow checks of 06. 229 regular inspections in the rainthe 7 IWTUs in the Industrial Areas collection networks at fixed points for (Thessaloniki, Patras, Komotini, the control of the quality of the water Heraklion, Lamia, Larissa and Drama) recipients of the Industrial Areas. and water recipients in collaboration 07. 80 on-site noise level determinations at with accredited external laboratories. 22 Industrial Areas. In 2018 the company also reported the results of its EMS to the Ministry of Environment and Energy, demonstrating its consistency and compliance. Aiming to certify its services and to provide an opportunity to support businesses in an organised framework, ETVA VIPE registered on the StartUp Incubator platform of the Ministry of Economy and Development and the Special Secretariat for the Management of Sectoral Operational Programs. Its goal is to facilitate business networking, support and Environment 263 build synergies between established businesses and teams in applying new requirements (cyclical economy applications and industry 4.0). Associated businesses in this environment should be facilitated to enhance their productivity and competitiveness.
