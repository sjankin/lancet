Fraport provides all operational and administrative services for airport and terminal operation as well as other associated services. The range of services also includes planning and consulting services. Passenger traffic, which impacts on a majority of the services the Group provides, is key to the Group’s revenue and earnings performance. Germany – almost exclusively Frankfurt Airport – was once again the most important site of the Fraport Group in the past fiscal year with a share of 61.5% in the Group result (2017: 66.0%). 88% total of employees were employed in Germany at the end of 2018. The information and key figures in this report covers the Group and all companies that are consolidated according to the regulations on financial reporting issued by the International Accounting Standards Board on the balance sheet date. This report covers all activities, products, and services, in particular, those with significant environmental effects within this framework. The scope of consolidation for the environmental key figures comprises the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated investments with significant environmental effects. In the years 2016 and 2017 these were: Gesellschaft für Cleaning Service mbH & Co. (GCS), Airport Cater Service GmbH (ACS), FraGround and the Group airports Varna, Burgas, Lima, and Ljubljana. In 2018, the scope of consolidation was expanded to include the 14 Greek airports of Fraport Greece and the Brazilian Group airports of Porto Alegre and Fortaleza. Deviations from the scope of consolidation of the companies with an impact on the environment are indicated accordingly. The scope of consolidation of the Group's key personnel figures corresponds to that of the financial figures (see “Companies included in the Consolidated and Balance Sheet Date”, page 148 et seq. in the Annual Report 2018). The financial, HR, and environmental key figures are calculated at the Group level via a SAP-supported application and are subject to the same calculation method. Different collection methods are indicated in individual cases. All data and information was collected by the relevant departments/consolidated Group companies. Our reports “GRI Report 2018” and “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018” (hereinafter also “Sustainability Report 2018“) are published annually in German and English and cover the reporting period of January 1 to December 31 of each year. The usual, and in our opinion appropriate, methods, calculations, and estimates are employed to determine the reporting data. It cannot be ruled out that individual GRI indicators may be associated with a degree of uncertainty. GRI Report 2018 Key Figures / Finance 4 Key Figures The vision of establishing Fraport as Europe’s top airport operator and also to set global standards forms the basis of the Group strategy. In fiscal year 2018, Fraport continued with the implementation of its Group strategy developed on the basis of the mission statement implemented in 2015/2016. The mission statement encompasses the Group goals “Growth in Frankfurt and internationally”, “Service-oriented airport provider”, “Economically successful through optimal cooperation”, “Learning organization and digitalization”, and “Fairness and recognition for partners and neighbors”. Based on these Group objectives, the Executive Board has defined six key non-financial performance indicators in accordance with Section 315 (3) of the HGB in conjunction with section 289 (3) of the HGB. These are: global passenger satisfaction and baggage connectivity, employee satisfaction, women in management positions, sickness rate, and CO2 emissions. Non-financial performance indicators 2018 2017 Change Global satisfaction of passengers (Frankfurt) (%) 86 85 +1 PP Baggage connectivity (Frankfurt) (%) 98.4 98.5 –0.1 PP Employee satisfaction 2.76 2.85 +0.09 Women in management positions (Germany) (%) 26.0 28.0 –2.0 PP Sickness rate (%) 7.4 7.5 –0.1 PP CO2 emissions (t) 244,029 209,668 34,361 Global satisfaction of passengers (Frankfurt) We want continously optimize the focus on customers and services at our airports.

Target level: > 98.5% (term: 2019) Employee satisfaction We want to create good working conditions and increase employee satisfaction. Target level: Better than or equal to 3.0 (term: 2019) Women in management positions (first and second level below the Executive Board), Germany We want to increase the number of women in management positions. Target level: 30% (term: 2021) Sickness rate We want to stabilize the sickness rate in the medium term and reduce it in the long term. Target level: ≤ 7.2% (term: 2025) CO2 emissions: Absolute emissions (sum scope 1 and 2 of GHG Protocol) of the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated Group airports in metric tons of CO2 We want to reduce the CO2 emissions of the Fraport Group. Target level: 125,000 metric tons CO2 (term: 2030) The performance indicators are also included in the Annual Report 2018 in the chapters “Control”, “Non-financial performance indicators”, and “Business outlook” of the Group management report starting on page 67.

GRI 102-9 Organization’s supply chain Unlike for manufacturing companies, there is no comparable relevance for the supply chain, but rather the focus is placed on the quality of the services offered and the functionality of the infrastructure required for this. Irrespective of this, it is crucial that business partners and suppliers are selected carefully. The Group companies each have their own procurement management. Fraport compels business partners and suppliers to comply with its Supplier Code of Conduct as part of its General Terms and Conditions (GTC), depending on the local conditions. The Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct details how to treat employees correctly, including respecting human rights, environmental and climate protection, and integrity in the course of business, for example the prohibition of corruption and bribery. A violation of this code may result in the termination of the business relationship. A contractual penalty may be imposed and a claim for lump-sum damages may be raised in the event of antitrust violations and serious misconduct. Business partners and suppliers must also undertake to observe these principles in dealings with their own suppliers. Fraport AG undertakes to focus on sustainability criteria when purchasing products and services. In addition, the company was one of the first in Hesse to sign a target agreement initiated by the Hessian Ministry of the Environment, Climate Protection, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in 2016. Consequently, social and ecological criteria are considered in purchasing decisions in addition to economic criteria. Fraport AG has a heterogeneous requirement structure. Its requirements range from architectural services to the construction of airport infrastructure including maintenance, office materials, and IT services to aircraft push-backs. More than 60% (approximately €528 million) of Fraport AG’s order volume of approximately €874 million was awarded to companies in the RhineMain region in 2018. More than 91% of all orders awarded were below €10,000 and were therefore to the particular advantage of medium-sized companies. Around 30% of the order volume was procured for services. The orders primarily concerned security, temporary employment, cleaning and IT services. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 32 50% of the order volume was procured for construction. This does not include the orders by the Group company FAS GmbH responsible for the Expansion South project. The other 20% was placed in the market for consumables. Fraport AG had 2,928 active suppliers and service providers in 2018. Around 98% of the order volume was awarded to suppliers and service providers based in Germany, approximately 1% to those based in the EU and about 1% to those based in the US and Switzerland. As there are comparable legal standards in these countries, in particular in relation to respect for human rights (see page 29) and anti-corruption and bribery matters (see page 30), the first level of Fraport AG’s supply chain is not deemed critical. Although orders with business partners and suppliers based outside the aforementioned countries seem insignificant in relation to the total order volume, of which they make up less than one percent, business relationships with suppliers from risk countries, known as the “Primary Impact Countries” (in accordance with the FTSE4Good Index), in particular require particular care. For this reason, an examination of the first level of the supply chain by contractors’ country of origin is an essential part of regular monthly reporting for the “Central Purchasing, Construction Contracts” central unit. If contracts for product groups that include suppliers or service providers from risk countries are to be put out to tender and awarded, the potential contractors will be reviewed depending on the order value. This also applies to orders for work clothes, for example. Fraport periodically checks in which countries production sites are located. If a business relationship is started with a supplier from one of these countries, sanction lists are extensively checked in advance. Sanction lists are official lists of people, groups or organizations subject to economic or legal restrictions. If there are irregularities, further checks are planned which may result in the withdrawal of an order. Fraport AG has fulfilled the legally compliant assignment of external personnel based on independent service and work contracts, as opposed to temporary work, by implementing external staff compliance within the framework of a directive on assignment and deployment of external personnel. The directive includes a mandatory inspection process in determining different types of contracts and reduces the risk of false service or work contracts or covert contracts for temporary work. This review process also includes the assignment of external personnel by Group companies for Fraport AG. The Group companies independently ensure the legally compliant assignment of external personnel by implementing suitable processes. A separate procurement process via the Group company Fraport Ausbau Süd was defined for the Expansion South project, in particular Terminal 3 in Frankfurt, due to the size and complexity of the project. By submitting an offer in this procurement process, building companies are obliged to comply with all requirements in the Posted Workers Act (Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz, AEntG) and the Minimum Wage Act (Mindestlohngesetz, MiLoG), to make contributions to the collective bargaining parties’ joint facilities, and also to only engage subcontractors or other third parties that meet these requirements. The Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct also forms part of any agreement. A due diligence review process was defined for purchases made for the construction of Terminal 3, which has since been carried out depending on the order value. In addition to mandatory checking of sanction lists and company information, this includes extensive research online on potential business partners before business relationships are started. The five largest suppliers to Fraport AG according to order volume are the companies FraSec, FraGround, Total Mineralöl, FraCareS, and Lüftungsanlagenund Gebäudetechnik LAG. Fraport AG wholly owns the Group companies FraSec, FraGround, and FraCareS. These mainly involve ground services and security services. As fully consolidated Group companies, they must adopt the Code of Conduct for employees and are also obliged to comply with the Group Compliance Management System (CMS) policy. These guidelines include instructions to make the Supplier Code of Conduct part of the General Terms and Conditions and to use it insofar as this is possible for the Group companies pursuant to national law. If such inclusion in the General Terms and Conditions is not possible, or is only possible if the Supplier Code of Conduct is modified, the local management shall inform the GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 33 department dealing with compliance at Fraport AG. The company Total Mineralöl supplies the Frankfurt site with fuel and is subject to the aforementioned conditions, as is the case for Lüftungsanlagenund Gebäudetechnik LAG. The international Group companies must also comply with all components of the Group CMS policy. This applies in particular to large construction projects such as the new terminal at Lima Airport. In Lima, compliance with the Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct is an integral part of the contract with the general contractor and its subcontractors. Fraport Greece also obliges its business partners and suppliers to comply with the Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct, which is an integral part of the contract with the general contractor for the expansion and modernization of the Greek regional airports. The Brazilian Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre also include the Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct as part of the contract with the general contractor. GRI 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain In 2018, there were no significant changes in terms of suppliers’ sites or relationships with suppliers, including selection and termination. Fraport does not have a traditional supply chain.

GRI 102-11 Precautionary principle or approach The Fraport Group has a comprehensive, Group-wide risk and opportunity management system, which makes it possible for Fraport to identify and analyze risks at an early stage, and to control and limit those risks using appropriate measures, as well as to take advantage of opportunities. This results in the early identification of potential risks that could jeopardize the Fraport Group (see Risk and Opportunities Report in the Annual Report 2018, page 113 et seqq.). Furthermore, our business model supports a precautionary approach when dealing with environmental problems and also takes into account aspects such as cost efficiency, economic feasibility, and sustainability of our environmental programs (see Environmental Statement 2017, page 8 in the Publications/Environmental Statements area on https://www.fraport.com/en/ourcompany/responsibility/publications.html). A range of comprehensive measures directed toward preventive health and safety are designed to avoid the physical, psychological, and social forms of stress that employees experience at work as far as possible. If stress cannot be avoided, the preventive measures are intended to reduce or compensate for it (see “Occupational health and safety” in the area of GRI 400: SOCIAL). The Executive Board and the employee representative bodies have formulated a statement of principles on occupational health and safety and incorporated it into the Group guidelines. Safety is the key requirement for air traffic. This principle applies equally to passenger traffic and air freight. This is why safety management has always been a top priority for Fraport. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed at Frankfurt Airport to guarantee the security of passengers, baggage, and cargo. The Safety Management System (SMS) at Fraport AG is an instrument set up in conformity with the ICAO standards and recommendations. It records and evaluates all events relevant to safety in airport operations and potential weak points in the operating processes. The SMS is directed toward all users of Frankfurt Airport; the relevant processes, procedures, and responsibilities are defined in a manual accessible to all internal personnel (see https://www.fraport.com/en/business-partner/services/safety-management-system.html). GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 34 GRI 102-12 External initiatives Voluntary initiatives (selection): Fraport AG has made a commitment to comply with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct to promote responsible corporate governance at all Group sites – the principles of the UN Global Compact (since July 2007), the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Corporate Governance Code of Fraport AG as early as 2002. The Code describes the key principles for the management and monitoring of the Company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and responsible corporate governance. The Fraport Code also includes the key rights of the shareholders who provide the company with the necessary equity capital and bear the entrepreneurial risk. The Fraport Code is firmly based on the German Corporate Governance Code. In addition, Fraport signed the Business Conduct Rules of the biggest European purchasing association, the German Association of Materials Management, Purchasing, and Logistics (BME) in 2009. The Rules are based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and include fundamental anti-corruption rules, antitrust agreements, rules on child labor and forced labor, and rules on compliance with human rights, environmental protection, health protection, and fair working conditions. The companies signing up to the agreement have made a commitment to promote the “Business Conduct Rules” with their suppliers in the best possible way. Since 2002, Fraport has been a member of Transparency International German Chapter e.V. (https://www.transparency.de/en/). Equal opportunities, diversity, and achieving the right work-life balance for career and family are key elements of our employment policy. In 2007, Fraport signed the Charter of Diversity and in 2013 the Charter on Compatibility of Career and Caregiving Activities in Hesse. Signatories of this charter aim to support their employees in taking responsibility for relatives who need care. Since 2006, Fraport has been contributing its climate reporting to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP), the world’s leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. In addition, since 2009 Fraport has participated in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI, with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European airports to adopt CO₂-neutral operation. Mandatory initiatives: Reporting is in accordance with the standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). As the capital market-oriented parent company of the Fraport Group, Fraport AG is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS (see Annual Report 2018, Basis for the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, page 148). For indexes, awards, and memberships, see https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport/about-us/awards.html. GRI 102-13 Memberships of associations Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV, http://www.adv.aero/) and Airports Council International (ACI, http://www.aci.aero/) Europe and World. Fraport is also a member of the Federation of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL, http://www.bdl.aero/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for Germany and has defined its target as highlighting its contribution to safe mobility, climate protection, and environmental protection. We are working together with bodies of these organizations to prepare positions on air traffic issues. They also include positions on projected legislation and political initiatives (see https://www.fraport.com/en/ourcompany/fraport/about-us/european-topics-associations.html).

Medium-term objectives are set out in “Our program” (“Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 50 et seqq.). See also “Understanding of sustainability” in the Responsibility/Publications/Sustainability Report 2018/Referenced document at https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/responsibility/publications.html. Ethics and Integrity GRI 102-16 Values, principles, standards and norms of behavior The Supervisory Board of Fraport AG adopted the Fraport AG Corporate Governance Code as early as 2002 and has since continually developed it in compliance with the recommendations and suggestions made by the Government Commission of the German Corporate Governance Code. The Code describes the key principles for the management and monitoring of the company and includes internationally and nationally recognized standards for good and responsible corporate governance (see Fraport AG Corporate Governance Code and Joint Statement on Corporate Governance at https://www.fraport.com/en/ourcompany/investors/corporate-governance.html). Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, we have made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD principles, and the ILO core labor standards. Fraport included these obligations in the Code of Conduct for Employees in 2013. Fraport as well as suppliers are committed to complying with these basic principles (see Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG/Code of Conduct for Suppliers of Fraport AG at https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport/management/compliance.html). In accordance with Fraport’s fundamental compliance values of probity, integrity, trustworthiness, responsibility, transparency, loyalty, and fairness, we aspire to act with social, economic, and environmental responsibility in our business dealings and see sustainability as designing the future. The reputation of our company is a key element in our success. We all contribute through our daily work to the positive perception of Fraport. The Code of Conduct for Employees was most recently edited and updated in 2016. It covers the subjects of compliance, working conditions, and human rights. Similar to the Code of Conduct for Employees, the Code for suppliers also contains the aspects of environmental conservation and climate protection. The Fraport AG Supplier Code of Conduct was also substantially revised in 2016. Fraport commits business partners and suppliers to adhere to the the Supplier Code of Conduct and to comply with the law in general and the anti-corruption principles in particular. They must also ensure that their suppliers adhere to these principles. Part of the supplier code of conduct is an anti-corruption clause, which defines serious misconduct (offenses). A violation of this GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 36 code may result in the termination of the business relationship. Further, in the case of antitrust violations and serious misconduct, a contractual penalty and flat-rate claim for damages may be imposed. The Code of Conduct for Employees of Fraport AG applies to all employees of Fraport. As the Code of Conduct is incorporated into the compliance management system policy, all controlled subsidiaries in Germany and abroad are required to implement it. For foreign investments, the code is published in the respective local language. Training on value-based compliance takes place by e-learning at Fraport AG and within the subsidiaries under the responsibility of the local senior management. Repeat training on compliance is planned at 3-year intervals. Business partners are not offered compulsory training. All new Group employees receive the Code of Conduct along with the employment contract. The Legal Affairs and Compliance department regularly collects information from the subsidiaries on the status of implementation of the Group CMS policy. The company management and the local compliance officers are responsible for the binding introduction and implementation of the Group compliance policy. Fraport is engaged at all Group sites in maintaining natural habitats and is striving for preventative environmental management. The environmental policy of Fraport AG was passed and signed in 2008 by the Company’s Executive Board (for further information see Environmental Statement 2017, page 8 in the Publications/Environment area on www.fraport.com/en/responsibility). It is therefore binding for the whole Group. The Environmental Statement based on a preventative approach for handling natural resources and obliges us to undertake all business activities in an environmentally friendly way. At each of our fully consolidated Group airports there is an environmental management system or is being developed that is used to detect and minimize risks. The long track record of experience enjoyed by Frankfurt Airport in environmental protection provides a tangible benefit for all Group sites, for example in the form of training courses and technical support, including on-site assistance. The guideline “Sustainable building at Frankfurt Airport” was developed for the main site in 2014. This guideline primarily addresses builders and designers and should help to incorporate holistic principles of sustainable construction in the early stages of the project. Building projects at the Frankfurt site make up one of the most resource-intensive areas and significantly contribute to the environmentally unfriendly and climate-damaging emissions. Each building that is not optimized in terms of energy and ecological efficiency represents an ecological burden for decades to come, which can only be rectified – if at all – with extremely high financial expenses. In addition to requirements for low resource consumption, low CO2 emissions and low operating costs, buildings are increasingly faced with requirements relating to comfort and ease of use. Moreover, the outdated model of placing the sole focus on the cost of a building has now evolved into a multi-dimensional consideration of the building throughout its entire life cycle. Appropriate planning tools are described in detail, showing the impact of planning on the entire life cycle of the building. By implementing a holistic approach, planning reliability can be increased, innovative concepts recognized at an early stage, and active contributions made to reaching climate protection goals. In the 2018 fiscal year, Fraport continued with the implementation of its Group strategy developed based on the mission statement implemented in 2015/2016. In order to ensure the achievement of the strategic objectives of this mission statement and react to changing market conditions with more focus, seven strategic challenges were formulated within the scope of the 2018 strategy process. The strategic programs presented below have been intensified to identify the defined challenges and corresponding Group objectives (see “Annual Report 2018”, page 61 et seqq.). The Group’s mission statement aims to define Fraport’s understanding of important issues. Our understanding of management, amongst other matters, is also described here. With these established aspirations we want to give management activity a common orientation and obligation and thus make our contribution to achieving the corporate objectives.

Monitoring and tracking: Fraport has implemented a Whistleblower System at many of its sites. This is an important tool for preventing or uncovering breaches in codes. In 2009, Fraport implemented the electronic Whistleblower System BKMS® (see https://www.bkmssystem.net/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=6fra1&language=eng) at the parent company. Fraport employees, business partners, and customers have the opportunity to submit confidential reports about irregularities around the clock using an Internetbased communication platform. This means that information on corruption, economic crime, and infringements of code of conducts can be reported anonymously throughout the world at any time. Since 2009, the whistleblower system has been successively introduced in our Group companies in the respective national language or the English version of the system. Fraport has also appointed an external lawyer as an ombudswoman. She additionally accepts reports on company-related crimes, inadmissible business practices, and serious infringements of regulations. Since 2003, employees at the Frankfurt site have also had an internal ombudsperson they can turn to. We have numerous management systems to establish responsible corporate governance in the business processes. These include, for example, environmental, health and safety, and quality management. Under the umbrella term “process-oriented quality management”, Fraport AG operates a system that is used to maintain and further develop a process-oriented organization with a focus on our new mission statement of a “Gute Reise”. In this system, the essential processes of Fraport AG are systematically and continuously checked and further developed to be able to offer customers continuously high quality and thus ensure the competitiveness of our company. Certification of the quality management system (QMS) in accordance with ISO 9001 was successfully completed as early as 1996. Beginning in 2000, certification was expanded to Group companies and a certification association was formed. Currently, this association comprises 18 companies. A key result of our quality management system is the creation of synergies within the Group certification association. The awareness of the processes implemented in the company and their effectiveness, efficiency, and interaction are essential for sustainable corporate success. In order to maintain the high level of process quality and, if necessary, improve it with the relevant responsible persons, we conduct internal audits regularly within the scope of the quality management system. Internal audits are used as a self-monitoring instrument. The basis for the internal audits is the international standard ISO 9001:2015 on which the QMS is based, and the underlying international standards for the management system as well as the relevant legislation (such as laws and administrative regulations and relevant regulatory decisions), the specific instructions, for example, contracts with customers, service level agreements, operational, process, or work instructions all serve as the basis for the internal audit. Random checks are made to see whether the relevant legal and any other requirements for the respective process as well as the internal rules are known and how they are implemented. Through the use of qualified auditors from Group companies for internal audits, we are able to generate a considerable number of improvement potentials in key business processes each year. Through intensive and open communication of the audit results from the various companies, synergy effects are created through learning from others . The procedure for internal audits is set out in the company’s own process instructions. The internal auditors are independent in accordance with DIN EN ISO 19011. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 38 The audits are planned and conducted pursuant to DIN EN ISO 19011 and evaluated and documented in a management audit program (MAP). The effectiveness and efficiency of the processes are thus continuously questioned and improved. Since 1999, Fraport AG has conducted a regular audit at Frankfurt Airport using state authorized and supervised environmental assessors. The basis for this is the European regulation on the “Eco-Management and Audit Scheme” (EMAS). Since 2002, the audit has also applied the international ISO 14001 standard. These audits under EMAS and ISO 14001 included Frankfurt Cargo Services GmbH (FCS) in 2008, N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH (N*ICE) in 2009, Energy Air GmbH in 2014, and GCS Gesellschaft für Cleaning Services mbH & Co. as well as FraGround Fraport Ground Services GmbH in 2017. Lima Airport, Ljubljana Airport, and the terminal operation in Antalya have been certified in conformity with ISO 14001. The airports in Varna and Burgas have introduced environmental management systems. In addition, the airports in Frankfurt, Antalya, and Ljubljana are involved with the Airport Carbon Accreditation of the Airports Council International (ACI) Europe. Procedures to monitor sustainable performance: Since 2014, decision-relevant sustainability issues have been discussed in meetings of the Executive Board including the relevant heads of the business, service and central units, which increases their binding nature and is accompanied by an increase in significance. These include passing the materiality matrix and program as well as awarding significant sustainability projects. The Executive Board undertakes monitoring and control of the issues relevant to sustainability (see “Strategy, Objectives and Organization” on https://www.fraport.com/content/fraport/en/our-company/responsibility/at-a-glance/strategy-and-goals.html). Key opportunities and risks: The Fraport Group has a comprehensive, Group-wide risk and opportunity management system. This that risks and opportunities are identified at an early stage, are evaluated, controlled, and monitored in a standardized manner and are transparently communicated using a systematic reporting (see Annual Report 2018, page 23 and page 113 et seqq.). GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 39 Governance GRI 102-18 Governance structure In accordance with German legislation, Fraport is governed by a dual management system: The Executive Board manages the company with responsibility for sustainable growth in the interests of the company, i.e., taking account of the requirements of the shareholders, its employees, and the other stakeholder groups associated with the Company. The Executive Board develops the strategic direction of the company, defines it together with the Supervisory Board, and ensures its implementation. The Executive Board is responsible for compliance with the statutory regulations and internal company guidelines, and ensures compliance within the Group. The Executive Board also ensures appropriate risk management and risk controlling within the Company. The Supervisory Board appoints, monitors, and advises the Executive Board. Decisions of fundamental importance for the company require the consent of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has 20 members and has equal shareholder and employee representation. The shareholder representatives are appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The employee representatives are elected by the employees in accordance with the provisions of the Co-determination Act. The term of office is five years. More detailed information on the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the composition and work of the Board is provided in the 2018 Annual Report (see Annual Report 2018, page 19 et seqq.). A list compiled by the Supervisory Board relating to diversity aspects is provided in the section “Key Figures”.

Stakeholder Engagement GRI 102-40 List of stakeholder groups See “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 45 et seq. GRI 102-41 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements In the Fraport Group, 96.5% (previous year: 95.8%) of all employees are employed and paid under collective bargaining agreements. The difference to 100% is made up of employees of smaller Group companies who are not subject to a collective bargaining agreement. These are mainly employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements or senior managers. See GRI 102-41 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements in the area of Key figures Personnel. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 40 GRI 102-42 Identification and selection of stakeholders The stakeholder groups relevant for us and to be included were defined with the involvement of the Executive Board and representatives from individual departments. We seek a dialog with our business partners, our customers, and with politicians. We also seek dialog with our critics, particularly those people who live near the airport and experience the negative impacts of aircraft noise. Last but not least, we are also dedicated to looking after more than 81,000 employees (as of: 2015) at the biggest workplace in Germany. As a large company, we bear direct, to some extent, as well as indirect social responsibility for these people. GRI 102-43 Approach to stakeholder engagement Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our stakeholder groups. This includes conducting regular surveys and operating systematic feedback management for our passengers, and the continual exchange of views with local authorities and citizens on subjects relating to the airport (see Service Quality in the GRI 400 SOCIAL section and Our Values Sustainability Report 2018 , p. 45). GRI 102-44 Key topics and concern raised Approach to integration of the interests of the stakeholders: The systematic exchange of information with the most important internal and external stakeholders enables us to develop perspectives for the strategic alignment of the company. We outline below the opportunities we want to take forward into the future. We show significant risks in our annual report (see Annual Report 2018, page 113 et seqq.). In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, the materiality matrix needed to be further developed in 2018 to include a total of three dimensions: the relevance of sustainability issues for the company and the stakeholders as well as the impact of the direct and indirect activities of the Fraport Group on the relevant sustainability issues. To do this, the content of the materiality matrix was first reviewed in terms of the requirements of the GRI Standards and in consideration of benchmark results (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 46). Fraport’s management at the Frankfurt site as well as the management of the fully consolidated Group companies and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, bank representatives, shareholders, analysts, investors, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, economic associations, scientific bodies, NGOs, local residents living near airports, the media) assessed in an online survey the relevance of the 14 sustainability topics regarding the company’s viability in the future. Fraport management was also asked to assess the economic, ecological, and social impact of Fraport business activities in these 14 areas (see “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 46). The surveyed stakeholders also had the opportunity to state further key issues for the future of Fraport AG – but these are covered completely in the defined areas of activity. The validity of the new materiality matrix was confirmed by the Executive Board in 2018. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 41 Resulting key issues: Our expanded program was derived from the content of the materiality matrix. It focuses on 14 sustainability topics spread among five areas of activity: “Governance” area of activity: Corporate Governance and Compliance Data protection IT security and airport safety and security “Economic enhancement” area of activity: Customer satisfaction and product quality Economic efficiency Growth and development in the Group Ideas and innovation “Employees” area of activity: Attractive and responsible employer Occupational health and safety “Community” area of activity: Value generation and commitment in the regions Noise abatement “Environment” area of activity Climate protection Conservation of nature and resources Air quality A comprehensive summary of all subjects including the associated objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 50 et seqq.). Implementation in communication: The objectives and measures of the program were passed by the Executive Board in January 2019. The program is a key element of the reporting such that the requirements of the stakeholders are also included. Reporting Practice GRI 102-45 Companies included in the consolidated financial statements See “Disclosures of shareholding pursuant to Section 313 (2) of the HGB” and “Notes to the Consolidation and Accounting Policies” (Annual Report 2018, page 230 et seqq. and page 148 et seqq.). GRI 102-46 Defining report content and topic boundaries The basis for defining the report content is a materiality matrix analysis. We focus on the principles of sustainability context, completeness, materiality, and stakeholder engagement formulated by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). From the regular and systematic exchange with our internal and external stakeholders, we gain the impetus for the strategic alignment of the company (see “Stakeholder dialogs” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 44). Since 2010, we have used this to create the GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 42 materiality matrix that depicts the company’s future challenges. The matrix is checked annually to ensure it is up to date and, if necessary, adjusted (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 46). In the course of aligning sustainability reporting with the GRI standards, the materiality matrix needed to be further developed in 2018 to identify key sustainability topics and thus future challenges for the Fraport Group. In 2018, the matrix was updated and its validity was confirmed. In defining the key issues for updating the matrix in 2018, we proceeded as follows: 1. Identification The content of the existing materiality matrix was first checked according to the GRI standards, taking account of the benchmark results and discussions with representatives of internal departments as well as external consultants. Detailed results from the last management and stakeholder survey from 2015 were also considered as well as the current extent to which targets from the sustainability topics in the program had been achieved. The aim of updating the topics was to concentrate on aspects that can be recorded with targets and measurable performance indicators (see “Updating the materiality matrix” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 46). Based on these analyses, we derived 14 sustainability topics that are of key importance to the future of the Fraport Group. The process of updating the materiality matrix and the identified topics were approved by the Executive Board. 2. Prioritization Fraport management at the Frankfurt site as well as the management of the fully consolidated Group companies and representatives of our most important stakeholders (airline companies, passengers, business partners, bank representatives, shareholders, analysts, investors, employees, employee representatives, political bodies and authorities, economic associations, scientific bodies, NGOs, local residents living near airports, the media) assessed in an online survey the relevance of the 14 sustainability topics regarding the company’s viability in the future. Fraport management was also asked to assess the economic, ecological, and social impact of Fraport business activities as regards these 14 topics (see “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 46 et seq.). 3. Validation After carrying out the stakeholder survey, the results were checked internally and the updated materiality matrix was approved by the Executive Board. The main and relevant GRI topics were then allocated to the sustainability topics in the materiality matrix. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 43 GRI 102-47 List of material topics After updating the materiality matrix, the 14 sustainability topics were assigned to the key GRI topics. Sustainability Topics Assigned GRI Topics Corporate Governance and Compliance Anti‐corruption Human Rights Assessment Environmental Compliance Socio‐economic Compliance IT Security and Airport Safety and Security Customer Health and Safety Business Continuity and Disaster Management (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Security Practices Data Protection Customer Privacy Customer Satisfaction and Product Quality Marketing and Labeling Service Quality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Provisions of Services and Facilities for People with Special Needs (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Economic Efficiency Economic Performance Growth and Development in the Group Market Presence Ideas and Innovation Attractive and Responsible Employer Employment Labor/Management Relations Training and Education Diversity and Equal Opportunity Non‐discrimination Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining Occupational Health and Safety Occupational Health and Safety Value Generation and Engagement in the Regions Market Presence Indirect Economic Impacts Public Policy Local Communities Noise Abatement Noise (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Climate Protection Energy Emissions Intermodality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Conservation of Nature and Resources Water Biodiversity Effluents and Waste Air Quality Emissions Refer to “Materiality matrix” in „Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018“, page 46. In addition, relevant aspects that are key requirements for operating an airport were determined and these continue to be part of the reporting. This covers the topics “Procurement Practices”, “Anti-competitive behavior”, “Child labor”, “Forced or compulsory labor”, “Indigenous rights”, “Supplier social assessment” and “Supplier environmental assessment”. GRI 102-48 Restatements of information The key figure of “Women in management positions” was adjusted to the key figure in “Our program” (see GRI 405-1 Composition of employees in the chapter Key figures/Personnel). This current report shows the “Women in management positions (first and second level below the Executive Board)”. In addition, the turnover rate was harmonized. From now on, the turnover rate is presented based on the key figure in the Annual Report. The turnover rate presented thus far according to GRI can continue to GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Univeral GRI Standards 44 be calculated in the same way (the number of employees leaving the company among all permanent employees / permanent employees * 100); in 2018, this rate was 8.6%. Instead of the industry-specific figure AO7: Change of people residing in areas affected by noise, the key performance indicator from “Our program” is reported: LOG noise area: Area affected by a Leq, day of 55 dB(A). Given its relevance, N*ICE is also presented in the area Key figures/Environment when defining AO6 Aircraft and pavement deicing agents. At Frankfurt Airport, N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH (N*ICE) is responsible for the de-icing of the aircraft. N*ICE is a group company that is not fully consolidated in the Group. Fraport AG holds 52% of the shares, while Swissport France Holding SAS has a 48% stake in the company. See also “Changes compared with the previous year” in the Annual Report 2018, page 58 et seqq.

GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 47 Specific Standard Disclosures GRI 200 ECONOMIC Management Approach EC Alongside our function of providing transport, our owners are interested in safeguarding value and income over the long term, i.e., sustainable corporate development. We want to continuously increase the assets of Fraport, generate a reasonable return on ’shareholders’ equity, and generate the financial means that are necessary for financing future development. Target attainment is measured by various indicators such as value added, ROFRA (Return on Fraport Assets), revenue, and the result. Fraport plans and controls the development of the Group in accordance with the principles of value-based management since 2001 with the objective of bringing about a sustainable increase in corporate value. The key measurement and steering figure of this strategy is the “Fraport value added”, which is calculated as the difference between adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) – added to the result of the Group companies valued at-equity before taxes) and the company’s capital costs (Fraport assets x cost of capital) (for further information see Annual Report 2018, page 69 et seqq.). The highest level in the organization that takes responsibility for the economic performance is the Chief Financial officer (CFO). The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored, and delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level (see Annual Report 2018, page 113 et seqq). Objectives and measures can be found in “Our program” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 50 et seqq. See also “Growth and development in the Group” in the Annual Report 2018, page 83 et seqq. See also “Ideas and innovation” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 80 et seq. GRI 201 Economic Performance – Management Approach The section “Economic Report” in the management report of the Annual Report 2018 includes information on business development in 2018 (see Annual Report 2018, page 83 et seqq.). Information on the risks and opportunities of the company are explained in the risk and opportunities report of the Annual Report 2018, page 113 et seqq. See also General Management Approach EC in the area of GRI 200 ECONOMIC. GRI 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed See 201-1 in the area of Key Figures Finance. GRI 201-2 Financial implications, risks, and opportunities due to climate change The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Group-wide risk and opportunity management system to identify, control, and limit risks and detect opportunities. The reference time frame is the rolling 24-month period. As a result of the longer time frames for climate change and the characteristics, the risk and opportunities view is conducted within the environmental management system. The increase in unpredictable extreme weather events over the past decades that can be attributed to climate change can increasingly be felt in Europe with regard to the operation of airports (for example: increase in heavy rain, severe thunderstorms, hailstorms, wind gusts, fog, as well as the trend towards warmer summers [number of summer days >25°C (77°F) and heat waves] GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 48 coupled with severe drought). As a result, this will likely lead to more and more to business interruptions, delays, capacity cutbacks, damage to the airport infrastructure as well as rebound effects caused by extreme weather events in both target and home destinations. In summer an increased need to cool the buildings and aircraft on the ground (APU operations) can be expected, which requires more energy and incurs higher energy costs. Hotter and more humid summers may also have negative effects on the health of employees (for example rapid dehydration, increased cardiovascular stress, sunstroke, heatstroke, lightning strikes). An electricity “blackout” due to network instability is also possible, which would affect operational readiness (among other things due to drought-related constraints/failures at thermal power plants) as well as the softening of asphalt on exposed surfaces and thus corresponding potential capacity cutbacks. Failure of data centers due to overheating cannot be ruled out either. Fraport AG is taking various measures to address the effects of climate change, such as adapting the volumes of rainwater holding tanks, expanding winter service facilities, cooling surfaces relevant to flight operations on hot days and various activities to protect employees’ health. The potentially rising energy consumption in buildings (for example due to more air conditioning) is countered by construction and organizational measures to reduce consumption. Tighter regulatory requirements due to climate change can also be seen as an opportunity. The development of the energy efficiency requirements, for example, supports the operational efforts to reduce energy consumption as well as the emissions and costs associated with this. The standards are met by measures in existing and new buildings. For example, the new head office is certified by DGNB for reducing life-cycle costs via energy savings and selecting easily reusable materials. Fraport expects increasing requirements for the energy efficiency of the vehicles and equipment used on a daily basis, so we are gradually converting our fleet. Physical opportunities exist in the predicted trend of global warming. Fraport could, for example, benefit from the expected increase in average temperatures during the winter months by being able to reduce the cost (resources, personnel, costs) of clearing the site, aprons, and runways. This could also apply to aircraft de-icing. In addition, this would reduce the energy consumed in the terminals and administration buildings during the winter months, and therefore lower CO2 emissions and costs. Since 2006, Fraport has regularly reported to CDP. Further Information: https://www.cdp.net/en/responses?utf8=%E2%9C%93&queries%5Bname%5D=fraport.

GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 49 GRI 201-4 Financial assistance received from government In 2018, we received subsidies in the amount of €9,530.81 for the CHIPS project. CHIPS (Cycle Highways Innovation for smarter People Transport and Spatial Planning) is a European initiative with the goal of establishing cycle highways as a new mobility option. The capital expenditure carried out within the scope of CHIPS focuses on the needs of bicycle commuters. The idea is to develop an innovative and well-placed commuter infrastructure for the network of cycle highways. Fraport AG and Gateway Gardens Grundstücksgesellschaft, as a sub-partner of the regional association, will invest in the cycling infrastructure. The funds will be used for a “mobile” mobility station which will house the participation and information center for the CHIPS project as well as a workshop for repairs and servicing for employees who commute by bicycle. In addition, ten bike boxes with charging stations for e-bikes and bicycle parking facilities and pedelecs will be purchased. In 2018, the “E-Bus4 Fraport” project received funding from the State of Hesse in the amount of €6,400.00. The “E-Bus4Fraport” project will test two battery-powered electric buses for passenger transport for the Fraport AG ground transport services. The buses have been ordered and should be put into operation in summer 2019. Fraport AG is a joint-stock company under German law. The shares are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and are included in the MDAX, the index for mid-sized German joint-stock companies. On account of the shares held by the State of Hesse and Stadtwerke Frankfurt am Main Holding GmbH, and the consortium agreement between these companies, Fraport AG is a company controlled by these shareholders (see also Annual Report 2018, “Relationships with affiliated companies”, page 75). Information on the funding relates to the Fraport parent company and was included in the reporting for the first time in 2018. GRI 202 Market Presence – Management Approach The Fraport Group is among the leading global airport groups with its international portfolio. Fraport provides all airport and terminal operation services and associated services. Fraport also provides planning and consultancy services and has operational and administrative activities. Passenger traffic, which impacts on a majority of the services the Group provides, is key to the Group’s revenue and earnings performance. See “Situation of the Group”, Annual Report 2018, page 54 et seqq., Visual Factbook in the Investor Relations/Publications section at www.fraport.com. See also https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport /fraport-group.html. GRI 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage compared to local minimum wage Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 88% of the Group’s employees work at this site. 96.5% of all Group companies (see GRI 102-41 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements) have collective bargaining agreements in place. These significantly exceed the local minimum wage standards. In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement for public service workers, which apply to the parent company and individual Group companies, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form the basis for assessment. Only the actual job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 50 GRI 202-2 Hirings from the local community Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation, as 88% of the employees in the Group work at this site. Fraport has no corporate policy covering the entire organization and does not implement a procedure for preferring local residents in recruitment. In foreign subsidiary companies, employees from within the country are generally employed because of the specifics of the business. Only a small number of managers are seconded from the parent company. AO1 Passengers See AO1 Passengers in the area of Key Figures Finance.

GRI 203 Indirect Economic Impacts – Management Approach Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to economic and social value creation. Frankfurt Airport, for example, with almost 81,000 direct employees (as of December 31, 2015), is the largest regional place of work in Germany. Additional employment effects are also created in enterprises that are appointed by Fraport for the construction and modernization of airport infrastructures. With a catchment area of around 38 million people in a radius of approximately 200 kilometers and in its role as the largest cargo airport in Europe, the Frankfurt site is one of the country’s most important business locations. In this context, Fraport makes a major contribution to social value creation. The company’s direct value creation includes expenses for personnel, capital expenditure, taxes, interest, and dividends to its shareholders. Over the past fiscal year, corporate performance (gross value generation) amounted to approximately €3.7 billion. The net value added amounted to around €2.4 billion. The Fraport Group’s indirect value creation includes consumption by airport employees and companies located at each airport, which also have their own value chain and employment effects and thus directly and indirectly make a contribution to the positive economic development of their respective regions. See also https://www.fraport.de/de/nachbarschaft-region/entwicklung-standort-fra-umwelt.html. GRI 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services for public benefit/Community engagement As an operator of the German airport with the biggest volume of traffic, we have a particular commitment to the Frankfurt/RhineMain region. We have a strong track record over many years of contributing to a wide variety of sporting, social, cultural, and environmental activities. These include donations and sponsorship for numerous clubs, cultural activities, charitable organizations, and educational institutions. For further information see GRI 413 Local Communities. You will find an overview of the expenditure for donations, sponsorship, and the Environmental Fund under “GRI 413 Community engagement” in the area of Key Figures Finance. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 51 GRI 203-2 Indirect economic impacts / Community engagement Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to economic and social value creation. There is predominantly potential for growth in companies that offer security services and at authorities. The people who live in the metropolitan region around the airport also benefit from this. They not only benefit from the short journey to the airport; many of them also work at a company that benefits from being close to the airport. Over 60% (€528 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €874 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. More than 91% of all orders awarded were below €10,000 and were therefore to the particular advantage of small and medium-sized companies. In 2018, orders to companies in the region are expected to remain at a similarly high level. This is complemented by the economic power of some 500 companies based at the airport. The tax volume generated by the “Airport corporate complex” contributed to financing public services such as schools, sports facilities, hospitals, universities, and social services. See also https://www.fraport.de/de/nachbarschaft-region/entwicklung-standort-fra-umwelt/wirtschaftsfaktorflughafen.html. The airport is also important for the entire Federal Republic of Germany because the German economy is mainly dependent on exports. Many companies rely on short delivery times and fast turnover of goods in order to be in a position to operate successfully in global markets for sourcing and sales. Air traffic is a necessary prerequisite for this. Frankfurt Airport plays a crucial role for Germany in this respect. GRI 204 Procurement Practices GRI 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant location of operation and the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region is defined as local. Over 60% (€528 million) of the order volume from the parent company totaling €874 million was placed with companies in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region. On account of the legal requirements for the airport operator as a sector contracting entity, it is not possible for Fraport AG to show preference to companies located in the immediate vicinity or within the wider area when awarding contracts. GRI 205 Anti-corruption – Management Approach Ensuring legal and compliant behavior in the Fraport Group is part of the corporate culture as it has been laid out, in particular, in the code of conduct for employees. The Code of Conduct applicable to all employees worldwide takes into account the United Nations’ anti-corruption conventions and is based on the ten Global Compact principles, the OECD guidelines, and the ILO Core Labor Standards. It covers corruption prevention and antitrust and competition law, among other things. The Executive Board is expressly committed to these principles as well as the zero tolerance principle, in particular in respect to corruption and violations of antitrust and competition law. The Code of Conduct is a key part of the Compliance Management Systems (CMS) of the Group companies and of Fraport AG’s CMS. The comprehensive analysis of compliance risks, which is focused on the areas of anticorruption, bribery, and antitrust and competition law, forms another important part of the CMS. The objective of the Compliance Management Systems in the Fraport Group is to ensure corporate management based on values and with integrity which goes beyond the mere fulfillment of standards. The value-based corporate culture is the basis of the stable further development of the Compliance Management Systems. They are designed to be preventive and should enable Fraport employees to become aware of compliance risks and violations at an early stage and respond to them appropriately. For Fraport AG, the Executive Board has expressly committed to this value-based compliance. With the Group-wide Code of Conduct as well as various communication measures, the Executive Board supports the Managing Directors of the Group companies as well as Fraport AG employees and their managers to meet their responsibility to continuously implement the compliance targets. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 52 Semi-annual compliance reports inform the Executive Board about the activities of the department dealing with compliance of Fraport AG and the status of measures to combat corruption. Both the Code of Conduct and the Compliance Guidelines are available to all employees on the internal information portals. The certified electronic whistleblower system (BKMS® System), which is available within the Fraport Group, is an important tool for preventing or uncovering violations and thus preventing corruption and bribery. The ombudswoman commissioned by Fraport AG receives reports from employees of the German group companies and Fraport AG as well as customers, suppliers, and other business partners which may be the subject of corruption and bribery. Employees in Germany can also contact their internal representative. In the interests of strengthening integrity and corruption prevention, Fraport AG laid out guidelines for accepting gifts and invitations in a new policy in fiscal year 2018. Compliance due diligence is a standard process in Fraport AG’s strategic business unit “Global Investments and Management”, meaning that significant compliance aspects, such as reviews of business partners on the topics of corruption, price fixing, and fraud, are taken into account for each capital expenditure project and for consulting services. The internal audit department provides independent and objective audit and consulting services in all major business units of Fraport AG, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, and Group companies, and compliance audits. The focal points of the audits are developed on the basis of a standardized, risk-oriented, planned approach. The Group companies implement the Fraport Standards for the CMS based on the policy on the Group CMS. The Compliance Management Systems of the Group companies also ensure that the corporate culture of Fraport AG is transferred to the entire Group. Similar to Fraport AG, the compliance risk analysis is the focus of the local Compliance Management Systems. Measures to prevent corruption are derived by the Group companies on the basis of this compliance risk analysis. These include, for example, training measures and the addition of compliance-related processes. Within the scope of large financing projects, additional measures against corruption and bribery are implemented in the Group companies, in part as stipulated by external lenders. Within the context of the invitation to bid for the expansion of the airport, the Group company Lima has obliged all bidders to sign an anti-corruption agreement. In accordance with Brazilian law, the Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre trained their employees in the topic of anti-corruption and held separate trainings for executives in fiscal year 2018. The aforementioned organizational concepts for identifying and reporting irregularities ensures that the Executive Board gains direct knowledge of any known cases of corruption and bribery or any other relevant information. In fiscal year 2018, there was no agreement with any business partner terminated due to allegations of corruption. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 53 GRI 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption The internal audit department provides independent and objective audit and consulting services in all major business units of Fraport AG, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, and Group companies, and compliance audits. The focal points of the audits are developed on the basis of a standardized, risk-oriented, planned approach. Fraport AG has extensively analyzed the results of the compliance risk analysis from 2017 and informed the Executive Board of this at the beginning of December 2017. These results formed the substantive requirements for the compliance program of Fraport AG in 2018. In the interests of strengthening integrity and corruption prevention, Fraport AG therefore laid out guidelines, in particular, for accepting gifts and invitations in a new policy in fiscal year 2018. GRI 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures Fraport parent company The Executive Board of Fraport AG is informed about compliance activities and progress made on measures to combat corruption in the form of semi-annual compliance reports. The management bodies do not receive dedicated training. The Code of Conduct and the relevant Compliance Guidelines are available to all employees on the internal information platforms. All business partners are informed about compliance with the Code of Conduct in the Code of Conduct for Suppliers, including the anti-corruption obligation. These are a central part of the General Terms and Conditions. The central compliance training sessions, particularly on the subject of corruption, are carried out as e-learning lessons. Our training concept involves different management levels and functions with the same obligation to undergo training. Of the 10,595 permanent staff (as at the balance sheet date of December 31, 2018), 4,468 people were obliged to undergo anti-corruption training in 2018 (42.2% of permanent employees). 82% of level 1 – 4 managers and 82% of non-management employees required to participate in training completed the “Accepting Gifts” anti-corruption module refresher training course. 81% of level 1 – 4 managers and 81% of employees required to participate in training completed the “Giving Gifts” anti-corruption module. The deadline for both is December 1, 2018, since a new anti-corruption module was rolled out which took effect after this date. In addition, classroom training on integrity and corruption risks was conducted in the year under review. Level 1 and 2 managers were trained in a special face-to-face event, focusing in particular on the topics of integrity, corruption prevention, and dealing with public officials. Group Managers and the local compliance officers are responsible for training their employees. The Group companies base the training courses on a corresponding concept, which defines, in particular, the list of addressees and the content of the training. GRI 205-3 Incidents of corruption and actions taken No cases of alleged corruption were reported and investigated in 2018 at the Fraport parent company and the Fraport investments. There were also no instances in which an agreement with a business partner was terminated due to allegations of corruption. Within the scope of an investigation for alleged bribery of a foreign official, search warrants were carried out in December 2017 including at Fraport AG. Fraport takes the allegations seriously and is investigating the matter internally. Given the ongoing investigation, no definitive statement can be made at present regarding the accusations. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – ECONOMIC 54 GRI 206 Anti-competitive behavior GRI 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trus, and monopoly practices In 2018 no substantial legal actions were pending nor were any substantial legal actions completed relating to anti-competitive practices or violations of antitrust law. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 55 GRI 300 ENVIRONMENTAL General Management Approach EN The operation of an airport and air traffic have various effects on the environment. Fraport considers itself responsible for taking due consideration of the resulting environmental requirements and expects the same of its suppliers and service providers. The environmental policy from 2008 obliges all Group companies to make use of natural resources and the environment in a sustainable, conserving and preventive manner, and to continually improve their environmental performance. To this end, there are environmental management systems at Fraport AG and all fully consolidated Group companies that are classified as “fundamentally environmentally relevant” due to their business activities. These systems are, almost without exception, certified in accordance with the relevant standard ISO 14001 or the European EMAS Regulation. Companies that join the Group and do not yet have such a system are obliged in the course of the acquisition to introduce an environmental management system. Environmental management systems serve to systematically organize, manage and monitor corporate environmental protection within the relevant company. In addition, they support those responsible for operational activities and the management with regard to the performance of their respective duties and improvements in environmental performance. The functionality and effectiveness of the environmental management systems is reviewed and certified by external certifiers (ISO 14001) or environmental verifiers (EMAS) on an ongoing basis. Fraport AG’s employees’ many years of experience in environmental management benefit all Group airports, for example in the form of technical support, including on site. Lenders explicitly call for consideration of environmental concerns in the biggest construction project at Frankfurt Airport. The European Investment Bank requires a project progress report every two years that contains the description of all significant environmental aspects for the financing of the Terminal 3. This helps to reduce environmental risks and is one of the principles of transparency, which aims to increase the reliability of the EIB Group as seen by its shareholders and the citizens of the European Union in general. In its “Environmental Impact Study for the Expansion Program of the AIJCH” updated for fiscal year 2018, the Group company Lima has laid out the requirements for the contractual implementation of the airport expansion in line with social and ecological guidelines. In addition, the Group company recognizes the “Equator Principles”, a set of rules by banks to comply with environmental and social standards in the area of project financing. Fraport’s environmental policy includes a commitment to report each year on environmental activities and performance (www.fraport.com/responsibility). To this end, the Group companies report to Fraport AG once a year on a comprehensive catalog of standardized environmental indicators and projects as well as associated improvements, and Fraport AG compiles this information for reporting purposes. The environmental management systems cover all environmental factors such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, air pollutant emissions, effects of business activities on nature and biodiversity, water consumption, and waste. The topics climate protection and the protection of environment and nature as well as air quality were determined to be important as a result of the materiality assessment according to GRI. The Coordinator for the Environmental Management System is based in the Central Unit for Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability. This Coordinator handles the necessary organizational and coordination functions, authorizes the internal environmental audit and external auditing of the Environmental Management System (in conformity with EMAS and ISO 14001), and advises the Executive Board and senior management on all issues relating to environmental management. The Coordinator for the Environmental Management System reports to the Chairman of the Executive Board in management reviews. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 56 The functions in environmental protection defined under statutory regulations are performed by the operating officers for water protection (Service Unit for Airport Expansion South), waste (Central Unit for Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability), hazardous goods and radiation protection (Central Unit for Occupational Health and Safety). The operating officers perform monitoring, advisory and facilitating actions within their specialist functions. They also report to the Executive Board. Noise and air pollution monitoring is the responsibility of the Department “Environmental Impacts Noise and Air” (Strategic Business Unit Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security). The Neighborhood Dialogue Service Center and the program for passive noise abatement are also allocated to this department. The (components of the) management approaches on the material aspects are described in detail in the Environmental Statement 2017 (see the Publications/Environmental Statements section on www.fraport.com/responsibility). The management approach is assessed via Article 18 (tasks of the environmental assessor) and Article 25 (conditions for assessment and validation) of the EMAS REGULATIONS (EU) No. 1221/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL dated November 25, 2009. The key effects were determined using the process of environmental auditing stated in Note I, EMAS REGULATIONS (EU) No. 1221/2009 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL dated November 25, 2009. Targets and measures are listed in “Our program” in the Sustainability Report 2018, page 50 et seqq. See also “Environmental Program” in the Environmental Statement 2017, page 56 et seqq. The Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability central unit is responsible for the training and education of employees, environmental auditors, and managers on environmental issues. The training courses required by law relating to hazardous goods transport and radiation protection are the responsibility of the Occupational Health and Safety unit (reports directly to the Executive Director Labor Relations), see Environmental Statement 2017, Environment policy, page 48, dangerous goods and hazardous substances, page 45 and 46 in the Publications/Environmental Statements section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html. The environmental key figures for the Fraport parent company are audited and verified in accordance with EMAS via an external environmental assessor. The assessment of the standards, methods, assumptions, and factors is part of this verification process. The environmental key figures of the Fraport Group companies are determined using comparable standards and methods. Country-typical factors are used when calculating CO2 emissions. The “Group” scope of consolidation in 2018 comprises the Fraport parent company and the fully consolidated investments with significant environmental effects. The SAP BPC system is mainly used for reporting between the Fraport parent company and the Group companies. No complaints regarding environmental impacts were received during the reporting period. Information on monitoring and tracking, and the central opportunities and risks are listed under GRI 102-16 Values, principles, standards and norms of behavior.

For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 302-2 Energy consumption outside of the organization See GRI 302-2 Energy consumption outside of the organization in the Key Figures/Environment section. The data are collected by the parent company; no records have yet been kept for the international Group companies included under IFRS. For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 302-3 Energy intensity See GRI 302-3 Energy intensity in the Key Figures/Environment section. For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption Since 2008, energy savings, which are due to facility renovations (such as the renovation of the technology centers in Terminal 1), changes to the facility operation, retooling of plants (such as the baggage conveyor system, lighting) or adaptations in energyconsuming processes (such as the baggage conveyor system), have been assessed. As savings (as a consequence of operational or technical measures) as well as increased consumption (for example, as a result of increased traffic or weather effects) generally occur at the same time in the same technical systems, this figure can only be calculated, but not measured. “Cumulative” means that the savings are essentially considered permanent, that is to say that a saving that is achieved remains in place in the following years, unless we have been provided with information that the improvement on which the saving is originally based has been undone by more recent activities (such as the removal of a regulation or the like). Each year, the saved energy quantity therefore increases by the additional (calculated) amount saved in the current year under review. Since 2013, Fraport has gradually been introducing CO2/energy consumption controlling at the Frankfurt site. This is a controlling tool for measuring and managing energy consumption. It creates transparency, helps to reduce energy costs and hence to improve energy efficiency. This tool enables us to monitor whether the strategic CO2 targets are being attained and to identify irregularities an early stage. At the same time, CO2/energy consumption controlling facilitates the reduction of equipment usage and allows successes in implementation to be communicated within the company and in the public domain. The database is provided by the GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 58 energy consumption data recorded in a highly nuanced approach for the parent company on buildings, systems, or equipment. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, and fuel for vehicles and combustibles are taken into account. Planning and construction based on life-cycle cost is implemented when portfolio buildings are refurbished and energy efficiency is enhanced. This is also the case for new buildings. See GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption in the Key Figures/Environment section. For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. See also GRI 302-3 Energy intensity in the Key Figures/Environment section.

GRI 303 Water – Management Approach Operating an airport requires a lot of water and simultaneously generates a large amount of waste water. When dealing with the legally protected resource of water, Fraport takes all aspects of modern water management into account. This includes control of consumption and quality control of the water entering the ecosystem. At Frankfurt Airport we use water sparingly and use saving techniques, among other things, in sanitary facilities and recirculation systems in vehicle washing facilities. In addition, where possible we use raw water instead of drinking water. We operate several rainwater treatment plants located on the site of CargoCity South and in Terminals 1 and 2. The new Pier APlus has also been equipped with a rainwater treatment plant. The service water is sourced from rainwater and groundwater (well water). When rainfall is low, purified water from the River Main is used. The service water is sourced through separate supply networks and supplied for sprinkler systems, toilet flushing and for watering landscaped areas. There is a complete service-water supply system in CargoCity South. In the north of the airport, Terminals 1 and 2 are supplied with service water. We are monitoring groundwater quality at 550 measuring stations. The chemical composition of the groundwater is monitored by 280 groundwater monitoring stations located at Frankfurt Airport and a further 270 groundwater monitoring stations located in the immediate vicinity. The groundwater quality and groundwater level is determined at monitoring stations defined by the regulatory authorities. The data is processed in a groundwater database. If pollution occurs in the groundwater, the waterways alarm plan ensures that this pollution is immediately reported and remedied. The alarm plan is a constituent element of the Emergency Response Manual of Fraport AG for Frankfurt Airport (FRA Not). Immediate measures are instituted and implemented by the Airport Fire Department of Fraport AG. Further information: General Management Approach EN.

AO4 Quality of rain water See AO4 Quality of rain water in the Key Figures/Environment section. There are indicators for the rain water which correspond to the statutory values specified by the City of Frankfurt. Compliance with these values is regularly monitored by government agencies. The data are collected by the parent company; no records are kept for the international Group companies included under IFRS. GRI 304 Biodiversity – Management Approach Our business activities and natural biodiversity can be harmonized. Areas that are close to nature and their inherent biodiversity are preserved and supported as far as this is possible within the operational constraints. Any impairments are kept as restricted as possible. Where substantial impacts occur, at least equal mitigation or equivalent replacement is carried out and we ensure long-term preservation of function. Fraport has made a commitment to the long-term preservation of biodiversity at Frankfurt Airport and has also decided to support projects beyond the confines of the Airport relating to the preservation of biological diversity in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region and in Hesse through its Environmental Fund. For example, the orchard meadows in the Frankfurt/Rhine-Main region are particularly worthy of protection. Orchard meadows in the State of Hesse have been reduced by around 90% over the past 30 years. The orchard meadows have a high level of species diversity and therefore play an important role in retaining regional biodiversity. The Hesse Society for Ornithology and Nature Conservation (HGON) (http://www.hgon.de/ vor-ort/hgon-vor-ort/unsere-arbeitskreise/frankfurt-am-main/) in Frankfurt, for example, receives financial support from Fraport to preserve valuable biotopes. Our “Principles for biodiversity” presented here (in the environmental policy of Fraport AG and in “Protect environment – maintain biodiversity” in the Publications/Sustainability Reports section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html) describe our responsibility for this important range of subjects, and document biodiversity projects at the airport and in the region that we conduct ourselves or support financially. International agreements for the protection of biodiversity, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), European directives, such as the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive, and national legislation such as the Federal Nature Conservation Act, are important foundations in conjunction with the actions taken in our valuable areas of nature. More information can be found in our principles for biodiversity (see “Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity” in the Publications/Sustainability Reports section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). The activities of Fraport AG and its subsidiaries do not generally entail any hazards for endangered species of plants or animals. Hazards of this nature only occur when the operational areas are expanded. In the European Union, an Environment Impact Assessment has to be carried out when this occurs and appropriate mitigation or replacement measures have to be implemented. Species on Germany’s Red List of endangered species exist at Frankfurt Airport. Plants and animals which are endangered at other locations have settled on the areas between the takeoff and landing runways or the taxiways due to the usage pattern. These areas of land in the operating areas very seldom experience human activity, and the kind of visitor pressure seen in nature conservation areas accessible to the general public does not occur here. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 60 The Group airports outside of Germany are generally financed through international banks. An Environmental Management Plan has to be submitted which is generally based on an Environmental Impact Assessment and defines how the consequences of intervention can be minimized. Fraport AG developed a Wildlife Management Program to protect against biological risks for air traffic and the impact of the airport operations on wildlife. Collisions with individual large birds or flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because statistically, around two thirds of all bird strikes take place at airports or neighboring areas, as an airport operator Fraport is also obliged to minimize this risk. In contrast to many international airports, we focus on special biotope management in Frankfurt. This concerns making the Airport area unattractive to relevant animals, i.e., minimizing or avoiding nesting, resting, and feeding opportunities. The bird strike rate is based on reports to the German Federal Aviation Office pursuant to EU Regulation 376/2014 and is calculated by the German Committee for the Prevention of Bird Strikes in Aviation (DAVVL). See Indicator AO9 Number of wildlife strikes per 10,000 aircraft movements in the Key Figures/Environment section. Within the airport site the areas between the two newly constructed aprons and the new runway were developed as nutrient-poor grassland (approx. 85 ha) and dwarf shrub heathland (approx. 132 ha). To achieve this, local seeds were collected on the airport site and the nearby area and planted on these areas. In addition, sandy grassland and sandy meadows from the former Kelsterbach substation to free areas in Kelsterbach Wood (approx. 2 ha) were successfully created, and the biotopes with the protected maiden pinks and dwarf everlasting flowers are also developing positively. Further information: https://www.fraport.de/de/nachbarschaft-region/entwicklung-standort-fra-umwelt/natur-umweltschutz.html GRI 304-1 Sites in, or adjacent to, protected areas A total area of owned land amounting to 22.84 km² (approx. 8.8 mi²) and an operational area of 18.60 km² (approx. 7.2 mi²) within that area means that our airport in Frankfurt/Main is one of the most compact major airports in the world. By making optimum use of our operational area, we contribute to keeping the utilization of natural areas in the densely populated Frankfurt/Rhine-Main Region as low as possible. Unoccupied areas at the airport are landscaped wherever possible. Environmentally valuable areas are located in the areas bordering takeoff runway 18 (west) with species-rich extensive meadowland, nutrient-poor grassland, sandy grassland adapted to dry habitats, and calluna (heather) heathland. The areas between the south and center runways measure approximately 600 ha and they are arguably the biggest area of green space in the region which is not used for agriculture. Apart from a substantial proportion of land of “minor biological value” (primarily sealed traffic areas), the airport has large areas of land which are used by animals and plants as habitats. Smaller species of atrisk birds, such as Eurasian skylarks, wheatears, European stonechats, or whinchats, can be regularly found there, and in spring natterjack toads and populations of frogs can also be seen. The exact data on protected areas can be found under GRI 304-1 Site in or adjacent to protected areas in the section Key Figures/Environment. See also Environmental Statement 2017, page 33 et seq. See also “Conservation of Nature and Resources” in the Dimensions/Environment area and “Environmental Funds” on https://www.fraport.de/de/nachbarschaft-region/entwicklung-standort-fra-umwelt/natur-umweltschutz.html. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 61 GRI 304-2 Impacts on biodiversity The environmental impact audit at Frankfurt Airport verified that overall no sustainable negative impacts were caused to directly adjacent conservation areas. This has been verified since 2010 during the course of monitoring biotopes and species (see “List of areas with measures” in the “Publications/Sustainability Reports” section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). GRI 304-3 Habitats protected or restored When construction work is carried out at the airport, the objective is to minimize its impact on the natural environment and the landscape. However, if areas of land have to be developed, mitigation measures are necessary. The unusually extensive, comprehensive environmental measures achieve more than simple compensation (see “List of areas with measures” in the Publications section on www.fraport.com/responsibility). Regular monitoring of fauna and flora is a constituent element of the plan approval notice and is outsourced to an external agency. Additional information (for example on restoration measures) can be found in the “Protect environment – Maintain biodiversity” document in the Publications/Sustainability Reports section on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html. See also “Conservation of Nature and Resources” in the Dimensions/Environment area and “Environmental Funds” on https://www.fraport.de/de/nachbarschaft-region/entwicklung-standort-fra-umwelt/natur-umweltschutz.html. GRI 305 Emissions – Management Approach The management activities at Fraport AG mainly deal with the emissions the company is directly responsible for, but it also looks at emissions that it is only indirectly connected to and which it can therefore only indirectly influence. Based on the Federal Government’s climate change agreement 2050, Fraport AG wishes to reduce the CO2 emissions at Frankfurt Airport to 80,000 t by 2030. This corresponds to a reduction by 65% compared to the emissions in the base year of the international climate change agreement (1990). In the past fiscal year, Fraport AG’s CO2 emissions amounted to approximately 188,631 tons of CO2, 0.8% less than in the previous year. The emission reductions from energy savings under ongoing programs to improve energy efficiency were nearly offset by the increased energy demand due to the unusually long and hot summer as well as strong passenger growth at Frankfurt Airport. For the Group as a whole (including Frankfurt), the Executive Board has set a climate protection target of a reduction of to 125,000 m. t. of CO2 by 2030. If necessary, the objective will be adjusted to any changes in Fraport’s airport portfolio. The Group target currently used corresponds to a reduction of around 50% compared to the base year of 2015. In 2018, Group emissions amounted to 244,029 m. t. of CO2 (previous year: 209,668 m. t. of CO2). The increase in emissions is due to the first-time inclusion of Fraport Greece as well as the Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. The contribution from these airports amounted to 36,445 m. t. of CO2. Without these airports, the emissions would have fallen by 1.0%. A way of successfully managing CO2 is to participate in the Airport Carbon Accreditation program of the ACI (Airports Council International), which Fraport played a major role in developing. Since 2010, it has evolved into the world standard for CO2 reporting and management at airports. Participation at level 2 (“reduction”) or higher requires proof of both a CO2 reduction target, a CO2 management program in accordance with international requirements and of annual emission reductions verified by external auditors. Frankfurt Airport reached level 3 (“Optimisation”) back in 2012. Ljubljana Airport achieved level 2 in 2015 and is aiming for level 3+ (“neutrality”) in the medium term. Lima, Varna, and Burgas airports do not currently participate, nor do the airports of Fraport Greece and the Brazilian airports in Fortaleza and Porto Alegre. However, they are obligated to have their CO2 footprint assessed by way of an external audit. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 62 Fraport AG has used its own monitoring instrument, the CO2 and energy consumption monitoring system, since 2013 to depict, analyze, and manage energy consumption at the Frankfurt site. It creates transparency about consumption and consumers, helps to improve energy efficiency and reduce energy costs. It also allows qualified statements to be made at any time about the current CO2 emissions at Fraport AG and allows any undesirable developments with respect to the strategic CO2 targets for Fraport AG to be detected at an early stage. The company’s monthly energy consumption, which is recorded in a sophisticated manner by building, system or equipment, serves as the database. All energy sources, such as electricity, district cooling, district heating, gas, fuel for vehicles, and other fuels, are taken into account. Since 2014, all decisions relating to Fraport AG’s energy management at Frankfurt Airport have been prepared in a separate body, known as the Energiezirkel, which is chaired by the Executive Director Controlling and Finance and reports to the Executive Board. Such decisions mainly concern improvements in building, system, and process energy efficiency. For the vehicle fleet and the aircraft handling equipment, the specialist departments assess the opportunities to use alternative forms of propulsion, in particular electric vehicles, as an alternative to vehicles with combustion engines. Fraport AG has been involved in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) since 2006, which analyzes climate risks, reduction goals and strategies of companies. The CDP manages the world’s largest database on this topic, which is used by investors and also by political decision-makers. A score assesses a company’s transparency and activities. Fraport AG achieved level C (“Awareness”) in 2018. This is evidence of transparent reporting and the company’s awareness of its influence on climate change. Air quality Fraport has already focused on the issue of air quality at the Frankfurt site for many years, also with the assessment of the airport’s share in the local concentration of nitrogen oxide. The current discussion on diesel pollutants has once again brought the subject to the fore. There is no obligation to monitor air quality, yet Fraport has set the objective of gaining a deeper understanding of the emission of air pollutants (emissions) by the airport and their effect on people and the environment (immissions). At the Group airports, air quality measurements and measures to improve it are implemented according to the national requirements and based on advanced specific local regulations. The Group companies comply with the relevant national laws and have correspondingly implemented their own monitoring systems where required. In Germany, Fraport AG cooperates with the German Aviation Association and the Airports Council International. In addition, there are collaborations with the Hessian Agency for Nature Conservation, Environment and Geology and the German Environment Agency to study so-called ultra-fine particulates. At the Frankfurt site, with the largest share of traffic, Fraport has continually measured air pollutants since 2002 at its two to temporary five measuring stations. The results are regularly published on the website in the “Air quality annual report”. In 2005, the area near the Runway Northwest was added to the network of air monitoring stations. In the approval procedure, the greatest impact on air quality by the airport was predicted for areas close to residential zones. The measurements show that the air quality on the airport grounds have remained unchanged at an urban level since the beginning of monitoring by Fraport. At the local level, there is an overlap of air pollutant concentrations both related to the airport and those not attributed to the airport. The airport’s impact on the air quality in the surrounding areas is limited to large extent to zones within a close proximity and to the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions component. Measurements and modeling suggest, however, that external influences, such as road traffic, also play a role in the air quality on airport grounds. In addition, the level of pollutant concentrations depends on the weather. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 63 To gain information on the proportion of a certain polluter to the overall exposure in a region, computational models have been developed that include all the relevant sources of pollution and their emissions for a given zone. The program LASPORT takes into account various airport-related emission sources in the lower atmosphere, creates spread computations, and illustrates the exposures. It was developed on behalf of the Association of German Commercial Airports (ADV) in 2002 and is now being expanded in collaboration with specialists from Fraport AG. From an organizational standpoint, the “Environmental Impact, Noise and Air Quality” department of the strategic business unit Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security is responsible for this task. The CO2 emissions are collected and monitored by the department of Environmental Management. The department is allocated to the central unit Corporate Development, Environment, and Sustainability. The Executive Board is directly involved as it receives an annual report on the matter. Fraport is working on a model for creating a systematic inventory of air pollutant emissions. Thus will enable future potential for mitigation to be identified, mitigation activities to be controlled, and have their success mapped. It serves also as a basis for data to determine the proportion of the airport’s operations on pollution in the surrounding area. The selection of the pollutants to be observed depends on their relevance. They are especially relevant if they are regulated by a threshold value and are emitted in a noticeable amount at the Frankfurt site. As an airport operator, Fraport can only indirectly influence emissions from aircraft. In order to motivate airlines to use low-emission aircraft, airport charges are levied on nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbon at the Frankfurt site. The emissions-based fee is charged per kilogram of nitrogen oxide equivalent emitted in the takeoffs and landings (“landing and take-off cycle”, LTO cycle) by an aircraft. The charges are levied per landing and per takeoff. The necessary information on aircraft and engine types is determined by way of a recognized fleet database. Aircraft turbines mainly emit carbon dioxide (approximately 7%) and water vapor (approximately 3%) in addition to mixed air (about 90%). The additional resulting pollutants carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, hydrocarbons, and soot account for less than one percent overall. The emission spectrum of aircraft turbines corresponds to that of road traffic. The quantities of these pollutants emitted by the aircraft at the Frankfurt site are calculated annually and published in the environmental statement. In addition to flight operations, air pollutants at airports also arise from the apron and vehicle traffic as well as the operation of heaters run on oil or gas. As a way of reducing pollutants, Fraport has gradually upgraded its fleet of vehicles to include lowemission and electric motors. Subsequent to the mediation on the expansion of Frankfurt Airport, Fraport established two service units in 2000: the Infofon hotline and a neighborhood dialog. In addition to complaints about aircraft noise and noise abatement, requests on air quality were also processed. Environmental management at Frankfurt Airport has been validated in conformity with the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) since 1999. Our Group majority-owned airports have established environmental management systems that systematically record emissions, effluents, and waste. In Antalya, Lima, and Ljubljana the management systems are also certified to ISO 14001 (see General Management Approach EN). The air pollutants and emissions are calculated or, since 2002, continuously measured at two dedicated stations. Measures for reduction are implemented: Collection of emissions-dependent airport charges based on nitrous gases and hydrocarbons, use of alternative drive technologies by introducing electrically driven ground handling devices. In addition, methods of calculating air pollutant emissions from infrastructure and aircraft handling were also developed. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 64 Fraport charges takeoff and landing charges based on emissions. The emissions-based fee is charged per kilogram of nitrogen oxide equivalent (= emission value) emitted by an aircraft in standardized takeoffs and landings (“landing and take-off cycle”, LTO). Charges are levied per landing and per takeoff. The necessary information on aircraft and engine types is determined based on a recognized fleet database, see airport charges according to Section 19b of the German Air Traffic Licensing Act, page 12 at https://www.fraport.com/en/business-partner/airlines-cargo/airport-charges.html. The use of alternative emission-free drives also has a positive effect on air quality. It also contributes to reducing CO2 emissions and is described in the “Climate gases” chapter. The air pollutant emissions are recorded by the organizational unit “Environmental Impact, Noise and Air Quality” of the strategic business unit Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security. The CO2 emissions are surveyed and monitored in the Environmental Management department. Environmental Management is located in the Corporate Development, Environment and Sustainability central unit, whereas the operational management of effluents is in the Integrated Facility Management service unit. At the Fraport parent company, a dedicated Waste Disposal department carries out this management function.

For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 305-3 Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 3) Each year, we calculate the indirect greenhouse gas emissions of the Frakfurt Airport. These include  emissions from air traffic within the limits of the LTO-cycle (= landing and takeoff cycle) up to a height of 3,000 feet (914 m) above ground, including the use of auxiliary power units (APUs)  passenger and employee travel to and from the airport  business travel by Fraport AG employees  the consumption of electricity, district heating and district cooling by third parties on site, as well as  the use of vehicles and equipment by third parties on site. As part of the participation in the ACI Airport Carbon Accreditation, CO2 emissions for Scope 3 were also determined at Antalya and Ljubljana airports. Further information can be found in the Environmental Statement 2017, Environmental Aspect climate gases, page 16 et seqq. (See Publications/Environment area on http://www.fraport.com/en/responsibility.html). GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 65 Relevant information for the other Group sites cannot currently be collected as this is very complex for an airport.

For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 305-4 Greenhouse gas emissions intensity See GRI 305-1 Direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) and GRI 305-2 Energy indirect greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2) in the Key Figures/Environment section. GRI 305-5 Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Climate protection is one of the most important challenges for the aviation industry. As an airport operator, we support the fourpillar strategy of the air-traffic industry with measures for climate protection in air traffic. In this context, we focus our efforts on areas which we are able to directly influence. These are primarily technical improvements to buildings and equipment as well as process optimization. We report on the measures in detail annually in the environmental program of our environmental statement (see www.fraport.com/responsibility). Furthermore, Fraport supports a number of industry-wide initiatives which are directed at reducing CO2 emissions. Fraport is involved in SESAR (Single European Sky Air Traffic Management Research), an initiative by the European Commission and EUROCONTROL that is intended to secure the future viability of European air traffic management with the involvement of all the players involved in air traffic. The various action plans within the scope of this initiative include integrated planning of flights, i.e., all the players involved are working to optimize the process from undocking the aircraft to reaching the target destination. This means that airports also become important players in air traffic management. The benefits for passengers and the environment: shorter flight times and reduced emissions. The targets of SESAR to 2020 include increasing capacities threefold since 2005, reducing CO2 emissions per flight by ten percent, increasing safety tenfold, and reducing air safety costs by half (http://www.sesarju.eu/). As a member of the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) through ACI, the global association of companies involved in air traffic, Fraport supports their targets: Reduction of CO2 by 1.5% per year by 2020 and carbon-neutral growth by 2050. This means a reduction in CO2 emissions in 2050 by 50% compared with 2005 throughout the entire industry (http://www.atag.org/). At the end of 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resolved to introduce and design a market-based global climateprotection instrument (GMBM) to set the course for further progress in climate protection in air traffic. With the international CO2 offsetting system CORSIA, the growth-related CO2 emissions of international flights will be offset from 2020 through the financing of climate protection projects. Fraport participates in Airport Carbon Accreditation, a program of ACI with the objective of persuading the maximum number of European airports to adopt CO2-neutral operation. Frankfurt Airport was the first airport to be audited in accordance with the rules of Airport Carbon Accreditation and it was accepted into the program in 2009. The highest level of 3+ can be reached in four stages. Fraport has reached level 3 “Optimization” in which a key additional component involves the verification of the assessment of the CO2 emissions of third parties connected with the airport operation (such as from the air traffic in the LTO cycle up to a height of 3,000 feet, from passenger and employee journeys to and from the airport, from the energy consumption of all other stakeholders at the airport, from business trips) and a stakeholder dialog. In this respect, we are involved in lively discussions with associations (such as the ADV, BDL, ACI), partners at the airport and in the region (such as the Lufthansa Group, Grundstücksgesellschaft Gateway Gardens, the FrankfurtRheinMain regional association, the City of Frankfurt Conservation Advisory Board, Climate Protection Advisory Council of the City of Frankfurt, House of Logistics and Mobility) and regional GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 66 initiatives (such as Hesse Fuel Cell Initiative and environmental protection initiatives). Our investment, Antalya Airport, has also reached Level 3+ “Neutrality”. In 2015, Ljubljana Airport achieved Level 2 “Reduction” by appropriate measures. Since 2006 Fraport has also contributed its climate reporting externally to the “Carbon Disclosure Project” (CDP) (www.cdp.net), the world’s leading climate reporting initiative in the financial industry. This index analyzes companies and their strategies on climate change and CO2 reporting. For a detailed description of the climate protection measures at Fraport, see Environmental Statement 2017, page 18 et seqq. See also GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption. For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. GRI 305-7 Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and other significant air emissions Fraport AG emits approximately 264 tons of NOx, 0.4 tons of benzene and 9.3 tons of PM10 per year. These data are derived from the zoning plan documents. Determining the data was extremely complex and expensive so that this procedure has not been repeated again. We are unable to influence other air emissions with our measures and they are therefore not relevant. As the data collection for vehicle and other emissions from handling processes at an airport are very complex and therefore costly, these are not conducted for the Group airports. For information regarding standards, methods, assumptions, and/or calculation tools used, see “General Management Approach EN”. AO5 Air quality See AO5 Air quality in the Key Figures/Environment section and GRI 305 Emissions – Management Approach. GRI 306 Effluents and Waste – Management Approach At the Fraport parent company, the rain water falling in winter is contaminated with biologically degradable de-icing agents for the aircraft and airfield surfaces when snow falls or frost occurs. Rain water with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 200 mg of oxygen per liter is retained and treated in water-treatment plants. The principle of Fraport’s waste management is to recycle or reuse unavoidable waste as far as possible. Frankfurt Airport separates non-hazardous waste including paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastics, wood, packaging waste (DSD green-dot waste), and mixed industrial waste. The collected waste is fed either into advanced sorting systems, where any contaminants are separated out and reusable materials are recycled, or into regional waste-to-energy plants. Electricity and heat are extracted from the energy generated during incineration. The hazardous waste created at Fraport is also collected separately and channeled away for recycling as far as possible. Where recycling facilities are not available this waste is disposed of in approved incinerators or in physical and chemical treatment plants. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 67 Waste Management at the Fraport parent company ensures professional disposal for approximately 60 different types of waste generated at Fraport. In this connection, Fraport maintains close contacts with authorities, disposal companies, other companies and universities. New know-how is incorporated into routine procedures as a result of benchmark activities with other waste generators. See GRI 306-1 Total water discharge in the area of Key Figures/Environement. For further information see Environmental Statement 2017, organizational chart, page 4, wastewater, page 39 et seqq., waste, page 48 et seqq.

Spills were reported by the parent company and Ljubljana Airport. AO6 Aircraft and pavement de-icing agents At Frankfurt Airport, N*ICE Aircraft Services & Support GmbH (N*ICE) is responsible for the de-icing of the aircraft. N*ICE is a group company that is not fully consolidated in the Group. Fraport AG holds 52% of the shares, while Swissport France Holding SAS has a 48% stake in the company. Given its relevance, the use of N*ICE aircraft and pavement de-icing agents is presented for the first time in 2018. To de-ice aircraft at Frankfurt Airport, N*ICE uses a mixture of propylene glycol and varying proportions of water. Doses of potassium formate are used for de-icing of airside areas depending on the weather situation. Both agents are biodegradable within a short time and meet strict environmental requirements. Rain water that contains de-icing agents is kept separate from drained areas and treated in the wastewater treatment plants. The use of de-icing agents is reduced by increasing the proportion of water per de-icing by 20%. To do this, the so-called NAD technology (N*ICE Advanced De-Icing System) is applied. This system consists of three separate tanks for water, type I, and type IV and uses two independent proportional mixing systems that allow for the de-icing agents to be applied precisely in line with the given weather conditions. N*ICE developed the process for converting the de-icing vehicles in cooperation with the respective vehicle manufacturer. There is currently a fleet of 70 de-icing vehicles equipped with NAD technology, and all newly acquired vehicles also have the new technology. The de-icing of the airside areas at Frankfurt Airport is carried out by the Fraport parent company. Doses of potassium formate in line with the weather situation are used for this purpose. Propylene glycol and potassium formate are biodegradable within a GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 68 short time and meet strict environmental requirements. Rain water that contains de-icing agents is kept separate from drained areas and treated in the wastewater treatment plants. See AO6 Aircraft and pavement de-icing agents in the Key Figures/Environment section. GRI 307 Environmental Compliance GRI 307-1 Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations At Fraport AG there are no breaches of statutory regulations which have been subject to fines or non-monetary sanctions imposed by the authorities. Intermodality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Fraport is working to make the airport accessible to as many passengers and employees as possible with public transport by networking with other carriers – also known as intermodality. In addition, short-haul flights can be shifted to the railways. The strategic networking of the airport with other modes of transport has a long track record at Fraport extending back to the 1970s. At that time, the first underground station at a German airport was opened under the newly constructed Terminal 1 – today this is the airport regional station. Opened in 1999, the AIRail Terminal created the link to the national and international long-distance rail network. We work closely with other means of transport to develop the intermodality of the airport. Our employees receive free job tickets to use bus and train services. Each year we collect data on the proportion of workers who come to work by public transport as well as the proportion of originating passengers who use public transport to reach or leave the airport. Most public transport at our international airports where we hold a majority shareholding is provided by the use of buses. See Significant environmental impacts of transport and traffic in the Key Figures/Environment section. Noise (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Airports located in the vicinity of metropolitan areas are a burden for many local residents. At the Group airports, noise abatement measures are implemented according to the national requirements on noise protection and, where appropriate, based on advanced specific local regulations. The airports comply with the relevant national laws and have correspondingly implemented their own monitoring systems where required. Frankfurt Airport is the site in the Group with the largest traffic volume by far. This also pertains the noise pollution felt by residents near the airport. The local management approach is therefore described below. In two bodies Fraport AG works with the region affected by aircraft noise, representatives of the state government and other members of the aviation industry. The Aircraft Noise Commission (FLK) is a legally appointed body that advises the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW), the Deutsche Flugsicherung and the Federal Supervisory Office for Air Traffic Control. The FLK advises the aforementioned bodies on measures to protect against aircraft noise and air pollution resulting from aircraft exhaust gases. The key task of the Airport and Regional Forum (FFR), which is assigned to the Hessian State Chancellery, is to foster dialog between the region and the aviation industry and to facilitate discussion of the impacts of air traffic, with a particular focus on Frankfurt Airport and the Rhine-Main region. The FFR includes the “Active Noise Abatement” expert group, which advises on measures that may help to reduce aircraft noise and the impact on the area around the airport. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 69 Fraport wants to grow further at its main site and ensure this growth generates as little noise as possible. For Fraport AG, this means that, in addition to the legal requirements, it is constantly working towards measures that reduce aircraft noise exposure. The development of aircraft noise exposure in the area around the airport is subject to continuous monitoring. Measurement analyses and the results of comprehensive simulations are regularly reported to the supervisory authority and the FLK, and are also publicly disclosed on the company’s website. Municipalities where there are Fraport aircraft noise measurement stations receive additional detailed analyses on request. We have been measuring aircraft noise around the airport for more than 50 years. Fraport currently maintains 29 measuring stations and three mobile measuring stations. The German Standard (DIN 45643) stipulates the type of equipment to be used for the measurements, how the measurements are to be carried out, and how the results must be reported. Fraport Noise Monitoring, FRA.NoM, tracks the level values continuously measured at stationary measuring stations and indicates the aircraft noise in the last three months. It also reports the approaches and takeoffs at Frankfurt Airport. The information system for aircraft noise issues, FRA.Map, is available online and allows local residents and interested parties to find information for their location or place of residence on an interactive map. The system also displays the areas that are targeted by noise abatement measures or entitled to compensation payments. As regards measures to reduce noise exposure, a distinction needs to be made between active and passive noise abatement. In active noise abatement, noise is reduced directly at the source or by implementing noise-reducing operating concepts and takeoff or landing procedures. These measures include the “Ground Based Augmentation System” (GBAS) navigation system, which enables a steeper angle of approach of 3.2 degrees for all runways. Thus far, the GBAS could not be used for parallel approaches and the aircraft had to alternate landing on the two runways. Parallel flights have now been possible since December 2018. With the so-called noise abatement model, individual takeoff and landing runways are alternatively not used, which extends the local nighttime quiet period by one hour. Furthermore, the current structure of the noise-related charges as part of airport charges is an incentive to use low-noise aircraft. During the summer months of 2018, there was a slight increase in landings after 11:00 p.m. This was partly due to bad weather conditions, strikes by air traffic controllers in Europe and capacity bottlenecks in European airspace. As an improvement measure, airlines added, for example, additional buffers in the flight plans at Frankfurt Airport. Moreover, takeoffs are no longer scheduled after 10:40 p.m. Late landings are examined and approved, if necessary, by the aircraft noise protection officer of the Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing (HMWEVW). For landings and takeoffs close to the edge of the night time window, Fraport AG charges a noise surcharge of 50%, and of 200% after 11:00 p.m., in an effort to make delayed aircraft movements particularly unattractive. Such charges are used to finance the passive noise protection program and wake turbulence prevention. The voluntary alliance for an emissions ceiling created in 2017 should help to ensure that the noise exposure at Frankfurt Airport during the day does not increase as much as would be permitted under the zoning decision, despite growth in aircraft movements. The traffic volume and traffic structure of the zoning approval for the expansion result in noise contours with continuous sound levels of 55 dB(A) and 60 dB(A). These contours have been reduced by 1.8 dB(A) across the board. The total areas within the reduced contours define the noise emission ceiling. If the limit is exceeded, Fraport AG and the airlines are obliged to examine further noise abatement measures. If the limit is repeatedly exceeded, any of the parties involved can take action outside of the alliance. In 2018, a monitoring report drawn up jointly by the alliance partners was published for the first time. This report shows that the noise emission ceiling was met in the 2017 fiscal year. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 70 To underline the importance of the Alliance for a Noise Limit for Fraport AG, our key performance indicator system includes the area of the larger of the two LOG aircraft noise contours, or Leq, day = 55 dB(A). Our goal is to keep the area in hectares (ha) that is affected by an equivalent constant sound level per day (Leq, day) of more than 55 dB(A) below the amount required by the noise limit despite increases in traffic. This target was met in both 2017 and 2018. Passive noise abatement measures are intended to reduce the noise level inside buildings by way of structural modifications. Fraport AG has extensive statutory obligations to take measures in around 86,000 households close to Frankfurt Airport. Eligibility is defined by a noise protection area determined by the Hesse State Government in accordance with the strictest regulations of the Aircraft Noise Act. Fraport AG satisfies these requirements in full. The state government promised affected residents additional, more extensive efforts than those previously made in the vicinity of the airport in announcing the “Together for the Region – Alliance for Noise Abatement 2012” program in February 2012. That same year, a regional fund was set up to this end with €265-270 million. The funds are predominantly provided by the State of Hesse and Fraport AG and can be used for both private households and public facilities qualifying for protection, such as schools, kindergartens, or hospitals. Some 17,300 households in the airport region may receive additional support for passive noise abatement from the regional fund. The application deadline for financing from the fund was December 31, 2017. In its place, the Equalization of Burdens Act, with which the State of Hesse has made an additional €22.6 million available to local authorities particularly by aircraft noise by the year 2021, has been in effect since January 1, 2018. In the area of passive noise abatement, the Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €47.9 million as at the balance sheet date December 31, 2018 (see Annual Report 2018, Group Notes, note 39, page 196). Wake turbulences Damage has repeatedly occurred on roofs in the direct vicinity of Frankfurt Airport in the past and wake turbulences from landing aircraft could not be ruled out as a cause. The HMWEVW subsequently issued supplemental planning zoning decisions on May 10, 2013 and May 26, 2014. These regulate the requirements for protecting roof coverings on buildings against wind gusts caused by wake turbulences and clarify the relevant prerequisites. The HMWEVW defined an area with around 6,000 buildings as an eligible area in the decisions. Including fiscal year 2018, some 3,380 applications for roof protection (wake turbulence prevention) have been submitted and work on some 2,850 properties has been completed so far. The Executive Director Controlling and Finance is regularly informed about the programs of measures regarding noise abatement and roof protection. The Executive Director Operations is also directly informed of individual issues where required. In the area of wake turbulence prevention, Fraport Group held provisions in the amount of €29.6 million as at the balance sheet date December 31, 2018 (see also Group notes, note 39 and Fraport AG’s Notes, note 30). In order to support local residents in the determination of their rights and to assist their applications, Fraport provides an extensive range of information and services on the company website. The issues surrounding the topic of noise are processed and managed by the “Environmental impact, Noise and Air Quality” (FTULL), which is allocated to the “Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security” strategic business unit. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 71 Fraport web presence regarding aircraft noise and noise abatement Visitors to Fraport’s website can find answers to various questions on noise abatement, aircraft noise, and flight operations, including figures, facts, data, and other opportunities for dialog at https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/responsibility/aircraftnoiseinfoservice/noise-abatement.html. This website is complemented by an interactive FRA Map, www.framap.fraport.de. This map allows internet users to create an individual image of their own aircraft noise situation on the basis of calculated aircraft noise values. FRA Map offers information on a range of topics, such as monthly figures on routes and runway occupancy as well as aircraft noise contours. In addition, FRA Map provides information on possible claims regarding structural sound protection or roof protection, and shows the noise-reducing effect of active noise abatement measures in the region surrounding the airport. Detailed information can be accessed by entering addresses, compiled in a report, via the function accessible at the link www.fraport.de/fluglaerminfo. Currently, these websites record individual levels at the stationary noise measurement points operated by Fraport AG as well as the flight tracks of the arrivals and departures at Frankfurt Airport; users can access them at the FRA NoM (Fraport Noise Monitoring) website at www.fraport.de/franom. Aircraft flight noise listed as noise for the last three months is available at FRA NoM. We also publish a history of the results of aircraft noise measurements, route allocations, or the arrivals and departures by operating direction of the takeoff and landing runway system and extensive measurement reports online at www.fraport.de/fluglaermmessung. Complaints and requests regarding aircraft noise Since 2000, Fraport has provided residents close to the airport with a central contact point for inquiries and complaints by citizens on the following topics:  Aircraft noise with noise levels and annual noise contours  Flight routes, route and runway allocations  Noise abatement measures  Fraport programs on structural noise abatement and roof protection  Air quality Telephone inquiries may be made to the Infofon hotline free of charge around the clock, between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., messages can be left on a voice recording system. Complex questions are passed on to the Nachbarschaftsdialog (Neighborhood Dialog) department. The Nachbarschaftsdialog (Neighborhood Dialog) colleagues can also be contacted directly by email or letter, as well as via a contact form specifically for inquiries concerning aircraft noise on the Fraport website. In 2018, 3,063 residents contacted Fraport with questions and complaints, an increase of 39% compared to the previous year. The main reason for this development was the exceptionally high proportion of easterly weather that led to an unusual level of flight noise pollution as well as an increase in delayed flights. The number of individual resident inquiries and complaints, however, is lower than in the previous year, at 48,499 complaints, which corresponds to 5% of the entire amount of aircraft noise complaints. Individual noise complaints are included in the representation of the noise pollution in the region as well as for investigating and following up on residents’ claims of potential violations regarding individual flights. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Disclosures – ENVIRONMENTAL 72 Regarding the overall number of complaints, we recorded a significant decline in 2018: at 962,620 complaints, the number is 84% lower than in the previous year. The positive trend from previous years has continued into 2018. The unusually large drop is due to the fact that the automated complaints from two of the most active complainants have stopped. Most aircraft noise complaints continue to be made by a small number of people. In 2018, around 914,000 complaints have come from a group of just 52 people who have submitted a high number of automated complaints about individual flights. Automated complaints are not processed. To allow a differentiated assessment of noise complaints or to place them in relation to local changes in air traffic, automated complaints are only recorded statistically and presented separately as agreed with the Aircraft Noise Commission. With regard to key figures, we publish the total number of messages received, the number of individually prepared complaints, and the number of complainants (see Key Figures Environment). GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 73 GRI 400 SOCIAL Labor Practices and Decent Work General Management Approach LA Fraport AG has a long tradition as a company with a social and a partnership-based approach. Group-wide, Fraport aims to remain competitive at all sites and in all areas and thereby secure jobs with fair and just working conditions. This involves providing fair wages and salaries, and a package of benefits that goes beyond pay. Fraport offers a high level of job security, good working conditions based on collective bargaining agreements, career and personal development options, and a highly developed corporate ethic. The Fraport Policy forms the overarching structure for all commitments and topic-specific codes of the Group. Pursuant to responsible corporate governance, Fraport has made a commitment to comply with internationally recognized standards of conduct, such as those defined in the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD guidelines, and the ILO Core Labor Standards. In 2013, Fraport published its own Code of Conduct to anchor these principles even more firmly within the company. This code commits employees to compliance with these fundamental principles. Fraport Group has over 21,900 employees. Given the growing challenges, such as increasing international competition in the aviation industry and passengers’ and airlines’ increasing demands, and the continuous focus of the Group on earnings, the aim is to organize the personnel structure in such a way that this competitive pressure can be withstood. Employees’ personal and professional skills are boosted Group-wide by training measures. This allows Fraport to ensure a high service quality. The fundamental importance of the human resources strategy is taken into account by the three key non-financial performance indicators of employee satisfaction, women in management positions, and sickness rate. The Executive Director of Labor Relations is informed at quarterly meetings with the HR managers of the Group companies at the Frankfurt site, among other things, of the development of these key figures. See also “Employees” in “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 82 et seqq. GRI 401 Employment – Management Approach As an attractive and responsible employer, Fraport aims to provide good working conditions and high levels of employee satisfaction. This key figure is calculated annually by surveying employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies. All laborintensive Group companies in Frankfurt as well as the Group companies Lima, Fraport Slovenija, and Twin Star took part in the 2018 survey. In future, the survey will be expanded to all other key Group companies. The cultural conditions must be taken into account, and a common standard for assessment must be agreed. At Fraport AG, the results are used to identify potential for improvement and derive appropriate measures. They are documented by the central unit Human Resources; the implementation is controlled and prepared for the respective units or German Group companies. In individual cases, the measures and the intended improvements can be included in the target agreements with executives. The strategic relevance of Group employee satisfaction is also clear, given that it is taken into account in the Executive Board’s remuneration (see also the “Remuneration report” section of the Group management report beginning on page 76 in the Annual Report 2018). The key figure is calculated from nine aspects of satisfaction and the detailed analyses show potential areas of improvement. Fraport aims to maintain employee satisfaction at a stable level Group-wide and continually improve the rating in the long term to GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 74 exceed 3.0 (index value in line with German school grading system). The average grade for satisfaction by the employees of the Fraport Group was at 2.76 in fiscal year 2018, and therefore above the adjusted value for the previous year of 2.85 (reported in the previous year: 2.87, the previous year’s figure was adjusted for the Group company FCS). At Fraport AG, the figure should be better than in the previous year. The average grade for satisfaction by the employees of Fraport AG in the past fiscal year was 2.86 and thus slightly improved year on year (previous year: 2.88). Fraport has stepped up its recruitment and training activities in these areas to meet challenges such as the tangible impact of demographic change at the many airport sites and the increased burden on operational employees in particular due to the growth in traffic. As a responsible employer, Fraport respects and promotes personal diversity and attaches great importance to ensuring that this is reflected in the way employees interact with each other. Diversity is a key goal for Fraport, which the Group systematically tackles as part of its diversity management. Diverse cultural backgrounds, international experience and gender aspects enrich the collaboration and promote innovation and creativity. This enables Fraport to flexibly respond to the changing requirements in the international markets and benefit from them. As far back as 2007 Fraport published its “Diversity charter” – a company initiative to promote diversity in companies and institutions. The Group company agreement “Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” formed the platform for principles such as freedom from discrimination and equal opportunities. The company agreement includes explicit definitions of values as well as specific internal regulations and structures. From an organizational perspective, responsibility for diversity is assigned to the Executive Director Labor Relations with corresponding resources. Fraport places particular focus on promoting women in management positions at the two levels directly below the Executive Board as well as at the respective management levels at the German Group companies. For reporting purposes, executives who report directly to the Executive Board are categorized as level 1. Executives who report to this first level of leadership are categorized as level 2. Regarding the Group companies in Germany, the levels of management are categorized based on comparable positions at Fraport AG. This corresponds to the objectives in the “Act on Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions in the Private and Public Sector”. The company maintains its objective to increase the proportion of women in management positions in Germany across both levels to 30% by 2021. Fraport respects national laws and does not want to impose any quotas based on German law at the foreign Group companies. In fiscal year 2018, the proportion of women in management positions in Germany was 26.0% (previous year: 28.0%). The proportion of women in management positions in Fraport AG in 2018 was 25.0% (previous year: 27.1%). The slight decline in the rate at both Fraport AG and the German Group companies is due to organizational and personnel changes. Fraport has worked to increase the proportion of women in management positions for many years. Particular focus is placed on all staff development processes that have an influence on increasing the proportion. This includes strategic succession planning across all levels of management as well as talent management and the Potential Assessment Center. The long-term measures that are already proving to be successful include the Cross Mentoring Program, the internal mentoring, and coaching within the context of the continued development of female executives. There are also offers, such as the option of holding an executive position on a parttime basis within the scope of an 80% or 90% workload. In the future, it will also be possible to work within the framework of an interim management. This allows for the management experience to be extended on a temporary basis. For job vacancies, suitable female candidates are also actively approached and systematic development and career paths are presented. Fraport AG did not receive any grievances about labor practices from employees or suppliers in the reporting period.

GRI 102-16 Values, principles, standards and norms of behaviour GRI 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover With regard to permanent employees, the staff turnover rate of 7.9% in the past year was below the rate of 8.3% in the previous fiscal year. This decrease was caused by fewer employees leaving the Group coupled with an increase in the number of new employees, especially due to the Group companies FraGround, FraSec, and FraCareS. All Group companies and investments have high turnover rates in some cases, due to their business model or business activities. The reasons for this are fixed-term employment contracts, terminations by either employees and employers, severance agreements, retirements, and deaths. In addition, some companies exhibit strong seasonal fluctuations. This is for example the case at our Group company Twin Star in Bulgaria. Other Group companies are active in the services sector, which generally features high turnover rates. FraGround GmbH and FraSec are particularly affected by this. These companies have strong seasonal recruitment and high levels of temporary employment. At the Fraport parent company, the turnover rate in 2018 amounted to 3.6% (previous year: 3.7%). A breakdown of employee turnover per region as well as the classifications by age groups was conducted for the first time in the GRI Report 2016. See GRI 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover in the area of Key Figures Personnel. GRI 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 88% of the Group’s employees work at this site. Fraport offers employees a series of non-payscale benefits. Supplementary company social benefits are granted equally to all employees (as appropriate, pro rata in accordance with the scope of employment). This also applies unless a specific length of service is a prerequisite for entitlement irrespective of whether the employment relationship is temporary or permanent. Our major controlled airport Group companies can also demonstrate above-average non-payscale benefits. The majority of our airport Group companies take on or participate in supplementary insurance, promote the health of their employees, offer further training opportunities and provide additional support (food allowance, bus transfer to the workplace, etc.). Additional company social benefits are also granted to all employees of our foreign Group companies with majority shareholdings in the same way (as appropriate, pro rata in accordance with the scope of employment). Exception: At Fraport Greece, only employees with an unlimited contract period receive a subsidy for the pension plan. This serves as an additional old-age provision to the state pension system.

GRI 402-1 Minimum notice periods regarding significant operational changes Fraport works closely with employee representatives in an atmosphere of trust. Pursuant to the Works Constitution Act, the Works Council must be promptly and comprehensively informed about any changes in the business. This has not been defined in detail or restricted within the framework of the collective agreements. A notification obligation of three months is standard business practice. A total of 39 meetings were held by the parent company’s Works Council in 2018 (including one extraordinary and one constituent meeting), while the Group Works Council held 10 ordinary and one extraordinary meetings. Just as in Frankfurt, Fraport also ensures that employees have the basic right of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining agreement negotiations at international sites where Fraport has a majority shareholding. We are committed to open cooperation in an atmosphere of trust with democratically elected employee representatives, and we use this process to work toward achieving a settlement that is fair for all interests. GRI 403 Occupational Health and Safety – Management Approach Occupational health Occupational health management in the Fraport Group has always focused on preserving the health, performance and therefore productivity of employees in the long term. A corresponding company agreement was signed in 2002. Today, the area of “Health management” is part of “Diversity and Social Affairs” which reports directly to the Executive Director Labor Relations. Most of the labor-intensive Group companies have their own departments, units, or specialists for occupational health management. With its preventive nature, Fraport contributes to maintaining employee performance and prevents work-related health risks. Employees are regularly informed about health-maintaining measures and their workplaces are ergonomically designed in the operational and administrative areas. Fraport AG’s multi-award-winning occupational health management initiates a wide range of health-promoting activities and measures with various focal points. For example, cooperation with gyms made it possible for employees to exercise close to their place of residence. Those who exercise regularly are rewarded with a contribution to membership fees. In 2018, the premiums for the collective operational supplementary health insurance were expanded to include greater reimbursements for dental prostheses. In total, around 2,000 contracts were concluded with employees and their relatives. All employees in Germany were given a “Fitbox” with suggestions for improving their own health. This also includes a calendar with suggestions for preventive measures. Each month, a new topic is presented and accompanied with corresponding information and activities. If possible given the state of operations and with approval by management, employees of Fraport AG can visit the health lectures during working hours. From an organizational perspective, responsibility for health management is assigned to the Executive Director Labor Relations with corresponding resources. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 77 The effects of demographic change in the Group and the increase of the average age of employees contribute, among other things, to a continuous increase in the number of long-term illnesses. However, high levels of absenteeism, especially in the operational units and Group companies in Germany, cannot be attributed only to health issues, workload and age-related effects. It can be seen that absenteeism in the operational areas decreases significantly on public holidays, which leads to the conclusion that there are motivation-related absences, as these working days are compensated by special bonuses. In 2017, new evaluation options for sick leave and training for managers were developed and implemented. Since 2018, each employee can obtain his or her personal sickness rate as well as that of his or her unit on the Intranet. The only possibility to adjust to increased volume of traffic at Frankfurt airport was through additional shifts. Fraport AG provided an attractive financial incentive for acquiring additional services under the motto “Growth in 2018 – Working Together”. Food and drinks were provided to employees in highly stressful work areas such as in aircraft handling. Workers at the security checkpoints were also given massage vouchers. All measures are regularly checked and, if necessary, adapted to ensure they remain effective. Fraport evaluates the effectiveness of the measures by continuously analyzing the sickness rate, among other things. The calculation excluding absences beyond sick pay (extended sick leave) primarily reflects the development of shortand mediumterm illnesses. Fraport focuses on limiting or reversing the sickness rate, which is increasing due to seasonal and age-related absences, among other things. The target is to have a maximum rate of 7.2% in both the Group and at Fraport AG by 2025. In 2018, the sickness rate in the Group was 7.4% (previous year: 7.5%). This development is primarily attributable to the improvement of the sickness rate at Fraport AG and the Group company FraSec, which both have a large number of employees. At Fraport AG, the sickness rate improved from 7.6% to 7.4%. In the Ground Services Strategic Business Unit, which has a large number of staff, as well as Airport Safety and Security, the sickness rate decreased noticeably. The steering committee of Fraport AG is an important decision-making body for health management, given that it makes decisions on financial, human, and material resources (see also “Fraport health management measures (FGM)”. Occupational safety A strong prevention culture means that, in addition to health management, occupational safety is systematically integrated into the company’s processes and structures as well. Accident prevention not only serves personal safety but is also of great importance from an economic point of view, for example if work equipment, vehicles, or facilities are damaged or if employees are unable to work due to illness. Strengthening the personal responsibility of all employees and, in particular, the management is a top priority. Comprehensive measures to guarantee high occupational safety standards are required, for example, when handling dangerous goods, in Ground Services’ operations, in maintenance, in internal transport and traffic, and during infrastructure construction activities. In terms of prevention activities on the part of Fraport, all health and safety risks are addressed within the framework of the overall spectrum of behavior and situational prevention. The main topics are briefly described below. At the Group level, the adoption of the Group health and safety management manual in 2018 was a milestone in developing a common understanding of occupational safety at Fraport. The material aspects of occupational health and safety for the Group are regulated on the basis of the principles defined in ISO 45001. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 78 Training and education concepts in occupational health and safety for managers, workers, safety officers, and first responders are continuously updated and make up the foundation of the occupational safety and health organization. These training concepts are continuously developed on the basis of risk assessments. Due to the increase in employment rates in all processing areas, especially the training documents for employees with a migrant background who work in operational areas were revised and made available in “simple language”. All hazardous substances still pass through the product assessment process at Fraport. This continuous review is intended to promote the use of substances with a low hazard potential and minimize risks for employees. Violations of occupational safety and health increase the potential danger and thus pose a disproportionately high risk of injury or health hazards. Qualified employees in the field of occupational safety and health therefore continuously carry out construction site inspections. As a result, the number of work accidents has stabilized in recent years and is at a level far below the national average. In addition, extensive consulting is offered to those responsible regarding questions on implementing occupational and health protection. Due to the increase in airside and landside movements, the topic of “Safety in internal transport and traffic” remains in focus. The driving safety of our personnel is therefore a top priority here in order to maintain the safety of all road users at the airport site. Fraport therefore regularly carried out safe driving training courses in the year under review, as well as “refresher” courses for drivers who have infringed traffic rules; these will continue to be held in 2019. The points system introduced as an additional regulation by Fraport in its role as an airport operator will continued to be used in 2019. Driver safety training is offered to employees whose work involves driving. There are special occupational safety seminars for managers, for example on transferring obligations of the business operator. Targeted and temporary measures and projects are intended above all to raise employees’ awareness of safe conduct in operational areas. In the project “Mindful through ‘18” in 2018, the focus was placed on reducing accident-related lost working days and the cost of damage to vehicles and equipment. As an additional measure, these project will be followed by the project “Zero” as part of the agenda for Ground Services for 2019. Behavioral health and safety will be strengthened in this section, which is responsible for the loading and unloading of aircraft as well as the internal transport. In accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act, Fraport has implemented an occupational safety unit under the Executive Director Labor Relations, which advises and supports business units in the further development of occupational safety. The key principles for the Group companies can be found in the occupational safety management manual. They are to be implemented independently by the managing directors and supplemented by company-specific rules in internal regulations. This rule is valid effective immediately for Fraport AG and Group companies that are allocated to the area of Occupational Safety and Health Act. Taking into account the national laws, the scheme is an option for action for the international Group companies. The procedures for recognizing the occupational safety management manual are nearly completed for the Group companies within the scope of the German Occupational Safety and Health Act. The Group companies of Lima, Fraport Slovenija, Twin Star, and Fraport USA have already provided confirmations. In addition, a self-assessment conducted in 2017 at the international Group companies revealed that key aspects of occupational safety and health according to German legislation have been applied and implemented. In the past the responsibility assumed by Fraport for occupational health and safety has also been clearly defined with regard to temporary staff. They have an equal priority alongside permanent employees when it comes to occupational health and safety, and they go through a professional orientation phase at Fraport. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 79 We continuously develop our safety concepts on the basis of a systematic assessment of potential hazards. Alongside the technical safety of workstations, the behavior of employees and their independent sense of responsibility play an important role in this respect. This is why Fraport carries out regular training on occupational safety. The Annual Meeting for Safety Officers in 2018 focused on the issue of “Traffic safety/distraction from cell phone use and stress”, among other things. Fraport measures the effectiveness of occupational safety measures by the number of accidents at work, among other things. The target is to continually reduce the total number of accidents at work per year and to achieve a “rate per 1,000 employees” (number of reportable accidents at work per 1,000 employees) of less than 25 within the Group by 2020. For all Group employees (permanent staff, temporary staff, apprentices, and leased laborer) the rate per 1,000 employees was 26.1 (previous year: 25.8). Fraport AG’s target for the rate per 1,000 employees is a figure under 20. It was 19.3 in 2018 (previous year: 24.1; as a result of late submissions, there may be changes to the figures reported for the previous year). The most significant reduction of accidents was recorded in the Ground Services Strategic Business Unit. At the Frankfurt site, Fraport AG operates its own occupational safety and health management system according to OHSAS 18001. Our international site in Lima is certified in accordance with OHSAS 18001. This certification has also been granted to our joint ventures FCS, N*ICE, AirIT Systems, and Fraport TAV Antalya Havalimanı Terminal İşletmeciliği A.Ş. See https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/responsibility/at-a-glance/corporate-values-and-policies/certificates.html. GRI 403-1 Percentage of employees in job safety committees Employees at Fraport AG have an opportunity to contribute to company processes in the area of occupational traffic safety. Fraport has a system of committees in Frankfurt which focus on occupational traffic safety. Appointments to some of these committees have equal employee and employer representation. The Fraport Job Safety Committee deals with operational issues relating to occupational safety at the parent company. The permanent members of the Committee include representatives from the Disabled Employees Committee and members of the Works Council, the Senior Company Medical Officer, the Senior Safety Expert, the Executive Director of Labor Relations in the Ground Services units, and five selected safety officers from the business units. The opinions of experts from technical departments and experts from the affected areas are sought on defined issues in specific instances relating to job safety and environmental protection. In 2018, the Committee met four times under the chairmanship of the Executive Director of Labor Relations. Fraport also actively participates in the further development of occupational health and safety issues in the Group. For example, the Group Job Safety Committee (K-ASA) was introduced at the Frankfurt site in 2012. The function of this Committee is to make fundamental decisions across the Group on standardizing processes in occupational health and safety. One of the Committee’s tasks was to approve overall occupational safety targets and the occupational safety management system for the Group. Permanent members include the Senior Safety Expert, the Senior Company Medical Officer, the Group Disabled Employees Committee and the Group Works Council, as well as all Executive Managers from the majority shareholdings at the Frankfurt site. If deemed as relevant, a representative of the “Global Investments and Management (BET)” unit also joins the committee, representing the foreign Group companies and subsidiaries. In this regard, the rules of procedure of the K-ASA were adapted in 2018. During the reporting period, the occupational safety and health management system as defined by the Fraport Executive Board was presented to the Fraport Group companies and subsidiaries. These companies were so convinced by the benefits of using a systematic collaborative approach that the majority of relevant Group companies and subsidiaries joined the occupational GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 80 safety and health management system. In workshops, common procedures and methods will be developed and rolled out Groupwide. In 2018, the K-ASA met twice under the chairmanship of the Executive Director Labor Relations of the Fraport Group. The Group Job Safety Committee for example, was introduced in 2012 at Franfurt site. The function of this Committee is to make fundamental decisions across the Group on standardizing processes in occupational health and safety. One of the Committee’s tasks was to approve overall occupational safety targets for the Group. Permanent members include the Senior Safety Expert, the Senior Company Medical Officer, the Group Disabled Employees Committee and the Group Works Council, as well as all Executive Managers from the majority shareholdings at the Frankfurt site. In 2018, the Job Safety Committee met twice. The Executive Director of Labor Relations also chaired these meetings. Fraport also operates a Transport Safety Committee, which meets at least once a month. This Transport Safety Committee focuses primarily on increasing traffic safety in the operational and apron areas. A representative from each of the departments is included on this committee as necessary. The Committee analyzes reported accident events and special traffic problems. It then uses expert reports to make recommendations to the Company’s management on improving the relevant situation. An overview of the percentage of employees represented in job safety committees is provided in GRI 403-1 Percentage of employees in job safety committees. GRI 403-2 Accidents, occupational diseases, absence days, and fatalities The number of accidents at Fraport AG showed a positive trend in 2018. The values for the 1,000 person rate and the number of accidents declined. Most common causes of injury were stumbles, falls, and slips. In the future, we plan on reporting the international key figure LTIF(R) (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate). A list of accidents, occupational diseases, days lost, and days of absence can be found under GRI 403-2 in the chapter Key figures. Recording, investigating, and evaluating accidents at work is carried out in accordance with the German Occupational Safety Act (Arbeitssicherheitsgesetz). Key figures per region were analyzed for the first time in the 2016 GRI Report. GRI 403-3 Workers with high incidence or high risk of diseases No workers are involved in operating activities that carry a particularly high risk of developing a specific disease or where a large number of illnesses occur. All measures for protection and prevention are taken through proper organization, provision of appropriate workwear, and occupational safety and medical examinations. GRI 404 Training and Education – Management Approach Human resources development In the light of the growing challenges such as international competition in the air transport industry, as well as passengers’ and airlines’ expectations and a continuing focus on earnings, the objective is to foster our employees’ personal, professional, social and methodological skills. This allows us to ensure a high service quality as well as to secure attractive jobs in the long term. Continuously developing one’s own abilities and skills is an essential part of private and professional life today. As a company, we promote the individual willingness to learn and develop with a wide range of training and qualification programs in the areas of languages, IT, management and leadership, communication, and technical training. We support employees in their roles as GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 81 specialist and executive professionals with individual coaching programs. We gradually introduce employees to the challenges and opportunities of digitization with new learning formats. A managed training services (MTS) online service platform has been set up for external training. The objectives of this MTS were to promote the topics of digitalization/Industry 4.0 in addition to significantly increasing efficiency and cost savings. We take our employees’ wishes in relation to their own personal development within the company seriously. Our leadership work is characterized by continuous learning and mutual trust. We endeavor to enable individual development measures – with a constant eye on the corporate objectives. For the management of our employees, we require creativity, openness, fairness and interest in the individual. This creates an ideal framework for dealing with each other based on trust and a motivating working environment. We promote specific target groups and talented individuals in long-term development programs, for example the internal “take off pool” and through various mentoring programs in cooperation with other companies and universities. We enable our employees to take part in recognized continuing training activities, e.g. to become professional managers, engineers or master craftsmen, as well as postgraduate courses at universities of applied sciences. In many cases we also offer scholarships for part-time MBA programs that meet the company’s interests. In the face of an employment market that is increasingly favoring employees and an already noticeable lack of skilled workers, there are no extensive or even surplus reserves of specialist and managerial staff in the Fraport Group. The situation surrounding external applicants is difficult, so that above all internal development measures are required in order to achieve the corporate and growth targets. In this context, internal job placements and the targeted use of employees offer the Fraport Group the greatest added value. The search for talent and employee loyalty play a central role. We therefore offer our employees a wide range of training opportunities. We promote and systematically prepare them for taking on responsible positions in the company, thereby ensuring that high-performance employees will shape the future of Fraport. Digitalization and new forms of work require a number of new skills, which we have increasingly addressed since 2018. These so-called ‘future skills’ (based on a study by the Stifterverband from 2018) include ‘traditional skills’ such as problem-solving ability, adaptability, project management, creativity and entrepreneurship, and personal initiative as well as, in particular, ‘basic digital skills’ such as the use of common software, careful and informed handling of online data, critical examination of one’s own digital activities, digital learning, collaboration, and agile work forms. For 2019, the launch of a comprehensive ‘digitalization program’ is planned to expand basic digital skills in the workforce. In addition, initial measures to strengthen self-management were implemented in 2018. Unlike in traditional, hierarchical structures, work in self-organized, agile teams calls for competence borne out of the self-management of each individual. This work form is still unusual for many colleagues and can easily lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. In addition to the development of new management principles with PFK which are in place to support all executives in their daily work beginning in 2019, we have also expanded the Fraport Training portfolio. In 2019, ‘Mindful Leadership’ offers in professional and leadership development (FE4-5) will be added in order to provide appropriate measures for improved self-perception, self-regulation, mindfulness, and self-management, while, at the same time, supporting the process of change already initiated at levels 1 and 2. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 82 In 2018, the external training budget of the Fraport parent company was €3.6 million. The aforementioned personnel development measures relate to the Fraport parent company. Open seminars and talent management are also offered at Group companies in Frankfurt. Foreign participations are supported on a case-by-case basis. See also https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/careers/working-at-fraport.html. Training Our company has conducted vocational training for over fifty years. Every year, as one of the largest training companies in the region, Fraport offers at least 110 young people an opportunity to start a career, with dual-degree programs and apprenticeships in more than thirty skilled occupations. In addition, two special qualification programs for young job entrants “Startklar” and “BIFF” (“Ready for Takeoff” and “Professional integration of young refugees in Frankfurt Rhine/Main”). In general, the training offer is oriented towards the needs of the business units and the Group companies. The training on offer is under continual development. Vocational training helps to meet the need for qualified junior staff in the medium term, and helps to secure the sustainability of Fraport. A total of 17 people are employed in the specialist unit for professional training at the Fraport parent company; 13 of these employees are training or program directors for the professional orientation programs and manage all training processes from recruitment to final examinations and are supported in these endeavors by around 400 part-time trainers. Each year, we invest EUR 10 million in training young professionals. Challenges in the area of vocational training will continue to expand. The decline in school leavers between 2010 and 2025, together with the ongoing trend of studying at university, requires further efforts, in particular to attract suitable pupils for our technical occupations and innovative approaches. Greater efforts are now being made to retain educated young people in the company. This is one reason why the Executive Board decided in autumn 2017 to offer permanent contracts to trainees in technical occupations who demonstrate professional and personal aptitude. In the summer of 2018, the company concluded an agreement with the works council on remuneration given the shortages resulting from demographic change and the increasing departures of young workers trained by us. According to this, young professionals trained within the company receive remuneration in addition to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. A multi-week stay abroad for individual occupations, such as for future commercial aviation officers, is also an integral part of the training. With the “Ready for Takeoff” professional preparation program, we prepare applicants who do not yet meet all criteria for direct entry for the technical vocational training at Fraport. The eight month long program is carried out in cooperation with the Employment Agency of Frankfurt am Main as well as Pittler ProRegion Berufsausbildung GmbH in Langen. Helping refugees to integrate into society and start a career will remain a key challenge in the years to come. With the BIFF training project initiated by Fraport and conducted in collaboration with companies based in Frankfurt and other institutions dedicated to the professional integration of young refugees, we play a role in offering qualifications and take social responsibility. The program offers an opportunity to choose a vocation, prepare for an apprenticeship, and improve language skills, while imparting the fundamental values of our social system as the essential element for integrating into the workplace and society. The digitization of the working environment presents another major challenge and will inevitably affect all training activities. The competences required of future skilled workers in the technical areas were coordinated with the departments within the framework of the “Professions of the future” project. The skills gained here must be harmonized with the requirements of the training regulations and taken into account when planning the training courses. In the future, such an evaluation will take place on a GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 83 regular basis together with the departments, and it will also be extended to commercial training. With a pilot group of technical apprentices, we will also review and evaluate the pedagogical and didactic value added of the use of tablets in the training. We see vocational training as a mission to offer a general education beyond the specific professional qualification. Within the scope of vocational training we will therefore continue to instill the basic values of our democracy in younger generations, and thus promote their interdisciplinary skills. We have concluded an evaluation of our current activities in political education and began implementing the modified concept at the end of 2018. We were able to gain the support of Gesellschaft für Politische Bildung Akademie Frankenwarte e.V. in Würzburg and Bildungsstätte Anne Frank in Frankfurt as cooperation partners.

GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 84 GRI 405 Diversity and Equal Opportunity – Management Approach Fraport stands for diversity. This becomes evident, in particular, when observing the variety of passengers, guests, and employees at the airport. Of a total of 21,961 employees in Germany, 5,120 employees do not possess a German passport. The largest share of this group are employees born in Turkey (1,931), followed by employees of Italian (406), Greek (360), and Croatian descent (223). Not only is there a remarkable number of nations that cross paths at the airport, but there is hardly any location in the world that combines to such an extent the religious and cultural backgrounds of people who use the airport terminals and who are employed at the airport. A variety of meditation and prayer rooms along with a room of silence are used by both passengers and employees. No other airport in the world offers passengers a comparably wide offer. Employees are grateful to have the opportunity for prayer, reflection, and contemplation directly at their workplace. Whenever people travel, there are always situations where help is needed. The church social service for passengers at Frankfurt Airport supports travelers who are in difficulty. There may be many different reasons for a difficult situation. Visas may have expired, documents or money been stolen, or passengers may have become stranded at the airport. Travelers may suffer from psychological stress and seek help from social services. Fraport supports the activities of Diakonie, a religious social welfare organization, both in terms of financial aid and personnel. A Diversity Board – Diversity Steering Committee – has been in place at Fraport since 2017. This Diversity Board is led by the diversity officers and is tasked with implementing the diversity strategy and ensuring adherence to the diversity goals. Executives from the management teams of the business, service, and central units are represented in the Diversity Board. At the same time, the Diversity Council was founded; it is tasked with supporting the diversity strategy as well as the goals and measures in technical terms and specific to each unit. The Diversity Council consists of representatives of the different work areas at Fraport. The Diversity Board and Diversity Council are bodies of the Fraport parent company and its units. Activities of Diversity Management in 2018 (selection): A particular focus on Diversity Management in the year under review was implementing the conceptual objectives that Fraport set for successful diversity management. An important part of this is the Diversity Council, which met on four occasions in the past year. Of central importance here is, on the one hand, learning more about specific issues and, on the other hand, increasing awareness for the importance of diversity in the company. The Diversity Board deals with stereotypes and the question of how to raise awareness amongst executives, and it also addresses the importance of networks and the networking of workers in an age of increasingly digital communication. A workshop on this topic was held within the scope of the German Diversity Days in June of the reporting period. The Diversity Council developed the RESPEKT campaign, which it also supports in an advisory role. The campaign is scheduled to start in 2019 with the aim of raising awareness of diversity among Fraport employees through posters and events. During an interactive workshop, executives were given the opportunity for the first time to experience the workplace and daily life from a perspective of an employee from the LGBT community. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 85 The seminar entitled “Arrival” addresses a target group of participants over the age of sixty; it was well received by participants and will now be held twice a year during normal working hours. This seminar aims to motivate long-term employees and to support them in the transition to retirement, both mentally and physically. To further develop a culture of reconciliation and as a result of the current “Workplace of the future” strategic project, a survey of employees and executives was carried out for the first time regarding their experience with teleworking. The results as well as the corresponding measures derived from them will be published in 2019. Over 80% of the target group took part in the survey. Religious festivals and traditions are recognized as well. In 2018 for example, Fraport once again offered both passengers and employees a three-day “Iftar” at the airport, during which meals and drinks were served free of charge for people to break their religious fast. The number of people taking part in such events has grown steadily in recent years. In November 2018, the feast of the “Abrahamic religions” was held for the eighteenth time. This interfaith celebration is an important event for the airport community, with contributions from local politicians and municipalities neighboring the airport. This event culminated in an exhibition by the photographer Rafael Herlich, who has published an illustrated book on the variety of religions in his hometown of Frankfurt. Fraport’s commitment and its contribution to interfaith dialog in the region is explicitly mentioned and illustrated in the photo book “DIVERCITY FFM”. Since 2018, an additional social worker from Diakonie Frankfurt has been working at the airport to attend specifically to the homeless at Frankfurt Airport. Our outreach work is there to help these people and allow them to return to normal life. Since 2016, Fraport has worked successfully in this area with the Diakonisches Werk, a charity aid organization. Since then, around 50 people not belonging to the airport have been able to find a new outlook on life. In 2006, an initiative to integrate people with health and physical constraints in all employment areas of the company was enshrined as an objective in the integration agreement of the Fraport parent company. We offer the same opportunities to people with disabilities or limitations so that they can be promoted and develop their skills just as other employees. The proportion of workers with a severe disability or equivalent circumstance at the Fraport parent company was 13.1% (in the previous year: 12.8%). These values are – as has been the case in past years – well above the five percent required by law in Germany. Within the Group, the rate was 7.7%. The integration agreement applies to the Fraport parent company. It also ensures that the contents of the integration agreement are taken into account in the Group companies.

GRI 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to men As an international company, Fraport encourages diversity in its workforce and acts in accordance with the principle of equality, rejecting any form of discrimination. Frankfurt Airport is defined as a significant business site, as 88% of the Group’s employees work at this site. In accordance with the usual structure of collective bargaining agreements, in particular that included in the CBA for public service workers, no gender-specific criteria may be taken into account when assessing activities. Criteria such as knowledge and skills, responsibility, level of difficulty of the activity, or management responsibility must form the basis for assessment. Only the actual GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 86 job is assessed and not the person who is carrying out the activity. Moreover, positions are usually assessed before they are advertised. In 2013 we participated in a Logib-D consultation promoted by the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) in order to review the actual salary data of female and male employees. After the survey and analysis of the structural data, Fraport AG (Fraport parent company) was given formal recognition at the start of 2014 that the Company had made equal pay a key strategic issue and that it acted as a role model. In addition, the so-called “Pay Transparency Act” entered into effect in Germany in 2017. This law promotes transparency of remuneration and remuneration schemes. An important role is given to strengthening collective bargaining coverage and social partnership. Beginning in 2018, the law provides a right to information enabling employees to find out the statistical median pay for workers of the opposite sex in their pay grade. See also code of conduct for employees at https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport/management/compliance.html. Human Rights General Management Approach HR The Fraport Group has undertaken to comply with the most important internationally recognized codes of conduct – the principles of the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Core Labor Standards of the International Labor Organization (ILO). In accordance with the values in the Fraport Code of Conduct, Fraport intends to operate with integrity and in an economically and ecologically sustainable manner. This responsibility is defined in the Code of Conduct for all employees. The same expectations can be found in the Fraport Supplier Code of Conduct. Fraport expects its suppliers and service providers to comply with the same standards regarding their handling of employees and their integrity in business activities. The Supplier Code of Conduct ensures the respect for human rights in assignments and also includes subcontractors. Fraport rejects any form of forced or child labor. Among other things, the minimum age permitting full-time employment in compliance with the relevant national regulations is observed within the Fraport Group. The Code of Conduct and the Compliance Guidelines in place at each respective Fraport Group company are available to all employees on the internal information portals. Fraport has established the appropriate reporting channels for any human rights violations. In the course of semi-annual compliance reporting, the Executive Board is notified about the activities of the department dealing with compliance at the Fraport AG and the status of measures. The certified electronic whistleblower system (BKMS® System), which is available within the Fraport Group, is an important tool for preventing or uncovering violations of human rights. Fraport AG has also engaged an external lawyer to act as ombudswoman for all employees at the Group’s German companies as well as customers, suppliers, and other business partners. Her job is to receive, legally review and forward information about unlawful conduct that damages the company. An internal representative is also available to employees in Germany. Regulations on working hours and complaints mechanisms, for example, are implemented in large financing projects, some of which are also demanded by external lenders. The Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP), which requires the implementation of a human resource policy as well as a management and a monitoring system, is, for example, a prerequisite for GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 87 the financing of Fraport Greece. The plan applies not only to Fraport’s employees, but also to suppliers and subcontractors. The ESAP also regulates the conditions for employees along the supply chain in order to prevent, for example, suppliers from employing refugees under inappropriate working conditions. In its “Environmental Impact Study for the Expansion Program of the AIJCH” updated for fiscal year 2018, the Group company Lima has laid out the requirements for the contractual implementation of the airport expansion in line with social and ecological guidelines. In addition, the Group company recognizes the “Equator Principles”, a set of rules by banks to comply with environmental and social standards in the area of project financing. In addition to an electronic whistleblower system introduced in 2018, the Group companies Fortaleza and Porto Alegre have set up monthly meetings which, among other things, focus on the protection of employees. For the implementation of the expansion program, the Group company Porto Alegre is committed to initiate the relocation of over 900 families within the framework of the concession contract. The relocation is being conducted in a structured manner already practiced in Brazil. Thanks to the close cooperation with the competent authorities of the municipal administration and the regional government, the local legislation is strictly adhered to. The affected families will be compensated by the Group company Porto Alegre. The aforementioned organizational concepts for identifying and reporting irregularities ensures that the Executive Board gains direct knowledge of any known cases of human rights violations or any other relevant information they receive. During the reporting period, there were no complaints related to human rights submitted to Fraport by way of the formal organizational complaint mechanisms. In the period under review, Fraport AG and its subsidiaries did not receive any complaints in connection with human rights submitted through formal, organizational complaint mechanisms.

GRI 406 Non-discrimination – Management Approach As a cosmopolitan company with an international perspective, Fraport values the diversity of its employees. Diversity enriches cooperation and promotes innovation and creativity. This is why diversity is a strategic issue for Fraport which the Group systematically fosters in its Diversity Management program. We respect and promote personal differences and work toward ensuring that this is reflected in dealings with others. The Group company agreement entitled “The Conduct of Partnership, Diversity, and Equality in the Workplace” formed the platform for defining key principles such as non-discrimination and equal opportunity for the Fraport Group.

GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 89 GRI 410 Security Practices – Management Approach Security is the essential prerequisite for air transport; this applies equally to both passenger and freight transport. Accordingly, security management has always been the top priority at Fraport. All 192 Member States (including all countries in which Fraport is active) of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have contractually committed to comply with the safety standards and recommended practices for airports. The same applies for the 44 Member States of the European organization of European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). National legislation ensures the responsibilities within this framework. In contrast to most EU, ECAC, and ICAO Member States, German law allocates, for example, passenger and baggage checks to government authorities, whereas in foreign countries this is usually the responsibility of the airports. The application of stricter measures based on a local risk evaluation in individual EU Member States is also possible. Within the Fraport Group, each company is subject to the security regulations in place in its respective country. Management must present proof of the fulfillment of the conditions to the supervisory authority in the respective country. Nonetheless, the security officers of the Group companies exchange information on certain projects or topics. IT security All important business and operating processes of Fraport are supported by IT systems and IT components. Due to the ongoing development of new technologies and the ever-increasing global threat of cyberattacks, there is an underlying risk potential for IT systems. Fraport takes account of this situation with active and preventative IT security management. This particularly focuses on safeguarding the security of IT systems that are critical to the company. The requirements for IT security are specified in the IT security policy and security guidelines that must be followed throughout the Group. Compliance with these requirements is checked regularly by the Internal Audit department, by IT security management, or external advisors. As a rule, the IT systems of the Group companies at the Frankfurt site as well as the SAP systems of Fraport Greece are integrated into the technology of Fraport AG and managed from Frankfurt. Exceptions in this regard are only possible with the approval of the Executive Board. The Group companies outside of Frankfurt use their own IT infrastructure, which provides protection according to the Group’s IT security policy. A serious system failure or material loss of data could lead to serious business disruptions and security risks. In addition to this, attacks by viruses and hackers could lead to system failure and ultimately to the loss of business-critical or confidential data. To counter these risks, all of the IT systems of critical importance to the company are configured redundantly and are housed at separate sites. The risks in the area of IT security are included in the risk management system. A separate section is responsible for IT security at Fraport AG. Its tasks are, among other things, the ongoing identification and implementation of measures to meet high safety standards. Within the scope of a working group in the German Aviation Association, Fraport AG along with other airport operators, Deutsche Lufthansa and the German Air Traffic Control has developed the security standards of the industry. These are based on the new requirements laid out by the IT Security in Critical Infrastructures (KRITIS) research program. The goal is to establish a high standard of security within the aviation industry through the selection of security measures, the assignment of measures according to predefined confidence levels, and mutual assessment. The work should be completed in 2019, and the industry standard should be released by the German Federal Office for Information Security. The standard ensures that the statutory provisions will be implemented at Fraport AG by mid-2019. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 90 The use of a standardized tool for all processes of IT security including documentation is currently being planned. In addition, the section coordinates awareness-raising activities for staff and external workers to ensure a high security awareness. The IT Security Officer at Fraport AG reports weekly to the Chief Information Officer, and a report is submitted to the IT Management Board every two months. The level of IT security is also part of the annual management report for ISO 9001 quality management certification. Proprietary key figures provide information about the status of IT security measures, divided into security and compliance aspects, at any time. The resulting overall score is regularly reported to the Executive Board. The risk management and safety management systems as well as selected measures are subjected to regular organizational and technical audits and checks by the internal audit department. In 2018, Fraport AG once again implemented a variety of projects to adequately respond to the growing risks arising from information technology. Among other things, Fraport AG updated its awareness-raising campaign originally launched in 2012. In addition, new requirements from the German IT Security Act, such as the reporting of incidents and an independent audit of security levels, have been fulfilled. Airport safety and security This area encompasses both security and safety: Safety refers to the operational safety of the overall airport operations as well as the safety within the airport grounds. Security is understood in terms of defending against terrorist threats and protecting civil aviation. The relevant measures include passenger, baggage, and cargo inspections and reviewing the access control points for airport employees and suppliers. Safety The Safety Management System (SMS) is in place with the goal of avoiding personal injury and damage to aircraft, vehicles, or infrastructure due to accidents and technical defects. For example, anyone with access to the airside areas (apron and runway) must complete SMS training before they can enter the airside areas. Emergency and crisis management is also part of safety management. Fraport AG is obliged to operate a SMS at Frankfurt Airport. It was established based on EU Regulation 2018/1139, 139/2014, and the relevant guidance materials. With the SMS, security incidents are recorded and evaluated, and potential vulnerabilities are identified. It is meant for all organizations and individuals with access to the airside areas at Frankfurt Airport. All factors that may affect the safety of airport operations are taken into account in the SMS, whether they are of a technical, organizational, or human nature. To this end, internal and external employees can send safety notices or messages. They are treated as confidential upon request, and they can also be placed anonymously. The SMS in place for all people and organizations participating in the operation of the airport documents the responsibilities, methods, and operating procedures that are relevant to ongoing occupational safety. For example, the SMS contains specifications for identifying hazards as well as instructions for process and risk evaluations. Proactive recommendations are therefore possible with this system. The SMS was last updated on December 11, 2017. The EASA Safety Manager follows the guidelines of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and enjoys a direct reporting right to the Executive Board. As a central reporting and alarm point for security matters, Fraport AG operates a Safety and Security Control Center at Frankfurt Airport which carries out the emergency and crisis management if necessary. The airport fire department, the medical services, the ambulance service, and the security services then coordinate operations in the field. A crisis unit is also commencing operations in the “Emergency Response and Information Center” (ERIC). It coordinates and executes all measures that require a concerted approach at the site beyond any routine damage and risk prevention. If necessary, the care team is activated, and this team interacts with passengers, greeters, and relatives on site or acts as an “emergency information center” to handle telephone inquiries. The care team consists of volunteer employees of Fraport AG and the Group companies at the Frankfurt site who are trained for the respective tasks. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 91 The contingency plan for the Frankfurt Airport “FRA Not” documents which preparations have been made for various emergency scenarios and defines procedures to minimize the impact. These include, in particular, the rescue of humans and animals, the preservation of natural resources and material assets, as well as maintaining the airport’s operations. The FRA Not plan includes procedures to coordinate all internal and external bodies to deal with emergencies. In order to train for the handling of emergencies and other security-related scenarios, regular exercises at the international airports are prescribed by ICAO and EASA. They are prerequisites for obtaining an operating license. Each respective operating company is responsible for carrying out the procedures. In November 2018, Fraport AG together with Deutsche Lufthansa, the Regional Health Department in Frankfurt, the Frankfurt Fire Department, the Special Isolation Ward of Frankfurt University Hospital, and ambulance services and authorities at Frankfurt Airport rehearsed procedures in a medical emergency. In this case, the exercise is not only required by ICAO and EASA but also fulfilled international health regulations. Such exercises have no impact on flight operations. The scenario of the exercise was based on the event that two passengers exhibit symptoms of a contagious infection while on a flight to Frankfurt. After a fictional landing scenario, the doctors of the Regional Health Department and Fraport AG practiced the procedures on board the aircraft. The additional medical treatment of all passengers as well as the transfer of the infectious passengers with special vehicles of the Fire Department to the Special Isolation Ward of Frankfurt University Hospital were part of the exercise. The results will be used for further education and training. Security Both international and European regulations contain guidelines on the structural design of airport infrastructure for the purposes of defending against attacks on the security of air transport. The security measures at the airports aim to prevent attacks, such as hijacking, acts of sabotage, or terrorist activities. In Germany, passenger and baggage checks are part of the central functions of security according to Section 5 of the German Aviation Security Act (LuftSiG). They lie within the jurisdiction of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community and are carried out by the German Federal Police and any third parties it commissions. At Frankfurt Airport, Fraport employees as well as employees of the Group company FraSec and other private security providers currently carry out airport security checks on behalf of the German Federal Police. According to Section 8 of the LuftSiG, all buildings and the site must be designed in such a way that the operation of the airport can be protected against attacks on the security of air transport and the proper implementation of all security measures is ensured. This applies, in particular, to the access controls to the airside areas as well as controlling persons, all carried objects, and vehicles before entering the security area. In addition, fencing, identification cards, training of personnel, as well as the safe transport of controlled luggage which protects it from unauthorized access are all part of these requirements. These security measures are the direct responsibility of the airport operator. They are presented in an air safety program approved by Hessian Ministry of Economics, Energy, Transport and Housing as the supervisory authority. The education and training of all security personnel occurs in accordance with Group-wide regulatory and internal requirements. At the Frankfurt site, the training requirements apply to security personnel of Fraport AG as well as of the Group company FraSec. The Group company FraSec carries out access checks for vehicles and people as well as goods at access points to the security area on behalf Fraport AG. Fraport AG does not limit its activities at Frankfurt Airport to the implementation of legal requirements, but rather also develops measures in agreement with the competent authorities responsible for maintaining the high safety standards. For example, the fence surrounding Runway West was upgraded with electronic sensors in 2018 that automatically report every touch. In addition, GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 92 Fraport AG tested a vehicle for autonomous fence controls in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute. As an additional measure, a security-awareness campaign using various media was set up to raise awareness among employees at the airport regarding security and encourage them to report any incidents to the Safety and Security Control Center. While the focus in 2018 was on security measures at terminals, in 2019 safety will be given a greater priority. As the operator of Frankfurt Airport, Fraport AG assumes responsibility for the task of exchanging all information relevant to security and for ensuring the continuous communication and close cooperation with the organizations responsible for security. In terms of work processes, regular weekly or monthly meetings are held with airlines, security service providers, and authorities for this purpose. Several times a year, Fraport AG invites managers of these companies as well as authorities to a meeting to exchange information. GRI 410-1 Security personnel trained in human rights policies or procedures See GRI 410 Security Practices, section Security. GRI 411 Indigenous Rights GRI 411-1 Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples Fraport respects the rights of indigenous peoples. During the reporting period, there were no incidents affecting the rights of indigenous peoples. GRI 412 Human Rights Assessment – Management Approach See General Management Approach HR. GRI 412-1 Geschäftstätigkeiten, die Gegenstand einer Bewertung hinsichtlich Menschenrechten und Folgenabschätzung waren During the reporting period, none of the investments were subject to a human rights assessment and/or impact assessment. GRI 412-3 Investment agreements and contracts that include human rights clauses In fiscal year 2018, no significant investment agreements were concluded through which Fraport has acquired shares in a different organization or initiated an investment project that would be material for the balance sheet. Within the framework of large financing projects, for example, regulations on working hours and complaint mechanisms, some of which are also required by lenders, are implemented (see General Management Approach HR). Significant factors for the selection of suppliers include the principles for awarding orders based on Section 97 of the German Act against Restraints of Competition (GWB):  Competitive principle (the maximum number of bidders should be given the opportunity to offer their services in a formalized procedure)  Transparency principle (all bidders should be provided with the same information. The selected procedure must not be changed in an ongoing commissioning procedure)  Equality principle/Prohibition on discrimination (all bidders should be treated equally)  Offer based on batch allocation (Major orders should be allotted in specialist batches and sub-batches in order to give small and mediumsized companies the opportunity to submit bids within the scope of their capacity)  Principle of profitability (the contract should be awarded to the most economic offer) When services are put out to tender, Fraport AG generally guarantees compliance with national and international law and agreements. This is again confirmed in legally binding terms when the contract is signed. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 93 Since the beginning of 2013, we have supplemented this with a Code of Conduct for the suppliers of Fraport AG, and we expect our suppliers to comply with this code. It is based on the principles of the UN Global Compact and is a constituent element of all tenders and contracts (see https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport/management/compliance.html). A specific compliance business partner review was established for the Airport Expansion South project. The aim is to minimize compliance risks (e.g., corruption, price agreements, fraud, etc.) by conducting due diligence on specific future business partners and to detect potential conflicts of interest. The process, which was established in 2016, provides for a multi-stage, risk-based approach, including integrity checks by external service providers. The process was continued at Flughafen Ausbau Süd (FAS) GmbH, which commenced operations on January 1, 2017. Moreover, compliance due diligence was introduced as a standard process in Global Investments and Management (BET) in 2015. As a result, significant compliance aspects, such as business partner audits on topics such as corruption, price agreements and fraud are taken into account in all investment projects and consulting services. The Group companies of Fraport AG implement the Fraport Standards for the Compliance Management System (CMS) based on the Group policy of Fraport AG on the Group CMS. See also GRI 102-16 Values, principles, standards and norms of behaviour. Community General Management Approach SO Airports are important business locations and contribute directly and indirectly to economic and social value creation. For example, Frankfurt Airport is the largest local workplace in Germany with almost 81,000 direct employees (as at December 31, 2015). The survey provides an insight into the sectors in which employees at the site work. Accordingly, two thirds of employees surveyed work for an airline, in airport operations, or in freight forwarding and transport operations. Other sectors are authorities and institutions, catering, security services, personnel services, consulting, hotels and restaurants, freight handling, cleaning, and retail. There is predominantly potential for growth in companies that offer security services and at authorities. The people who live in the metropolitan region around the airport also benefit from this. They not only benefit from the short journey to the airport; many of them also work at a company that benefits from being close to the airport. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 94 GRI 413 Local Communities – Management Approach Frankfurt Airport is the site in the Group with the largest traffic volume by far and is also the location of the company headquarters. For Fraport, social responsibility has been a corporate principle for many years. Fraport AG has therefore long supported numerous clubs and institutions in the Rhine-Main region in particular. Fraport AG’s funding concept for its community, cultural and social engagement is “Active for the region”. It primarily serves to boost clubs and support volunteer work in the region around Frankfurt Airport. All activities are combined into an independent department. In organizational terms, the competent central unit is assigned to the Chairman of the Executive Board. The so-called “neighborhood framework” describes the geographical boundary for support activities. The area is based on district and state borders taking into account the most important approach and takeoff routes. If these change, the neighborhood framework will also be modified – as it was most recently when Runway Northwest was inaugurated. The expansion allowed other cities and municipalities to participate in the company’s support activities. Donation priorities include the promotion of social and charitable institutions, particularly those that encompass measures relating to education, social equality, health, and the integration of marginalized groups in society. Employees can also apply for donations as patrons of their clubs. Sports sponsorship in the Rhine-Main region includes both recreational and professional sports. Well-known names that have concluded long-term contracts with Fraport AG include the FRAPORT SKYLINERS and Eintracht Frankfurt. In the area of basketball, Fraport sponsors not only the German league team but also gives donations to support the project “Basketball goes to school”. At Eintracht Frankfurt, the club is promoted and Eintracht AG is sponsored with the affiliated soccer school. In the fields of culture and education, Fraport is involved in the Rheingau Music Festival, among other things. There are also longterm partnerships with the Frankfurt cultural institutions Städel Museum, Schirn Kunsthalle, and Liebieghaus sculpture collection. Overall, in 2018 Fraport supported more than 1,500 projects run by various clubs and institutions by making donations and providing sponsorships totaling around €6.0 million. Fraport has financially supported youths’ and young adults’ integration into working life since 1999 with the ProRegion Foundation. The original objectives of the foundation were the provision of funding for the creation of additional apprentice positions or the securing of available apprentice capacities in the region. New priority areas have emerged in the past few years. In addition to projects for the vocational and social integration of young refugees, other projects on professional orientation and competence assessment in general education schools are receiving more and more funding. The Foundation’s committees have taken this social development as an opportunity to extend the purpose of the Foundation in addition to promoting vocational education in the field of “social integration”. Since the Foundation only acts as a funding institution, it relies on close cooperation with proven providers of youth vocational education. These include Gesellschaft für Jugendbeschäftigung e. V., an association dedicated to youth employment in Frankfurt, Evangelische Verein für Jugendsozialarbeit, an association for youth social work, Verein für Kultur und Bildung e. V., an association for culture and education, and Berufsbildungswerk Südhessen in Karben, an institute whose goal is to prepare youth for careers and vocational training. As one of the largest employers in Hesse, Fraport AG focuses on helping young people to integrate in the workplace with two career preparation programs. The programs “Startklar” (Ready to Roll) and “BIFF” (Berufliche Integration von Flüchtlingen in Frankfurt Rhein-Main or Professional Integration of Refugees in Frankfurt Rhine-Main) are aimed at young people without a apprentice position or young refugees. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 95 Fraport has supported nature and environmental conservation projects, research, and environmental education since 1997 with the environmental fund. Its best-known project is the RhineMain Regional Park, which extends between Rüdesheim, Wetterau, the Kinzig Valley, and the Hessian Ried. Fraport is also involved in the Wirtschaftsinitiative FrankfurtRheinMain (FrankfurtRhineMain Business Initiative), which 150 companies participate in. One outcome of this cooperation is the House of Logistics and Mobility (HOLM) competence center at Frankfurt Airport. Even at the individual sites of the international Group companies, regions close to the airport benefit from the economic performance and the donations made and sponsorship activities undertaken by each Group company independently. The companies and their value chains as well as employee consumption contribute directly and indirectly to the positive economic development of the respective regions. GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs See GRI 413 Local Communities – Management Approach. Fraport regularly conducts open stakeholder dialogues (see „Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018“, page. 44 et seq.). GRI 413-2 Operations with significant actual or potential negative impacts on local communities Airports significantly contribute to economic prosperity through jobs, tax revenue, and excellent transport connections. However, their business activities also have disadvantages which exert negative impacts on local communities. A material aspect here is noise abatement (see “Noise – Management Approach” in section GRI 300 ENVIRONMENTAL). AO8 Number of persons displaced by the airport operator and compensation measures In 2018, 51 families were resettled so that work could begin on the drainage system at Porto Alegre Airport. The relocations were carried out in accordance with Fraport’s obligations under the concession contract. Fraport paid the affected families compensation totaling over 580,000 reais. 41 of the displaced families had already been compensated in recent years by the Brazilian government. GRI 414 Supplier Social Assessment GRI 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social criteria During the reporting period, no contracts with major suppliers or contractors were rejected on account of human rights criteria or came into being only due to the inclusion of additional framework conditions. Further screening is therefore not required. GRI 415 Public Policy – Management Approach Fraport has a broad network of institutionalized, structured communication media to promote dialog and a regular exchange of views with our stakeholder groups (see “Our Values – Sustainability Report 2018”, page 44 et seq.). Fraport pursues its interests through membership of the industry organizations Task Force for German Commercial Airports (ADV) (see http://www.adv.aero/) and Airports Council International (see http://www.aci.aero). Europe, and World. From July 2018, the Chairman of the Fraport AG Executive Board, Dr. Stefan Schulte, will serve as the honorary president of the German Commercial Airports (ADV) for a period of two and a half years. Fraport is also a member of the Federation of the German Air Traffic Industry (BDL) (see http://www.bdl.aero/en/). BDL focuses on the importance of air traffic as an economic factor for Germany and aims to highlight its contribution to safe mobility, climate and environmental protection. We are working together with committees within GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 96 these organizations to prepare positions on air traffic issues. This includes positions on projected legislation and political initiatives. Working with trade organizations is a top priority for Fraport. Involvement in trade organizations promotes the exchange of information and cooperation with other airports and airlines on current issues relating to traffic policy and sector-specific matters. ADV and the BDL focus on Germany’s importance as a traffic hub. ACI EUROPE and ACI WORLD address issues relating to European and international air traffic. In Europe, the exchange between hub airports is particularly important, as common positions, strategies and solutions can be agreed here. Working with trade organizations involves a range of different specific issues (e.g., environmental policy, safety measures, passenger rights, infrastructure development, Single European Sky, etc.). The Fraport Executive Board also plays an active role in the management bodies of the industry associations. See also https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/fraport/about-us/european-topics-associations.html. GRI 415-1 Political contributions The company makes no financial donations to political parties or institutions. Product Responsibility General Management Approach PR The customer comes first for Fraport. This is also reflected by the mission statement, “Gute Reise! We make it happen.” The aim of the strategy is to establish itself as Europe’s best airport operator and also to set global standards. This ensures the development of the company’s value and competitiveness in the long term. The target is to win over the main customers, i.e. passengers, airlines, the freight community, and retail concessionaires, with attractive offers and the best service. At the Frankfurt site, Fraport works closely among others with the Federal Police to ensure that security and passport control processes are efficient and that a high volume of passengers is handled in sufficient time. Passenger satisfaction is important for international Group companies too. The fully consolidated Group airports that are operated through concession agreements are contractually obliged to carry out surveys on passenger satisfaction. This is measured at the different sites using various key figures. Where appropriate, this system of collecting data is to be harmonized in the medium term. Passenger satisfaction at Lima Airport was 94% in 2018 (2017: 82%). Travelers reacted positively to various improvements to the quality of services. For example, customs clearances, the look and feel of the public areas of the terminal, and retail offers were improved. At the airports in Varna and Burgas, the satisfaction level was nearly 74%. Here the system of collecting data used by Fraport AG was applied for the first time in fiscal year 2018. In the new system, the previous year’s level of 97% resulted in a satisfaction rate of 82%, a decrease of 8 percentage points. While satisfaction at Varna Airport increased, it deteriorated in Burgas due to the high use of the terminal in the summer. Despite significant passenger volume growth, the number of complaints in Ljubljana rose only slightly to 81 (previous year: 64). In March 2018, Fraport Greece launched an expanded market research program at all 14 airports. Based on these survey results in summer 2018, all airports received overall grades, despite on-going construction, of better than 3.00 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is very poor and 5 is excellent). The three top ranked airports were Rhodes (4.06), Aktion (3.94), and Kefalonia (3.86). At the two Brazilian airports Fortaleza and Porto Alegre, passenger satisfaction will be measured within the scope of the concessions guidelines in the future. The initial results are expected for the second quarter of 2019. In order to guarantee service quality while traffic volume increases, and to meet passengers’ and airlines’ increasing requirements, Fraport is conducting extensive expansion and modernization measures at the Group airports. For example, a new terminal and a second runway will be built at Lima Airport. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 97 Frankfurt Airport, the site with the most passengers, is a particular focus in the Group portfolio. The following will therefore discuss the service quality management implemented at that site. Passenger satisfaction is considered the most important criterion for service quality. Global satisfaction describes passengers’ satisfaction with the services offered and the overall service at Frankfurt Airport. Fraport is committed to the target of maintaining and increasing customer satisfaction continuously. Despite the expected temporary overload of terminal infrastructure due to traffic growth in the next few years, Fraport AG aims for a target of at least 80% global satisfaction at Frankfurt Airport. With the inauguration of Pier G of Terminal 3, passenger satisfaction should be at least 82.5% from 2021. From 2025, Fraport AG’s target is at least 85% based on the complete capacity increase from Terminal 3. In Frankfurt, passenger satisfaction is mainly recorded using surveys. The global satisfaction of passengers at the Frankfurt site in 2018 was 86%, one percentage point above the level of the previous year (previous year: 85%). With 69.5 million passengers in 2018, Frankfurt Airport recorded strong growth of 7.8% compared to the previous year. This resulted in increased waiting times at security checkpoints during peaks in traffic (particularly during school vacations and public holidays). This was reflected, among other things, in an increase in the number of complaints about the security inspection process. Passenger satisfaction with waiting times at security checkpoints was 80% in 2018 (previous year: 81%) and satisfaction with personnel at security check was 82% in 2018 (previous year: 82%). Despite the excellent results for most key figures in passenger satisfaction in the fiscal year 2018, the focus is on improving performance particularly at security checkpoints. Fraport is co-operating closely with the authorities of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community (BMI), the German Federal Police, and security companies in an effort to avoid long waiting times for passengers at the security checkpoints in the future. The service program “Great to have you here!” launched in 2010 has increased global passenger satisfaction at Frankfurt Airport significantly. As part of five sub-initiatives, directions and signposting, ambiance and comfort, and the range of relaxation, work and entertainment options on offer in the terminals were all significantly improved. Most of the measures were successfully completed in 2018. Individual measures, such as the renovation of the sanitary facilities, will continue in fiscal year 2019. At the same time, in 2018, approximately 1,100 employees completed training within the scope of the “Service Excellence” program, in order to further improve hospitality and service orientation at Frankfurt Airport. In 2018, passenger satisfaction regarding the hospitality of airport staff was 91%, which represented a significant increase (previous year: 85%). Fraport has also directly exchanged ideas with Deutsche Lufthansa, the security companies working at the Frankfurt site, retail concessionaires and other service providers, and Deutsche Bahn regarding service, hospitality, and customer satisfaction in the Service Quality Committee since 2016. The first important milestone was the definition and approval of the Service Guidelines for FRA. In these guidelines, the partners reiterate their desire and their joint responsibility to strengthen the Frankfurt site and to further develop service quality and trusting cooperation. The target is to ensure that common passengers, customers, and guests keep a good impression of Frankfurt Airport in addition to improving global satisfaction of the passengers, the willingness to recommend Frankfurt Airport, satisfaction with the hospitality, and improving the sense of security. Fraport AG’s Executive Board is informed in quarterly reports about the most important key figure passenger satisfaction indicators and involved in decision-making processes. The Executive Board also adopts annual target levels for the most important passenger satisfaction criteria. These levels are authoritative for all relevant business units and in some cases for service providers. Improvement measures are primarily set out in the service program, employee training, and other infrastructure projects. Also, the strategic relevance of global satisfaction of the passengers is made clear by considering it as part of Executive Board remuneration. GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 98 The reliable loading of luggage for departing flights and the fast delivery of luggage to the baggage claim for arriving flights have a major impact on customer satisfaction. The baggage connectivity figure provides information about the percentage of baggage at Frankfurt Airport that is loaded on time in relation to the total departing baggage. A high level of connectivity proves the good quality of baggage processes, which is one of the main responsibilities of Ground Services. This is particularly important because Frankfurt has a high proportion of transfer baggage with a transfer share of more than 55%. The objective is to achieve a longterm baggage connectivity of more than 98.5%. In the past fiscal year, baggage connectivity amounted to 98.4% and was therefore 0.1 percentage point below the previous year’s and the target figure. In particular, delayed flights and poor weather conditions had a negative impact on the loading of baggage on time. In order to maintain connectivity at its current high level in the future coupled with increasing number of baggage items, Fraport is constantly working on optimization measures that are closely coordinated and implemented with airlines within the scope of regular performance discussions. In order to maintain baggage handling at a high level given the strong traffic growth in fiscal year 2018, recruitment of personnel was significantly expanded. On the other hand, IT processes were optimized to ensure the stability of the IT infrastructure of the baggage conveyor system, even when processing high volumes. The Executive Board is informed about the development of baggage connectivity on a monthly basis. The division managers receive daily reports, so that countermeasures can be taken to restore the quality in the event of a decline in performance. The values are regularly discussed with the airlines, and measures are implemented for improvements wherever necessary. For example, Deutsche Lufthansa frequently receives a detailed monitoring report, and improvement measures are managed jointly. Other parameters for measuring customer satisfaction and service quality at Frankfurt Airport include the annual ranking of the top 100 airports by the consultancy Skytrax. Frankfurt Airport was ranked tenth in 2018 worldwide, based on online passenger surveys (2017: tenth place). GRI 416 Customer Health and Safety – Management Approach The top priority for air traffic is safety. We want to retain the high standard of safety at Frankfurt Airport. A continuous review of all processes governing safety, training of personnel deployed, and a safety management system enable us to make a significant contribution to safety. Increasingly advanced technologies and more and more personnel are being deployed at Frankfurt Airport to guarantee the safety of passengers, baggage, and cargo. Another central area of action is noise abatement. We are committed to taking responsibility and we incorporate all the aspects of this conflict into our business actions to maximum possible effect. This is particularly important against the background of a foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic. In order to reduce the noise pollution created by the operation of the airport, together with our partners from the “Alliance for Noise Abatement” we have implemented a variety of active and passive noise abatement measures, and we continue to work on the development and introduction of additional improvements (for more information, see “Noise Abatement” at https://www.fraport.com/en/our-company/responsibility/aircraft-noise-infoservice/noise-abatement.html). Fraport AG developed a Wildlife Management Program to protect against biological risks for air traffic and the impact of the airport operations on wildlife. Collisions with individual large birds or flocks of birds are a hazard for aircraft. Because, statistically, around two thirds of all bird strikes take place at airports or neighboring areas, Fraport, like every airport operator, is obliged to minimize this risk. As is now common practice internationally, Fraport in Frankfurt also focuses on special biotope management. The airport grounds are designed to be unattractive for animals relevant in this context, i.e. breeding, resting and feeding opportunities are minimized or avoided. Bird collection points in the vicinity of the airport are regularly monitored. In the case of new planning and GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 99 rescheduling in the region, influence is exerted in the planning process to ensure biological flight safety. In 2018, Frankfurt Airport had a wildlife strike rate of 5.34 incidents per 10,000 aircraft movements (previous year: 5.59), slightly below the national average of 5.61 (previous year: 5.8). The statistics also include collisions with mammals. Further information: Service quality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) GRI 401 Employment – Management Approach GRI 410 Security Practices – Management Approach Business Continuity and Disaster Management (AOS) Business Continuity and Disaster Management (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Fraport AG currently has an emergency management system spanning all departments that was implemented on the basis of the Emergency Plan for Frankfurt Airport, and applies this to all emergency incidents. Each individual incident and the measures taken are documented. Apart from routine everyday business, extreme weather events and partial evacuations of terminal buildings were a particular issue on the agenda last year. Our crisis team was also engaged in this matter in our emergency center (ERIC – Emergency Response and Information Center). Emergency management also covers the care team, where volunteer employees work in the ERIC support team, the special assistance team, the emergency information center, and the basic assistance team. The ERIC support team supports the crisis team with its work in emergency situations or serious operational disruptions affecting Frankfurt Airport. The special assistance team provides psychological and social frontline assistance to possible relatives or uninjured affected parties, while the emergency information center is the first telephone contact point for relatives at the airport and the basic assistance team helps to support passengers in the terminals in special circumstances. Emergency and crisis management comprises the following elements  Emergency planning  Crisis preparation  Emergency Response and Information Center (ERIC)  Care team  Emergency exercises  Airport fire brigade  Airport safety  Security control center  Medical services In order to ensure adequate preparation for emergencies, a range of different emergency exercises are regularly carried out at Frankfurt Airport, for example  Planned exercies  Full exercises  (Partial) exercises firefighting and rescue exercises  (Partial) exercises for informing relatives, affected airlines, media, and the general public  (Partial) exercises providing initial counceling for uninjured survivors of an accident, their relatives, and people giving assistance. Alongside smaller exercises, e.g. evacuation of persons from the Skyline, a full exercise is carried out at the airport every two years in accordance with statutory regulations and international and European directives. This major exercise involves practicing GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 100 for complex emergencies. The primary focus is on the effective cooperation between internal and external emergency services. The Emergency Directive for Frankfurt Airport (FRA Not) forms the basis for planning and coordinating these exercises. The exercise scenarios are planned and carried out as near to reality as possible, in order to ensure that all the parameters contained in the emergency plan are reviewed – the functionality and effectiveness of organizational, personnel, and material precautions, as well as the qualifications of the emergency and support personnel. Special training and career development courses are held, for example, for employees in the Care Team (see https://www.fraport.com/en/business-partner/airlines-cargo/securityservices.html). The Fraport Group has a comprehensive Risk Management System. This ensures that material risks are identified, continuously monitored, and delimited within the framework of the existing options to an acceptable level. Among the events that may affect the quality of service at the airport, for example, are a failure of the central airport information system (INFOplus) or the electronic gate management system. Corresponding countermeasures for the failure of a system are laid down in individual section processes. GRI 416-1 Product life cycle stages for which health and safety impacts are assessed for improvement The top priority for air traffic is safety. By continuously reviewing all safety-related processes, the training of our staff, and a safety management system, we can maintain the high level of safety at Frankfurt Airport.

See Business Continuity and Disaster Management. Service Quality (Airport Operators Sector Disclosures) Service quality is measured by the following instruments: 1. Fraport passenger survey on customer satisfaction Each year, around 29,000 passengers are surveyed in respect of their satisfaction with Frankfurt Airport. The questionnaire includes satisfaction with the time spent at the airport overall, as well as approximately 75 criteria along the entire passenger process chain at Germany’s largest air-traffic hub. This ranges from the arrival, signage and friendliness of the check-in staff to waiting times at security and passport controls, the ambience and cleanliness of the terminals, gastronomic, shopping and entertainment offers, as well as the comfort and equipment of rest zones and departure gates.The survey takes place at the departure gates as GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 101 part of the ongoing “Fraport MONITOR” passenger survey, where all departing passengers are personally interviewed prior to boarding. Analysis: The proportion of passengers (on a scale where one is best and six is worst) who selected one of the best assessment options (“top box”) is analyzed in terms of global satisfaction and individual aspects along the passenger process chain. For example: Overall satisfaction calculated on the basis of this method amounted to 86% in 2018, i.e. 86 out of 100 surveyed passengers gave a score of 1 or 2 to the question “How satisfied were you overall with Frankfurt Airport today?”. 2. Direct feedback system In addition to the interviews conducted as part of the Fraport passenger survey, a direct feedback system in the sanitary facilities, security and information counters was implemented at Frankfurt Airport in 2016 in order to measure the quality of service at these locations. Passengers evaluate the service they experience directly at or after the processing point by pressing a green, yellow or red smiley button (scale of 3). The individual evaluations are transmitted within seconds in “real time” to the server for assessment. On the one hand this permits the systematic measurement and evaluation of service quality in the various processing areas (ex post), as well as the operational use of the data to manage the processes. In 2018 a total of nearly seven million passengers gave feedback using this system. We are also in continuous dialog with our business customers and partners. The regular meetings held by our customer advisory councils, working groups with the airlines as well as the meetings of the service quality committee (SQC) are part of established dialogs. There are also regular exchanges with authorities such as the federal police and the main customs office in Frankfurt.

GRI 418 Customer Privacy – Management Approach Protecting personal data is a priority for any company. As a responsible partner, Fraport always requires the highest standard in this area, regardless of whether it is the data of passengers, customers, employees, or contractors. Data protection laws have always been a high priority in Germany, and data protection has been clearly regulated since 1980 by the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). While the BDSG only applies to Germany, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May 2018, has harmonized data protection in all EU Member States. However, there may be deviations from this law when transferred to national legislation. Within the Fraport Group, the GDPR affects the Group companies within the EU. The Executive Board works towards ensuring the Group companies in other parts of Europe comply with the regulation as in Germany. The individual Group companies are independently responsible for the implementation. And the EU Group companies have fulfilled this responsibility. This compliance is monitored by Fraport AG. For the Group companies outside the EU, the laws on data protection are implemented in accordance with the national regulations. The objective is to ensure the handling of personal data in compliance with the data protection laws and to safeguard the rights of the data subjects. The Data Protection Officer at Fraport AG monitors compliance with these regulations within the company. He reports directly to the Executive Board and is independent in exercising his tasks in the area of data protection. Violations of the GDPR or other related complaints can be sent directly to him, anonymously if necessary. In 2018, Fraport AG did not record any violations of data protection that were reportable according to the GDPR. Fraport AG has a registration process for data protection and data security incidents in place. Complaints and access requests by data subjects are processed promptly and completely. To consolidate the processes and rules at Fraport AG, it implements existing processes in a data protection management system and is planning the implementation of a data protection policy. Existing training concepts have been revised and implemented with e-learning methods. For employees who handle sensitive data to a particular extent, classroom training sessions were also held, and the content of these sessions is available as video training. Within the framework of the Association of German Commercial Airports (ADV), which includes many more airports in addition to Munich Airport, Fraport AG is part of a task force on the subject of GDPR. Participating in this task force allows Fraport to continuously evaluate its own measures against a benchmark. To ensure compliance with the new regulation, Fraport AG has implemented a project to implement the requirements of the GDPR since 2017. The existing framework conditions have been checked and new processes established where necessary. They are GRI Report 2018 GRI Content Index / Specific Standard Disclosures – SOCIAL 103 also part of the quality management system according to ISO 9001. The processing directory in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR has been created and is constantly being updated. In addition, a guideline for deleting personal data was developed. The steering committee of the project receives regular reports on the progress. The Executive Board is informed regularly by a member of the steering committee. In the course of examining the conditions, the Fraport website was assessed regarding, among other things, personal data to ensure compliance with GDPR. The data protection statements for all so-called data subject categories such as employees, visitors, applicants, passengers, or customers are available at privacy-statement.fraport.com. Personal data of passengers are required by Fraport AG primarily for the use of parking garages and for baggage handling. The processing of travel data is the responsibility of the airlines. The majority of the personal data processed by Fraport is due to the issue of airport ID cards and is thus compulsory for security reasons. Fraport AG has established a working group at the Frankfurt site, which is responsible for all issues relating to the use of video technology and consists of employees responsible for data protection, product management video, and requirements management of the relevant sections, and corporate safety, along with the involvement of the Works Council. It is developing a concept that lays out clear rules for users of all video data regarding the respective purpose and data protection requirements. The concept contains the roles and authorizations for the use of video technology throughout the entire airport grounds. Regulations on the use of Fraport video technology by authorities is also included. In addition, a standardized approval process was established that is mainly based on the naming of video officers (VO) by the areas using the technology. The VO of the strategic business unit Airside and Terminal Management, Corporate Safety and Security has been appointed by the Executive Board to head the working group of all video officers. He is also a point of contact for the authorities. These measures ensure that the requirements for video surveillance are compatible with the privacy rights of passengers, visitors, and employees. To ensure safety at airports, personal access rights must be managed and controlled. In Frankfurt, this is carried out by way of an identification management system as well as new access control systems for gates and all other access points to operational and security areas. Fraport AG has implemented both technical and organizational measures to protect data against misuse. The requirements of the GDPR are also fully complied with in this respect. Access to this system is allowed to only a limited group of people for a specifically defined task, so that misuse can also be identified and tracked as much as possible. GRI 418-1 Complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy Fraport did not identify any substantiated complaints in 2018. GRI 419 Socio-economic Compliance GRI 419-1 Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic area No breaches are known at Fraport AG.
