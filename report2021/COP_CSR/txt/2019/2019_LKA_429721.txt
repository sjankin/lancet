As plantations switched to other permitted weedicides, the maximum chemical residue levels became incompatible with Japanese import standards. Again, tea revenues suffered, while costs increased due to the necessity of manual weeding. 34 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2018/19 Managing Director’s Message HIGHLIGHTS FOR 2018/19 Erratic weather patterns that While faced with increasing labour outmigration, KVPL has continued to prevailed during some parts of the invest in people to motivate and retain employees.

The objective is to reduce the use of chemical fertiliser and to increase the carbon percentage in the soil. As at 31 March 2019 we purchased 757 tonnes of compost. Within its short operational period, the initiative has proven to be extremely successful in a sustainability context, providing a high level of non-toxic soil nutrition. Based on the effectiveness of the composting project it was recognised at the Chairman’s Awards with a Merit award. Drone Spraying In a pioneering initiative, KVPL has successfully piloted a drone spraying programme in up country estates, which reduces wastage and increases efﬁciency of spraying. The aerial robotic vehicles provide consistent, dependable spraying services at an effective cost. Quality control and reporting of efﬁciency metrics through GPS tracking, including path ﬂown, plant coverage, and spray utilisation show farmers and senior managers that their plantations are fully covered. The pilot projects clearly demonstrated signiﬁcant efﬁciency gain compared to manual backpack-spraying. ENERGY MANAGEMENT Reduction of energy consumption GRI 302-04, SDG 07, 08, 12, 13, UNGC 08, 09 The tea sector is an energy intensive industry. However, KVPL has initiated a number of mechanisms to reduce energy consumption. This includes harnessing renewable energy from hydropower, solar power and biomass.

Therefore, KVPL Identiﬁcation has continually strengthened its Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process in line with international best practices and has in place a comprehensive enterprise risk management system that extends from the Board of Directors, to each estate of the Company, and to all subsidiaries of the KVPL Group. The overall risk management system is regularly reviewed through internal and external oversight mechanisms described below. Monitoring Risk and Evaluation Management ~ A separate review team has been established to carry out system Review reviews in order to ensure the effectiveness and compliance of existing systems and controls.

Risk Monitoring and Review This ﬁnal step of the risk management process can be divided into two parts: ~ Monitoring: In this step the Company is expected to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented strategies, such as whether the strategies have brought the expected results by reducing the respective risks within the year. This monitoring process is carried out at different levels of the organisation by different parties. ~ Review: The risk proﬁle is reviewed quarterly and checked to ensure there is no substantial diversion. RISK PORTFOLIO OF THE KVPL GROUP KVPL Group has a wide range of risk portfolio as shown by the below graph and it has further increased since KVPL entered the solar power sector in the year under review.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. The fair value of matured managed trees were ascertained in accordance with SLFRS 30. The valuation was carried by Prathap Chartered Valuation & Consultancy (Pvt) Ltd., using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical veriﬁcation was carried out covering all the estates. 14.2.1 Change in Fair Value of Biological Assets Group / Company As at 31 March 2018/19 2017/18 Rs. ’000 Rs. ’000 Change in fair value of consumable biological assets (Note 14.2) 24,847 17,315 Change in fair value of produce on bearer biological assets (Note 17.1) 7,132 (5,983) 31,979 11,332 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2018/19 215 FINANCIAL REPORTS 14.2.2 Information About Fair Value Measurements Using Signiﬁcant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Range of unobservable inputs Relationship of Valuation Unobservable (Probability weighted average.)

Contiguous area of trees with trees a similar specie silviculture and other characteristics. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long-term exploitation of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable.

This require an entity to determine how much beneﬁt is attributable to the current and prior periods and to make estimates about demographic variables and ﬁnancial variables that will inﬂuence the cost of the beneﬁt. The following key assumptions were made in arriving at the above ﬁgure. According to the actuarial valuation report issued by the actuarial valuer as at 31 March 2019 the actuarial present value of promised retirement beneﬁts amounted to Rs. 1,077,667,193/(2017/18 Rs. 886,008,628/-). If the company had provided for gratuity on the basis of 14 days wage & half months salary for each completed year of service, the liability would have been Rs. 1,185,397,217/(2017/18 Rs. 930,428,985/-). Hence, there is a contingent liability of Rs.107,730,024/(2017/18 Rs. 44,420,357/-), which would crystallise only if the company ceases to be a going concern.

The main purpose of these ﬁnancial liabilities is to ﬁnance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. Accordingly the Group has exposure to mainly Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Market Risks from its use of ﬁnancial instruments. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. 37.1 Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies. The Group ﬁnancial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the ﬁnancial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor ﬁnancial risks and adherence to limits. Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The KVPL Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the ﬁnancial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 37.2 Credit Risk Credit Risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers and from its ﬁnancing activities including deposits with banks and ﬁnancial institution's foreign exchange transactions and other ﬁnancial instruments. 37.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂuenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings, when available and in some cases, bank references, purchases limit etc. which also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the management is considered when revisions are made to terms and conditions. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 1,335 m (2017/18 – Rs.831 m). KVPL has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea and Rubber auction systems. MTPL has the largest exposure to credit risk as a major portion of the trade receivables are from foreign currencies. All open account debtors are covered with export credit Insurance. Settlement of other debtors are carried through banks. Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2018/19 243 FINANCIAL REPORTS 37.2.2 Investments Credit risk from invested balances with the ﬁnancial institutions are managed by the Hayleys Group Treasury Department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore, mitigate ﬁnancial loss through potential counterparty’s failure The Group held short term investments of Rs. 35 m as at 31 March 2019 (2017/18 – Rs. 35 m) which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets. On 01 November 2018, Martin Bauer Group of Germany joined Hayleys Global Beverage (Pvt) Ltd. as a strategic partner by investing in a 51% stake of the Company. Resulting from this investment, Kelani Valley Plantations PLC ‘s share holding percentage in Hayleys Global Beverages (now known as Martin Bauer Hayleys (Pvt) Ltd.) stands at 10.1% and therefore, it has ceased to be accounted as an equity accounted investment. 37.2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Group held cash at bank and in hand of Rs. 63 m as at 31 March 2019 (2017/18 – Rs. 87 m) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets. ~ Sampath Bank PLC – A+ (lka) ~ Hatton National Bank PLC –AA – (lka) ~ Bank of Ceylon – AA+ (lka) ~ Citi Bank N.A. – AAA (lka) ~ Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd – AAA(lka) ~ DFCC Bank PLC – AA(lka) ~ National Development Bank PLC – A+(lka) ~ Seylan Bank Ltd A+ (lka) 37.3. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difﬁculty in meeting the obligations associated with its ﬁnancial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another ﬁnancial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group does not concentrate on a single ﬁnancial institution, thereby minimising the exposure to liquidity risk through diversiﬁcation of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term investment with long-term ﬁnancial sources and short term investment with short-term ﬁnancing. Where necessary, the Group consults the Treasury Department and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinising the funding decisions. 244 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2018/19 Notes to the Financial Statements FINANCIAL REPORTS 37 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES Contd.
