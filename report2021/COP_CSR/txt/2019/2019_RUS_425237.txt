Along with implementation of the anti-crisis measures, the VEB team created favorable conditions for its future development. In 2017, the Bank embarked on a newly developed VEB 2.0 strategy aimed at the Bank transformation and enhancement of its efficiency. Within the framework of this strategy, VEB focused on the development of hi-tech processing industry, infrastructure, innovative technologies and support for exporters. Among VEB’s other priorities stands promotion of “green” renewable energy, which has great potential from the point of view of sustainable development. In 2017, VEB’s investment in Russia’s economy amounted to over 190 billion rubles, which is twice as much as was invested in the previous year. According to the results of 2017, the overall Bank’s loan portfolio comprised ca. 14% of the total bank loans issued in Russia for a term of more than 3 years. The Total Economic Impact of the VEB investment projects implementation has reached 0.34% of the GDP. Noteworthily, while carrying out its investment activities, VEB pays special attention to the formation of a high-quality project portfolio. Thus in 2017, the Bank started the development of a highly professional sectoral expertise and launched a new model of its interactions with the regions. It stipulates that its regional managers take part in the selection of VEB projects since they are well versed in the regional business’ specificities and have long passed a multi-stage selection system. Kickoff by the VEB team of the Project Financing Factory deserves special recognition.
