Such risks are, on the date hereof, the risks that Rexel believes may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or its results of operations, should they occur.

Note that there may, however, be other risks that have not yet been identified as of the date of this Registration document, or whose occurrence as of the date hereof is not considered likely to have a material adverse effect. 2.1 Risk factors In a constantly changing environment, Rexel is committed to protecting the interests of its shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers, and all other stakeholders, while achieving its objectives. In this context, Rexel is implementing an active risk management policy to be able to efficiently respond to internal and external threats likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, its results of operations or its reputation. The risk management approach initiated by Rexel, notably through the Risk Committee, works towards the identification of significant risks as well as the definition and the implementation of risk management measures for each of them. The risk management process implemented within the Rexel Group is described in section 2.3 “Internal control and risk management procedures” of this Registration document. The risks presented in this chapter are the risks resulting from the risk mapping carried out and updated on an annual basis in the context of internal control and risk management procedures put in place by the Rexel Group. These risks are those that may have a material adverse effect on the Rexel Group, its activities, its financial condition, its results of operations or its perspectives. In addition, are described in the present chapter the major procedures implemented to limit those risks’ likelihood and/or impact in the paragraph “Management of risk” of each risk. In parallel, for the purposes of the extra-financial performance declaration, Rexel carried out a more detailed analysis than that carried out by the Risk Committee of the main risks related to the environmental, social and societal consequences of its activities. The specific procedures that are conducted to identify and analyze these risks are described in paragraph 4.1.3 “Main non-financial risks” of this Registration document.

(2) The position adopted by the Board of Directors is more restrictive than the guidelines of the Afep-Medef Code that provides for the payment of indemnities in case of forced departure “independent of the form of such departure”. (3) The Board of Directors, having the option to assess the interest for the Group to activate the non-compete clause or to waive its right in such respect depending on the effective risk of competition upon the departure of the executive (in particular in the situation where the executive would continue to carry out missions or functions for competitors, even after a retirement leave), believes that the activation of such clause should not be ruled out as a principle (in particular, taking into account the various legislations applicable in respect of retirement rights for international executives).

(2) The relative performance criterion of the Rexel share compared to the SBF 120 GR index has replaced the previously determined TSR criteron based on a panel of selected companies. This change is due to the difficulty to establish and update a representative panel of companies comparable to Rexel (in particular from a geographical, strategic challenges, digital transformation in product and services sales point of view, etc.). The SBF 120 GR index, which Rexel is a part of, better integrates some of these criteria. The weighting of this criterion, the triggering threshold, the target and maximum vesting have been determined based on a comparable structure to that of the TSR criterion previously used, in line with market practice.

IFRIC 22 “Foreign Currency Transaction and On a full year basis, the impacts of IFRS 15 on the Advance Consideration”, but they do not have a income statement for the year ended December 31, material effect on the Group’s financial statements. 2017 were as follows: FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 (in millions of euros) AS REPORTED ADJUSTMENTS IFRS 15 RESTATED Sales 13,310.1 (7.1) (1) 13,303.0 Cost of goods sold (10,045.9) 25.0(2) (10,020.9) Gross profit 3,264.2 17.9 3,282.1 Distribution and administrative expenses (2,688.9) (18.1)(3) (2,707.0) Operating income 322.3 (0.2) 322.1 Net income before income tax 176.4 0.1 176.5 Income tax (71.5) (0.4) (71.9) Net income 104.9 (0.3) 104.7 (1) Under IFRS 15, sales were adjusted downwards by €7.1 million of which €(24.2) million associated with direct sales transactions for which the Group is deemed to act as an agent (see (2)) and upwards by €15.7 million in relation with delivery services charged to customers that were previously presented as a reduction of distribution and administrative expenses (see (3)). (2) Reflects mainly the adjustment of direct sales transactions. Direct sales are arrangements with customers whereby the Group engages a third-party supplier to ship the products to the customer, based on Rexel’s purchase order with the customer, without any physical transfer to and from the Group’s warehouse. Direct sales represent approximatively 20% of Rexel’s total sales. Under IAS 18 guidance based on risks and rewards analysis, the Group carries, in particular, the credit risk on receivables attached to such sales and therefore was deemed to act as a principal. Accordingly, Rexel recognized the gross amount of direct sales transactions in revenue. IFRS 15 moved away from a risks and rewards approach to a transfer of control approach. For the vast majority of its direct sales transactions, the Group is ultimately responsible for fulfillment of the customer’s order and has discretion in establishing pricing. It obtains controls of the goods at the point in time they are shipped by the third-party supplier but does not transfer control of the products to the customer until they are delivered to the customer’s site. Rexel has inventory risk relating to the specified goods as it bears the risk of loss during the transit and the risk of return from the customer subsequent to the delivery. In very limited instances where these conditions are not fulfilled, the Group is deemed to act as an agent and recognizes a commission income for the excess of the amount invoiced to the customer and the amount charged by the supplier. (3) Reflects mainly the adjustment associated with delivery services invoiced to customers that were previously matched against transportation costs in the distribution and administrative expenses under IAS 18. These services are analyzed as a performance obligation of Rexel and therefore are presented as revenues when adopting IFRS 15.
