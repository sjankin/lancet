Our company’s sustainable development strategy is guided by a continuous performance improvement plan. The plan defines yearly priorities and objectives whose progress is regularly monitored and evaluated. This plan plays a key role in determining and validating Polyeco’s commitments with regard to social responsibility, environmental management, governance, human rights, labour and ethics. Reporting on social and environmental performance is based in an integrated internal system developed and updated by Polyeco which facilitates the process of collecting, compiling, reporting its non-financial performance throughout the Company plants, in accordance to Polyeco’s sustainability strategy and commitments and more specifically to UNGC COP criteria and WBCSDWorld Business Council for Sustainable Development/CSI-Corporate Social Investment Guidelines. Our company's strategy is also based on the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy adopted from the European Commission, as an industrial economy that is not producing waste and pollution, which includes revised legislative proposals on waste to stimulate Europe's transition towards zero waste generation, and measures covering the whole cycle from production and consumption to waste management and the market for secondary fuels and secondary raw materials. So, the high priority’s objective of our policy is ‘’Making More from Waste: Recovery/Recycling/Reuse’’. At our main hazardous waste treatment facility we treat hazardous waste preventing their release into the environment and provide environmentally friendly methods of managing hazardous materials according to the Circular Economy Principles. Moreover, one of the biggest business themes in a global economy geared towards the Global Goals is the minimization of waste, through resource saving and energy recovery.

Since its foundation in 2001 Polyeco implements programs, initiatives and practices that reflect its values and define its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), incorporating social and environmental friendly targets in its everyday business activities. Over the years, Polyeco has been supporting both local and broader community, focusing on the following key points: SUSTAINABLE PLANET & ENVIRONMENT, CULTURE, EDUCATION, RESEARCH & INNOVATION, SPOR TS & HEALTH, VULNERABLE SOCIAL GROUPS.

Recognizing the importance and necessity for volunteering and social solidarity, it is not uncommon for company employees to urgently develop initiatives and contribute to raising money and goods where needed, as they did for the fire-ravaged residents of deadly fire that hit the area of Mati in eastern Attica in 2018, the flood-ravaged residents of Mandra Municipality and refugees. In our 2014 Report we had the pleasure to announce the launching of Polyeco’s ambitious Contemporary Art Initiative, PCAI, which primarily aims at raising environmental awareness through a unique art program inspired by the crucial issue of waste management, which is not only technical, but also environmental and social. Since then, Mr. Athanasios Polychronopoulos, Executive Chairman of Polyeco Group, Director of PCAI and driving force behind the company’s art initiative, decided to implement a sprinting strategy towards the implementation of PCAI’s objectives. His genuine belief that art is the best tool to stimulate dialogue about waste management was complimented by his wish to share this assumption with the company’s employees, clients and the general public. The objective has been to create a framework that will allow Polyeco to implement its unique environmental awareness raising program. W ithin three years PCAI has accomplished to finalize its structure and to begin the implementation of its vision. 30 4.3 Polyeco Contemporary Art Initiative (PCAI) A statement about Polyeco’s ethos and identity reflecting the company’s energy and sense of commitment. 31 STRUCTURE PCAI has become part of an international trend in the corporate collecting sphere that goes beyond purchasing art works. It implements its objectives though three areas of activity: its Collection, its Projects and its Support THE PCAI COLLECTION The PCAI Collection is based on special commissions mainly of moving image art. PCAI provides mid-career and emerging artists with the means and resources to create an artwork inspired by urgent environmental issues in their broader relation to current sociocultural, economic, philosophical concerns. The Collection invites artists to reflect on the concept of waste and related processes in a free and innovative way; to create art that challenges the limits of previous views and representations; to imagine new forms and use radical tactics while addressing our changing world. The PCAI Collection includes commissioned works by artists such as Mika Rottenberg (Kurt Schwitters Prize 2018), Sophia Al-Maria (inaugural winner of the Dunya Contemporary Art Prize), Wu Tsang (Sharjah Biennial), Angelo Plessas (documenta 14) and George Drivas (57th Venice Biennale) amongst others. In 2017 PCAI's first commissioned only exhibition, Paratoxic Paradoxes (curator Nadja Argyropoulou), took place in the Benaki Museum in Athens. In 2018, in the context of the Resilient Futures exhibition (curator Syrago Tsiara), PCAI collaborated with the State Museum of Contemporary Art of Thessaloniki and the Contemporary Art Center of Thessaloniki. A series of events related to the PCAI Collection took place in 2018: 1) PCAI Collection permanently exhibited in the PCAI and Polyeco Group Offices in Piraeus 32 Works from the PCAI Collection are exhibited in the headquarters of Polyeco Group and PCAI in Piraeus, a concept that focuses on the integration of contemporary art into the daily work environment and the employees’ interaction with video art inspired by the company’s environmental activity. The new offices were designed by architect Margarita Hatzakou with respect to the environment and the company’s philosophy and were recently captured through Yiorgis Yerolymbos' lens. 2) PCAI becomes a proud member of IACCCA ©IACCCA In September 2018 PCAI became a member of the International Association of Corporate Collections of Contemporary Art IACCCA, the only Greek participant in this unique network of more than 46 members who represent the best of the corporate collections of the contemporary art community. 3) PCAI awarded in the Corporate Art Awards 2018 ©Corporate Art Awards 2018 33 A few years after its foundation, and after having organised and supported a series of successful exhibitions and events, PCAI was awarded for its original cultural program at the Corporate Art Awards 2018 that took place in the European Parliament in Brussels on November 28-29, 2018. PCAI and its corporate collection have been awarded amongst other international companies such as Deutsche Bank, American Express, FAO, FIAT, HBC, BMW, Pictet Bank, Wurth, etc. The two-day event was held in the framework of the European Year of Cultural Heritage celebrations and aims at acknowledging and promoting institutions, companies and private investors who are actively contributing to the development of the Arts and Society. During the reception of the award, Mr. Athanasios Polychronopoulos, Executive Chairman of Polyeco Group described the original way in which artists are invited to get inspired by the company's environmental activities around the world. Antonio Tajani, President of the European Parliament, in an announcement during the ceremony praised the Corporate Art Awards institution and team for their important job, while Corporate Art Awards founder, Luca Desiata, noted in regards to PCAI: I was particularly impressed by the originality and the social impact of your collection. It is a unique and innovative example for supporting contemporary artists. 4) Magical State from the PCAI Collection travels to the Pulitzer Arts Foundation How do images of the future shape the city in the present? What competing futures are emerging in the urban fabric? Dwell in Other Futures was a two-day festival of art and ideas that explores the collisions of race, urbanism, and futurism, providing a platform for alternate visions of the St. Louis to come. Launching Friday, April 27 at the Kranzberg Art Foundation’s .ZACK arts facility, Dwell in Other Futures continued at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation on Saturday, April 28. As part of the Dwell in Other Futures program the Magical State, Sophia All Maria's work for PCAI, was screened on Saturday April 28, 2018. 34 The PCAI Projects The PCAI Projects are all the activities and events (special commissions, talks, conferences, exhibitions, publications, educational programs and workshops) organized by PCAI within the organization’s foundational aim. Such activities and events develop beyond the Collection, yet are often in dialogue with issues raised by its material. Ιn 2017 PCAI launched PCAI JUNIOR, an innovative educational program focusing on environmental awareness through film and art that is travelling to schools and institutions all over the world. A series of events related to the PCAI Projects took place in 2018: 1) Resilient Futures exhibition in PCAI, Piraeus and CACT, Thessaloniki After the launch of the Resilient Futures project through a successful prelude event on June 5, 2018, World Environment Day at the Polyeco Group and PCAI headquarters in Piraeus the group exhibition officially opened on June 27 at the Contemporary Art Center of Thessaloniki in partnership with the Contemporary Art Museum of Thessaloniki (now MOMus). The Resilient Futures exhibition, curated by Syrago Tsiara, focused on the concept of resiliency and sustainability and symbolically bridges the port of Piraeus with that of Thessaloniki. It included works from the PCAI Collection along with works from other international video artists. Participating artists were Loukia Alavanou, George Drivas, Mary Zygouri, Hertog and Nadler, Vassilis Karouk, Eva Kotatkova, Oliver Ressler – Zanny Begg, Mika Rottenberg, Stefanos Tsivopoulos, Saskia Olde Wolbers. The exhibition received raging reviews, was accompanied by a bilingual catalogue (Greek-English) published by CACT Editions and accepted thousands of visitors. 35 2) PCAI’s Innovative Educational Platform in Oman, powered by Polyeco Gulf, Orpic and the North Al Batinah Directorate General of Education ©ORPIC As part of their values in serving Oman and customers with pride, Orpic in collaboration with Polyeco Gulf and the North Al Batinah Directorate General of Education presented the PCAI Junior educational platform in Oman for the first time. After its first successful implementation in Greece in 2017, the environmental program took place in two different schools this July focusing on the concepts of recycling and the conservation of the public utilities. On this occasion the students of the program conducted site visits, participated in workshops and developed solutions for environmental issues that, at the end of the program, were going to be captured on short animated films. 3) PCAI JUNIOR at the SNFCC 36 Revolving around the open-air, sunny Mediterranean Garden, PCAI’s environmental education program in the SNFCC was structured into three sections (exploration, solution and storytelling), featuring activities that encouraged children to explore, solve problems and tell stories, discovering the flora of the Park in each season, familiarizing themselves with the arts of animation, illustration and scriptwriting, and creating a short film. PCAI received a grant from SNF for the implementation of the program. 4) PCAI awarded at the ISWA EDUCATION AWARDS In 2018 PCAI was a proud winner of the 2nd prize of the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) Young Professionals Group (YPG #WhatHappensToMyWaste. All winners were officially announced at the ISWA World Congress in Kuala Lumpur in the YPG Special Session #WhatHappensToMyWaste – Waste education around the world on Monday, October 22.

PCAI Junior in Mauritius took place in Terre Rouge State Secondary School after a competition amongst schools organized by the Ministry of Education and Human Resources, Tertiary Education and Scientific Research. The program focused on experiential learning and all participating students, aged from 12 to 14, addressed a specific environmental issue, seeking for solutions in a creative manner. 7) PCAI’s educational films travel to international kids and animation festivals ©Gazte film festival 38 Las Ptinas film created on the occasion of the first PCAI Junior program in Athens continues its trip around the world. After being presented in Animasyros 2018 and Camera Zizanio 2018 the original animated film, created in collaboration with the pupils of Geitonas School, was presented in Spain and Mexico on the occasion of the Gazte film festival 2018. THE PCAI SUPPORT PCAI Support refers to PCAI’s engagement in other initiatives and individuals that share the same vision and concerns. 1) PCAI Supported the Laboratory of Dilemmas at EMST, Athens ©Laboratory of Dilemmas PCAI, a proud supporter of the Laboratory of Dilemmas, George Drivas’ work for the Pavilion of Greece at the 57th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, supported Drivas second show at EMST National Museum of Contemporary Art in Athens from March 29 to July 1, 2018. The Laboratory of Dilemmas constitutes a narrative video installation based on Aeschylus’ Iketides (Suppliant Women), a play that poses a dilemma between saving the Foreigner and maintaining the Native's safety. Addressing current global sociopolitical issues, the work deals with issues like the anguish and puzzlement of individuals and social groups when addressing similar problematics. The successful exhibition focuses on the play’s dilemma through found footage of an unfinished scientific documentary. The depicted experiment was never completed for unknown reasons and it is presented in the form of a Labyrinth of multiple video and sound sources that develop into a unique audiovisual experience. A number of acclaimed international actors and actresses, like Charlotte Rampling, Yorgos Kotanidis and Kora Karvouni, are participating in the films produced. 39 PAR TICIPATION OF EMPLOYEES Polyeco’s employees play a crucial part in the implementation and the dissemination of the initiative, actively helping the artists in both research and the creation of their projects, using all the means in their disposal. They also act as ambassadors of PCAI in their areas of activity. Polyeco Project Managers are in a continuous dialogue with PCAI’s Director exchanging information and narratives about past, current and future projects. The benefits from employee involvement have been recorded to be so substantial that through this growing new collaboration PCAI wishes to communicate to Polyeco employees that their participation in the Initiative through a number of different actions will eventually expose them to numerous different and creative ways of thinking. 40 AFFILIATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS Since its establishment PCAI has supported, collaborated or been connected with various international festivals and organisations including: Aisxylia Festival Eleusis Art Athina International Art Fair Athens Concert Hall Athens International Airport Athens International Film Festival Benaki Museum Athens Berlinale International Film Festival Climate Change Conference Athens Contemporary Art Center of Thessaloniki (CACT) Corporate Art Awards Design Overview In T irana (DOIT) European Independent Film Festival Paris Festival du Nouveau Cinema of Montreal Glasgow Short Film Festival Greek Company of Environment and Culture Greek Ministry of Education State Museum of Contemporary Art of Thessaloniki House of Cyprus (Cultural Centre of the Cyprian Embassy) Institut Français de Grèce International Short Film Festival Oberhausen International association of Corporate Collections of Contemporary Art (IACCCA) International Solid Waste Association (ISWA) Kino der Kunst International Festival Munich Kuala Lumpur Eco Film Festival Kunsthalle zu Kiel Mu.ZEE Ostend National Museum of Contemporary Art (EMST) Panorama of Ecological Films Posidonia Events Pulitzer Arts Foundation Rotterdam Film Festival Sea Days Piraeus (European Maritime Day) Thessaloniki International Film Festival (TIFF) Thessaloniki Port Authority SA T ilt Platform Triple COPs Geneva Venice Biennale 41 TARGET AUDIENCE Having as an ultimate goal the creation of environmental consciousness and culture, PCAI does not address a specific audience. On the contrary, it wishes to connect audiences through art. Adopting the principle that environmental protection is a common responsibility and can only be achieved with collective effort, our initiative addresses each and every one, trying to communicate through art the challenges that threat nature and the consequences that are caused by the over exploitation of natural resources and human intervention, when there is no respect for the environment. However, special emphasis is given to the creation of environmental awareness among young people, which on the one hand will suffer more from the consequences of environmental degradation and on the other hand will be called to disseminate their culture to future generations. WORK IN PROGRESS PCAI is destined to mirror Polyeco’s growth. Its activities are on par with the success of the company. For the next year we wish to: 1. Develop an increasing activity around our growing Art Collection. In 2018 we are plan ning to commission new works related to environmental awareness 2. Expand our educational program to other schools in Greece and abroad and develop affiliations with other organisations and institutions 3. Expand our animated film library and promote our feducational films to film and kids festivals. 4. Present our Collection abroad and collaborate with Museums, Institutions, Festivals and Organisations that share our vision and goals 5. Further our support to artists and art institutions and expand our affiliation program and synergies. 6. Design and Implement an artist-in-residence program that would invite contemporary artists to stay in Athens and create new works inspired by PCAI’s vision and goals. 7. Attract support from other initiatives and institutions. In 2018 PCAI received its first grant on the occasion of it educational program. Our aim is to be able to generate more financial support in order to expand our program and activities 8. Involve more of our employers; enhance our engagement program promoting the role of art in the workplace stimulating productivity, innovation and open-mindedness 9. Commission and engage local artists in countries where Polyeco operates and further address our stakeholders and the local communities we offer our services to, especially those in parts of the world who are experiencing a form of cultural isolation. PCAI wishes to engage them in a creative dialogue and in some cases promote their artistic voices 10. Enhance our social impact and interaction with local communities and pose issues that concern environmental policy in local, regional and national level 11. Be recognized for our effort to make a lasting contribution to all the countries that trust its services 42 Responsibility towards our Employees 43 5.1 Working at Polyeco At Polyeco, we value the relationship we have with our employees. The success of our business depends on every employee in our global enterprise. We are committed to fostering open and inclusive workplaces that respect human and workplace rights, where all employees are valued and inspired to be the best they can be. To meet this demand, we employ dynamic individuals, with credible experience and passion. Over the years, we have been fortunate to attract some of the most talented professionals in our industry. Our dedicated and highly educated personnel is our competitive advantage, the most valuable asset for achieving management initiatives and corporate growth. How we conduct business is fundamental to our success and achieving our results. We believe ethics and compliance is our shared responsibility. A commitment to integrity and ethical behavior is a critical factor in our decisions regarding professional advancement and compensation. The foundation of our approach lies in two key documents: our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Workplace Policy Handbook. Both are in full compliance with the UN Global Compact principles and International Labour Organization (ILO) declarations. 44 5.2 Human Rights Respecting human rights is a fundamental part of Polyeco’s responsibility as a company and is vital to operate our sustainable business. We are committed to respecting fundamental human rights in our operations, our value chain, and in the communities where we operate. We seek to avoid complicity in human rights abuses and to use our influence to promote the fulfillment of human rights. Our commitment to operating with respect for human rights is reflected in all aspects of Polyeco’s business operations and is integrated in our company policies and relevant procedures. We aim to identify, assess, and manage the human rights impacts of our business activities based on the operational context, our leverage and business relationships. In this context, Polyeco has developed and implements a human rights policy, according to which the company commits to align its operations and strategies with the universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights. Polyeco’s Human Rights Policy is integrated within the company’s standards of its Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. POLYECO HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY We respect the human rights of our employees, our contractors and community as established by the UN A/RES/3/217 Universal Declaration on Human Rights and in the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, including non-discrimination, prohibition of child and enforced labour, and freedom of association and the right to engage in collective bargaining. There is no discrimination based on race, national or social origin, caste, birth, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, union membership, political opinions and age.

Both are influenced by the United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organization (ILO) declarations. Together, they describe our high standards and expectations, addressing such subjects as child labour, forced labour, freedom of association, discrimination, health and safety, hours of work and Human Rights. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and our Workplace Policy Handbook, apply to all entities in which Polyeco owns a majority of interests. Implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business, labour and human rights in our corporate context we use three primary components: A. Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, a key document used as a framework for respecting human rights in our business context influenced by UN A/RES/3/217 Universal Declaration B. Our Workplace Policy Handbook, influenced by the Greek Labour legislation, the UN A/RES/3/217 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization (ILO) declarations C. A due diligence process to identify, prevent, mitigate and be accountable for labour and human rights abuses. Our company complies with the Greek Labour Legislation in all of its activities, as well as the local laws and legislations of all the countries in which we operate. Among other regulations, these forbid all forms of forced and compulsory labour, give to employees the freedom and the right to resign from their work voluntarily and reward extra hours of work with additional payment. 48 5.5 Equal opportunities Polyeco introduces measures to promote equality, being aware of the diversities of language, culture and family circumstances that may exist in the workforce. Managers and supervisory staff seek to develop an understanding of the different types of discrimination and how it can affect the workforce. Polyeco treats all employees fairly, ethically, respectfully and with dignity. Polyeco offers equal employment opportunities without any distinction based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, religion, citizenship, marital status, family situation, country of origin or other factors, in accordance with the laws and regulations of each country where it operates. The selection, recruitment and remuneration of our personnel are based on their qualifications, skills, work experience, and on personal interview without gender, age, family status or other discriminations. Wages offered by the company are equal or greater than the minimum rates applicable for each job position. It is our policy, in accordance with all applicable laws, to recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job titles without regard to race, sex, religion age, disability, nation origin, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. W ithin company operations and cooperation with other businesses, we ensure that employment contracts are provided to all employees stating the terms and conditions of service, the voluntary nature of employment, the freedom to leave (including the appropriate procedures) and any penalties that may be associated with a departure or termination of work. Polyeco respects the freedom of association and the right of all employers and workers to freely and voluntarily establish and join groups for the promotion and defense of their occupational interests. 49 Women in the workforce Polyeco looks to those human rights defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its two corresponding covenants, The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Additionally, we also look to children’s and women’s rights as outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Polyeco’s approach to its business operations is in compliance with the ILO International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, The Children's Rights and Business Principles, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the United Nations Global Compact, to which we are signatories. Distribu�on By Gender 2017 23% MEN WOMEN 77% Distribu�on By Gender 2018 21% MEN WOMEN 79% 50 Child Labour Child labour is an essential concern for Polyeco. In this context, we use adequate and verifiable mechanisms for age verification. We ensure the adherence of minimum age provisions of national labour laws and regulations, especially in countries with Low Human Development Index, where Polyeco executes many of its projects. We are against any form of child labour in all of our operation in Greece and abroad, and the same we require from our contractors and supply chain. Discrimination The workplace is a strategic entry point for freeing society from discrimination. Combating discrimination at the workplace can help reduce disadvantages, such as in education, resulting from inequity that people may have suffered at earlier stages in life. When the workplace brings together workers of different races, sexes and ages, for example, and treats them equally, it helps build a sense of common purpose. By doing so, it defuses stereotypes and prejudices that are at the heart of discrimination. 51 5.6 Benefits Our primary responsibility is the protection of all our employees, their corresponding salaries and fringe benefits in a time that most of our competitors are laying-off staff and decreasing salaries. We ensure that our employees are paid well, at the least legal minimum wage; sufficient to meet basic needs, have access to affordable benefits, and work in a safe environment. Wages and benefits are clearly communicated to workers; paid in convenient manner -cash or bank deposit; overtime paid at premium rate; all employees receive a wage receipt with an analysis of their payment that include, any overtime payment, tax and social security deductions. We do not make use of false apprenticeship schemes to avoid legal obligations to personnel. Employee wellbeing The wellbeing of our employees is a key component of our corporate values and sustainability. We have strengthened and expanded support initiatives for employees offering them benefits beyond the statutory minimum, to help them cope with balancing work and family commitments. In 2018, Polyeco signed a Private healthcare and life insurance program for all its employees. We also actively protect motherhood and parenthood in our company through flexible labour regime, without any loss of benefits, for up to 12 months, as well as to our employees caring for elderly family members or family members with serious sickness. We have also established a leave/short working hour system for employees caring for family members with special needs rated over 80%. Occupational Health and Safety Management We are measured by our ability to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of our people. Polyeco is committed to achieving excellence in providing a healthy and safe working environment and to supporting environmentally sound practices in the conduct of its activities. Recognizing the social and economic dimension of the occupational accidents Polyeco has developed and applied a comprehensive and effective Safety & Health Management System according to OHSAS 18001 standard and The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1 974 requirements. 52 Employee Εducation, Training & Development Our primary responsibility is the protection of all our employees, their corresponding salaries and fringe benefits in a time that most of our competitors are laying-off staff and decreasing salaries.

Wages and benefits are clearly communicated to workers; paid in convenient manner -cash or bank deposit; overtime paid at premium rate; all employees receive a wage receipt with an analysis of their payment that include, any overtime payment, tax and social security deductions. We do not make use of false apprenticeship schemes to avoid legal obligations to personnel. 53 Health and Safety 54 6.1 Health and Safety Policy Polyeco recognizes its responsibility towards the Environment, the Health, Safety and well-being of its personnel and people affected by its activities.

In addition, Polyeco expects its contractors and suppliers to follow these HSE principles while having in place an objective HSE Performance Evaluation System. √ HSE performance improvement incident investigation, audits and inspections Polyeco investigates incidents and implements mitigation measures to ensure that they will not be repeated. All individuals, whether contractors or staff, shall therefore report all incidents and near misses. Incident will be investigated to identify actions to be taken to prevent their recurrence. Regular audits will be conducted to verify implementation of this HSE policy. Polyeco has set in place an awarding system to promote high HSE performance. √ Emergency Response Polyeco maintains an emergency response and preparedness procedure to identify the potential risks and to respond to accidents and emergency situations. This procedure is also meant to prevent and/or mitigate associated environmental, safety and health impacts. Polyeco establishes appropriate systems and trained personnel for emergency response in place for all its activities. Should an accident occur, emergency preparedness routines and resources will be available to limit the consequences and restore safe operations. 56 6.2 Integrated Management System (IMS) An integrated IMS manual has been developed to ensure product and service quality continue to meet the highest standards demanded by Polyeco and expected by its customers; ensure products, processes and services are carried out in an environmentally responsible and protective manner; provide a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce and other interested parties; and ensure conformity with legal and other requirements applicable to Polyeco’s Operations. The manual is structured in three levels as demonstrated below: • Level 1 IMS Manual and Polyeco Policies • Level 2 IMS Procedures and Plans, Safety Procedures & Standard Operating Procedures • Level 3 Forms, Appendixes and Risk Assessments Polyeco implements and maintains a process for periodically evaluating compliance with legal requirements and other requirements of each country where operational activities are taking place. These requirements related to the environmental, health, safety and quality aspects of its processes, products and services and are applicable to all persons working for or on behalf of the organization. Results of evaluation are recorded and reported to management for review and direction of actions when required. Specific Management Procedures have been developed and cover the following: • Policy Handbook • Documents & Records control • Internal Audit • Management review • Management of change • Incident investigation • Complaints, Corrective actions & Non conformity products • Statistical Analysis • Objectives, targets • Training & Competency • Waste Management plan 57 The H&S provisions are integrated in the IMS manual, describe the H&S Management System of Polyeco and provide linkage to all management system documents. The integrated manual covers the following documentation and H&S procedures: • Objectives of the H&S system, field of coverage, general requirements • H&S Policy • Planning for Risk Assessment, Legal requirements • Requirements by clients • Organization chart, structure and responsibilities allocation • Appointment of Quality, H&S and Environmental Officer • Appointment of Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor • Appointment of Technical Safety Officer • Competence, Training & Awareness • Documents & Records Control, Subcontractor management • Special Health & Safety guidance on: maintenance activities, fire protection,manual movement of loads, machinery operation, chemical substances, safety signs, PPE • Control, monitoring, correc tive actions • First aid, medical inspection of personnel Figure 1: IMS Components Planning: Review & improvement: Task risks and environmental impacts HSEQ management review assessment Legal, business and customer requirements Objectives, targets and programs Implementation & operation: Checking: Structure and responsibilities Performance monitoring and measurement Training, awareness and competence Evaluation of compliance Communication, participation and consultation Complaints, Nonconformities & corrective and preventive actions Document & record control Control of records Operational control Internal audits Emergency planning and response 58 Furthermore, the applicable Integrated Management System (IMS) of Polyeco provides linkage to all management system documents, aims to assist Polyeco conform to the requirements of ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. OHSAS 18001 is the foundation for the health and safety elements of the Polyeco IMS, enabling the organization to control occupational health and safety risks and improve performance. IMS is a series of interrelated processes that focus on establishing and achieving the HSSEQ Policy and objectives of the company. Polyeco’s management system is modeled on the continual improvement cycle consisting of four system phases and supporting elements as below: Risk Assessment The Risk Assessment forms the basis of the Health and Safety Management System and provides a systematic approach in order to identify potential health and safety hazards and appropriate control measures to ensure a safe place of work. All information arising from the Risk Assessment of each task are placed on file and communicated to all members of staff related to the task. The following is fully considered to undertake and complete the risk assessment: • Identify and where possible quantify hazards. • Identify those people who might be affected whether employees or 3rd parties and how that could happen. • Evaluate the risks (likelihood and intensity), identify precautions and control measures and assess if current precautions are adequate. • Brief project staff and inform them of any revisions. • Investigate methods and/or strategies to reduce or eliminate risks. • Record all findings and brief staff accordingly. • Constantly review the assessment during tasks implementation and ensure assessments and assumptions are valid (supervision). Standard Operating Procedures Similar work activities produce a basic 'model' risk assessment reflecting the core hazards and risk associated with these activities. Such 'model' risk assessments form the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and are applied in every workplace, when they are appropriate to the specific type of work. The SOPs are adapted to the actual work situations of the current project. These SOPs form part of the Health and Safety Plan and are communicated to all personnel on site. 59 Training and induction sessions Apart from its personnel Polyeco conducts training sessions to representatives of client on several aspects depicted in the following table. The training sessions are both theoretical and practical. The scope of the training includes the following concepts which are included in the training program: • Understanding of the project’s safety and environmental requirements and their implementation on site by the staff • Understanding of the procedures to be followed in improper situations • Reporting principals and understanding rule • Understanding how to act in case of unexpected environmental accidents An indicative training matrix with the subjects covered is presented.

Additionally, this form is used for any HSEQ related observation including, Safe Actions, Near Misses, HSE Concerns, System Improvements, Recommendations, Document Changes etc. 65 6.3. Health and Safety Indicators Health and Safety indicators are developed and incorporated in the IMS in order to identify and grade our main waste management activities on the site and to follow-up and communicate our Health and Safety improvements in a group level. Polyeco group has established KPIs regarding incidents, accidents, near misses in our facilities and in all sites we operate worldwide. Accordingly, we record the possible safety precautions that need to be implemented in order to avoid risk for safety at work. Some of the most important safety indicators are presented in the table below. Health and Safety Indicators 2015 2016 2017 2018 Recordable incidents 9 8 1 6 Total recordable incident rate 7.85 6.05 0.75 4.15 Fatali�es 0 0 0 0 First aid cases 6 4 0 3 Road traﬃc accidents 1 0 0 0 Lost �me incidents 1 0 0 0 Lost �me rate 0.87 0 0 0 Safety mee�ngs 8 11 12 15 Health and safety inspec�ons 15 17 17 23 Safety meetings and H&S inspections have been increased through the last five years in Polyeco facility and in other Polyeco group facilities and working sites around the world. Polyeco is constantly collecting H&S data so as to assess and understand the problematic tasks/projects and to implement accordingly new correction measures which will lead to minimization of the risks and consequently the incidents at the working areas. 66 Lost time incidents and Lost time incident rate1 There were no lost time incidents recorded in 2018 while the lost time incident rate was zero. The target for both indicators for 2019 will be set to zero as well. Recordable incidents and Recordable incident rate2 There were 6 recordable incidents in 2018 while the total recordable incident rate was 4.15. The target for recordable incidents for 2019 will be set to two or less and accordingly the target for TRIR will be set to 1.5 or less. According to the downward trend (slope) below, Polyeco is targeting to minimize to zero the recordable incidents within a two-year timeframe. 67 Targets for 2019 Through the correct implementation of the IMS and our employees’ contribution we can achieve year-on-year improvements to health and safety and meet our targets.

In 2018 approximately 2,890 kg of laboratory waste were exported to licensed facilities in the EU Solid wastes Any solid industrial waste generated from production at Polyeco facility is converted into alternative fuel. Metal packaging and various scrap metals from waste packed in metal packaging are recycled. Once the packaging are emptied, they are cleaned and compressed and the clean metal is sent to an approved waste collector for recycling. Recyclable waste from staff activities is collected separately and recycled within the facility as a raw material for the production of secondary fuel. The waste that cannot be recycled is collected by the Aspropyrgos Municipality and taken to the Ano Liossia Landfill. Their quantity is about 11 tn / year for the Aspropyrgos plant and about 3 tn / year for the Thessaloniki plant. Liquid waste There are 2 different liquid waste streams at Aspropyrgos facility; industrial liquid waste and urban waste water. It is worth mentioning that the proposed changes have been integrated to the existing industrial liquid treatment plant and it is not expected to be associated with the discharges to the water recipient as facility’s liquid waste is being treated at Tank Farm. SOIL & GROUNDWATER There is no imminent risk of soil or groundwater contamination when the facility operates under normal conditions. Potential risk may occur in the event of a leak in the pumping station, tanks or in the repackaging area and the area of HW storage. To avoid such a risk, appropriate soil protection measures have been taken in the respective areas. In addition, soil is being tested periodically which entails chemical sampling every 6 months at various points around the site for elements and compounds as defined at the corresponding environmental condition of the Decision of Approval of Environmental Terms. Groundwater’s control entails sampling at 3 boreholes, once every 6 months. 83 CIRCULAR ECONOMY Polyeco produces alternative fuels and alternative raw materials using a variety of hazardous & non-hazardous waste streams, by applying best available techniques as defined in IED Directive 2010/75/EU. Alternative raw materials are recovered in the cement industry for the production of clinker, substituting natural resources and contributing to the circular economy. Furthermore, alternative fuels are substituting conventional fuels. The EU Circular Economy Strategy announced on 2 December 2015 aims to meet the major challenges of the modern economy: saving resources, strengthening competitiveness, creating jobs and promoting growth, in relation to the protection of the environment and public health. Specifically, substitution of fossil fuels with alternative fuels contributes to the protection of the environment and public health by reducing carbon dioxide emissions and energy costs as well as waste management costs, limiting the need for landfills. Polyeco, using resources to increase its efficiency, offers economic benefits such as job creation and support for the country's economic development as well as more effective environmental protection and mitigation of climate change. Climate change has a visible impact on all sectors of the economy, the environment and society in general. Addressing climate change requires coordinated efforts at a global level under the Paris Agreement and based on the principles of the circular economy. The socio-economic transformation required by the transition to a low-carbon economy gradually improves production and consumption models, creating and enforcing modern technologies and practices. Therefore, we support the circular economy and we have a positive impact by re-using and recovering the waste, because Innovation is key to supporting closed-loop thinking, according to SDG12, SDG17. 84 7.6 Eco-Friendly Activities Polyeco contributes to the conservation of It should be mentioned that for the achievenatural resources, reducing operating expensment of the targets set in the field of environes and raising employee environmental awaremental protection the company strongly ness. “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle” is one of encourages the participation of its employees Polyeco’s fundamental principles, implementand ensures their constant education in the ing longstanding and active waste reduction practices that can be applied for the conservaand recycling programs.
