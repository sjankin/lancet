LuxairTours also initiated a review of its not only confirms that it is one of the main actors of the regional distribution channels, developing its online business and investing in economy, it also has proven to be one of its main drivers. partnerships with travel agencies. LuxairTours thus evolved over the DECISIONS past years to become a steady profit centre of the group. In 2011, Luxair Luxembourg Airlines offered a capacity of 1.971 million seats and had 15 aircraft, compared to 3.068 million seats and 20 That reliable profit-maker had traditionally been the air cargo handling aircraft today; yearly passenger numbers grew by 78% between 2011 unit LuxairCARGO, but the major crises in the world’s economy took and 2018. LuxairTours increased its passenger numbers by 53% their toll as declining world trade was generating overcapacities in AT THE during the same period, with five more destinations on offer today the market, putting heavy pressure on the margins. LuxairCARGO than 8 years ago. LuxairServices accompanied the steady growth of recovered and has shown record numbers of handled tonnage for the Lux-Airport, with 1,792,000 passengers handled in 2011 compared last three years – however, the profitability never improved due to a to 4,040,000 in 2018. The LuxairCARGO performance speaks for very sensitive and volatile market which remains unpredictable and itself: 678,000 tons of air cargo were handled in 2011; in 2018, the dependent on the global economy. RIGHT annual volume reached 957,000 tons. Last but not least, LuxairServices, the passenger and ground handling This operational development unfortunately was not always in line business unit of LuxairGroup successfully dealt with the outstanding with the financial results. LuxairGroup nevertheless mostly managed growth of lux-Airport. LuxairServices succeeded in developing its to achieve positive operational earnings and always showed a very operations by convincing the airport’s customers with the excellence TIME sound balance sheet. and quality of its service. This overall performance is outstanding because during the same time In summary, all four LuxairGroup business units are performing well, period, LuxairGroup had to contend with ever fiercer competition in its despite their competitive environment. Although the airline business is home market and has been influenced by the global economic trends. and always will be LuxairGroup’s core business, it is the combination of At the end of the day, excellent governance and a strong leadership diverse airline related activities that allow LuxairGroup to withstand the made it possible to achieve these results: LuxairGroup’s development economic and competitive pressure, operational as well as financial. certainly shows that the strategic adaptations LuxairGroup made over LuxairGroup is proud of its performance and proud of its role as a the years were the right choices at the right time. major actor and driver in the regional economy. This role also includes a social responsibility that LuxairGroup always assumed, LuxairGroup’s business model is complex, in many aspects. First of guaranteeing employment for its almost 3,000 staff as well as for the all, LuxairGroup is a small player in the European airlines industry, but over 3,000 indirect jobs which depend on its activities and the airport, it competes with the big ones. Nevertheless, it has a vital function for on top of its role as a key pillar of the economic development and the regional economy and fills a niche, as Luxair Luxembourg Airlines growth for the Greater Region. guarantees direct operations to the main European business centres and capitals. It’s a role that competitors could not take over, since In a world that is continually accelerating, where innovation and they mainly serve their own hubs and consider Luxembourg as a flexibility are key to a sustainable future, LuxairGroup will continue destination amongst many others. doing big things, by taking the right decisions at the right time – just as it always has! LuxairTours remains the number one tour operator in the greater region. Its reliability and proximity to its customers, combined with a Paul Helminger Chairman of the Board of Directors 8 9 CEO’S LETTER CHALLENGED 2018 was once again a challenging year for LuxairGroup and its main activities The airline side of our business experienced an 11% growth in passenger Airline, Tour Operating, Airport Services and Cargo Handling.

In BY other words, all of our activities were under constant pressure. The tour operator business – LuxairTours – saw an increase of 9% in passengers and remains the leading package holiday provider in the The aviation industry has recently undergone a huge transformation, marked Greater Region. LuxairTours also broke new ground with the successful by numerous airlines disappearing or being taken over by big groups, launch of a new destination in the Middle East, Ras Al Khaimah. leading to a consolidation in a market now dominated by only a handful CONSTANT of players. Nonetheless LuxairGroup, largely thanks to the diversity of its LuxairCARGO, the air cargo handling unit, showed a slow growth of 2% in activities, remains as one of the last independent regional airlines in Europe. line with the global economy, nevertheless realising another record year in handled tonnage while broadening its customer base. One has to consider that the investment and the sheer effort to keep up with the competition and assure the necessary growth are proportionally Our Airport Services unit benefited from Lux-Airport’s steady growth CHANGE larger for a regional player like LuxairGroup. Thus, the challenge for to reach a record number of 4.04 million passengers serviced while LuxairGroup is to manage this perpetual evolution, particularly, but not constantly maintaining LuxairGroup’s high standards in terms of quality, only, when it comes to digitalisation, which revolutionised the service safety, security and comfort of people and goods. industry. LuxairGroup therefore launched a huge programme to ensure that our company was and always will be state-of-the art in its operations The outlook, however, remains uncertain, mainly for reasons beyond our and in customer service. control.

Our customers for the Tour Operator, the situation remains fragile as the current growth should rest assured that they are in excellent hands, in any situation. largely comes from destinations which are still recovering from political upheavals of the recent past. But the digital transformation not only concerns the passenger, it is valid for all our businesses and also means reviewing internal processes, No matter the weather or the economic, political or social climate, introducing new technologies in the everyday workflows and acting more LuxairGroup needs to maintain continued growth in all its activities in order quickly to increase productivity. to fight stiff competition and assure a sustainable future. To meet these challenges our workforce undergoes permanent change Looking back over the last decade, I remain confident that we will management.

But looking at it from a different angle, this positive increase in turnover must be weighed against the effect of a 34% hike in fuel TRAVELLERS’ prices in 2018, which negatively impacted the airline’s net profitability.

LuxairCARGO will handle cargo second half of 2018 and the year ended with a more moderate rate transported by Uni-Top Airlines, a major Chinese freight airline. This of growth of 3.5%. In contrast to the last few years, LuxairCARGO is building on another new connection with China since 2018, when did not outperform the global average but was at 2%, far from the China Southern started weekly flights to Luxembourg. 14% growth rate it achieved in 2017. After a significant increase of frequencies and volumes of some clients in 2017, LuxairCARGO’s rate of growth has slowed down. Nonetheless, the volume handled by LuxairCARGO grew by 2% from 940,000 tonnes to 957,000 tonnes in 2018. The volume handled at the Pharma & Healthcare Center grew by 20% compared to 2017, for a total of 37,000. This growing segment of the cargo business is projected to remain strong in the future. The number of trucks loaded and unloaded grew by 1% in 2018, for a total of 125,944 movements. Digital innovation helped make it easier to coordinate air to ground transfers and continued ground transport. The number of rotations remained stable at 6,600 units and the year closed with an increase in turnover of 6%. After a strong rebound in 2017, however, profits diminished in 2018. This weakened performance is explained largely by uncertainties in volatile volume previsions and the resulting increase in personnel costs. The growth in the second half of the year was well below what had been forecasted, and profitability was consequently negatively impacted.
