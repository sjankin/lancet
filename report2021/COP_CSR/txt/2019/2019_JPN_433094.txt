The Consortium is intended to facilitate discussions among corporations and financial institutions that endorse TCFD recommendations for initiatives aimed at more efficient disclosure of corporate information as well as information disclosure leading to appropriate investment decisions by financial and other institutions. In addition, the Marubeni Group is conducting scenario analysis to analyze the impact that climate change is likely to have on its businesses and finances. The Marubeni Group will analyze the risks, opportunities and impacts on its businesses from climate change based on a Current Policies Scenario and the 2.0¬∞C Scenario, and will use the results in considering business plans and strategies. CHAPTER The Case of our Initiatives ‚Ä¢ In feed ingredients procurement in the Food Division, taking into account the possibility of increases in product prices and transportation costs due to a decrease in production volume in the agriculture and livestock industries resulting from climate change, the Marubeni Group is actively responding to the risks that accompany climate change by viewing them as opportunities. This response includes geographic diversification of suppliers and cus2 tomers, cultivation of new production regions, research and development of alternative and new products, and acquisition of new partners. ‚Ä¢ In the power generation business of the Power Business Division, in September 2018 Marubeni released the Notification Regarding Business Policies Pertaining to Sustainability (In Relation to Coal-Fired Power Generation 043 Business and Renewable Energy Generation Business) to promote reduction of GHG emissions from its power generation portfolio, based on transition risks such as changes in the energy mix of each country under the 2.0¬∞C Scenario, tightening of regulations, changes in systems, and changes in stakeholder awareness. On the other hand, the increase in renewable energy projects, upgrades and efficiency improvements of existing power plants, the increase in energy storage and power system stabilization projects, and the increase in distributed power sources will present business opportunities, and we will therefore take a more active approach in the area of clean energy generation. Furthermore, Marubeni recognizes the financial impact from changes such as insurance premium increases as a transition risk based on the Current Policies Scenario, and will use it for reference when formulating mediumand long-term strategies.
