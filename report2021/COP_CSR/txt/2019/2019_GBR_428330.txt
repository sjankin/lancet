Commitment Euromonitor International supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. The scope is broad but includes:  Non-discrimination against, and behaviour towards, vulnerable groups  Civil and political rights  Economic, social and cultural rights  Fundamental principles and rights at work We recognise there are global differences in accepted practices with regards to standards in safe working environments, child protection and other aspects of human rights. However, we ensure we work to the highest standards across all regions rather than just meeting local requirements. We are committed to the well-being of our employees, in-country analysts and contractors, creating safe, positive and professional work places. Implementation We have extensive global policies regarding equal opportunities, flexible working, parental leave, work-life balance and anti-harassment and bullying amongst others. All employees are briefed at induction and every policy is available on the company’s intranet. © Euromonitor International Human Rights 3 Euromonitor requires all suppliers to comply with the full requirements of the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code (eti Base Code). In addition to compliance with the provisions of the eti Base Code, we are committed to ensuring that modern slavery does not take place anywhere in our business or in any of our supply chains. Modern slavery may take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking and is a crime and a violation of human rights, which exploits a person for personal or commercial gain. In accordance with our Modern Slavery Statement, found on our website, we are committed to tackling modern slavery throughout our business. We believe that an important part of upholding and promoting human rights is the commitment a business makes to its local communities. From April 2017 we have committed 1% of our turnover to our corporate social responsibility spend, an amount which equated to roughly £1.4 million in 2018–2019. As signatories of the UN Global Compact we have chosen to align a major part of our community investment programme with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and carefully measure how each of our charity partnerships contribute to the success of the goals. In 2019 we partnered with Justice & Care through our Headline Partnership programme. With our support the organisation is creating an expert witness training programme to improve the number of UK modern slavery and trafficking cases ending in a prosecution. We also encourage a healthy working environment for staff in all our offices and have a range of activities to support this including subsidised gym memberships, in-office classes, fruit deliveries, and social activities. Each year we run a Health & Wellness week in all of our global offices to encourage staff to look after their mind and body and ensure they have a healthy work-life balance. Measurement Management of Euromonitor offices is regularly reviewed by the Leadership Board to ensure all policies are being implemented correctly. Euromonitor is compliant with all legal employment requirements in every respect, and in many cases, exceeds minimum requirements. In the past year Euromonitor International has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights. In 2019 we underwent a smeta Audit as part of our membership of sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange). The audit identified 9 areas for improvement across our supply chain management, health and safety and hr policies and procedures. We will undergo a follow up audit in June when we hope to be found fully compliant. © Euromonitor International Labour PRINCIPLE 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; PRINCIPLE 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; PRINCIPLE 5: The effective abolition of child labour; and PRINCIPLE 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Commitment Euromonitor International hires, promotes, develops and compensates employees based on unbiased criteria and without regard to age, gender, disability, marital status, race, national origin, religion or sexual orientation or any other legally protected characteristics or status. Our Suppliers are also expected to recruit, employ and promote employees on the sole basis of the qualification and abilities needed for the work to be performed. Euromonitor International promotes a positive in-house health and safety culture through regular health and safety checks and employee training. Suppliers shall provide a safe and hygienic environment for its workers. Euromonitor International complies fully with all aspects of labour law in all countries in which it operates. Where our standards exceed those of local legislation, we apply our own policies. © Euromonitor International Labour 5 Implementation Euromonitor International has written policies that clearly state employee rights and responsibilities and their compensation and benefits. It is company policy to ensure that decisions concerning hiring, wages, promotion, training, discipline, retirement and termination are based only on unbiased criteria, and are not linked to any discriminatory characteristics. All employees of Euromonitor, including contracted cleaning staff are paid appropriate living wages, not a minimum wage. Staff members are encouraged to share any matters of concern with us without fear, in the knowledge that they will be taken seriously and that the matters will be investigated properly. The procedure for raising such concerns is outlined in our Whistleblowing Policy which is freely available to all staff via the company intranet. We remain a member of sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) sharing information with our clients on four key areas: labour standards, health & safety, the environment and business ethics. As part of our sedex membership we continue to ensure staff are aware of the Ethical Trading Initiative and that we are always upholding its 9 key areas. In the last year we have partnered with Micro Rainbow International, our donation is being used to provide an employment training programme for members of the lgbti community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The aim of the programme is to help members of the lgbti community counter discrimination and low economic status through professional advancement and in many cases the opportunity of self-employment. Through our Regional Partners programme we are funding several projects which directly support beneficiaries to combat discriminations and enter employment.  Casa Central in Chicago USA is delivering an early learning academy programme to propel its beneficiaries towards a higher quality of life.  The Clock Tower Sanctuary in Brighton UK is supporting homeless young people to make the first steps towards self-sufficiency and employment.  Two Good Foundation in Sydney Australia supports women who have survived domestic abuse into employment through catering courses.  Empowering Women in the Atlas in Morocco run a women’s cooperative providing seed funding for start-up rural businesses. Measurement Euromonitor International’s hr team reviews the company’s responsibilities towards labour rights in relation to compliance with national and international law. We continue to monitor all health and safety incidents, recruitment statistics and sickness records to ensure compliance with our policies. The cr Manager works with all community partners to evaluate the impact of our support. Reports are published on the Corporate Social Responsibility blog on our global website. © Euromonitor International Environment PRINCIPLE 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; PRINCIPLE 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; PRINCIPLE 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Commitment Good environmental practice is important in ensuring that we, and our suppliers, operate responsible and sustainable businesses, which reduce their negative impact on the environment as much as practicable and comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and standards. Although Euromonitor International’s direct impact on the environment is relatively small we are keen to ensure continued commitment to our internal policies and controls. We take our responsibility in supporting initiatives that prevent and manage environmental risk very seriously. Specifically, we are committed to:  Conserve natural resources and reduce the environmental burden of waste generation  Become single use plastic free across all our offices  Reduce the consumption of energy through building assessment and control, and by encouraging employee awareness, individual action and proactive involvement  Reduce the level of air travel and balance the impact of unavoidable flights  Reduce the waste generated and increase recycling in all of our offices © Euromonitor International Environment 7 Implementation Staff engagement continues to be key to our work around environmental responsibility. Each year the company hosts a global Green Week that is organised by local csr Committees in each office. A key focus in the last and coming year is becoming as far as possible plastic free. We are actively encouraging our offices to stop using plastics, not just recycling plastic that has been used. Actions have included:  Providing new starters with reusable water bottles  Purchasing crockery and cutlery for all offices  Removing plastic stirrers and straws from kitchens  Introducing refillable metal soap containers in bathrooms Other initiatives introduced during the year include the use of eco cleaning products in London, food composting in Chicago and transferring to a green energy supplier in Bangalore. Energy reduction is a key element of our environmental management programme, with a focus on employee behaviour and building efficiency. In 2019 our London office underwent its second Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (esos) audit. We have acted on two of the recommendations upgrading our hvac software system and implementing a better monitoring and management system to access real time data on our energy consumption therefore enabling us to better analyse and manage it. We continue to balance the impact of carbon emissions associated with all company flights with our Carbon Offsetting partners, The World Land Trust and Save the Orangutan. In 2018 we offset the emissions associated with our head office energy consumption and in 2019 will roll this out to all offices. Measurement Euromonitor International’s leadership team is committed to reducing our environmental impact. The cr Manager, working with the Director of Operations and Office Managers has day to day responsibility for our environmental programmes and activities. We will be reviewing and reporting, to the Leadership team, on the new energy measuring and monitoring software after the first quarter of the new financial year. In 2016–2017 we achieved a global reduction in energy consumption of 5%. In 2017–2018 we have seen further reductions in 6 offices although a slight increase in our overall consumption. This is partially explained by the opening of three new offices, Hong Kong, Seoul and Düsseldorf. Euromonitor International uses licensed waste companies for disposal of waste and recycling and approved carbon balanced programmes. Reports are regularly reviewed to ensure our systems are effective with the majority of refuse produced being recycled. Euromonitor International has not been involved in any environmental incidents, nor has it been the subject of any investigations or legal proceedings by any regulating authority. © Euromonitor International Anti-Corruption PRINCIPLE 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

The Sustainable Development Goals, or sdgs, aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. We want our csr programme to make a real difference. Each year we are spending 1% of our turnover on charitable projects chosen by our staff. Aligning our giving to the sdgs ensures we are working towards global solutions. Through our Headline and Regional partners, we are supporting 128 charitable organisations through which all 17 of the sdgs are being addressed. This year, we have adopted World Bicycle Relief to join our existing nine Headline Partners; we will be supporting their work in Kenya and Zimbabwe. World Bicycle Relief Case Study Mobility and the Sustainable Development Goals Mobility is an essential element of development strategies that aim to achieve the sdgs. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, there are over 600 million people who walk as their main mode of transportation. The lack of efficient, reliable transportation adversely affects economic and social development in regions where distance in a barrier.
