Optimizing transportation and minimizing fuel consumption are areas that we strive to improve in. We optimise the use of technology within our warehouses, which helps us improve efficiency and lower our energy and other resource requirements, reducing our overall environmental impact. We use a range of technologies within our buildings to help cut emissions, including motion-detecting light sensors and energy-saving bulbs in our offices.
