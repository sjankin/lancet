This is a very important milestone in e-mobility, because it means any car fitted with a CCS Combo connector can use our stations, which have a charging capacity of 350 kW. To roll out this network, in early 2018 we put out a European call for tenders, and the SPIE bid stood out from the rest. We were impressed by their track record and attractive offering, plus the fact that they operate in several European countries, which is obviously going to make things easier for us. Our initial experience has been very positive: SPIE is a highly efficient and well organised company. They’re prompt and reliable at motorway sites, and they meet the specified delivery dates. These are essential criteria for us, because we have to manage a highly complex logistics chain. They really know what they’re doing, and in many ways we’re actually learning from them. Each site has its own specific challenges, as regards layout, surface areas and regulations set by partner service stations or motorway companies. SPIE has the flexibility and logistics efficiency needed to adapt to each different situation. For example, all the materials are on site in advance, ready for work to start, meaning teams are never held up Marcus Groll by supplier delays.” Chief Operating Officer, Ionity “Know-how, adaptability and logistics efficiency are essential qualities for the smooth roll-out of our pan-European network of charging stations.” Watch the interview with Marcus Groll. 35 Inspiration Smart city Smart Facility Management UNITED KINGDOM Arcadia uses a Computer Aided Facility Management (CAFM) platform to manage operations across its 2,500 outlets worldwide.

In this environment, SPIE capitalised on its strategy of diversifying its business with the major oil companies, while landing a number of new service contracts with independents like Perenco and Maurel & Prom.

In the Netherlands, we’re working hand in hand with SPIE on a number of sites that call for creative, flexible grid connection solutions, as at the Louisegroeve1 solar park. Two of the initial challenges on this kind of project concern availability of land and acceptance of renewable energy projects by local populations. We therefore involved SPIE right from the initial project planning stages. Interaction with the network operators must be factored in from the outset, along with management of any factors liable to hinder smooth progress on project operations. Another challenge for SPIE is to ensure that the energy generated is fed smoothly to the power grid using the best available techniques, as grid availability has become an issue in the Netherlands. SPIE has everything it takes in terms of expertise here but, for us, the crux of our relationship lies in their ability to come up with prompt solutions to any difficulties encountered, ensuring the project is delivered to schedule. SPIE’s European scope is another important factor: we know we can count on them in countries including the United Kingdom and Germany.

To complete this broad-based project, 48 INSPIRATION / 2018 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE Groupe PSA France SPIE combines its industry expertise and local reach to support the ramp-up of production by Groupe PSA in Europe. “We work with SPIE in a number of industrial areas, including electrical installations and body-in-white and vehicle fitting lines. For example, we recently called on SPIE to assist on the new Peugeot 208 line in Trnava, Slovakia, and on the new DS 3 CROSSBACK line at our Poissy facility in France. SPIE will also be setting up the electric vehicle charging stations at the Opel development centre in Rüsselsheim, Germany. The challenges we’re taking up with SPIE are many and varied, against a backdrop of considerable economic pressure. To start with, new product launches are driving many of our production facilities to full capacity. So schedules are tight, with no room for delays. Another challenge is the constant need for performance improvements, even though Groupe PSA has already managed to halve its capital expenditure in the past ten years, while actually making more cars. Refurbishing and adapting existing plant, for example, enables us to reduce both costs and environmental impact. We also have to ensure rapid response capabilities at our production facilities, and this calls for attentive, local-reach services. This is one of SPIE’s great Quentin Rasse strengths, with their excellent Machinery and Equipment Purchasing Director, Groupe PSA geographical coverage of units operating in the industrial specialities of “SPIE has implemented a new industrial interest to us.

BUT AT SPIE, WE THINK THAT IT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST AN OPPORTUNITY. In our increasingly complex, high-tech businesses, responsibility makes us grow. It encourages us to view our work differently and to realise the importance of working together as a team. The more demanding the project, the more responsible everyone has to feel. In this way, responsibility creates and nurtures trust, the foundation of the company’s progress and long-term success. 53 Inspiration E X P E R T I S E & B U S I N E S S L I N E S Transforming our expertise and business lines WIDELY RECOGNISED FOR ITS TECHNICALLY ADVANCED CAPABILITIES, SPIE OPERATES AN OVERARCHING EXPERTISE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME WITH THE AIM OF PIONEERING TECHNICAL AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS.

A Group Safety Committee has been created to make this requirement a more integral part of our organisation. For example, in Germany, we adopted the Safety Champion initiative previously rolled out in the United Kingdom. Each team selects a co-worker to monitor safety for a four-week period, after which another person takes his or her place. Transferring best practices helps foster a shared culture of safety, especially when teams from several countries are joining forces on the same project. It delivers a strong message to our clients, who can then replicate initiatives at their own sites.” Watch the interview with Oliver Polanz. 56 INSPIRATION / 2018 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE Fostering a culture of empowerment IN ITS HOLISTIC APPROACH TO EMPOWERMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY, SPIE EMPHASISES EXCELLENCE IN PRACTICE AND THE SHARING OF VALUES ACROSS THE DECISION CHAIN IN SUCH AREAS AS EMPLOYEE SAFETY, ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES, ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND LEADING BY EXAMPLE.

Every person has a complementary role to play and that’s what makes our teams strong. This is all the more true in a highly competitive sector where we need a head start of three to five years to anticipate future needs. For example, in terms of developing future-proof buildings, when it all starts to get very technical, we have no qualms about suggesting the most audacious solutions to add value for our customers. I think that being a woman helps to have this initiative mindset. This is what I’d like to say to young women thinking of a career in engineering: go for it, and be sure to develop your ability to perceive projects from all angles – it’s essential for the future of cities.” Watch the interview with Sandra Gottcheiner. 58 INSPIRATION / 2018 ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORT / SPIE Creating a transformation dynamic TO STEP UP THE TRANSFORMATION OF ITS ECOSYSTEM, SPIE IS DIGITISING ALL OF ITS PROCESSES AND PRACTICES, WHILE CONTRIBUTING TO A WIDE ARRAY OF INITIATIVES THAT ARE HELPING TO MOVE SOCIETY FORWARD.
