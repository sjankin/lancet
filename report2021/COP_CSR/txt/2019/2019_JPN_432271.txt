Kao Sustainability Data Book 2019 47 Water 102-12, 103-1 Contents Kirei Lifestyle Plan Kao’s approach Editorial Policy Water is essential to Kao’s business activities. In manufacturing, water is used not only as a raw material in liquid cleaning products but also for heating, cooling and cleaning purposes. Consumers also need to use water when using our products. Kao has continued to propose products which reduce the Kao’s approach amount of water needed for their production and when they are used by consumers. In addition, the water that is used in plants and homes is returned to river and ocean environments as wastewater after receiving wastewater treatment. We are Independent assurance report Conservation therefore also taking steps including management the water quality of wastewater at our plants, and developing products whose wastewater has less impact on the environment.

Kao Sustainability Data Book 2019 48 Water 102-15, 103-1 Contents Kirei Lifestyle Plan Kao’s approach Editorial Policy Risks and opportunities related to realization of our vision by 2030 Items Content Enactment of water-related policies and regulatory regimes has the potential to increase our supervisory costs in this area. Investing in better facilities and developing of new technologies to comply with policies and regulations will mean higher equipment and operating costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. In addition, national or regional policies to limit water intake depending on plant locations or increased risk of water sources drying up could cause unscheduled production stoppages and result in lower sales. Independent assurance report Policies, legal restrictions Conservation Examples of possible policy or regulatory restrictions Transitional risk ・Plant wastewater regulation. ・Regulation of use of chemical substances in products. ・Product labeling programs for environmental performance or chemical substance content. ・Water intake restrictions. Risk of profit reduction due to higher operating costs entailed by higher R&D costs for developing water-saving and other products for Technology dealing with water risks. Risks Risk of failing to increase sales if technologies developed do not work out. If drought persists at the national or local level, limits on water consumption during product use may be imposed. While this creates Market opportunities in the form of stronger demand for water-saving products, we face the risk that sales of non-water-saving products may fall. Risk of lower sales if water-saving product technology levels fail to match levels demanded by the market. Reputation Risk of reputational harm due to insufficient measures or inadequate disclosure for dealing with the above risks. Risk that short droughts or flooding due to localized downpours may stop plant operations and make production impossible. Similar GRI Standards Community conditions at suppliers’ plants could make it impossible for us to procure raw materials, with the risk that we could not continue Physical risk manufacturing products. There is also the risk that supply chains, from suppliers to our plants, and from our plants to our customers, could Acute be interrupted. These risks, meaning that we could no longer supply our products to the market, would negatively impact sales, and if such risks actually materialized, would require special measures at additional cost, thus reducing our profits. In addition, damage to infrastructure due to widespread flooding would severely affect consumers’ lives and reduce consumption activity, which carries the risk of lower sales for us. In the case of our plants or suppliers located in areas where severe drought may occur, there is a risk that we may not be able to increase Chronic production necessary for future growth. There is also the risk that sales of water-using products may decline in these areas. ISO 26000 Resource efficiency Continuing to reduce water use at our plants reduces operating costs for manufacturing products and is an opportunity to increase profits. Our product development system centers on interface control technology. Interface control literally means controlling how substances mix Corporate Culture Products, services with each other. This technology enables us to continue developing water-related products, for example, detergents that rinse readily or cement that does not readily mix with water, thus enabling us to respond appropriately to market changes. Opportunities If restrictions on water use materialize after a disaster due to flooding or downpours, the spotlight will be on water-saving products, presenting an opportunity to increase sales. Markets Construction of a more resilient infrastructure is also an opportunity to boost demand for concrete and cement additives essential for TCFD index construction work. Continuing to reduce water use at our plants and require suppliers to implement water risk surveys help improve our resilience with regard to water issues in manufacturing our products. Resilience We have been offering advice to consumers for over 60 years, and thanks to a database built up over 40-plus years, we can forecast consumer trends and propose new products, an activity necessary for improving the resilience of our business.
