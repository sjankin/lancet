The purpose of NCC’s sustainability work is to create conditions for people to work, reside, travel and live in a sustainable manner. And in so doing, we must increase value for our customers, employees and shareholders, and society at large. Sustainability work encompasses considerations involving health and safety, social inclusion, materials and waste management, energy usage and climate adaptation, as well as ethics, compliance and the design of our product portfolio. Overall, the decisions we make and how we act in these areas form the foundation for NCC’s future development.

Note 24 Tax on net profit for the year, deferred tax assets NCC has identified two revenue streams where IFRS 15 has or could have a and deferred tax liabilities 49 material impact on NCC’s financial statements. Note 25 Properties classed as current assets 51 The first revenue stream concerns contract modifications related to change Note 26 Materials and inventories 51 orders and contract claims for shortcomings in tender specifications and similar items, which mainly affect the NCC Building Sweden, NCC Building NorNote 27 Construction contracts 51 dics and NCC Infrastructure business areas. The requirements for being able Note 28 Share capital 52 to recognize revenue from contract modifications are more rigorous under Note 29 Interest-bearing liabilities 52 IFRS 15 than under the former IAS 11 in terms of both the documented right to, Note 30 Other provisions 53 and probability of, payment from the customer. A contractual modification exists even if the parties dispute the scope and/or the price of the modification. Note 31 Pensions 53 When assessing whether the modifications are enforceable, NCC must take all Note 32 Other liabilities 55 relevant facts and circumstances into account. If the parties fail to agree on the Note 33 Accrued expenses and deferred income 55 price, the revenue is only to be recognized insofar as it is highly probable that a Note 34 Leasing 56 material reversal of accumulated recognized revenues will not arise when the Note 35 Related-party transactions 56 parties reach agreement. According to IAS 11, revenues in such cases would be recognized when it is regarded as probable that they will be approved by the Note 36 Pledged assets, sureties, guarantees and contingent liabilities 57 customer. The other revenue stream refers to the NCC Property Development business Note 37 Cash flow statement 57 area’s revenues from sales of commercial property projects before completion. Note 38 Financial instruments and The question is whether the revenue is to be recognized over time (percentage financial risk management 58 of completion) or as previously at a specific time (when the property has been Note 39 Information about the Parent Company 66 completed and handed over to the customer). According to IFRS 15, the reveNote 40 Events after the balance-sheet date 66 nue is to be recognized over time (percentage-of-completion) unless NCC has Note 41 Appropriation of the company’s profit an alternative use for the sold property and NCC is entitled to payment from the 66 customer for work completed to date. If one of these criteria is not fulfilled, the revenue, as before, is to be recognized at a point in time – on completion and handover to the customer. Since NCC always agrees on delivery of a certain property to the customer, and it cannot be sold to anyone else, NCC, according to the definition in IFRS 15, never has an alternative use for the sold property. Concerning whether NCC is entitled to payment, certain legislation contains factors that indicate that NCC has such an entitlement, while other legislation indicates that this is not the case. Moreover, legal praxis has not been developed in this context. NCC’s overall assessment is that in normal cases the uncertainty concerning NCC’s entitlement to payment is so great that the revenue, as before, should be recognized at a point in time, on completion of the property and handover to the customer.

The loss carryforwards may be utilized against future profits, with no time limitations, and NCC’s assessment is that there are factors that convincingly indicate that this will be the case. The businesses have a track record of operating at a profit, market conditions are favorable and the losses incurred are a function of structural and project-specific difficulties. To manage these, NCC has initiated a comprehensive action program that is proceeding as planned.

In Norway, the commitment comprises two small pension systems pertaining to supplementary pensions that are not funded and where no new vesting occurs.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 8-67 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of parent company as of 31 December 2018 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2018 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and the balance sheet for the parent company and the group. Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, to the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Our audit approach Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. We tailored our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the NCC group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which NCC operates. In a business such as NCC’s, our risk assessment is particularly influenced by the impact of the Board of Directors’ and management’s estimates and judgements on the financial statements. We have assessed the highest risk for misstatements in the financial statements to be the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition in some of the ongoing projects in NCC Building Sweden, NCC Building Nordics and NCC Infrastructure. In addition, we have identified a number of other risks that also reflect components of estimates and judgements, e.g, warranty provisions and disputes. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of the Board of Directors’ and management overriding internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Based on the risk assessment the central audit team developed an audit strategy according to which the group audit mirrors NCC’s organisation and which starts in an audit of the five business areas. As a part of this strategy the audit has focused on the largest units within each business area, which are subject to a so-called full audit. The central audit team performs the audit of the parent company and the consolidated accounts and issues, based on the audit strategy, instructions to the audit teams for each business area. We also perform a centralised audit of, e.g., selected controls in the financial processes handled by NCC’s group common shared service centre as well as of relevant controls over NCC’s group common information systems. The results of these examinations are shared with local audit teams. NCC 2018 FINANCIAL REPORT 69 Materiality The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Key audit matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. KEY AUDIT MATTER HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER Revenue and results recognition in construction projects We have evaluated and on a sample basis tested selected key controls in so-called tollgates in NCC’s project process, from calcula2018 revenue in NCC’s construction and civil engineering operation to current project reporting.

The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for this other information. Our opinion on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion on this other information. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the President are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and the consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the President are responsible for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the President intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The audit committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s responsibility Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts is available on Revisors­ inspektionen’s website www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description is part of the auditor´s report. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Opinions In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the President of NCC AB (publ) for the year 2018 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Presidents be discharged from liability for the financial year. Basis for Opinions We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibility section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the President The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company’s profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general. The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization and the administration of the company’s affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The President shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfil the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner. NCC 2018 FINANCIAL REPORT 71 Auditor’s responsibility Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the President in any material respect: • has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or • in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association. Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act. A further description of our responsibility for the audit of the administration is available on Revisorsinspektionen’s website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar.

The Nomination Committee’s work complies with the INTERNAL GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL instructions adopted by the AGM. NCC’s operations require a considerable amount of delegated responsibility. Group-wide decision-making procedures are in place to clarify exactly who is entitled to make decisions at each stage of the decision-making process. In addition to strategic and organizational matters, the areas regulated include investments and divestments, rental and leasing agreements, financing, sureties, guarantees, the assessment of tenders and EVALUATION OF THE BOARD business agreements. On top of the rules of procedure for decision making, a number of other Group-wide AND AUDITORS control documents govern communication, finance, code of conduct, the environment and work environment.

The Board or, where appropriate, the Audit Committee appointed by the Board, also assists the Nomination Committee in evaluating the CODE OF CONDUCT work of the auditors. A comprehensive program to develop and implement the Group’s values has long been under way. These values have been translated into norms and rules governing how NCC employees are to behave in various situations. These regulations are summarized in a Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct describes the requirements that NCC – the Board of Directors, management and all employees – have to meet in terms of behavior and conduct and that NCC in turn expects its business partners to respect. NOMINATION COMMITTEE Every manager has an obligation, within his or her area of responsibility, to ensure that employees and Election and remuneration business partners are informed about the contents of the Code of Conduct and the requirement that they be of the Board of Directors observed. NCC managers must always set a good example. Adherence to the Code of Conduct is followed and auditors up continuously as a natural part of ongoing operations. In 2018, NCC continued to refine its compliance program in line with the applicable Group-wide policy and needs-adapted process. NCC Compass focuses on providing straightforward and tangible advice to the EXTERNAL AUDIT organization, in order to prevent the risk of irregularities. Three areas have been identified as especially (Audit firm) important in NCC Compass: bribery and corruption, competition law and conflicts of interest. The area of diversity was added to NCC Compass in 2017 and in 2018 management of personal data was added as a feature of NCC’s GDPR work. NCC Compass is available via NCC’s intranet. All NCC employees can make use of the content of NCC Compass and seek guidance. NCC has also appointed and provided special training to 58 employees in business ethics and how NCC Compass is to be applied in various situations. These employees are called Navigators since their assignment is to assist employees at NCC to correctly navigate the areas covered by NCC’s Code of Conduct. In addition, NCC has introduced advanced system support for internal and external reporting of irregularities, all within the framework of the value-driven and transparent corporate culture that NCC is working to refine. Moreover, NCC has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of the operations and identified risk areas and risk processes. The purpose of NCC’s procedures is to make it easINTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT ier for employees to dare to ask questions in difficult situations, rather than letting ignorance or thoughtlessness lead them to take the wrong decisions or behave in an undesired manner. The work methods include guidelines covering such areas as how to handle the most prevalent risk situations. Implementation combined with training and discussions with NCC employees continued in 2018. All NCC employees are covered by the training programs. Further training in the area is provided in the form of shorter, Web-based courses. During 2018, both web-based and instructor-led GDPR courses were arranged for groups with GOVERNANCE OF BUSINESS AREAS special interests and needs due to their management of personal data.
