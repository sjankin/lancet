.KBC KBC Group UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 Statement of Continued Support In 2006, KBC became a signatory of the UN Global Compact, and we are pleased to reaffirm our support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In 2018, a number of new policy guidelines were introduced, while others have been tightened up and updated. In doing so, we are responding to the constantly evolving expectations of our stakeholders and the wider community by implementing stricter policies for sustainable banking and insurance. We clearly communicate on the new and updated policies in the 2018 Sustainability Report, published in April 2019. One of the three cornerstones of the sustainability strategy is to limit our adverse impact on society as much as feasible. Therefore we apply strict sustainability policies to our business activities in respect of human rights, the environment, business ethics and sensitive/ controversial societal issues. In our internal data gathering and audit process we assess the communication and implementation of the KBC policies and guidelines throughout the KBC Group. All guidelines and codes of conduct are publically available on our corporate website. The KBC sustainability policies are reviewed and updated every two years to make sure that our policies continue to meet and address the concerns and expectations of society. KBC's compliance with the UN Global Compact Principles is another positive signal to the international community of our itment to continue enhancing corporate sustainability throughout our operations and beyond.
