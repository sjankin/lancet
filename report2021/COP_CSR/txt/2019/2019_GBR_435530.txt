Society has a history of learning from catastrophic events such as Deepwater Horizon and Challenger, yet large numbers of people die at work every day in less high profile ways. The Foundation’s purpose is to engineer a safer world and it works with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) to speak out and find solutions – it could be something as simple as providing fishermen with phone apps so they can have appropriate weather forecasts. James Pomeroy also highlights the demographic angle to As safety systems become more safety: in some countries, half of the population is aged under complex and interconnected, 25, so there is a relatively small pool of experienced people from whom to transfer knowledge. Conversely, in many the immediacy and consequences developed markets, work patterns are shifting as people work of human errors will be much greater. to a later age or as part of the gig economy, which raises questions about training, equipment and policies, as well as how to empower these people to speak up about their own safety.

The challenge It can be challenging for our surveyors to work in confined spaces and hazardous locations. Equally, our clients are keen to avoid the costly disruptions associated with surveys and inspections. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) is India’s largest private port operator and an end-to-end logistics provider. The organisation owns 10 strategically located ports and terminals, which represent 24% of India’s port capacity. The availability of the port cranes is essential to the entire port operation. Periodically, these port cranes are subjected to inspection to identify areas that require maintenance, repair, or replacement. Conventional closed-up visual inspection poses operation risk and can also be time consuming. The solution Using drones for remote inspection is an effective solution that provides a win-win for both client and surveyor. To realise this opportunity, LR has introduced the use of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), more commonly known as drones, as part of our portfolio. For APSEZ, a proof-of-concept project was set up to explore the feasibility of using drones to complement conventional closed-up visual inspection of the port cranes. The project was broken into two stages:  Stage 1 – Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) service provider suitability and capability assessment using LR’s guidance notes.  Stage 2 – Drone data capture and data interpretation by an experienced and qualified LR inspector.

The challenge The world’s oceans are under increasing pressure from threats such as climate change and overfishing, whilst consumers are increasingly looking for sustainable choices for seafood. A rapidly growing requirement for sustainable protein is driving demand that is increasingly being met by aquaculture fish farms which now provide us with almost as much of our seafood as commercial wild caught fisheries. The need to mitigate the environmental impacts of fishing and aquaculture are increasingly in the public consciousness. This combined with the globalisation of food chains and suppliers mean that the complexity and potential risks of the seafood product business have increased. For seafood producers, it is important to meet the safety, quality and social compliance requirements of manufacturers and indeed the consumer who wants to know that the seafood they eat is safe and sustainably sourced. The solution It’s therefore essential that the sector implements systems LR has assessed fisheries to ensure it continues to meet not just consumption requirements, but also environmental and social criteria. on every continent and in Shining examples of best practice are the Aquaculture 40 countries to the Marine Stewardship Council’s (ASC) farm fish standard, the leading standard for the farmed seafood sector, and the Marine Stewardship Council Stewardship Council (MSC) fisheries standard.

In response to a series of high potential 93% increase in employee confidence incidents, LR created a dedicated training programme to improve the competency of our personnel to safely undertake high-risk activities. There are 10 LifeSavers modules, each of which relates to a high-risk activity that field-based colleagues face. These activities include working at height, entering confined spaces or boat transfers. Each LifeSaver provides clear guidance on the minimum requirements. They simplify each requirement by breaking down high-risk activities into a series of behaviours and actions that are easy to understand. LifeSavers Modules We’ve worked hard to develop our safety 1.
