As 99% of the Group’s surplus liquidity is held to the finance policy, cash and cash equivalents can be invested in accounts at a Swedish commercial bank with a very good credit to maturities up to six months with no more than 25% of the rating, it is the view of the company that the risk associated with excess liquidity tied up for longer than three months. cash and cash equivalents is low.

Capital consists of equity and the Company’s dividend policy in the form of the share redemption Interest rate risk programme. The interest rate risk to which the Group’s income and cash flows are exposed is low. Changes in interest rates affect the return on cash and cash equivalents obtained by the Group. Even though the Company has a relatively large proportion of cash and cash equivalents in relation to total assets, the risk associated with these changes is not considered substantial. As of the last day of December 2018, the company had no external loans or credit facilities. Credit risk The Group does not have any significant concentration of credit risks. No customer accounts for over 6% of the Group’s total revenues, with the three largest customers accounting for 14% of the Group’s revenues in total. NetEnt has set guidelines for ensuring sales of services to customers with a suitable credit background and is responsible for monitoring and analysing the credit risk for each new customer before standard terms for payment and delivery are offered. The use of credit limits is regularly analysed and the management does not anticipate any significant losses due to default of payment from these counterparties. Through short lead times and credit terms, providing a short customer credit term, the credit risk is further reduced. Management is of the opinion that the Group has routines to handle credit risk exposure to each individual customer. Maximum credit risk exposure is matched by the carrying amount of financial assets. In 2015 the NOTES Note 26 Financial risks (cont.)

See Note 2, Accounting principles. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost. A calculation of fair value based on discounted future cash flows, in which the discount rate that reflects the counter-party’s credit risk is the most significant input data, is not considered to give any significant difference from the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities included in level 2. For all financial assets and liabilities, the carrying amount is therefore considered to be a good approximation of fair value. The three levels of measurement in the hierarchy for fair value are as follows: Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices on active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2: Measurement model based on observable data for the asset or liability other than the quoted prices included in Level 1, either direct (prices) or indirect (derived prices). Level 3: Measurement models where significant input data is based on non-observable data. a n n u a l r e p o r t 2 0 1 8 _ f i n a n c i a l st a te m ents _ 1 0 9 Categorisation of financial instruments 2017 In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group has decided not to apply the standard retroactively, and has therefore not recalculated the comparative amounts for 2017 in this report.
