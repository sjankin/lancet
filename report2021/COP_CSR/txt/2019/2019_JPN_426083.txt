Bearings are eco-products that reduce energy consumption Founded just over a century ago by Noboru Niwa and Jiro Nishizono, NTN has a long history of rising to meet by supporting various rotating mechanical parts and reducing friction. each new challenge head-on. Our founders emphasized the importance of having “Frontier Spirit” and Bearings are mounted inside machinery and are usually hidden from view. “Coexistence and Co-prosperity Spirit”—two key traits that define the Founders’ Spirit. But they play a key role in improving the safety and reliability of machinery, helping contribute to “NAMERAKA* Society.” *“Nameraka” means “smooth” in Japanese. Frontier Spirit Coexistence and History Co-founder Noboru Niwa became interested in the idea of manufacturing bearings in Japan to meet the country’s demand at Co-prosperity Spirit the time. Learning that a ship carrying a cargo of foreign bearings Niwa was also committed to the idea of sharing the wealth had sunk in the Port of Yokohama, Niwa lost no time in bidding created from business profits instead of monopolizing it. It was a successfully for the entire cargo. He then engaged engineer Jiro value his mother had taught him from an early age. He realized Bearings date back to the time of the ancient Nishizono to refurbish the bearings, selling them as reclaimed that being able to produce low-cost bearings in Japan as an Egyptians. The Egyptians placed logs on the parts.

This realization came from blocks used to build the pyramids. Rolling the by Nishizono to produce bearings in Japan. After its founding, the the values his mother had taught him, and inspired him to work blocks over the logs reduced friction, enabling Company had to overcome a long series of hardships, struggling with Nishizono to attempt to manufacture bearings in Japan. human workers to move the massive blocks. to do business as a solo independent operator not affiliated with “Coexistence and co-prosperity Spirit” is still a core of the Inner ring Modern bearings are devised on the same the government or a major conglomerate.

The jjoints could not be used in automotive applications due to their rigidity. But we found the same technology could be repurposed for robotics, Developed from Core Business resulting in the development of “i-WRIST.” Existing robots require ample space to move, and need a new location whenever there is a change in the various products they support. “i-WRIST” addresses these issues by saving space and enabling easy setup. It can perform the same movements as the human wrist joint, requires little space even for a large range of movement, and can support a wide range of needs with just software changes. By enabling the human wrist movements that today’s robots have previously been unable to recreate, “i-WRIST” has opened the door to operations previously only possible with human workers. Early 2000s At present In the future NTN is expanding its businesses in new areas that contribute to development of a recycling-based society Business Strategies that keeps circulating smoothly with its core tribology technologies developed through bearing works NTN will develop businesses in new areas addressing natural energy, electrification of automobiles, safety innovations, robots working and living with people, and services/solutions driven by big data.
