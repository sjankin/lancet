By making more efficient use of these resources, our environmental impact and costs can be reduced.

ISO 14001 provides a systematic approach to environmental work and contributes to continuous improvements. The goal is for all of the Group’s production units to be certified. This also applies for other operations where environmental certification is relevant, such as the large units in Beijer Tech. A total of 24 (22) units are currently certified. Four additional companies are preparing to implement the environmental management system over the next six to 18 months. At the end of 2018, all companies had implemented updates to meet the demands of ISO 14001:2015. Internal and external environmental audits are part of the Group’s continuous efforts to monitor and improve the environmental management system. Beijer Alma employs more than 70 (75) internal environmental auditors, who conducted 46 (37) environmental audits during the year.

Specially manufactured sealing caps The UK company European Springs & Pressings has designed a special cap for the drinks producer Tinkture. The company has developed an attractive bottle and wanted a cap that could match the bottle design. The end result was a specially designed sealing cap for which the Lesjöfors company drew on its knowhow and creativity in engineering and Power springs are used, for example, in hose rollers and engine recoil starters. manufacturing. Lesjöfors’s standard range includes some 80 different power springs. The products are manufactured in the US and Latvia. Springs in innovative medical technology The company Sanandco has developed the MonitorMe system for registering and analyzing patient data. The product contains advanced springs from the Lesjöfors company European Springs & Pressings. MonitorMe is a phone device with sensors that measures and sends information concerning temperature, pulse and blood pressure over the ©TINKTURE Internet to a digital patient journal. In this way, a person’s health status can be monitored at home instead of taking up time and space in the healthcare system. 42 LESJÖFORS Increased automation In Latvia, automation has increased in the manufacturing of gas springs. The goal to reduce manual steps in manufacturing permeates the entire Lesjöfors Group and entails that new, updated machinery is gradually being introduced in many plants. At Lesjöfors Gas Springs, a new assembly machine was installed. The machine is fully automatic and assembles components for gas springs quicker and more efficiently than in the past. A special camera reviews the quality and stops the machine if something has been assembled incorrectly. Growth in Russia The chassis spring operation established in Russia in 2010 has grown 20 percent per year in recent years. Among other applications, this type of gas spring is used to open and close doors Lesjöfors is one of few European manuand hoods. facturers with a local service and sales Support for students organization and its own distribution Lesjöfors has contributed products and know-how to student projects for warehouse in Russia.

Lesjöfors Banddetaljer has a similar cooperation with an engineering upper-secondary school in Sweden. During the year, European Springs & Pressings invited students to a “work experience week”. In China, Lesjöfors has a collaborative project with a university. Outstanding delivery reliability In Tinglev, Denmark, delivery quality is at an all-time high. This is where Lesjöfors manufactures compression springs for customers in such countries as China, the US and Mexico. Measurements taken internally and among customers show a nearly 100-percent level of delivery reliability year after year. This accuracy and excellent outcome are the result of hard work, including a continuous search for improvements. 43 Habia Cable HABIA CABLE Habia Cable is one of Europe’s largest manufacturers of customized cables and cable harnesses.

Asia is the largest market, accounting for approximately twothirds of sales. Other markets include Europe and North America. Telecom has its own sales organization in these markets and covers all customer needs with its broad range. The market has long been characterized by price pressure, mainly due to Chinese low-price products that have forced many cable manufacturers to leave the area of telecom cable. Habia has countered this price trend by concentrating its manufacturing and product development to China and constantly developing its products and production processes. Other Industry – breakthrough in offshore, growth in defense Habia is one of Europe’s largest manufacturers of custom-designed cables. Its products are adapted to specific customer requirements and are often used in high-tech applications. Its customers include companies in nuclear power, defense and offshore as well as industrial companies in areas such as transport, engine and turbine manufacturing, and tool, measuring and sensor technology. Habia has manufacturing operations in Sweden, Poland, German The company’s sales encompass about 50 countries. The largest and China.

To handle this, many Asia 8% of the company’s products are manufactured in robust, high-performance Rest of the world 4% materials. Its cables are used, for example, in military applications, electric power tools, gas turbines and marine diesel engines. One focus area is offshore, which, despite adjustments in the energy sector, is a significant market in which Habia has launched several products and has world-leading technology. Flexiform boasts superior damping and helps to increase the range of base-station antennas. 48 HABIA CABLE Competitive advantages Main areas – Habia’s sustainability Telecom – high performance at lower cost work Compared with many competitors, Habia’s proprietary products give ■■ More efficient energy consumption. customers higher performance at a lower cost, for example, through the ■■ Reduced VOC emissions. profile-extruded version of Flexiform.

Svebab expands its capacity Svebab has made investments and process improvements that have increased its manufacturing capacity for fire hoses by about 30 percent. Another machine has been installed at the company’s textile facility. The company has also carried out remodeling and process improvements in vulcanization, more than doubling its speed in this area of manufacturing. These changes have made it possible to scrap the company’s old, bulky and inefficient machines, thereby doubling its storage space. The work environment has also been improved. ©EXONE 3D printing is used to create grains of sand that are then used in molds for end products, such as this type of impeller. 58 BEIJER TECH Successful service collaboration A new type of collaboration has improved the service provided by Preben Z. Over the past three years, sales have increased between 20 and 30 percent per year. Service is now handled by blasting machines together with a local company.
