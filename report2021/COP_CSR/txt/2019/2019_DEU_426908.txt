NORMA Group’s joining products are COMMUNITY used in various industries and can be found in vehicles, ships, trains, aircraft, ­domestic appliances, engines and plumbing systems as well as in applications DATA for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. From its headquarters in Maintal near Frankfurt/Main, Germany, the Company coordinates a global ­network consisting of 30 production facilities as well as numerous sales and ­distribution sites across Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific. COVER THE FGR PIPE COUPLING – A RELIABLE CONNECTION FOR SUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE The FGR pipe coupling reliably connects pipes made of metal, such as steel, stainless steel or copper, but also pipes made of plastic. What does this have to do with sustainability? The way it is used in waste water treatment plants is just one example. The steel pipes used here are exposed to acidic liquids and must therefore be replaced regularly. The advantage of the FGR: The pipe coupling is tightened with two screws and can thus be used again and again – in contrast to other solutions, no pre-treatment of the pipe ends or welding work is necessary. The FGR thus makes a contribution to wastewater treatment while saving resources through its reusability. Up to 500 FGR couplings can be used in a single wastewater treatment plant. Other applications include municipal and private water supply, cooling and process water in the chemical industry, power plants and seawater desalination plants.

Using this technology, the parts of the joining element touching the pipe are melted and fuse with the materials of the pipe. The result: an enduring and safe connection with no leakages at the point of retrieval which provides a valuable contribution to water efficiency in Indian households. Following this development, Kimplas became a pioneer in house service connections, which by now have been made a mandatory element of public water supply projects in India. NORMA Group acquired Kimplas in 2018. The key factor in the acquisition is Kimplas’ expertise and product range in the area of water management which also include water irrigation systems.
