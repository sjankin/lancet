10th ANNIVERSARY OF CARBON NEUTRALITY STATUS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Fiscal Year: 1 April 2018 31 March 2019 Dear Stakeholders, With the release of the 10th edition of our Sustainability Report, we wish to highlight the fact that our Company has been Carbon Neutral continuously for the past ten years. Indeed, Alcantara is the first Italian Company and among the few in the world to achieve this status. This accomplishment is the result of the decisions we have taken and the activities we have planned and implemented in the field of sustainability in line with development guidelines that we will continue to follow in the future. I wish to underline that we take this important outcome as a new starting point and not as an arrival point. We are aware of having understood the Paris Accords on Global Warming, which are only strengthened by the continuing calls to action from the scientific community, and our pioneering sensitivity to this has been highlighted 10 years ago. The key elements in Alcantara’s commitment to all stakeholders may be summed up as follows: • Carbon Neutrality. As a clear, self-determined and direct action to fight climate change and speed up the process of decarbonizing the economy, every metre of material produced and marketed by Alcantara has a net CO2 emissions balance of zero. • Full Life Cycle Assessment. Alcantara measures its footprint in a cradle-to-grave approach. This best practice is a mark of excellence, which includes monitoring the raw materials production phase. • Responsible Procurement. Alcantara has been monitoring its own supply chain since 2007 to increase awareness of and commitment to the principles of sustainability. Our Company asks its suppliers and partners to respect the universal principles of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and fight against corruption. Specifically, regarding the issue of climate change, supplies procured via our “core” and “supercore” suppliers have a zero CO2 emissions balance. We will continue to expand our responsible procurement policy, gradually expanding the number of partners involved. THE • Corporate Citizenship. Alcantara pursues development and profitability with a focus on respecting and ensuring social, economic and environmental balance. Our Sustainability Report includes a description of our participation in UN-patronized international offset CHAIRMAN’S projects. These initiatives aim to expand the use of renewable energy resources and to improve the health and social conditions of people in the poorest and most disadvantaged LETTER areas of the world while offsetting all CO2 emissions produced. • Stakeholder Engagement. For the purpose of fostering and spreading a genuinely shared culture, the direct engagement of principal stakeholders is of the utmost importance for us. To this end, we have spearheaded a number of fully non-profit initiatives, including the organization of the International Symposium on Sustainability. This annual event -that in 2019 marked the 5th editionis an important occasion for awareness-raising, dialogue among experts in different business sectors (business managers, entrepreneurs, policymakers, academics, scientists, representatives of the financial world, etc.) and cross-fertilization in issues of decarbonization and climate change. • Continuous Improvement. Alcantara has implemented a five-year plan to expand its production facility (2017-2022) which will increase employment while reducing environmental impact. Our Company is also committed to progressively maximizing the use of bio-based raw materials (that are not food-chain antagonists) in its production process. The Alcantara product portfolio includes materials that contain recycled raw materials. Lastly, we are engaged in research into end-of-lifecycle product recycling. • Voluntary open involvement. Alcantara confirms its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and in the Global Compact Network Italy Foundation (GCNI), underlining its long-term commitment to responsible management, respecting and promoting the ten UNGC principles and undertaking actions aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The Company also confirms -among other initiativesits participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). This 10th edition of our Sustainability Report includes information on all the initiatives we have undertaken and represents an act of transparency for the Company since we voluntarily disclose what we do and what our future plans are. Firmly believing sustainability is a necessary factor that is consistent with our long-term objective of increasing the economic and financial value of the Company, it remains a core value in our corporate culture, an important growth driver and a spur to developing our business strategy. Now, more than ever, we are convinced that sustainability is a value beyond cost: a value for our Company, our brand, our people and our stakeholders. A value for the future.

In “Alcantara Drives Dreams”, the installations took guests on a journey of the mind and spirit, where everyday elements pushed the boundaries of imagination. Alcantara unveiled during the 2018 Design Week the Interior Capsule Collection INITIAL, a brand-new furnishing project. The collection, entirely made by Alcantara® electrowelded, available in different colours, consists of alphabet letters that chameleon-like turned into pieces of furniture that inspire and amaze: upside-down Ts and Ls that became columns with seats, O-shaped screens, Us that divided up spaces, pouffes in the shape of As, Cs and Is.

For this edition, the curator Davide Quadrio has selected 3 installations from the Company’s art collection, created by 3 extraordinary contemporary talents: Krijn de Koning (Work for Alcantara, Blue Chair), Nanda Vigo (Arch/arcology) and German design collective Zeitguised (Beyond the Nuclear Garden). The exhibition organized by Alcantara aimed to respond to the theme chosen by the Biennale, “Freespace”, presenting the selected works in a completely new setting, seeking to establish a connection with history and working towards an idea of an imagined future, as an infinite source of creative potential. Alcantara was honoured to be a partner (together with Connect4Climate-WorldBank and philanthropist Paul G. Allen’s Vulcan Productions) of “X-Ray Fashion”, the virtual reality experience created by MANND and directed by the famous fashion photographer and filmmaker Francesco Carrozzini (Franca: Chaos and Creation). “X-Ray Fashion” was presented at the 75th Venice International Film Festival. The fashion industry accounts for 20% of global waste and 10% of global CO2 emissions. Fashion is often associated with human rights abuses including hazardous working conditions, long hours and more besides. “X-Ray Fashion” explored the dark side of the industry and its impact on climate change with an immersive, multi-sensory installation. “X-Ray Fashion” has promoted major initiatives and become an advocate for greater sustainability in the sector. 86 87 ALCANTARA 2018 LAMBORGHINI NIGHT F/W 2019 WOMENSWEAR COLLECTION PURITY OF EMOTION FASHION WEEK Shanghai, September 2018 Milan, September 2018 On the occasion of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo-Shanghai race, Automobili Lamborghini China and Alcantara presented “2018 Lamborghini Night-Purity of Emotion” event. During the night, guests were able to enjoy an atmosphere that positively celebrates the Italian lifestyle values exclusivity, luxury, technology, outstanding performance and fine artisanship-for which both brands are known the world over. A key role was played by the Alcantara lounge that feature sharp edges that echo the lines of the Lamborghinis in action on the racetrack-with the 100% Italian-made material adding a pleasing touch of contemporary luxury to sofas and armchairs dressed in a relaxing Ice Grey and Pearl Grey pouffes and cushions featuring a pattern that evokes a Lamborghini’s interior. Furthermore, only for this special occasion, a preview of the S/S 2019 Alcantara fashion collection was introduced to the wide audience. The Company has created a wardrobe with a strong personality for the Alcantara woman, exploiting the material’s high performance by applying it to the latest fashion trends. The F/W 2019 collection was made up of influences, of apparent contradictions that instead blend harmoniously together: high-tech and tailoring, street style and couture approaches. From the coat, the quintessential symbol of Italian elegance, to the skirt that played the central role of garment-accessory, for an intentionally eccentric style statement. Highly consistent juxtapositions: animal prints and certification of a fully “animal-friendly” production process, namely without the use of animal derivatives. In keeping with the new partnerships project with top names in Italian manufacturing, Alcantara has also collaborated with Sergio Rossi creating sandals, boots and pumps made out of Alcantara®. 88 89 ESQUIRE TOWNHOUSE JAPAN AND KOREA PRESS CONFERENCES ALCANTARA & ALFA ROMEO Tokyo-Seoul, November 2018 Dubai, November 2018 In November, Alcantara played a leading role, together with Alfa Romeo EMEA, at the annual event organized by the Esquire Middle East magazine, held at XXII CARAT VILLA-PALM JUMEIRAH, in Dubai, renamed the Esquire Townhouse for the occasion.

NERVI IN THE MAKING Rome, March 2019 The capsule collection created jointly by LARUSMIANI and Automobili Amos, in partnership with Alcantara S.p.A., was presented at the LARUSMIANI Boutique in Via MonteNapoleone 7. The collection, inspired by the Lancia Delta Futurista-which was on display inside the store for the occasion-aimed to create practical, functional garments that reflect the typycal aesthetics and uses of gentlmen drivers. Alcantara® decorated some of the items in the collection (the jumpsuit inspired by car racing, the helmet case and the roll-up set of car tools, all handcrafted by expert craftsmen) and upholstered the interiors of the car created by Eugenio Amos. The LARUSMIANI creative team also chose it to cover the walls of the Boutique for the inauguration of its new concept. The close alliance continued between MAXXI and Alcantara, forged in 2011, with a common and ongoing programme of research, experimentation and dialogue between creativity and innovation. Having organized six group exhibitions involving over 30 designers and national and international studios, from last year the Alcantara-MAXXI Project with the Studio Visit format became monographic and personal. For each edition, one internationally famous designer or studio was invited to create a space within the National Museum of 21st Century Arts that expressed their interpretation of the work of one of the artists in the Collection. This year the international design studio Formafantasma was selected, which after consulting the archives of MAXXI Architettura, chose the work of Pier Luigi Nervi, presenting “Nervi in the making”, curated by Domitilla Dardi, a design curator at MAXXI. The result was an installation that recreated a Chinese box-style environment-physical and mental at the same time-to express the importance of a material in the work of a designer. 94 95 5.2 Universities, Research 5.3 Stakeholder Engagement and Sustainability On 7 and 8 February, on the Island of devoted to host several speeches San Servolo in Venice, at the premises focused on sharing emerging trends, of Venice International University, opportunities driven by technology, Alcantara organized the 5th edition corporation’ cases, opinions of financial CLIMATE HOW: of the International Symposium operators and policy makers.
