This entails continuously raising our sights and endeavouring to develop our approach, choices, processes and products to further enhance our sustainability. During the year, new governance documents regarding sustainability, the environment and our Code of Conduct were prepared, helping us maintain our leadership. Success factors include awareness of our impact and an approach characterised by continuous improvement, which is achieved in a systematic and structured way. We shall act proactively, not reactively, and developing the skills of Significant public sector customers, including public authorities, our companies’ employees plays an important role in raising the regions and municipalities are setting increasingly stringent Group’s performance in sustainability. demands, contributing to the need to focus on restructuring, which we believe will benefit the development our business, both in our Sustainability work must form a natural part of our corporate culture home markets and in export markets. and this must be communicated in a relevant way, both internally and externally.

This prioritisation is based on the following factors: the extent of the negative impact, the extent to which a positive impact can be achieved, and the scope of our opportunities to Sofia Svensson control our impact. President and CEO LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP AB | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | 2 Overarching sustainability objectives Lammhults Design Group’s strategy indicates three areas within the 17 Global Sustainability Goals where we can most make a difference. These are SDG 8 (Working conditions and economic growth), SDG 12 (Sustainable consumption and production) and SDG 15 (Life on land, focusing on ecosystems and biodiversity). We are working towards four comprehensive sustainability goals to achieve sustainable commercial and social development, as well as continuous improvement. These are part of our sustainability platform for managing and prioritising work on sustainability in the companies. ENSURE THAT LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP’S CORE VALUES AND SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES ARE RECOGNISED AND INTEGRATED INTO THE OPERATIONS OF EACH COMPANY TABLE – PONTO During the year, new governance documents regarding sustainability, the environment and the Code of Conduct have been Design Troels Grum Schwensen. prepared at the Group level. Application and governance efforts based on these continues in 2019. All employees are to be briefed and receive training. TABLE – GRADE PLUS Design Johannes Foersom and Peter Hiort-Lorenzen. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SOCIALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN Lammhults, 2018 The stringent requirements of Möbelfakta on a systematic approach have strengthened work on social accountability. External audits of procedures and working methods for choice and follow-up of suppliers have been a criterion for Möbelfakta approval since 2016. Combined, only 4 percent of total purchasing in 2018 came from risk countries according to the updated list from Amfori BSCI. They were China, Romania and Turkey. A specific procedure is in place, according to which the Managing Director of each company must approve new suppliers. INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF SUSTAINABLE WOOD RAW MATERIALS IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY During the year, the Library Interiors business area was certified in accordance with the FSC® traceability standard. Ensuring the wood raw material is purchased from sustainable forestry (FSC, PEFC certified or equivalent) is a criterion for approval in accordance with the Möbelfakta label and the Nordic Swan ecolabel. A total of 87 products/series now have Möbelfakta labelling. This is an increase of ten for comparable and continuing operations. The number of products approved under the Nordic Swan Ecolabel is 22. REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Design for long product lifetime and to reduce energy consumption, increase the proportion of renewable raw materials, increase the proportion of recycled materials and design products for greater recycling and interchangeability are central aspects of the companies’ development work. Since 2016, Fora Form has reported the climate footprint for much of its collection, with a total of 43 declarations currently available. Ragnars Inredningar has decided to invest in a heat pump facility that will reduce electricity consumption. This will be brought online in the spring of 2019, when a photovoltaic cell facility will also be completed. By 2020, Lammhults Möbel targets all furniture assembly being achieved with screw joints, thereby allowing the use of glue in assembly to cease. This step provides conditions for a circular economy. In the past three years, CO2 emissions from heating and electricity have been cut by 26 percent for comparable units. Further significant reductions will also occur in 2019, with Ragnars having introduced ecolabelled electricity and investing in a heat pump facility and photovoltaic cells. LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP AB | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | 3 Stakeholder dialogue and materiality analysis The most important stakeholder groups are found within and surrounding our value chains. Our primary identification of stakeholders is based on this view. They are shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and partners, as well as society in the form of authorities, the educational system, the media and the local communities in which we operate. For the environmental aspects, the national environmental objectives adopted by Sweden’s Riksdag (parliament) and the Global Sustainability goals are also regarded as stakeholders.

A large part of the external purchases involves unique components for specific products. In several cases, tool-specific production explains the low degree of labour intensity, enabling local production. For the Group as a whole, local suppliers (national) account for 65 percent of the purchasing value in 2018. Of the Group’s external purchases of materials and components, suppliers in the Nordic countries accounted for 57 percent, other Western European countries for 22 percent, Eastern European countries for 19 percent, while purchasing from Asia (China) accounted for 2 percent. The Group has suppliers in a total of 29 countries. Of these, three countries are ranked as risk countries in Amfori BSCI’s list of risk countries as of January 2019. These are China, Turkey and Romania. These three supplier countries account for 4 percent of direct external materials. During the year, factory inspections were performed at supplier facilities in China. This work forms part of the follow-up programme included in the working method regarding social and environmental responsibility.

Lammhults LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP AB | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | 1 5 About the report This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with GRI Standards (core level). Lammhults Design Group reports annually on its sustainability work, simultaneously with the production of the Annual Report for the preceding calendar year. Reading references appear in the appendix (see the GRIContent Index tab) to this report by means of a GRI cross-reference table. Parts of the information can be found in the Annual Report and reference is made to this where appropriate. Financial and social indicators encompass the entire Group. For environmental aspects, all production and distribution units are included. The sales companies have only a marginal impact on the environmental indicators. The environmental impact of subcontractors’ factories is not covered by the report. The Sustainability Report at hand has not been subject to external review. Morgana AB conducts operations subject to a duty of notification under the Swedish Environmental Code, the Ordinance concerning environmentally hazardous activities and the protection of public health (1998:899). Environmental impact primarily constitutes emissions of solvents from the coating process. A transition to UV-cured coatings has reduced solvent emissions. None of the Group’s other companies is engaged in operations that in themselves may be classified as particularly hazardous to the environment, and as a result no duty of licensing or notification under the Swedish Environmental Code applies. Please refer to Sven Lindberg, Purchase and Sustainability Manager, with any questions. His contact details are available on the Lammhults Design Group website.
