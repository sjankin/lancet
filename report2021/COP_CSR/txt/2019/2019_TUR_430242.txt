In order to create a culture related to innovation, included among the strategic targets of the firm which has begun to point its activities in this direction, an Innovation and Creativity working group was set up, in which a representative from every department at Yeşim takes part. Together with this group, in which every department has the chance to be represented, another important undertaking in the field of innovation and creativity was initiated by the signing of a cooperation protocol for innovation with the Bursa Governorship’s EU Project and External Affairs Coordination Center. In this way, an important collaboration in the name of public-private sector association was realized. REACHING OUT TO THE FUTURE WITH R&D Yeşim Textile, which established its R&D department in 1999 and attaches great importance to its research and development work, has put its name to ever more valuable activities, realizing many firsts up to the present in the field of intelligent, organic, recyclable and innovative fabrics. In return for the effective and sustainable activities it has carried out in the field of R&D, the firm possesses, at the point where it is today, an R&D Center certified by the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology. Thanks to this, Yeşim Textile became the 603rd firm in Turkey to have the Ministry-approved R&D Center documentation. The center officially commenced operations in August 2017. Pursuing its project-based activities independently of production with the aim of disseminating an R&D and innovative culture within the firm, the center carries out hundreds of fabric studies in line with the expectations of the customers. In the name of launching value-added and innovative products on global markets and of carrying out effective, sustainable work, 26 staff are on duty in two separate buildings which serve as the Yeşim R&D Center. By combining the innovative R&D efforts conducted at Yeşim in a single area and with a recorded project culture, the aim is to enable the manufacture of high value-added products and thus increase export capacity. Among the other goals of the center are to produce technological knowledge via R&D and innovation, make innovations in products and production processes, increase product quality and standards, increase productivity, reduce production costs, commercialize technological knowledge, develop pre-competitive collaboration, and support and encourage an increase in recruitment of R&D personnel and a qualified work force. Carrying on its activities in line with these targets, the Yeşim Textile R&D Center began project work towards intelligent textiles by developing conductive fabrics through the use of conductive polymers in printing paste in 2018. Besides this project, it is aimed to de201 8 velop functional fabrics REPORT by the application of synthesized PROG RE SS graphene oxide to the TEX TI LE Y EŞİ M 29 fabric surface via nanotechnology production methods. In 2018, the R&D Center applied for one patent. In 2019, too, design registrations and patent applications are planned. The center’s TÜBİTAK project on sustainability, including subject headings such as water, energy, productivity and cost was approved in 2018, and work on this project is still ongoing. Besides this, another sustainability project application was made to TÜBİTAK at the end of 2018, and the application is still at the decision stage. Accordingly, in 2018, 2 applications were made for support from external funds. The center has 5 projects targeted in this field for the future.
