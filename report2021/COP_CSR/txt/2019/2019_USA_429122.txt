Beginning at the end of each calendar year, data is collected and eventually processed into the final report. Last Year’s Sustainability Report was submitted June 2018. With this year’s report, we aimed to become more closely aligned with the GRI process. Internal stakeholders are identified by the major departments influencing the data gathering and results, including Human Resources, Quality, Environmental Services, Health and Safety, Learning and Development as well as the Marketing Department. Discussions with each stakeholder were held to determine materiality aspects and priorities. Samtec will also continue to informally reference RBA standards so that the questions are more closely aligned with RBA concerns. On July 1st of 2018, the G4 guidelines were replaced with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). Our plan for alignment with the revised standards was to engage and inform both primary and secondary stakeholders of the new revisions. This preparation has allowed us to not only align with the changes, but has also allowed us to broaden the scope and depth of our reporting. As we have done in previous reports, many of the indicators will be re-stated to begin the process of creating year-to-year tracking to establish a trend history line for the measured indicators. Also, many indicators and locations are still in the process of coming online, so some, but not all, indicators will show some new data not previously available in the years before. The data presented in this report has been generated by our internal management systems and have not been assured by an external agency.
