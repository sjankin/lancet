This will also enable us to create stronger long-term relationships with customers and give us access to data we can use to refine our offering and develop new solutions. Telia Com9 Annual and Sustainability Report 2018 Our Company Comments from the CEO COMMENTS FROM THE CEO AN EVENTFUL YEAR Telia Company is now basically a Nordic and Baltic company as we have completed the divestment of the operations in Eurasia in all material aspects.

SUSTAINABILITY Telia Company wholeheartedly supports UN’s global goals for sustainable development and the Global Compact principles. It is comforting to see how states, organizations and companies jointly gather to handle problems and spread solutions. Not at least our own industry contributes to enabling sustainable business models and responsible resource utilization. At the same time as we see all the good we contribute to, we should not settle for or disregard our own environmental impact. Telia Company should stop being on the planet's minus account to instead become part of the solution to the climate problem and the environmental impact. Under the current management, sustainability and responsibility have become one of the foundations on which the business rests. The more important our services become for the society to function, the greater responsibility can be required from us. We conduct a business that aims at social and economic value creation which is managed in a responsible and ethical manner. To these benchmarks, we are now making an ambitious and far-reaching effort to reduce our negative environmental impact, with the goal of reducing it to zero over time. In 2019 we will enhance the work that will make us one of the world's most environmentally friendly telecom operators. Finally, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our employees, partners and customers who make our joint journey possible. Thanks also to all 483,000 shareholders for your confidence in the company and for us leading it. Stockholm, March 13, 2019 Johan Dennelind President and CEO Our Company Trends ENABLING DIGITALIZATION Technology, society and businesses are under transformation. Cutting across this transformation is a constantly growing connectivity need. The Nordic and Baltic regions are leading the way globally in digitalization, changing and improving the ways our customers live, work and run their businesses. At the same time, there are societal and environmental challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity that require us to fundamentally rethink the way we become an enabler of digitalization for good. TECHNOLOGY Softwarization Key drivers of change are softwarization – replacing hardware with software – and servicefication – everything as a service. Softwarization creates extreme scale and flexibility advantages which benefits industry leaders in the cloud world, in turn changing the competitive landscape into BUSINESS one, where old operational models and business models are challenged by global ecosystem players. AI and automation TECHNOLOGY Artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT) combined enable rapid growth of intelligent automation. This creates new demands on customer privacy and ethics in data management. Augmented and virtual reality SOCIETY The rise of amplified experiences through augmented and virtual realities, and their integration into our daily lives, bring new possibilities for how we sense and explore the world. Augmented and virtual reality are already coming into play beyond the consumer area and enable new ways to collaborate in companies, for example in remote conferencing. 12 Annual and Sustainability Report 2018 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Sustainability Notes Other SOCIETY BUSINESS Always connected The impact of digitalization The digital and physical worlds are converging and distinBusiness models and processes are under rapid transforguishing between the two is becoming less and less meanmation driven in part by IT enablers including IoT.

These ambitions and both quantitative and qualitative goals stretch until 2022 and can be found in this report. The previous ambitions and goals which stretched from 2015 to 2018 have, where relevant, been incorporated in the new ambitions and goals. Going forward we will continuously develop and improve on ways of measuring and reporting on the goals, as well as revise them when needed to match the company’s strategy, operational changes and stakeholder expectations. Changes to sustainability reporting We see continuously growing requirements and expectations mainly from institutional investors on sustainability reporting. We also see new standards and guidelines such as the UN Guiding Principles Reporting Framework and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Principles gather momentum. We believe that applying the requirements of new and already established ESG reporting frameworks pose a challenge in terms of reporting on the most material topics using a format most suitable to stakeholders with whom we engage on ESG topics. For these reasons, we decided to move away from reporting according to the GRI standards and instead adopt a company-specific sustainability reporting framework. During the process of developing the framework we consulted with some of our largest shareholders and the most critical issue raised was ensuring comparability with established frameworks. The reporting framework and Sustainability Notes therefore contain references to several other reporting frameworks. Code of Responsible Business Conduct The Code of Responsible Business Conduct defines the expectations and requirements how to conduct business responsibly and clarifies the importance of, and channels for, speaking up regarding actual or suspected unethical behavior or violation of laws or the company’s guiding documents. Read more in Corporate Governance, section Group-wide governance framework. The Code was launched in 2016 together with a mandatory e-learning course for all employees and subsequent new employees. The e-learning course focuses on the purpose of the Code, what is expected of employees and those working for Telia Company, as well as speaking up. In late 2018, a new e-learning course was launched in four core markets, with roll-out planned for the remaining core markets in early 2019. The new course provides in-depth practical guidance on how to apply the requirements of the various areas of the Code through set of realistic scenarios, with guidance on how to resolve them.

The policy and related instructions include safety measures and requirements for our employees, contractors and subcontractors regardless of work environment. OHSAS 18001 certification During the year, Telia Sweden implemented OHSAS 18001. At year-end, local companies (except Telia Sweden) in core markets as well as Moldcell in Moldova were certified according to OHSAS 18001. In the coming years, we will transition to the new ISO 45001 management system. Measuring health and well-being In 2018, a new health and well-being index was created in the employee engagement survey, Purple Voice. The additional questions focus on work conditions and recovery, work demands and work environment. The index score was 77 percent, which served as baseline for setting the 2022 goal of 80 percent. The scores were positive overall, with most areas scoring around ten percentage points better than the comparable external benchmark. Local health and well-being coordinators will support team leaders to identify and implement improvement actions, particularly related to recovery between periods of high workload. Focus on sickness absence We continued to see the consistently highest sickness absence rates in customer support functions including call centers. Local health and well-being coordinators continued to work with these teams by supporting the team leaders with better visibility on data and focusing on the physical work environment. In early 2018, we implemented a new employee management system that provide team leaders with instant updated statistics for tracking sickness absence. 58 Annual and Sustainability Report 2018 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Sustainability Notes Other HUMAN RIGHTS HIGHLIGHT Our responsibility and approach Telia Company recognizes its responsibility and is committed to respecting and supporting human rights throughout HUMAN RIGHTS AS PART OF its operations.

SDGs and human rights The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a lens for us to put our human rights risks, opportunities and work into context. Risks and opportunities include: RISKS OPPORTUNITIES SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth – poor SDG 5: Gender equality – our work to create gender working conditions in the supply chain balance and eliminate unconscious bias against girls and women as technology professionals SDG 12: Responsible production and consumption – the social and environmental life cycle impact of SDG 13: Climate action – mitigating climate change consumer electronics, particularly in production and by reducing our climate impact and helping customers waste management reduce theirs SDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions – violaSDG 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions – enation of the right to privacy and freedom of expression bling basic internet access through surveillance SDG 17: Partnerships for the goals – communicating on our work, and encouraging industry peers and other companies, to support and promote children’s rights Both risks and opportunities are generally managed Human rights impact assessments through the work within the Responsible business focus We undertake human rights due diligence and more areas.

While each focus area has a human rights element, some have larger impacts or risks. Below is a summary of the key human rights topics, the most salient issues and our response and stakeholder engagements within these focus areas. The topics, issues, responses and stakeholder collaboration did not change significantly during the year. Other or new human rights issues discussed and escalated to senior management and the Board during the year not specifically covered by the Responsible business focus areas included diversity and inclusion, non-discrimination and artificial intelligence (AI). All focus areas are considered relevant for each of Telia Company’s markets. The external context accentuates certain issues in certain regions, e.g. anti-corruption and surveillance issues in markets where public indices show a high degree of corruption and a low degree of freedom of expression. Key topics and salient issues need to be managed also in relevant stages of the acquisition or divestment of companies.

Potential impact Success in business transformation and growth will depend on a variety of factors beyond Telia Company’s control: the cost of acquiring, renewing or maintaining telecom licenses and spectrum permits, the cost of new technology, availability of new and attractive services, the costs associated with providing these services, the timing of their introduction, the market demand and prices for such services, and competition. Failing to harvest synergies from acquisitions and reach the targets set for business transformation, customer attraction and future growth may negatively impact the results of operations. 63 Annual and Sustainability Report 2018 Directors’ report Risks and uncertainties Strategic and emerging risks Risk Description Mitigating activities Emerging In September 2015, Telia Company announced its decision to • A decision has been made to dispose markets reduce the presence in, and over time leave, region Eurasia our operations in Eurasia.

There may be unexpected or unpredictable litigation cases under civil or tax legislation. Foreign exchange restrictions or administrative issues may effectively prevent Telia Company from repatriating cash, e.g. by receiving dividends and repayment of loans, or from selling its investments. Another risk is the potential establishment of foreign ownership restrictions or other formal or informal possible actions against entities with foreign ownership. Such negative developments or weakening of the local economies or currencies may have a negative effect on Telia Company’s results of operations. Turkey experienced significant financial turbulence with material decreased value of the Turkish lira as a consequence. The nature of these markets with uncertainties and complexity may affect the sales process regarding both expected outcome and timing. The sanctions against the Russian Federation may negatively affect the Russian ruble and the Russian economy, which in turn may impact countries whose economies are closely linked to the Russian economy, such as a number of region Eurasia countries. 64 Annual and Sustainability Report 2018 Our Company Directors’ Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Sustainability Notes Other Financial risks Risk Description Mitigating activities Associated Telia Company conducts some of its activities through as• Monitoring of the associated compacompanies sociated companies, the major one being Turkcell in Turkey, in nies’ performance and joint which Telia Company does not have full ownership or control• Active board work in our associated operations ling interest and are due to that not in full control but still have companies, driving issues of key significant influence over the conduct of these businesses. importance to Telia Company Telia Company also has holdings in LMT and Lattelecom, the • Continuous work to solve the deadleading Latvian mobile and fixed operators.
