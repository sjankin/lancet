Human Rights Principles and Company Policies Infiniti Research Limited believes that all employees have the right to individual freedom of expression and opinion. This is upheld by regular meetings between management and employee groups and bi-monthly office meetings. In common with most businesses we have a set of policies which builds on our business principles, establishing a clear framework to help our employees, business partners and stakeholders understand the standards we expect: • equal opportunities & diversityelimination of discrimination • health & safety • whistle-blowing 4.1 Equal Opportunities & Diversity Policy Infiniti Research Limited is committed to ensuring that all members of staff are treated fairly and are valued irrespective of disability, race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, nationality, religion, employment status, age or membership or non-membership of a Work Union. This means that no one is to receive less favorable treatment on any of the above grounds or is to be disadvantaged by requirements or conditions which cannot be shown objectively to be justifiable. In the event that an employee becomes disabled during their period of employment we will seek to retain their services wherever possible. Each Region's Board will be responsible for ensuring both the implementation of this policy and compliance with relevant local legislation. Implementation: Every member of staff at Infiniti Research Group has a personal responsibility to: • treat people fairly and without prejudice; • value and respect others; • ensure that no one is harassed, victimized or bullied in the workplace; • promote a work environment where everyone feels confident to report incidents that are unfair or personally offensive; • seek to develop their own skills and encourage others. Goals: We want to ensure that Infiniti Research always remains a company where people are given the best possible opportunities to make a success of their lives, whatever their backgrounds are. Everybody has a valuable contribution to make; our challenge is to unlock the talents and potential of all our staff. We celebrate diversity and tolerance so that different cultures can thrive, adding to the richness and experience of our company. Measurement of Outcomes: • In hiring new employees, we have ensured that these principles are adhered to at all times. 3 4.2 Health & Safety Policy Our Company Values make clear our priority and commitment. Nothing is more important at Infiniti Research than the health and safety of our customers, our staff, and any others affected by our operations. Our staff should expect to go home at the end of the day, unhurt. Infiniti Research Limited supports managers in the discharge of their health and safety responsibilities to: • Provide adequate control of the health and safety risks arising from our work activities • Provide and maintain safe equipment • Provide effective communications across our operations • Ensure all employees are competent to do their tasks, and to give them adequate training • Measure performance in the management of health and safety • Maintain safe and healthy working conditions • Provide resources to ensure we deliver against our responsibilities • Commission audits to provide assurance that adequate systems are in place and effective • Review and revise this policy as necessary at regular intervals These will be delivered through long standing arrangements where we will continue to develop and enhance these arrangements as we strive, relentlessly, to reduce and, where possible, eliminate health and safety risks. Implementation: Staff and subcontractors are given necessary health and safety induction and provided with appropriate training. Escape routes are well signed and kept clear at all times. Evacuation plans are tested from time to time and updated as necessary. First-aid box and accident book are always easily accessible. Goals: • The continuing development of an ongoing safety consciousness among all members of the company • A further reduction in occupational injuries and illnesses, and the associated loss of productivity Measurement of Outcomes: • By repeatedly practicing fire drills/evacuations, we have continued to ensure that in the instance of any actual incident, our employees will be completely familiar with best practices. 4.3 Whistle-blowing Policy We and our subsidiary companies are committed to the highest standards of quality, honesty, integrity, openness and accountability. Whistle-blowing means deciding to tell somebody official about something that is going on, or you believe is going on, within a company which is illegal or criminal, or that endangers people or the environment, or is against the rules that apply to the business. This may include: • Actions which endanger the health or safety of employees or the public; • Criminal offences; • Failure to comply with legal obligations; • Harassment and victimization; • Financial fraud or mismanagement; • Bribery; • Breach of any of our internal policies or procedures; 4 • Unauthorized disclosure of confidential information; • Actions likely to damage our reputation; • Actions which cause damage to the environment; and • Actions which are intended to conceal any of the above. We hope that in many cases, people will be able to raise any concerns with management. However, sometimes people feel they can't speak openly and honestly to their managers or are concerned about the consequences if they speak up or that their concerns will not be taken seriously. Infiniti Research Limited does not believe that it is in anyone's interest for people with knowledge of wrongdoing to remain silent. Implementation: We do not take these matters lightly, and we will take the lead in investigating all genuine complaints thoroughly. We will work together with the appropriate people to find an answer to the problem. Goals: We aim to continue to encourage openness and will always support people who raise any genuine concerns under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. People who raise a genuine concern under this policy will not be at risk of losing their job or suffering any form of retribution or harassment as a result. This policy does not, however, extend to anyone who maliciously raises a concern that they know is untrue. Measurement of Outcomes: • Having a clear whistle-blowing process in place continues to help our employees to feel comfortable that there is a clear mechanism for genuine issues that arise. Ensuring that all our employees are fully aware of our principles helps them be aware in case their intervention should ever be needed. Employees are encouraged to raise their concerns in any instance. 5. Labour Infiniti Research Limited respects the dignity of all its employees and recognizes fundamental principles of human rights as identified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Infiniti Research will uphold fundamental human rights in everything we do. Infiniti Research is committed to taking steps to identify and prevent interference with fundamental rights and provide for the respectful exercise of those rights by all persons, consistent with the safe, effective and efficient performance of their work. Infiniti Research further recognizes that the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, and that certain fundamental human rights also extend to the workplace. Infiniti Research recognizes that the challenge of maintaining these standards are unique in different parts of the world and create challenges for business in applying these principles, while giving due respect to local culture, laws, and norms. Consequently, in applying this Policy, Infiniti Research shall give due regard to the law of the land where the policy is applied. Infiniti Research recognizes that Child Labor or any form of Compulsory or Bonded Labor would be in absolute contravention to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The situation is continuously monitored to ensure both are entirely absent from our Company, and we require the same for all customers and suppliers. Infiniti Research also recognizes that many persons and groups have differing views on human, civil, and political rights that extend beyond the fundamental principles expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Infiniti Research welcomes the discussion and debate on these issues but does not believe that it is appropriate to attempt to impose our views on others. Infiniti Research does believe, however, that we can, and do, influence others through leading by example, and recognizes that it cannot be the arbiter of these differing views. Infiniti Research also recognizes that fundamental rights are not subject to negotiation or compromise. Infiniti Research will consider policies or practices that go beyond such fundamental rights, but in doing so, Infiniti Research will be 5 mindful of its obligations to its customers, and its duty to avoid adopting standards that so significantly exceed local requirements that doing so would place Infiniti Research at an economic disadvantage to its competitors. Consistent with the foregoing, all persons employed by Infiniti Research, shall be extended the following workplace rights, without distinction of any kind, such as race, color, sex, sexual orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status. Workplace Rights: 1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions. No one may be compelled to belong to an association, either directly or indirectly through the compulsory financial support of such association. 2. Infiniti Research and all its subsidiaries ensure that minimum wage standards are complied with in each location. 3. Employment related decisions must always be based on relevant and objective criteria. 4. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, either orally or in writing, or through any other media of their choice, and the freedom to hold opinions without interference. 5. The right to vote in secret is absolute and should not be restricted in any manner. When consistent with local law, everyone shall have the right to vote for representatives in genuine elections which shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors. 6. Everyone shall have the right to obtain or impart information necessary to make an informed choice, a necessary corollary to the rights of freedom of association and secret ballot elections for representatives. Where necessary, Infiniti Research will ensure that (1) employees have the information necessary to make a fully informed choice on the important issue of representation and (2) that no party will unlawfully prevent the dissemination or expression of any views on representation. 7. Everyone shall have the right to protection against interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence, or attacks on their reputation, and no one shall be subjected to such interference or attack. 8. Everyone shall have the right to their property. No one shall be deprived of their property, or the right to exercise control of their property, whether real, tangible, or intangible. Responsibilities: The exercise of the rights provided for in this Policy carries with it special duties and responsibilities by those claiming such rights for themselves or on behalf of others. Therefore, the exercise of these rights may therefore be subject to the following parameters: 1. Recognizing that the workplace is for work, these rights must be exercised in a manner that does not interfere with the safe and efficient performance of work by those persons on working time. 2. Such responsibilities as are necessary for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others. 3. Such responsibilities as are necessary to prevent conduct or statements the primary purpose of which is to damage the reputations of others. Infiniti Research will not tolerate conduct by any person or organization that seeks to intimidate, harass, or coerce employees in the exercise of these rights. Implementation: Constant dialogue with the employees is deemed the best way of securing a good working environment and preventing stress. The management therefore has a responsibility of monitoring the employees’ wellbeing, both on a regular basis and through the yearly “Performance and Development review” 6 Goals: • To provide a basis for embedding the responsibility to respect and support human rights through all business functions • To continue to identify policy gaps through our process which alerts the company to new areas of human rights risk • To foster the continuing development of in-house learning, management capacity and leadership on human rights issues. Measurement of Outcomes: • Last year, through discussions with our employees, we were able to identify an area for improvement. The wellbeing of our employees has improved considerably through having the option to partake in company yoga classes over the past two yearswith stress levels noticeably decreased, and a positive working environment attained. 6. Environmental Principles The environmental impact of this small business association and our scope for reducing the carbon footprint is smaller in scale than in many other industries. Even so, we find that this is no excuse not to make an effort. We have therefore adopted a green purchasing policy, in which environmental considerations are essential. Implementation: • In order to reduce paper use, E-mails are widely used to share documents and ideas. • Invoices and quotes are sent electronically in every instance possible. Documents are signed electronically in every instance possible. • We encourage our customers to accept online invoices, and actively use any client online billing portals available. • We are continuously making efforts to reduce paper use, by using double sided printing, where printing is required. • With regards to lighting, we chose low-energy solutions wherever possible, buying energy efficient light bulbs and purchasing electricity which primarily derives from wind power. We have furthermore installed videoconferencing facilities in order to reduce CO2 emissions from travelling. Goals: Our goal is to seek further opportunities to reduce our consumption of natural resources by using alternatives where possible, and by optimizing efficiency of use, whilst protecting and enhancing the environment. In meantime, we will continue to find areas where we can reduce our CO2 emissions Measurement of Outcomes: • Over the past two years, we have observed a reasonable decrease in the amount of paper used since opting for electronic signature of documents, instead of ‘wet ink’ signatures. We are confident that we will be able to further decrease the amount this year. • We have managed to keep our CO2 emissions from travel low, through teleconferencing and videoconferencing with our international clients. 7 7. Anti-Corruption Principles It is Infiniti Research Limited’s policy to conduct our business in an honest and ethical manner. We take a zerotolerance approach to bribery and corruption and are committed to acting professionally, fairly and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships wherever we operate and implementing and enforcing effective systems to counter bribery. We constantly strive to uphold the highest professional standards, and rigorously maintain our independence. Specifically, in relation to anti-bribery and corruption, the Company Code of Conduct commits all Infiniti Research Limited professionals to: • Act lawfully, ethically and in the public interest; • Prohibit bribery and corruption by Infiniti Research Limited agents; • Not tolerate illegal or unethical behavior by clients, suppliers or by public officials; and • Follow high standards of ethical conduct around the world, including aspiring to the ten principles of the UN Global Compact (including anti-bribery). These commitments reflect Infiniti Research Limited’s International position as a signatory of the UN Global Compact. We will uphold all laws relevant to countering bribery and corruption in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. We remain bound by the laws of the UK, including the Bribery Act 2010, in respect of our conduct both at home and abroad. This policy applies to all individuals working at all levels, including partners, consultants, employees (whether permanent, fixed-term or temporary), contractors, trainees, seconded staff, homeworkers, casual workers and agency staff, volunteers, or any other person associated with us, wherever located (collectively referred to as workers in this policy). Goals: Bribery and corruption undermine the foundation of any company where it is present, and damages social and economic development. That’s why we are committed to ensuring that we continue to pride ourselves on our reputation for acting fairly and ethically wherever we do business. Our reputation is built on our company values, the behavior of our employees and on our collective commitment to acting with transparency throughout our organization. The main 2018-2019 goal for the Company is to continue to provide education for all level of employees up to management about corruption, as well as what to do if one should encounter it. It is our mission to create a transparent and open working environment in which people feel able to speak freely and challenge behavior at every level, but where they can also discuss issues in confidence, where necessary. Measurement of Outcomes: • Again, we are pleased to report that we have maintained a transparent working environment, and that bribery and corruption are never tolerated in the work that we do. • We have found that by educating our employees on this topicthey are empowered to detect corrupt or unethical practicesthus enabling us to avoid any such engagements. 8 8. Future Principles Our Ethics & Compliance programs will continue to evolve with our company’s growth strategy. Looking ahead, we will continue to work to ensure that each of our Ethics & Compliance programs is relevant to our business, is aligned with Infiniti Research’s strategic vision and provides our employees with practical tools and resources, as well as clear communications and awareness programs, to enable compliance around the world. Going forward, we will continue to maintain zero tolerance for corruption and to work against it in all its forms. 9
