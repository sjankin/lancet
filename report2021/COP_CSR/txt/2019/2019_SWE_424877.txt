In 2018, we intend to raise the general awareness among all employees by making use of the various internal forums and venues at our disposal. Our ambition and goal for the year is to maintain our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Human Rights intact. Principle 3, 4, 5 and 6 – Labour  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining (P3)  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour (P4);  The effective abolition of child labour (P5);  and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (P6). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to the strict laws (of Sweden and UK) pertaining to the freedom of association and labour practices, and actively and continuously works to promote equality at the workplace. Our goal for 2018 is to maintain our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Labour intact and to achieve a gender balance of 40/60 to 60/40 among new employees. Principle 7, 8 and 9 – Environment  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges (P7).  Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility (P8)  and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies (P9). 4C Strategies will continue its progressive work (recycling, cyber meetings, minimizing waste, promoting public transportation, bicycling, etc.) in this area. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 2019-01-07 COP 2018 4(4) Principle 10 – Anti-corruption  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery (P10). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to Swedish and UK legislation regarding corruption. In 2018, the aim is simply to stay the course and not to encounter a single case of doubtful nature. Measurement of outcomes Human Rights During 2018, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Human Rights has been received. Labour During the year, 23 new employees were hired of which 8 or 35% were women. This is not quite up to our goal (40%) and can to a large extent be explained by the fact that it is very difficult to find as many women in the field of IT as men. During 2018, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Labour has been received. Environment In 2018, we continued to:  use 100 % fossil free electricity and a supplier that contributes part of their annual profit to charities (GodEl).  use environmentally friendly choice of rental cars.  recycle all plastics, paper, metal and cardboard at the office. Anti-corruption This topic has pro-actively been discussed at various internal forums in order to maintain a vigilant and risk-aware culture. During 2018, no complaint or legal issue related to Corruption has been received or raised, internally or externally. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62
