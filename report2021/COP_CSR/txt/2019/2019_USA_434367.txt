At Shaw, it means keenly focusing on the ingredients that go into products as well as the impacts of sound, moisture and other design considerations because we know the spaces where we learn, create and come together to solve our greatest challenges impact our wellbeing. We’re addressing environmental health and human experience at the same time. Putting people at the heart of our sustainability efforts. 2 3 Dear Stakeholders, Shaw Industries has grown globally from our founding in north Georgia more than half a century ago. We have built on our legacy in carpet to include floorcoverings for every possible place and space. Generations of associates have invented, innovated and designed products for evolving preferences and needs. The world in which we operate today is unrecognizable from the one in which we were established. But one thing has never changed: our unwavering commitment to integrity. Our approach to our work is rigorous. We are serious about accountability. We are focused on the long-term, and we pursue both innovation and continuous improvement. Built on integrity and powered by innovation. Our products are carefully scrutinized and optimized for the human experience whether that’s in your homes, classrooms, offices, playrooms or playing fields. We understand that we must work every day to help you fulfill our customers’ design vision and everyday performance needs. We know that we have the humbling opportunity to be the foundation of the places where people raise their families and pursue their ambitions. To be a successful company in the 21st century, we not only have to accept change—we have to drive it. Doing so requires constantly striving to better understand our customers and their preferences and pain points, improving our products and operations, and investing in people and processes. Over the past five years, Shaw has invested more than $1.5 billion in new and existing facilities in the U.S. alone. In 2018 and the first half of 2019, key investments in our operations included: • Modernizing plants in Andalusia, Ala., Decatur, Tenn., and Chickamauga, Ga. focused on key components of our carpet manufacturing; • Expanding manufacturing and warehouse space at our carpet tile facility in Adairsville, Ga.; • Investing in our logistics and distribution network; • Acquiring STS—a Scotland-based carpet tile manufacturer with further investment to upgrade and expand their capabilities. This continued investment wouldn’t be possible without our talented, passionate associates. We proudly invest in their success and reward their innovation. We’re honored to have been recognized by Forbes and Ethical Corporation in the past year for our focus on diversity and inclusion. Our education and training programs continue to receive accolades and help us rank among elite businesses as an employer of choice. Our product innovation and sustainability achievements have been recognized by our customers and formally at The Edison Awards. We are grateful for the opportunity to create a better future—together—by putting people first. Sincerely, Vance D. Bell Vance D.

The world around us shapes who we are. The spaces where we learn, create and come together to solve our greatest challenges have a significant impact on our wellbeing. Starting with the human element. Our products are often at the center of those spaces. Underfoot in offices around the world. In classrooms where students learn about our shared history and plan for a remarkable future. On amateur and professional sports fields where friendships are forged and champions are created. In homes where countless memories are made. Sometimes our products are intentionally in the background; other times they are the star of the show. In either scenario, our customers can count on Shaw to innovate and to drive change—in performance, design and sustainability (in the myriad ways it can be defined). We’re committed to leading by example, by staying true to who we’ve always been: A company founded on putting people first. A business built on integrity and powered by innovation. We perpetually take the next step forward, across every element of our sustainability strategy. Starting with the human element. It’s why we’re focused on the ingredients that go into products and the impacts of sound, moisture and other design elements so we can create a better future. We believe in a future comprised of spaces and places that support the wellbeing of people and the planet. It’s why we’re deeply entrenched in the communities where we operate through civic engagement, volunteerism, education and job creation. It’s why we’re dedicated to creating rewarding career opportunities for our associates and providing countless opportunities to learn and grow. It’s all instrumental to our shared quest to sustain HUMAN ability. We look forward to sharing more about our approach and our progress through this report. Susan Farris Vice President of Sustainability Susan Farris, Vice President of Sustainability 12 13 SUSTAINABLE SPACES PLACES PEOPLE PLANET The spaces where we learn, create and come together to solve our greatest challenges have a significant impact on our wellbeing. That is why we’re focused on the ingredients that go into products and the impacts of sound, moisture, occupant comfort and other design elements. Our goal is to create a better future—a future comprised of spaces and places that support the wellbeing of people and the planet. Spaces and places that support people and the planet. 14 15 PRODUCT HUMAN IMPACT On average, people spend approximately 90% of their time indoors. With this being the reality for so many of us, it’s no surprise that the definition of sustainability has broadened beyond traditional operational measures (such as energy, water and recycled content), and even social and philanthropic impacts, to an increased interest in material health and how commercial and residential spaces impact people. There are a number of factors pointing to and driving this market shift. and consumer products are now common topics within the built Sustainable building programs and design standards are evolving environment sector. to embrace and consider factors such as material health and noise With greater access to information, consumers are increasingly alongside other building performance metrics. At the same time, curious about what ingredients are going into their homes, new standards have emerged such as the WELL Building Standard, workplaces and schools. It’s a journey we’ve been on for decades, with a stated mission to improve human health and wellbeing in but the market is ever-evolving; new information emerges daily; buildings and communities throughout the world.

Discussions about chemicals of concern that were previously limited to technical conferences or solely focused on food, cosmetics 16 17 MATERIAL HEALTH PRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS AND DISCLOSURE KNOWING OUR PRODUCTS We aim to know as much about our products as possible—what goes into them (ingredients) and thus what might come out of them. That begins with raw material choices. We educate and train our technical development groups to use an enterprisewide raw material approval process, and our sourcing groups ensure purchase orders are not issued without completing this review process. We use the Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Products Program material health assessment methodology to characterize the hazards of chemicals present in a product and to assess any relevant routes of exposure to hazardous chemicals during the intended use and endof-use phases of a product’s lifecycle. Chemical composition data for materials is required down to the 100 ppm level (0.01%) to generate full assessment ratings. This program’s material health rating system was developed to identify the continuum of risk—from those chemicals that pose the greatest hazard to those that pose little to no hazard. Almost 90 percent of the products we manufacture are Cradle to Cradle Certified, and we follow this internal evaluation process as well as hazard screening and risk assessment ® for all new raw materials, regardless of whether the final product is pursuing or already certified to the Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program standard. SEEKING THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION Shaw values third-party verification and validation of our sustainability efforts both as a way to simply communicate a product’s sustainability attributes and to avoid the skepticism that often comes with unvalidated, self disclosed information. Cradle to SM Cradle certification—with its focus not only on safe ingredients, but also the effective use of raw materials and energy and water resources, and labor and community practices in the supply chain—is key to our approach to creating sustainable products. Importantly, it also resolves the tension between the desire to know more about what is in our products and the need to protect intellectual property. Everyone should have access We also ensure our products meet indoor air quality performance for VOC (Volatile organic compounds) emissions using Green Label Plus, FloorScore and GREENGUARD certification programs. to sustainable products for In addition to these third-party certifications, we also provide product ingredient and disclosure information via Health Product Declarations (HPDs) and Declare labels, to be their homes and workspaces. responsive to marketplace expectations for manufacturers to be more transparent about the footprint of their manufacturing processes and the materials used.

Too much noise can lead to stress, fatigue, lack of focus, anxiety and lengthy healing times. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can raise our blood pressure, accelerate breathing, cause irritability and anxiety. It can affect our quality of sleep. It can increase our sensitivity to pain, as well as impair our comprehension, memory and reading ability. IMPACT ON BUSINESS From student apartments and hotels to offices and hospitals, sound can positively or negatively impact how people experience a building. According to a survey of multifamily property managers, noise is the third most frequent complaint made by residents. And these complaints aren’t just idle chatter: 20 percent MAKING A SOUND CHOICE of residents say they would move if there were noisy or annoying neighbors.

Recognizing this gap in the marketplace, we’ve conducted extensive testing to provide an estimated IIC rating based on specific floor and ceiling construction, paired with particular flooring types and installation methods where underlayment is and isn’t used. This testing These are the constant sounds of our everyday lives, and research shows that sound produced not only an IIC number but a sound file that allows you to hear the difference.
