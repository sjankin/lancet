Therefore, socio-environmental sustainability cannot be separated from our business strategy, for it is our very business. We publicly commit to sustainability through the goals that we set and periodically disseminate. In 2013, we committed to achieving eight global goals by December 2017. We have successfully completed this cycle. For the new cycle, to take place between 2018 and 2025, our goals will be based on five pillars: Water Management, Sustainable Agriculture, Climate Change, Circular Packaging and Entrepreneurship. To them we added a sixth pillar, Intelligent Consumption. The goals were announced in the wake of the launch of the 100+ sustainability platform and are in line with the commitments we made when we joined the UN Global Compact Brazil Network, an initiative that brings together companies willing to work with the international community to manage sustainable businesses. The future we dream of is being built through a joint effort. ingredients and to environmental concerns.

About 160 companies and industries are registered on the platform. Last year, they reduced their water consumption by 18%, on average. The tool also makes it possible for companies to generate custom reports so they can monitor indicators and disseminate the results to their internal audiences, as well as to clients and suppliers, among others. In addition to helping to preserve water, the platform also provides companies with benefits such as lowering production costs, increasing competitiveness, increasing water security in the industry and its supply chain, as well as maintaining jobs.

We believe that only a joint and permanent effort from all walks of society is able to tackle the challenge of creating a culture of responsible use of alcohol in Brazil. The Smart Consumption program, which is based on guidelines set by the World Health Organization, encompasses numerous social initiatives to engage as many people as possible in this cause. We conducted studies in 2018 to understand the reality of university students and build In August 2018, we inaugurated the Center for Innostrategies to encourage a moderated use of alcohol in thevation and Technology, in which we invested R$ 180 se environments.

This is how Brasilia Safe Life came about, a program that, in addition reducing the number of deaths and injuries in traffic accidents, also aims to reduce the harmful use of alcohol by 10% until 2020 through a partnership with the departments of Health and Education – a goal that is aligned with that of the World Health Organization. In two years, Brasilia Safe Life managed to reduce the number of deaths caused by traffic accidents in the Federal District by 28%. In the health front, primary care social workers interview local families alcohol use patterns and intervene to make sure that consumption is always moderate and not harmful to health. In the education front, we work with Federal District public schools so that young people do not consume alcohol and understand the risks and the consequences of this behavior.
