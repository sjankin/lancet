Actions We ensure that our approach is state of the art and that our partners and consultants learn from each other in this area. We engage with highly knowledgeable experts and professionals in the area of good governance and human rights. Measurement of outcomes We monitor through our quarterly board meetings and reporting on the UN Global Compact. Furthermore, the quality of the work that we do is reflected by the assignments of this type entrusted to us.
