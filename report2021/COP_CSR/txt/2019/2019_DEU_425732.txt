We are fully exploiting the potential presented by the digital revolution. And we are extending our reach beyond lighting to enter into fields of application such as visualization, sensors, and treatment. We don’t just want to generate economic added value, we also want to contribute to sustainable development. Our intelligent, energy-efficient products and solutions are helping to combat climate change. Furthermore, our lighting technologies are helping to enhance safety in road traffic and public spaces, protect personal data, and improve wellbeing in the workplace and the home. As part of this process, we are forging ahead with our transformation into a high-tech company focused on photonics. In fiscal year 2018, we strengthened our activities in high-growth fields both organizationally and by way of acquisitions, equity investments and partnerships. The most important investments to mention from a sustainability perspective involved smart farming, human centric lighting, and safety-enhancing sensors in cars. OSRAM CONTINENTAL also commenced operations during the fiscal year. The company is bringing together the latest lighting technologies with electronics and software and helping to make road traffic safer through intelligent lighting solutions. Sustainability means responsibility, which for us includes not only the value that our products add but also the way that we treat our employees, suppliers, and customers. Throughout our value chain, we put the emphasis on careful use of resources, environmental protection, good working conditions, health and safety, and compliance with human rights—both in respect of our own employees and those of our partners.

In the EMEA region, we only record data for transport that is paid for by OSRAM GmbH. Smaller units such as Traxon and Clay Paky are excluded from the reporting, as are the activities of OSRAM CONTINENTAL since the fourth quarter of 2018. Overall, based on an estimate on freight costs, we estimate that despite the aforementioned limitations more than 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our transport activities are included in the calculation. 5) Emissions generated by business travel encompass worldwide flights, rail travel in Germany, and trips made in hire cars and leased vehicles. We obtain the data on European hires from our hire car partners and we make professional estimates for the rest of the world, which for vehicle hire is mainly the U.S.A. OSRAM mostly leases vehicles in Germany. We have the data on the actual greenhouse gas emissions up to and including August 2018. An estimate for vehicles leased outside Germany was added to create a worldwide figure, which we then extrapolated over the fiscal year as a whole using a linear method. 6) OSRAM locations are only included in VOC reporting if they are required by local laws or regulations to register as an emitter of VOCs. ] OSRAM Licht AG – Sustainability Report 2018 34 ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE PROTECTION — Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change Objectives, Action Taken, and Results In fiscal year 2018, OSRAM reported figures for Scope 3 During the reporting period, OSRAM continued to be guided for the first time (a retrospective set of figures for fiscal year Absolute CO2 emissions in metric tons by the EU targets of an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions 2017) and published them as part of the CDP.
