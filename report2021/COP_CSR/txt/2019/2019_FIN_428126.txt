For example, environmental aspects steered the designing of the new vessels deployed by ESL Shipping in the autumn already from the start. Telko re-tendered its logistics operators in Russia in 2018, and the selection criteria included not only cost savings, but also more efficient logistics solutions and lower transport emissions. The actions and choices are supported by the Group’s environmental guidelines and requirements, which apply to all subsidiaries. Their key principle is the continuous improvement of operations. Aspo strives to address critical environmental issues in a way that exceeds the minimum level required by law and regulations. To address environmental aspects in supply chains, Aspo has prepared a Supplier Code of Conduct for its goods and service providers. Reputation as a responsible company that takes into account environmental impacts is an important competitive factor for Aspo, because its customers and other stakeholders place value on environmental issues. If realized, environmental risks could cause significant financial losses or tarnish Aspo’s reputation. The Group has identified, for example, the following as significant environmental risks: environmental damage resulting from Aspo’s own operations and, in particular, the handling of fuel in the shipping business and the practices of its partners, for example, in the transport and storage of chemicals. Changing regulations, such as stricter environmental laws, changes to energy policies and the development of fuel taxation, can also have a significant impact on operating conditions and costs. Aspo actively monitors the regulatory situation and aims to develop its THE LOWEST-EMISSION The designing of the new vessels started five years ago. Both vessels use modern technologies, the most essential DRY BULK CARRIERS of which is the use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the main IN THE WORLD engine, three auxiliary engines and the heating boiler.

ASPO | YEAR 2018 Responsibility Report 7 The volume of energy, excluding fuels, purchased by ESL Shipping, Telko, Kauko and other operations decreased clearly. The volume of energy purchased and reported by Leipurin increased in 2018 due to a new, more comprehensive energy reporting method in many of its operating countries. Altogether, Aspo Group’s purchased energy, excluding fuels, totaled 5,707 (5,033) MWh in 2018. The growth of ESL Shipping’s fleet through the acquisition and new vessels resulted in a significant increase in Aspo’s bilities. For example, Kauko’s mobile knowluse these new products.

Another common cause for food waste is the delivery of incorrect products, whether due to miscalculation by the customer or an error made when inputting the order or during order picking in the warehouse. Reducing food waste is one of Leipurin’s key goals, and the progress is monitored on a monthly basis. In 2018, food waste decreased by roughly 10% by improving the inventory turnover ratio by seven days, elaborating the handling instructions and improving monitoring processes. In 2019, the purchasing, sales and logistics units aim to reduce food waste at least by 25% and improve waste recovery by increasing the share of waste used in livestock feeding and recycling. 8 Responsibility Report SOCIAL vey to assess its employees’ satisfaction with their jobs, the quality of leadership and RESPONSIBILITY management and Aspo as an employer.

In China, for example, Telko’s purchasing officer audits the activities of Telko’s suppliers. Human rights play a key part in all Telko’s partnerships. Subcontractors are required to comply with international human rights laws and treat all employees equally and with respect. Telko also pursues a zero tolerance policy towards the use of child labor and all forms of forced labor. A good indicator of the open interaction is that clients also expect Telko to comply with their Codes of Conduct and audit Telko’s operations.

LTIF-rate includes only Finnish personnel and marine personnel of vessels owned by AtoB@C. The LTIF-rate is significantly affected by even small changes in the number of incidents: one incident more or less during the reporting year, in comparison to the baseline year, will have a major impact on the LTIF-rate. Particularly for the smaller businesses the fluctuation of the LTIF-rate can partially be explained by the small number of employees. 2 Sick-leave absence ratio is calculated: (sick days/total work days)*100. Sick-leave absence ratio of ESL marine personnel (excluding AtoB@C shipping marine personnel) is calculated: (total sick days in the fleet/total days worked onboard)*100. 3 Information on sick leave is not available for ESL Shipping Marine personnel for the year 2016. 4 AtoB@C Shipping marine personnel reported for Sweden. AtoB@C Shipping marine figures included in reporting from 2018. 5 Information on sick leave is not available for AtoB@C Shipping marine personnel. In 2018, the lost-time injury frequency decreased in all businesses, apart from Telko. Annual variation in the reported LTIF is not significant; it is associated with the calculation method.
