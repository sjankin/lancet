We have included events and data about every one of the company’s countries and operations, unless otherwise specified. The report covers the period between January 1st and December 31st, 2018. This technical report responds to several of the company’s methodologies, indexes, and commitments, such as the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the Sustainability Index of the Mexican Stock Exchange, FTSE4Good, and MSCI. The report has been prepared employing the <IR> Framework and in accordance with the GRI Standards, Core option. Our great interest in establishing a constructive dialogue with the people around us responds to the fact that we are convinced that the synergy between the private sector, communities, and the authorities will be the main driver behind sustainable development. This document constitutes our main communication tool on our annual performance, and its goal is to invite our stakeholders to establish a dialogue with us. We appreciate any comments you wish to share with us.

Our goal is to show how our actions contribute to creating a certain degree of economic, social, and/or environmental value for the midand long-term. For example, refurbishing a public space offers clear social benefits, such as lowering local crime and improving the social fabric. However, if we add an urban reforestation and waste management program to this space, we would also generate environmental value. And, finally, if we support the development of the local economy by offering training and support to retailers in the area, we would also generate economic value. The following diagram shows the way in which, with some of our projects, we can have a positive effect on the generation of these three values simultaneously with different magnitudes.

As part of our continuous improvement process, we strive for our daily operations to not be limited by a specific timeframe. The Sustainability and risk management action plans, as many others, are completely embedded in the company’s general strategy in order to assure our stakeholders that Arca Continental will continue its operation tomorrow, and that it will do so even better than it does today. The structure of this Integrated Report reflects our generation of social, environmental, and economic value. However, we have not structured this information as sections or chapters within the report because each program makes a contribution, to a different extent, by generating value in all three aspects. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Integrated Report 3 COMPANY OPERATIONS [102-2] COMPLEMENTARY BEVERAGES BUSINESSES OTHERS SNACKS AND * * SWEETS * * * * * * *Associate Company Peru United States 10% Ecuador REVENUES 35% 7% Argentina MXN 159 billion 5% 5% Snacks & Other Businesses Mexico 38% 4 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE [102-16] VISION MISSION To be leaders in beverages and To generate maximum value for our snack food consumption for every customers, associates, communities, occasion in all the markets in and shareholders, satisfying our which we participate, focusing on consumers’ expectations at all times profitability and sustainability. and with excellence. • Customer-centricity and a vocation for service OUR • Integrity based on respect and justice VALUES • Comprehensive human capital development • Sustainability and social responsibility CULTURAL PRINCIPLES In 2018, Arca Continental launched the company’s cultural principles, which are the pillars behind our goals, thus ensuring that we remain loyal to our essence as a socially responsible company.

Arturo Gutiérrez Hernández Emilio Marcos Charur CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 112 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L Report of the Independent Auditors To the General Stockholders’ Meeting of Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V. OPINION We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. and its subsidiaries (Company), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the year then ended, as well as the explanatory notes to the consolidated financial statements, that include a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2018, and its financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Ethics Standards of Mexican Institute of Public Accountants together with other requirements applicable to our audit in Mexico. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those requirements and standards. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Said additional information includes the Annual Report presented to the National Banking and Securities Commission (NBSC) and the Annual Report issued to the stockholders (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our independent auditors’ report thereon), which are to be issued subsequent to the date of this report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the other information not yet received, we will issue the report on the Annual Report as required by the NBSC, and if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and, if required, describe the issue in our report. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 115 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company and subsidiaries to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company and subsidiaries audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those Charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.

A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries (AC or the Company) is mainly engaged in the production, distribution and sale of soft drinks pertaining to the brands owned by or licensed from The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC). AC shares are registered at the National Securities Registry of the National Banking and Securities Commission (NBSC) and are quoted on the Mexican Stock Exchange. According to the bottler’s agreement signed between AC and the bottler authorization granted by TCCC the latter, AC holds the exclusive right to conduct this type of activities with Coca-Cola products in different territories in Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru and as from the second quarter of 2017, in the Southwestern of the United States (US) (see Note 2 below). The Company’s portfolio of beverages includes cola and flavored soft drinks, purified and flavored water, and other carbonated and non-carbonated beverages in sundry presentations (see Note 28). Also, the Company’s portfolio included an own trademark and registered distribution rights to operate in Mexico and the US. On July 22, 2016, the Company sold the trademark and distribution rights to operate in Mexico and on September 30, 2017, it sold the trademark and distribution rights to operate in the US (see Note 29), both to TCCC. Additionally, the Company produces, distributes and sells food and snacks through its brands Bokados, Wise, Deep River brands and other brands used by its subsidiaries Nacional de Alimentos y Helados, S. A. de C. V., Bbox Vending, S. de R. L. de C. V., Industrias Alimenticias Ecuatorianas, S. A. (Inalecsa), Vending del Ecuador, S. A., Wise Foods, Inc. (Wise Foods) and Old Lyme Gourmet, Co. (Deep River); as well as dairy products of high added value under the Industrias Lácteas Toni, S.A. (Toni) brand in Ecuador. AC conducts its activities through subsidiary companies of which it is the owner or of which it controls, either directly or indirectly, most of the common shares representing their capital stock (see Note 30). The term “the Company”, as used in this report, refers to AC and its subsidiaries in the aggregate. As mentioned in Note 2, in 2017, AC transferred to its subsidiary AC Bebidas, S. de R. L. de C. V., (AC Bebidas) its interest in the capital stock of its subsidiary and associated companies, as well as its joint operation, mainly engaged in the soft drinks business, additionally, effective as from October 2018, AC transferred the net assets of its branch in Ecuador to AC Bebidas. These transfers were conducted at the book value of these entities, as shown in AC’s consolidated financial statements and because it is a transaction within the group, it had no impact at the consolidated level. In 2017, upon AC’s transferring its 20.14% interest in AC Bebidas, the effects described in Note 2 were recognized. Moreover, with the transfer of its Ecuador branch’s net assets and liabilities in 2018, AC’s interest in AC Bebidas reached 80%. The merger of AC and Carismed XXI, S. de R. L. de C. V. became effective on January 2, 2017, for which, AC acquired 25% of the interest in its subsidiary Arca Continental Argentina, S. L., currently AC Bebidas Argentina, S. R. L. de C. V. (See Note 19). Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. is a variable capital publicly traded stock company incorporated in Mexico, domiciled at Ave. San Jerónimo 813 Poniente, in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The symbol “$” in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements refers to thousands of Mexican pesos. The acronym “US” refers to thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise indicated. NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: 2018 A. ECUADOR BRANCH CONTRIBUTION On October 15, 2018, AC contributed to AC Bebidas, the Ecuador branch’s assets and liabilities in exchange for increasing the interest in the subsidiary by 0.14%. This transaction was conducted within the framework of the Transaction Agreement mentioned below. For accounting purposes, the transfer of the net AC Bebidas assets was considered a business combination of entities under common control, and therefore the net assets transferred were accounted for by AC Bebidas at values at the Arca Continental consolidated level (predecessor accounting) as from the date on which the transfers were made, not including comparative 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 123 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S figures, based on Company accounting policies. Under this treatment, there was no difference between the historical book value of the net assets acquired of $349,216 and the contribution value, determined on the basis of the tax cost thereof. As a consequence of the predecessor’s accounting, the Ecuador branch’s $6,362,940 goodwill recognized by AC was transferred to AC Bebidas and no additional goodwill was recognized in connection with this transaction. With this contribution, AC’s interest in AC Bebidas is 80%, with Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) holding the remaining 20%. At December 31, 2017, AC held 79.86% of the AC Bebidas capital stock, with the remaining 20.14% held by CCR. B. ACQUISITION OF CORPORACIÓN LINDLEY’S MINORITY INTEREST On September 26, 2018, AC Bebidas entered into an agreement for the purchase of shares with Peru Beverage Limitada S. R. L. (Peru Beverage Limitada), a subsidiary of The Coca Cola Company, through which it acquired 223,774,704 common shares of Corporación Lindley S.A. (CL) with full voting rights and representing 38.52% of the common shares not listed at the Public Registry of the Securities Market of the Securities Market Superintendence of Peru. As a result of said purchase of shares, AC Bebidas currently holds 99.78% of CL voting shares. As the sole and total price for the purchase of said shares, AC Bebidas paid Peru Beverages Limited the amount of $9,622,876 (US$506.8 million) in cash, equivalent to US$2.26 dollars per share. The difference between the book value of the minority interest acquired and the amount paid is shown under stockholders’ equity in the retained earnings. At December 31, 2017, there were 355,903,118 common shares issued by CL and 15,801,752 investment shares. Investment shares carry no corporate rights such as voting rights or the right to attend stockholders’ meetings; neither do they confer the right to appoint members of the Board of Directors. The percentage of voting shares December 31, 2018 and 2017 is 72.96% and 56.93%, respectively. C. ACQUISITION OF THE GREAT PLAINS COCA COLA BOTTLING COMPANY For the purpose of expanding AC’s primary operation in a territory adjacent to that of CCSWB, on August 25, 2017, through its subsidiary CCSWB, AC acquired from CCR the overall capital stock of Great Plains Coca Cola Bottling Company (Great Plains) for the revised price of $3,636,197 (US$206,300) in cash. Great Plains operates as a Coca-Cola bottler and distributor in the state of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa being the most important cities. The valuation method used in that acquisition was the purchase method and at December 31, 2017, the Company was in the process of determining distribution of the purchase price at the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired from Great Plains, as it is reviewing valuations made by independent experts and was consequently in the process of determining goodwill. Said analysis was concluded within the twelve-month period from the date of acquisition, in accordance with the corresponding accounting standard. The following chart provides a summary of the consideration paid by AC at the acquisition date and the comparison between the preliminary fair values and the ending fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired.

(2) To date, no contingent liability has arisen from this acquisition that should be recorded. 124 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L The adjustment between the preliminary and ending fair values gave rise to an adjustment in the value of the consideration paid of $162,304, which represented a reimbursement in 2018. Expenses related to this transaction were recorded in the “Other expenses, net” line item at December 31, 2017, see Note 23. Moreover, AC’s equity in the net proforma revenue of Great Plains, as if it had been acquired on January 1, 2017, would have been $6,498,809 (unaudited) and in net gross profit would have been ($102,586) (unaudited). Great Plains income for the period from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2017 was $1,701,486. D. ACQUISITION OF DEEP RIVER In November 2017, through its subsidiary AC Foods LLC., the Company reported on the acquisition of Old Lyme Gourmet Company, known as Deep River Snacks, a company engaged in the production of snack food under the Deep River brand, which is based in the state of Connecticut and is known for its line of home style potato chips and organic seasoned corn chips under the Deep River brand. This acquisition was completed at a final price of $1,252,398 (US$60,686) and in 2018 and within the period allowed under the accounting standard, the study conducted by independent experts was concluded allowing for definitive recording of the distribution of the purchase price at the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired from Deep River, which was under analysis and had a preliminary status at December 31, 2017. Following is a summary of the consideration paid by AC and the final determination of the fair value at the acquisition date: Net assets acquired $ 67,607 Intangible assets 386,490 Goodwill 946,268 Defered taxes (147,967) Total consideration paid $ 1,252,398 Expenses related to this transaction were recorded in the “Other income (expenses), net” line item, see Note 23. 2017 A.

On February 8, 2017, AC and TCCC, through its subsidiary CCR, signed a Transaction Agreement (the Agreement), which is governed by US law and establishes the following: 1. Effective as from April 1, 2017, AC transferred, through a contribution to its subsidiary, AC Bebidas, it interest in the capital stock of some of its subsidiary and associated companies, as well as of its joint operation (and other activities integrated in said businesses) in Mexico, Ecuador and Argentina, in exchange for an interest in AC Bebidas and through a purchase/sale in Peru; 2. Effective as from April 1, 2017, CCR transferred to AC Bebidas the entire capital stock of Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages LLC (CCSWB), a company that has: (i) exclusive right to bottle, distribute and sell TCCC beverages in the Southwestern US composed of Texas and a portion of Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas (the Territory), (ii) ownership of different assets related to operations in the Southwestern US, and (iii) certain liabilities related to operations in the Southwestern US, in exchange for an interest in the AC Bebidas capital stock. 3. On November 30, 2017, AC transferred its interest in the capital stock of other subsidiaries and associates in exchange for an additional interest in the capital stock of AC Bebidas. B. ACQUISITION OF CCSWB AND SUBSIDIARIES In order to continue with the AC’s growth strategy in US territories and achieve synergies arising from AC operating performance, on April 1, 2017, CCR contributed to AC Bebidas 100% of the capital stock of CCSWB, and as from that date, AC Bebidas holds the equity units and net assets for operation of the CCSWB business in the Territory, as well as all voting rights. The assets acquired include all those pertaining to the TCCC beverage business within the Territory, among others: (i) nine plants and other property involved in the production, bottling, distribution, promotion and marketing of beverages; (ii) refrigerators, vending machines, quality control lab equipment, production lines, office furniture, computers, vehicles, tools, machinery in general and all the working capital related to production, bottling, distribution, promotion and marketing of said beverages; (iii) the rights arising from contracts, licenses and administrative permits pertaining to the production, bottling, distribution, promotion and marketing of beverages; (iv) licenses and authorizations for the use of the brand names of said beverages; (v) insurance policies covering fixed assets and other insurance policies and bonds pertaining to the operation of same; and (vi) cash on hand. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 125 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S The liabilities assumed by AC Bebidas through CCSWB as a result of the transaction include those involved in the beverage operation, such as: (i) tax obligations pertaining to the production, bottling, distribution, promotion and marketing of beverages; (ii) accounts payable related to the assets transferred and to the production, bottling, distribution, promotion and marketing of beverages; and (iii) payment obligations under a $11,255 million loan agreement contracted by CCR and then transferred to CCSWB as part of the transaction. The business acquisition was recognized in these financial statements by the purchase method established in International Financial Reporting Standard 3 (IFRS 3). That acquisition is included in the US segment, see Note 6. The acquisition was recorded by distributing total assets acquired, including intangible assets and assumed liabilities, based on fair values determined at the date of acquisition. The surplus of acquisition cost over net fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded under goodwill. The total consideration transferred by AC Bebidas, consisting of 100% of CCSWB capital, was determined to be 20.14% of AC Bebidas capital stock in the amount of $47,421 million. AC Bebidas issued Series B equity participation unit certificates, with a par value fo $10,289 million and an issuance premium of $37,132 million. The fair value of the certificate issued by AC Bebidas to CCR was determined based on the average market value AC shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange in effect in the 30 days preceding announcement of the signature of the Framework Agreement which determined the capitalization value adjusted to the AC Bebidas business. The total amount of the consideration determined includes the cash received in the transaction of $3,771 million, the cash from the price adjustments established in the Master Agreement for a net total of $5,504 million received by AC on the transaction close date and the net amount of $419 million paid on December 27, 2017 regarding the final adjustments at April 1, 2017. As a result of the above transaction, control over CCSWB was obtained, acquiring 100% interest (80.00% at the AC level) in exchange for delivery of 20.00% of the shareholding interest in the AC Bebidas business (20.14% at December 31, 2017). This transaction generated no cash flows from the exchanges of shares, except for the net payments made to adjust the values of the transaction, as per the agreement between AC, AC Bebidas and CCR. IAS 7 requires gross presentation of impact on the transaction; therefore, for presentation in the cash flow, the net flows paid with regard to the price adjustment of the acquired business and cash in the acquired entity of ($1,463) million and $3,771 million are included as part of investment activities. On the other hand, cash received by AC to adjust the price of the shares delivered to AC Bebidas for CCR’s non-controlling interest in said entity is shown as part of financing activities. The acquisition gave rise to a decrease in AC’s interest in AC Bebidas, without loss of control. The $28,459 million effect of this decrease was applied to retained earnings and is shown in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The non-controlling interest over 20.14% of AC Bebidas corresponding to CCR was determined at $18,961 million, which is also shown in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. 126 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L The following table summarizes the consideration paid by AC and the determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date (millions of pesos): Cash $ 3,771 Customers and other accounts receivable, net (1) 3,382 Inventories 1,678 Prepayments 393 Property, plant and equipment Net 18,367 Bottling agreement (Note 12) 24,936 Intangible assets (2) 728 Other non-current assets 363 Current debt (11,225) Suppliers (3,714) Other current liabilities (3) (3,410) Deferred income taxes (11,909) Other non-current liabilities (42) 23,318 Goodwill (4) (Note 12) 19,018 Net assets acquired from the CCSWB business 42,336 Adjustments to price in cash, net 5,085 Non-controlling interest in CCSWB (5) (8,526) Total consideration paid $ 38,895 (1) The contractual amount of the accounts receivable is $3,422 million, of which $40 million are expected to be unrecoverable.

(5) The non-controlling interest was determined by the proportional value method of the net assets acquired. Expenses related to this transaction were recorded in the “Other expenses, net” line item. See Note 23. AC’s equity in the net proforma revenue of CCSWB, as if it had been acquired on January 1, 2017, would have been $43,628 million (unaudited) and in net gross profit would have been $7,790 million (unaudited). CCSWB income for the period from the date of acquisition to December 31, 2017 totaled $33,248 million. NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The consolidated financial statements and notes there to were authorized for issuance on March 13, 2019 by the undersigned officers. Following is a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its subsidiary, which have been applied consistently in preparing its financial information in the years presented, unless otherwise specified: A. BASES FOR PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS include all International Accounting Standards (IAS) in effect, as well as all the related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), including those issued previously by the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for: (i) derivative financial instruments designated as hedging measured at fair value, and (ii) net assets and the results of the operations conducted by the company in Argentina, a hyper-inflationary economy, which are stated in the terms of the the current unit of measure at the closing date of the period reported on. See Note 3d. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 127 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimations. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a greater degree of judgment or complexity and those involving assumptions and estimations that are significant for the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 5. B. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES i. New standards and changes adopted by the Company The company has applied the following standards and modifications for the first time for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2018: • IFRS-9 Financial instruments • IFRS-15 Revenue from contracts with customers • IAS 29 Financial information in hyperinflationary economies Adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recorded in the financial statements (see Note 31). The new accounting policies are explained in Notes 3g. and z. In accordance with the transitory provisions of IFRS-9 and IFRS-15, comparative figures were not restated. ii. New standards and interpretations not yet adopted IFRS-16 “Leases” IFRS 16 was published in January 2016. The result will be that most of the lease agreements will be recognized in the statement of financial position by the lessees, since the difference between financial leasing and operating leasing has been eliminated. In accordance with the new standard, a financial asset is recognized (the right to use the leased asset) and a financial liability (for the obligation to pay leases). The only exception are short-term leases and leases involved insignificant lease payments. The Company leases machinery, office and commercial space under operating leases not subject to cancellation expiring at terms ranging from one to 15 years. The lease agreements have different terms, extension clauses and renewal rights. In the renewal, the terms of the leases are renegotiated. The Company applied the following procedure: a) performed an inventory of the agreements in effect as of December 31, 2018, b) evaluated the agreements under the decision tree established by IFRS-16 to identify a lease, c) applied exemptions to the agreements considered short-term and of insignificant value, d) adopted by not applying IFRS-16 to the agreements previously identified as different from leasing, according to IFRIC 4 and e) applied a single incremental loan rate per portfolio of identified agreements. The main judgments that were considered by the Company in the process of adopting this new standard were the following: i) for agreements with definite forced term, without clauses of renewal, or of early termination, the term established in the agreement, ii) for those agreements in which the contractual clauses did not clearly define the time of use of the asset or included indefinite renewal agreement clauses, the Company chose to define a lease period based on the most probable period of use of the agreement active. In accordance to the procedure described, at January 1, 2019, the Company expects to recognize assets for right of use of approximately $1,464,437 and leasing liabilities of $1,464,009 (after adjustments arising from prepayments and lease payments recognized at December 31, 2018). As of the reporting date, the Company has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of $1,057,893, see note 27. Of these commitments, approximately $341,519 relate to short-term leases, which will be recognized in straight line as expenses in results. The Company expects the after tax net profit to decrease by approximately $65,414 for 2019, as a result of adoption of this new standard. Operating cash flows will increase and financing cash flows will decrease by approximately $82,713, as payment of the principal portion of leasing liabilities will be classified as cash flows provided by financing activities. The Company’s activities as lessee are immaterial; therefore, the Company does not expect them to have a significant impact on the financial statements. However, some additional disclosures will be required as from its entry into effect. The standard will be applied as from the date of compulsory adoption, i.e., January 1, 2019. The Company intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate the comparative amounts for the year prior to application of the standard. The Company has identified no other standards that have not yet gone into effect and which could have a significant impact on the entity in current and future reporting periods and in foreseeable future transactions. 128 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L C. CONSOLIDATION i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company exercises control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed or is entitled to variable yields arising from an interest in the entity and is capable of affecting yields through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries consolidate as from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They cease consolidating as from the date on which said control ceases (see Notes 2 and 30). When combinations are made in the form of the acquisition of businesses under common control, the Company initially records the assets transferred and the liabilities incurred at the predecessor value in the books of the selling entity at the date of the transaction, which includes adjustments to fair value and goodwill of previous combinations. Any difference between the equity issued by the Company or the consideration paid and the predecessor values are recorded directly in stockholders’ equity. Acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. The Company uses the purchase method of accounting to record business combinations. The consideration transferred in the acquisition of an independent entity is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of all assets and liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration agreement. When payment of any portion of the consideration in cash is deferred, amounts to be paid in the future are discounted at present value on the date of the transaction. The discount rate used is the incremental rate of the Company’s debt, as this rate is similar to that which would be obtained in a debt from independent sources of financing under comparable terms and conditions, depending on their characteristics. The contingent consideration is classified as capital or as a financial liability. The amounts classified as financial liabilities are subsequently disclosed at fair value with the changes recognized in the consolidated results. Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. The identifiable assets acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially valued at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on the basis of fair values or in proportion to the non-controlling interest in the net assets of the acquired entity, as opted for in each particular case. The surplus of the transferred consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous interest held in the equity of the acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. If the total amount of the transferred consideration, the minority interest recognized and the previous interest held in the acquired entity are lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, in the event of a purchase at below market price, the difference is directly recognized in the statement of income. Unrealized balances and profits on transactions between entities belonging to the Company are eliminated in consolidation. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. The subsidiaries’ accounting policies have been amended when necessary to ensure that they are in line with the Company’s policies. ii. Changes in the interest in subsidiaries without loss of control The transactions with the non-controlling interest not conducive to a loss of control are recorded as transactions in stockholders’ equity, that is, as transactions with stockholders in their capacity as such. The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the interest acquired in the book value of the subsidiary’s net assets is recorded in stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses on the sale of non-controlling interest are also recorded in stockholders’ equity. iii. Sale or disposal of subsidiaries When the Company no longer controls, any interest retained in the entity is revalued at fair value, and the change in book value is recorded in income for the year. The fair value is the initial book value for accounting purposes, subsequent to the retained interest in the associate, joint business or financial asset. Any amounts recognized previously recorded in comprehensive income with respect to said entity is accounted for as though the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This implies that amounts previously applied to other comprehensive income are reclassified to income for the year. iv. Associated companies Associates are all entities over which the Company exercises significant influence, although not control or joint control, which generally occurs when the Company holds from 20% to 50% of the voting rights in the associate. The company’s investment in associates includes the goodwill related to the acquisition, net of accumulated impairment losses. The existence and effects of the potential voting rights currently exercisable or convertible are considered in evaluating whether or not the Company controls another entity. Furthermore, the Company evaluates the existence of control in cases where it holds no more than 50% of voting rights but is in a position to control financial and operating policy. Acquisition-related costs are charged to income when incurred. The investment in shares of associated companies is valued by the equity method. That method is used to initially recorded investments at acquisition cost. Said investments are subsequently valued by the equity method, which consists of adjusting the value of the investment by the proportionate part of profits or losses and the distribution of profits by capital reimbursements subject to the acquisition date. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 129 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S If equity in an associated company is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a portion of the amounts previously applied to comprehensive income will be reclassified to income for the year, when appropriate. Equity in the results of associated companies is recognized in the income statement, and equity in movements in other comprehensive income, subsequent to acquisition, is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company presents the equity in net profits of associated companies considered integral vehicles through which the Company conducts operations and strategies as part of operating income. Post-acquisition accrued movements are adjusted against the book value of the investment. When the Company’s interest in the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its investment therein, including any other accounts receivable, the Company recognizes no additional losses, unless it has incurred in obligations or has made payments on behalf of the associated company. On each reporting date, the Company determines whether or not there is any objective evidence of impairment of the investment in the associate. If so, the Company calculates impairment as the difference between the recoverable value of the associate and its book value and records that figure in “Equity in losses/gains of associates” by the equity method in the statement of income. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its associates are eliminated according to the interest the Company has in each. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred. In order to ensure consistency with Company policies, the accounting policies of associates have been modified as appropriate. When the Company no longer exercises significant influence over an associate, any difference between the fair value of the investment retained, including any consideration received from disposal of a portion of the interest, and the book value of the investment is recognized in income for the year. When an investment in associates is transferred due to restructuring under common control, it is valued at fair value by the entity receiving the transfer. v. Joint agreements The Company has applied IFRS 11 to all its joint agreements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified either as a joint operation or a joint business, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Company has determined that its joint agreement qualifies as a joint operation. In joint operations, each joint operator records its assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the percentages specified in the contractual agreement. A contractual agreement can be a joint agreement even if not all of its parts have joint control over of agreement. Revenue arising from the joint operation regarding goods or services acquired by the Company as joint operator, as well as any unrealized profit with third parties are eliminated as part under consolidation and reflected in the consolidated financial statements until they are realized with third parties. D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION i. The functional and reporting currencies The amounts included in each of the financial statements of the Company’s entities must be measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos, which is the functional currency of the holding company, as an independent legal entity. Note 30 provides descriptions of the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries. ii. Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are converted to the functional currency using the exchange rate in effect on the transaction or valuation dates, when items are remeasured. Exchange gains and losses from settlement of those transactions and from conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at the closing exchange rates are recognized as exchange fluctuations in the statement of income, except when deferred to other comprehensive income because they qualify as cash flow coverage. iii. Conversion of foreign subsidiaries Income and the financial position of all Company entities whose functional currency differs from the Company’s reporting currency are translated to the reporting currency as follows, depending on whether or not the subsidiary’s functional currency is in a hyperinflationary economy. Non-hyperinflationary economy • Assets and liabilities on each statement of financial position presented are converted at the closing exchange rate in effect at the date of the statement of financial position. • The Stockholders’ equity of each statement of financial position presented is converted to the historical exchange rate. • Income, costs and expenses shown in each statement of income are converted at the average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the accumulated effect of transaction rates, in which case, the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date is used). • All resulting exchange differences are recorded under comprehensive income. 130 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L Goodwill and adjustments to fair value arising at acquisition date of a foreign transaction that are to be measured at fair value are recognized as assets or liabilities of the foreign entity and converted at the closing exchange rate. Exchange differences are recorded in comprehensive income. Hyperinflationary economy • Assets, liabilities (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising at the acquisition date) and stockholders’ equity of the financial position, as well as the income and expenses shown in the income statements, are translated to the exchange rate prevailing at the close of the statement of financial position, after being restated to their functional currency; and • Assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses for the comparative period are maintained according to the amounts obtained from the translation of the year in question, that is to say, of the financial statements of the preceding period. Said amounts are not adjusted to subsequent exchange rates, as the Company presents its financial information in Mexican pesos, which correspond to a currency of a non-hyperinflationary economy. When a foreign operation is disposed of, any exchange difference pertaining to net worth is reclassified to the statement of income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. The exchange rates used in preparing these financial statements are as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Pesos to the US dollar 19.66 19.74 Pesos to the Peruvian sol 5.83 6.09 Pesos to the Argentine peso 0.52 1.06 Pesos to the Euro 22.47 23.69 The exchange rate of the peso to the US dollar at April 1, 2017, date of the business combination with CCSWB was $18.71. The average exchange rates used in preparing these financial statements are as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Pesos to the US dollar 19.21 18.85 Pesos to the Peruvian sol 5.83 5.80 Pesos to the Argentine peso 0.70 1.13 Pesos to the Euro 22.63 21.46 Restatement of financial statements Prior to its translation to pesos, the reporting currency of the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation so as to reflect changes in the purchasing power of the functional currency. In order to determine whether or not an economy is hyperinflationary, the Company evaluates the qualitative features of the economic environment, as well as the quantitative features established by IFRS, when an inflation rate accrued over the most recent three-year period is equal to 100%. Inflation in Argentina As from July 1, 2018, cumulative inflation over the past three years in Argentina exceeded 100%; therefore, the Argentine peso was qualified as the currency of a hyperinflationary economy. As a result of this situation, the financial statements of the subsidiaries located in said country, whose functional currency is the Argentine peso, has been restated as per the requirements of International accounting Standard 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” (IAS 29) and have been consolidated as per the requirements of IAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”. The purpose of meeting said requirements is to consider the changes in the general purchasing power of the Argentine peso and thus present the financial statements in the current unit of measure at the reporting date. The financial statements of said operations prior to restatement were prepared using the historical cost method. The inflationary adjustment was calculated considering the indexes established by the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils in Economic Sciences (FACPCE) based on the price indexes published by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC). 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 131 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S The price indexes used for restatement of the financial statements are: YEAR INDEX 2018 184.2552 2017 124.7956 2016 100.0000 The financial information pertaining to the subsidiaries in Argentina are restated as follows: a. The amounts corresponding to non-monetary items of each statement of financial position, that are not measured at the date of the statement of financial position at fair value or net realization value, as applicable, are restated applying the change in the general price index to the historical cost, from the date of acquisition or the date of the last measurement at fair value, to the date of the statement of financial position; b. The amounts corresponding to monetary items shown in the statement of financial position are not restated; c. The components of capital of each statement of financial position are restated: 1) At the start of the first period in which IAS 29 is applied, using the change of a general price index, from the date on which the items originated to the date of restatement, except for retained earnings, which arise from the rest of the balances in the statement of financial position. 2) At the end of the first application period, in subsequent periods, all of the elements of capital are restated, applying a general price index, from the start of the period, or from the date of the contribution, if subsequent. d. Income and expenses are restated applying the change in the general price index, from the date on which the expenses and income were recognized, to the date of the report. e. Gains and losses in purchasing power arising from the net monetary position are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of the financial result (Note 25). Initial recognition of hyperinflation in the consolidated financial statements where the reporting currency does not pertain to a hyperinflationary economy does not require changing the comparative balances; therefore, the accumulated effect arises from the existing difference between the equity at the 2017 close corresponding to the subsidiaries in Argentina and the initial equity for 2018, due to the effects of restatement of said entities’ financial information. The accumulated effect of initial application of IAS 29 on the consolidated financial statements amounted $2,998,446 and was recognized in the retained earnings. The Company opted for recognizing the adjustment of the items, including the capital, on the effect of translation of foreign entities, which as of December 31, 2018 was $957,439. E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits available for operations and other highly-liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less, all subject to immaterial risk of change in value or country risk. F. CLIENTS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Clients and other accounts receivable are amounts owed by clients on goods sold or services provided in the ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable are generally settled within a 90 day term, and are therefore classified as current. Clients and accounts receivable are initially recognized on the basis of the consideration, unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognized at fair value. The Company holds clients and accounts receivable for the objective of collect the contractual cash flows and therefore, measures them subsequently amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. As from January 1, 2018, the provision for losses is based on assumptions on the risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company applies the simplified approach allowed under IFRS 9, which requires that losses expected over the lifetime of the instruments to be recorded as from initial recognition of accounts receivable and uses judgments upon making these assumptions and upon selecting the data for calculation of impairment, based on the Company’s historical information, in the existing market conditions, as well as in future estimations at the end of each reporting period. Note 31 includes further information related to the effect of adoption of IFRS 9 in connection with the provision for losses. Due to the short-term nature of the other account receivable, the book value thereof is considered the same as its fair value. For most non-current accounts receivable, fair values are also not significantly different from their book values. 132 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L G. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets i. Classification As from January 1, 2018, the Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories (see Note 31): • Those subsequently measured at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and • Those measured at amortized cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of cash flows and where these cash flows are consistent with the definition of solely payments of principal and interest. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses are applied to other comprehensive income. The Company reclassifies debt instruments when, and only when, its business model for managing those assets changes. ii. Recognition and disposal Regular purchase and sale of financial assets is recognized on the trade date, the date on which the Company agrees to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from financial assets expire or are transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards ownership. iii. Measurement At the initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value profit and loss (FVPL), transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. The transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit and loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are entirely considered when determining whether cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model to manage the asset and the cashflow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories which the Company classifies their debt instruments: • Amortized cost: Assets held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at their amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets are included in the financial income, using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss, arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains (losses) together with for age exchange gain and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line Income Statement. • FV-OCI: Assets held for collection of contractual cash flows and for the sale of financial assets, when the cash flows of assets represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in book value are recognized through other comprehensive income (OCI), except as concerns recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and exchange rate gains and losses applied to income. When financial assets are disposed of, the accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in the OCI is reclassified from capital to income and recognized in other income (expenses). Interest income from said financial assets are included in the financial income, using the effective interest rate method. Exchange gains and losses are shown in income and financial costs, and impairment expenses are shown as a separate item in the statement of income. • FVPL: Assets failing to meet the amortized cost or FV-OCI criteria are measured at fair FVPL. A gain or loss in a debt instruments subsequently measured at FVPL is applied to income and shown in net terms in other income (expenses) in the period in which it arises. The Company reclassifies debt instruments when, and only when, it changes its business model for managing those assets. iv. Impairment From January 1, 2018, the Company assesses on forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments at amortized cost and FV-OCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether a significant increase in credit risk has arisen. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified method permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recorded recognized as from initial recognition of accounts receivables, see note 8a. for further details. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 133 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S v. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net amount is shown in the statement of financial position when the right to offset amounts recognized is legally binding and there is the intention to settle them on net bases or to simultaneously realize the asset and pay the liability. The legal right should not be contingent upon future events and must be executable in the regular course of business operations as well as in the event of non-compliance, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. At December 31, 2018, no financial assets and liabilities have been offset. vi. Accounting policy applied up to December 31, 2017: As explained in Note 31, the Company has applied IFRS 9 retrospectively, but decided not to reformulate the comparative information. As a result, the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for as per the accounting policy previously in effect, as described below: Up until December 31, 2017, the Company classified its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through income, loans and accounts receivable, and investments available for sale. Classification depended on the intended purpose of the financial assets. Management determined the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition thereof. Purchases and sales of financial assets were recognized on the settlement date. Financial assets were canceled in their entirety when the right to receive related cash flows expires or is transferred and the Company has substantially transferred all of the risks and benefits inherent to ownership thereof, as well as control over the financial asset. a. Financial assets at fair value through income statement Financial assets at their fair value through income were financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category is it was mainly acquired to be sold in the short-term. Derivative financial instruments are also classified as held for trade, unless they are designated as hedges. Financial assets recorded at fair value through income were initially recognized at their fair value and transaction costs are recorded as expenses in the statement of income. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of these assets were applied to income for the period in which they were incurred, in the other expenses, net line item. Dividend income stemming from financial assets recorded at fair value through income were recognized in the statement of income as other income when it was established that the Company was entitled to receive them. b. Loans and accounts receivable Loans and accounts receivable were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determined payments that were not quoted in an active market. They were included as current assets, except for maturities of over 12 months after the date of the statement of financial position, which were classified as non-current assets. Loans and accounts receivable were initially valued at fair value, plus transaction costs incurred, and were subsequently recognized at amortized cost. When circumstances arise that indicate that receivables will not be collected in the amounts initially agreed or will be collected in a different term, said accounts receivable were impaired. Accounts receivable represented amounts owed by customers arising from the sale of goods or services rendered in the regular course of the Company’s operations. c. Financial assets available for sale Financial assets available for sale are non-derivative financial assets that were either classified in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They were included as non-current assets, unless they mature in under 12 months or management intends to dispose of said investment within the 12 month-period following the date of the statement of financial position. Financial assets available for sale were initially recognized at their fair value, plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these assets are recorded at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary instruments classified as available for sale were applied directly to capital in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income. When instrument classified as available for sale were sold or impaired, the cumulative fair value adjustments applied to capital were included in the statement of income. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no financial assets available for sale. 134 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L d. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net figure was shown in the statement of financial position when the right to offset amounts recorded was legally applicable and they were intended to be settled on net bases or the asset is to be realized and the liability is to be paid simultaneously. The legally enforceable right should not be contingent of future events and must be payable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. At December 31, 2017 no financial assets and liabilities have been offset. Impairment of financial instruments a. Financial assets valued at their amortized cost At the end of every reporting year, the Company evaluates whether or not there is objective evidence of impairment of each financial assets or group of financial assets. Impairment losses were recorded when there is objective evidence of impairment resulting from one or more events occurring subsequent to the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”), provided the loss event(s) impact(s) estimated future cash flows derived from the financial asset or group of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. The factors evaluated by the Company when determining whether or not there is objective evidence of impairment were: • ­Significant financial difficulties of the issuer or debtor. • ­Breach of contract, such as late payment. • ­The Company’s granting of a concession to the issuer or debtor as a result of the issuer’s or debtor’s financial difficulties not considered under other circumstances. • ­The issuer or debtor is likely to declare bankruptcy or some other type of financial reorganization. • ­The disappearance of an active market for the financial asset is due to financial difficulties. • ­Verifiable information indicates that there is a quantifiable decrease in future estimated cash flows relative to a group of financial assets subsequent to initial recognition, although the decrease cannot yet the identified with individual financial assets, such as: i. Adverse changes in the status of debtor payments on the group of assets. ii. Domestic or local conditions related to non-compliance on the part of issuers of the group of assets. Based on the above-mentioned factors, the Company determines whether or not there is any objective evidence of impairment. Then, for the category of loans and accounts receivable, if impairment is considered to exist, it determines the amount of the respective loss by computing the difference between the book value of the asset and the present value of estimated effective future cash flows (excluding future credit losses not yet incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate. That amount, which is recorded in the statement of income under “selling costs” is subtracted from the book value of the asset. If the interest rate of a loan or investment held to maturity is variable, the discount rate to measure any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate determined according to the terms of the contract. Alternatively, the Company could determine the impairment of the asset considering its fair value determined on the basis of its current observable market price. If the impairment loss is reduced in subsequent years due to objective verification of an event occurred subsequent to the date on which said impairment was recorded (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of the impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. H. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES As from January 1, 2018 (See Note 31), derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Recognition of changes in fair value depends on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, on the nature of the item hedged. The Company designates certain derivatives as: • Fair value coverage of recognized assets and liabilities or of a firm commitment (fair value hedges). • Hedging of a particular risk related to the cash flows of assets and liabilities recognized. At the start of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedge instruments and the items hedged, the risk-management objective and the strategy for conducting hedging transactions. The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 21. Movements in the hedge reserve in net capital stock is shown in Note 20. The complete fair value of derivative hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or liability, when maturity of the remaining hedge item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when maturity of the remaining hedge amount is under 12 months. i. Cash-flow hedging qualifying for hedge accounting The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedging is recognized in the cash-flow hedge reserve in capital stock. The gain or loss related to the non-effective portion is immediately applied to income under financial income and expense. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 135 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S When options contracts are used to hedge forecasted transactions, the Company designates only the intrinsic value of options as a hedge instrument. Up until December 31, 2017, the Company classified the options in a foreign currency as cash flow hedge derivative instruments and recorded the effective portion of changes in fair value that qualify as cash flow hedging in other comprehensive income and the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion in the statement of income held for trade and recorded them in FVPL. Gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the intrinsic value of options are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The changes in value over time of options related to the hedged item (aligned time value) are applied to other comprehensive income (OCI) in the costs of the hedge reserve in capital stock. When forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted transactions, the Company generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of forward contracts are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The change in the forward element of the contract that refers to the hedged item (“aligned forward element”) is recognized in other comprehensive income in the costs of the hedge reserve in capital stock. In some cases, the Company can designate the total change in the fair value of the forward contract (including forward points) as a hedging instrument. In those cases, gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the overall forward contract are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The amounts accumulated in capital stock are reclassified in the periods in which the hedged item is applied to income, as follows: • When, subsequently, the hedged item gives rise to recognition of a non-financial asset, both deferred hedging gains and losses, and the value of the time deferred of options contracts or forwards points (if any) are included in the initial cost of the asset. Deferred amounts are ultimately applied to income for the period, as the hedged item affects the gain or loss. • The gain or loss related to the effective portion of interest rate swaps that cover variable interest rates of loans is applied to income under “financial expenses”, at the same time as the interest expense of the hedged loans. When a hedge instrument matures, it is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any deferred accumulated gain or loss and hedging costs deferred in capital remain at that time in capital until the forecasted transaction occurs, giving rise to recognition of a non-financial asset. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss and the deferred hedging costs reported in capital are immediately reclassified to income. ii. Derivatives no qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are immediately applied to income and included in other income (expenses). iii. Accounting policy applied up to December 31, 2017: As explained in Note 31, the Company has applied IFRS 9 prospectively, but decided not to reformulate the comparative information. As a result, the comparative information provided continues to be accounted for as per the accounting policy previously in effect, as described below: Derivative financial instruments contracted and classified as fair value hedging or cash flow hedging were recognized in the statement of financial position as assets and/or liabilities at fair value and were subsequently measured at fair value. Fair value was determined on the basis of recognized market prices and when they are not traded in the market, it is determined based on valuation techniques accepted in the financial sector, using inputs and variables observable in the market, such as interest rate and exchange rate curves obtained from reliable sources of information. The fair value of derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or liability if maturity of the remaining hedge amount is over 12 months. Derivative financial instruments documented as hedges were contracted to cover risks and there was compliance with all coverage requirements. Designation was documented at the outset of the coverage operation, describing the purpose, item hedged, risk to be hedged, hedge instruments and the method for evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of the hedge relationship, features, book recognition and the manner in which effectiveness is to be measured, applicable to that operation. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as fair value hedge, were recorded in the statement of income. The change in the fair value of hedges and the change in the primary position attributable to the risk hedged were applied to income in the same line item of the position they hedge. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments related to cash flow hedging was temporarily applied to stockholders’ equity, under comprehensive income, and is reclassified to income when the position if it hedges affects income; the infective portion is immediately applied to income. 136 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L When the forecasted transaction hedged gives rise to recognition of a non-financial asset (i.e: Inventory or fixed asset), gains or losses previously deferred in capital are transferred from capital and included in the initial valuation of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts were ultimately recognized in the cost of sales, in the case of inventories or in the depreciation expense in the case of fixed assets. The Company suspends hedge accounting when the derivative matures, is canceled or exercised, when the derivative fails to reach a high effectivity to offset the cash flows of the item hedged, or when the Company decides to cancel the hedge designation. When suspending hedge accounting in the case of fair value hedges, the adjustment to the book value of an amount hedged for which the return on active interest rate is used, was amortized in income for the maturity period, and in the case of cash flow hedges, the amounts accumulated in stockholders’ equity as part of comprehensive income, remain in the Capital until the effects of the forecasted transaction affect income. In the event the forecasted transaction is unlikely to occur, the gains or losses that were accumulated in the comprehensive income account are immediately applied to income. When hedging of a forecasted transaction was shown as satisfactory and is subsequently shown to fail the effectiveness test, the accrued effects on comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity are proportionately applied to income, to the extent that the forecasted transaction is applied to income. I. INVENTORIES Inventory is shown at the lesser of cost and net realization value. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The cost of finished products and of products in progress includes design, raw materials and direct labor costs and other direct costs and general manufacturing expenses (based on regular operating capacity). Borrowing costs are excluded. Net realization value is the sales price estimated in the normal course of Company operations, less the respective variable selling expense. J. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Non-current assets (or groups of assets) to be disposed of are classified as held for sale when their book value is mainly recoverable via a sales transaction considered to be highly likely. Those assets are recorded at the lower of the value arrived at by comparing the balance in books and fair value less cost of sales; they are not depreciated or amortized as long as they are classified as held for sale, and are shown separately from other assets in the statement of financial position. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company holds no assets available for sale. K. PREPAYMENTS Prepayments represent disbursements made by the Company for insurance, advertising or leases where the benefits and risks inherent in the goods to be acquired or the services to be received (such as prepaid insurance premiums) have not yet been transferred. L. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes expenses directly attributable to acquisition of the asset. Subsequent costs are included in the book value of the asset or recorded as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when the Company is likely to receive future economic benefits arising from same and the cost of property, plant and equipment can be reliably determined. The carrying amount of replaced parts is derecognized. Repair and maintenance expenses are recognized in the statement of income in the year in which they are incurred. Significant improvements are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset in question. Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method, considering each components separately. Following are the average useful lives of the families of assets: Buildings 30 70 years Machinery and equipment 10 25 years Transportation equipment 10 15 years Furniture and other equipment 3 10 years Bottles and delivery containers 2 7 years Refrigerators and sales equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Land and investments in process are valued at cost and are not depreciated. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 137 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S Spares and parts for use over more than a year attributable to specific machinery are classified as property, plant and equipment under other fixed assets. The costs pertaining to general and specific loans directly related to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which require a substantial period (12 months or more), are capitalized to form part of the acquisition cost of said qualifying assets until the moment they are ready to be used for the intended purpose. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the determination of said costs is based on specific and general financing. The residual and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and if expectations differ from prior estimates, the changes are recorded as a change in accounting estimate. Assets classified as property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing when there are events or circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recovered. An impairment loss corresponds to the amount at which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recovery value. Recovery value is the greater of fair value net of selling costs and the asset’s value in use. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recovery value, impairment of an asset’s carrying value is recognized and the asset is immediately recognized at its recovery value. Gains or losses on asset disposals are determined by comparing the sales value and the carrying value and are recognized in “Other income (expenses), net” in the statement of income. Returnable and non-returnable containers (bottles) Company operations involve both returnable and non-returnable containers. Returnable containers are recorded as fixed assets under property, plant and equipment and are depreciated by the straight-line method, based on their estimated useful lives. Under certain historic operating practices in certain territories, returnable containers provided to customers are subject to agreements whereby the Company retains ownership of the container and requires the customer to pay a deposit. The container is controlled by the Company via its commercial distribution network and the Company is entitled to charge customers for identifiable breakage. Non-returnable containers are recorded in consolidated income as part of cost of sales, at the time of sale. M. LEASES The classification of leases as financial or operating leases depends on the substance of the transaction rather than on the form of the contract. Leasing in which a significant portion of the risks and benefits pertaining to ownership are retained by the lessor is classified as operating leasing. Payments made under operating leasing (net of any incentive received by the lessor) are charged to the statement of income by the straight line method over the term of the lease. Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and benefits of the leased property are classified as financial leases. Financial leases are capitalized at the outset of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of minimum lease payments. If determination is practical for discounting minimum payments at present value, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used; otherwise, the incremental rate on the lessee’s loan is used. All of the lessee’s initial direct costs are added to the original figure recorded as an asset. All lease payments are applied to liabilities and the financial charges until a constant rate for the balance is achieved. The respective lease obligations are included in non-current debt, net of financial charges. Interest on financial costs is charged to income for the year during the lease period so as to produce a periodic constant interest rate in the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under financial leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. N. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the acquisition cost of a subsidiary in excess of the Company’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, determined at the acquisition date. Goodwill is shown separately in the statement of financial position under “Goodwill and intangible assets, net” and is recorded at cost less accumulated impairment losses, which are not reversed. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the book value of goodwill related to the entity sold. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is assigned to the cash generating units. The assignment is made to cash generating units or cash generating groups of units expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arises, identified in accordance with the respective operating segment. 138 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L Intangible assets are recorded when they are identifiable, they provide future economic benefits and there is control over such benefits. Intangible assets are classified as follows: i. Indefinite-life intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment testing. To date, no factors have been determined that might limit the useful life of these intangible assets. Indefinite life intangible assets consist mainly of: a) bottler agreements entered into by the Company with TCCC, which grant rights to product, bottle and distribute TCCC products in the territories in which the Company operates, b) brands with which Nacional de Alimentos y Helados, S. A. de C. V. (Nayhsa), Wise Foods, Deep River, Tonicorp and Inalecsa market their products, which are considered of high value and positioning in the market and c) Tonicorp distribution rights. The aforementioned bottler agreements have specific expiration dates and do not guarantee they are perpetual; however, based on own experience and market evidence, the Company considers it will continue to renew these agreements and has thus assigned them as indefinite life intangible assets (see Notes 5, 12, and 28). Brands and distribution rights have no expiration and are those used by the Company to operate in its snack and dairy product segments. Those in definite-life intangible assets are assigned to cash-generating units (CGU) for impairment-testing purposes. ii. Defined-useful-life assets are recognized at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses recognized. They are amortized by the straight-line method, according to the useful life, determined based on expected future economic benefits, and are subject to testing when there is evidence of impairment. These intangible assets correspond to the non-compete agreements of some business combinations and to certain distribution rights, certain brands and software, which are amortized in 5, 10 and 30year periods according to each asset’s features (see Note 12). The estimated useful lives of definite-life and indefinite-life intangible assets are reviewed annually. O. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS Assets with an undefined useful life, such as goodwill, are not depreciated or amortized and are subject to impairment testing once a year or before that when there are indications of impairment. Assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value might not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recovery value. The recovery value of an asset is defined as the higher between the value-in-use and the fair value of an asset less the related sales costs. In order to evaluate impairment, assets are grouped based on the minimum levels of cash flows that can be identified separately (cash generating unit). Impaired non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed in search of possible impairment reversal on each reporting date. P. SUPPLIERS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE These balances represent liabilities arising from goods and services provided to the Company prior to the period end, that have not been paid. Suppliers and other accounts payable are presented as current liabilities, unless the payment is not due within 12 months following the reporting period. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently valued at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. Q. DEBT The debt is initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. The debt is subsequently recognized at amortized cost. Any differences between the amounts received (net of transaction costs) and the settlement value are recognized in the statement of income during the term of the loan, using the effective interest rate method. Loans are eliminated from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is met, canceled or expires. The difference between the book amount of a financial liability that has been canceled or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including non-monetary assets transferred or assumed liabilities, is applied to income as other financial income or costs. R. FACTORING A liability owed to suppliers is eliminated from the statement of financial position when it is settled, that is to say, when the obligation is eliminated, canceled, or expires. The Company contracts financial factoring for financing of accounts payable to suppliers in Peru and when changes in terms and conditions indicate that the liability owed to suppliers is no longer extant, a new financial liability is considered to be owed to the factoring entity, resulting in cancellation of the original liability owed to the supplier. S. INCOME TAXES Income taxes reflected in the statement of income represent tax incurred in the year, as well as the effects of deferred taxes on income determined by the method of assets and liabilities, applying the rate established in current legislation or substantially enacted and in effect on the balance sheet date in the location in which the Company operates, and generate taxable income from all temporary differences determined by comparing the book and tax values of assets and liabilities expected to apply when the 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 139 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled, considering any unamortized tax losses prior to analysis of recovery. Tax is applied to income, except to the extent it relates to other comprehensive income, in which case, tax is recorded in other comprehensive income. The effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in income for the period in which the rate change is determined. Management periodically evaluates positions declared in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable legislation is subject to interpretation. The Company recognizes provisions when necessary based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. A deferred tax asset is recorded only when there is likely to be future taxable income against which to apply deductions arising from temporary differences. Deferred taxes on income applicable to temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint agreements is recorded, except when the temporary difference reversal period is controlled by the Company and temporary differences may not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is the legal right to do so and when taxes are collected by same the tax authority. T. ASSOCIATE BENEFITS The Company provides the following associate plans: i. Pension plans Defined contribution plans: A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. The Company has no legal or assumed obligations to pay additional contributions if the fund fails to maintain sufficient assets with which to pay all associates the benefits related to service in the current and past periods. Contributions are recorded as associate benefit expenses on the date on which the contribution is due. Defined benefit plans: A benefit plan is defined as the pension benefit to be received by an associate upon retirement, which usually depends on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the statement of financial position with respect to defined-benefit plans is the present value of the defined-benefit obligation at the end of the accounting period, less the fair value of plan assets. Obligations for defined benefits are calculated annually by independent actuaries via the projected unit credit method. The present value of defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using discount rates (per IAS 19) denominated in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid and with maturity dates are similar to those of the pension liability. In countries with no in-depth market for said instruments, market rates for government bonds are used. Re-measurements of the liability caused by gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to stockholders’ equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The cost of past services is recognized immediately in income. ii. Termination benefits Termination benefits are paid when the Company terminates employment prior to the regular retirement date or when an associate accepts termination of employment in exchange for those benefits. The Company recognizes termination benefits when there is a verifiable commitment to conclude the work relationship of certain associates and a formal detailed plan providing so and that cannot be surrendered. In the event there is an offer that encourages associate resignation, the related termination benefits are valued based on the number of associates expected to accept the offer. The benefits payable over the long-term are discounted at present value. iii. Short-term benefits The Company provides short-term associate benefits, which can include wages, salaries, annual bonuses and bonuses payable over the following 12 months. The Company recognizes a provision when is it contractually obligated or when the former practice has created an obligation. iv. Associates’ statutory profit sharing and bonuses The Company records a liability and an expense for bonuses and associate profit-sharing when it has a legal or assumed obligation to pay those benefits and determines the amount to be recorded based on profits for the year, after certain adjustments. 140 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L U. PROVISIONS Liability provisions represent a present legal obligation or an obligation assumed as a result of past events where resources are likely to be required to comply with the obligation, when the amount in question has been reliably estimated. No provisions are recorded for future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of the amount necessary to cover the obligation at the date of the financial statements and are recorded on the basis of management’s best estimation. V. CAPITAL STOCK The Company’s common stock is classified as capital. Incremental costs attributable directly to the issuance of new shares are included in equity as a deduction of the consideration received, net of taxes, nevertheless although the Company has incurred in no such costs. W. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income Consists of net income, plus re-measurement of the defined-benefit liability and other capital reserves, net of taxes, which are composed of the effects of conversion of foreign entities, the effects of derivative financial instruments for cash flow hedging and interest in other items of the comprehensive income of associates, as well as other items required by a specific provision to be reflected in stockholders’ equity, which do not constitute capital contributions, reductions or distributions. X. FUND FOR REPURCHASE OF OWN SHARES The Stockholders periodically authorize disbursement of a maximum amount for the acquisition of own shares. Own shares acquired are shown as a decrease in the fund for repurchase of own shares included in the consolidated statement of financial position under retained earnings, and are valued at their acquisition cost. These amounts are stated at their historical cost. Dividends received are recognized by decreasing their historical cost. With respect to the sale of shares from the repurchase fund, the amount obtained in excess or deficit of their historical cost is recognized in the premium on the sale of shares. Y. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment reporting is presented consistently with the internal reports provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the highest authority for making operating decisions, allocation the resources and evaluating the operating segments’ yield. Z. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company adopted IFRS-15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” as from January 1, 2018, when application of this standard became mandatory, using the modified retrospective method. The Company manufactures and sells carbonated and non-carbonated beverages under TCCC’s trademarks, dairy products, foodstuff and snacks wholesale, in the markets in which it operates, based on formal and informal agreements entered into with different customers in the Modern and Traditional Channel, in which prices are negotiated continually, given the turnover of products and the competitiveness it must maintain in the market. Income from these sales is recognized at the fair value of the consideration collected or to be collected and represents the amounts receivable on the sale of products, net of discounts, returns and taxes. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the products is transferred, which is when the products are delivered to the customer, and there is unsatisfied obligation that could affect acceptance of the products by the customer. Delivery is effective when the products are delivered to the specific location, the risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the customer has accepted the products. Further to the above, it is concluded that the Company’s revenue is generated at a specific point in time. In the Modern Channel, retail products are sold at a discount for volume, based on total sales during the period, which is usually under 12 months, given the dynamics of displacement of the products in the market. Revenue on these sales is recognized based on the price established in the agreements, net of discounts for estimated volume. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and foresee discounts, using the expected value method. No element of financing is considered present, due to the fact that sales are, for the most part, made in cash for the Traditional Channel, or with a credit term for the Modern Channel. An account receivable is recognized when the products are delivered and the payment is not in cash, and only the passage of time is required before the payment is made. Sales discounts are considered variable consideration and are reflected in the client’s invoices, therefore, discounts are recorded at the time of sale, that is, revenue is recorded net of discounts. The list price is already discounted; therefore, make an estimate is not needed. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 141 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S Accounting policy applied up to December 31, 2017: Revenue is comprised of the fair value of the compensation received or to be received on the sale of goods during the normal course of operations. Income is shown net of returns and discounts, and after eliminating inter-company sales. Revenue is recognized when the following conditions are met: • The risks and benefits of ownership are transferred. • The amount of the revenue can be measured reasonably. • Future economic benefits are likely to flow to the Company. • The Company retains no implication related to the property or effective control of the goods sold. • Costs incurred or to be incurred, in connection with the transaction can be measured reliably. aa. Earnings per share The basic profit per share is calculated dividing the net profit attributable to the controlling interest by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the year. The amounts used in the determination of the basic profit per share are adjusted on the basis of the diluted profits from taking into account the weighted average of the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding, assuming the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. bb. Bottler incentive agreement At its discretion, and as per the bottler’s incentive agreement, TCCC provides the Company a number of incentives, including contributions for the maintenance of equipment of cold drinks, advertising and marketing expenses, and others. The terms and conditions of those agreements require reimbursement when certain stipulated conditions are not met, including minimum volume performance requirements. Incentives provided by TCCC for maintenance of beverage refrigeration equipment and/or advertising and marketing expenses are deducted from the respective expense. NOTE 4 RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I. RISK MANAGEMENT The Company’s operations are exposed to different financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and risk for price of production materials and other production materials), credit risk and liquidity risk. It is Company policy to contract derivative financial instruments held only for hedging, in order to reduce the risks related to its financial liabilities, and to cover certain purchases, projected operations and firm commitments set in foreign currencies. The exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks is managed through the Company’s Financial Risk Committee. The company’s main exposure to financial risk is mainly related to the security liabilities at variable interest rates and to present or future currency commitments, all related to its line of business or certain forecasted operations, such as prices of raw material and other production materials, accounts receivable from customers and liquidity. The Company has current Master Agreements for Derivative Financial Instrument Operations or ISDA Master Agreements in order to ensure that a number of quotations are available when deciding whether to carry out transactions with instruments of that type, which are used only for raw material exchange rate price coverage, and are documented in simple instruments such as swaps and forwards. The company’s operations with swaps allow only the conversion of different currencies or interest rates (variable or fixed or vice versa). All the Company’s derivative financial instrument operations are previously analyzed, approved and periodically monitored by the Financial Risk Committee. That committee submits proposals to the General Director, who in turn periodically informs the Board of Directors. Both the Financial Risk Committee and the General Director review the performance of those instruments on a quarterly basis, and make any required advance cancellations, changes in term, etc. The Company’s derivative financial instrument operations are contracted and managed by the corporate office, which contracts any necessary transactions for its subsidiary companies which do not contract this type of operations individually. CL and CCSWB are exceptions to that rule, i.e., they handle their own operations. The Company operates that type of agreement with recognized banking and financial entities with a robust operating and financial structure. Market risk a. Foreign currency risk (exchange rate) The foreign currency risk is related to the risk of the fair value of future cash flows from a financial instruments fluctuating due to changes in the exchange rate. The Company is exposed to exchange rate risks stemming from: a) its net exposure of foreign 142 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L currency assets and liabilities, b) income from export sales; c) purchases of raw materials, production materials and capital investments made in foreign currencies, and d) the net investment in subsidiaries and joint operations held abroad. The Company’s greatest exchange risk exposure is the exchange rate of the Mexican peso to the US dollar, the Peruvian sol and the Argentine peso for conversion of investments to the reporting currency. It is Company policy to operate mainly in the markets in which its subsidiaries reside. Accordingly, debt is contracted in said markets’ local currency, except Peru (Note 21 v.). Net sales are expressed in Mexican pesos, Argentine pesos, US dollars and Peruvian soles. During 2018 and 2017, 40.08% and 41.77% of sales were generated in Mexican pesos, 5.11% and 7.72% in Argentine pesos, 44.07% and 38.25% in US dollars, and 10.74% and 12.26% in Peruvian soles. Those are the functional currencies of each of the consolidating entities (see Note 30). Following is the Company’s exposure to exchange risk at December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. The enclosed tables show the book value of the Company’s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Figures in thousands of Mexican pesos At December 31, 2018 2017 US ARGENTINE PERUVIAN US ARGENTINE PERUVIAN DOLLAR PESO SOL DOLLAR PESO SOL Monetary assets $ 19,011,822 $ 1,667,814 $ 3,266,166 $ 15,246,776 $ 2,471,270 $ 3,437,796 Monetary (12,999,022) (1,263,591) (4,013,324) (13,477,451) (2,056,695) (4,584,444) liabilities Non-current monetary (25,604,347) (167,970) (1,843,885) (25,585,127) (2,013,006) (2,178,777) liabilities Net position ($ 19,591,547) $ 236,253 ($ 2,591,043) ($ 23,815,802) ($ 1,598,431) ($ 3,325,425) Following is a sensitivity analysis related to the adverse impact on the comprehensive income the Company would have due to its exposure to the net foreign currency position at December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively: Hypothetical variation (maintaining all other variables constant) 2018 2017 One-peso increase to the dollar ($ 996,691) ($ 1,206,755) A 50-cent increase/decrease with respect to the Argentine peso (225,906) 754,120 A 50-cent increase / decrease with respect to the Peruvian sol 222,007 273,019 This exposure is to the movements in exchange rates related to conversion from US dollars, Argentine pesos and Peruvian soles to Mexican pesos of the results, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in the US, Argentina, Ecuador and Peru. As detailed later in this Note, the Company also contracts coverage derivative financial instruments to cover certain commitments in foreigncurrency involving the purchase of raw materials and other production materials. The Company does not cover the risks related to conversion of its subsidiaries and joint operations, the effects of which are recorded in stockholders’ equity. The intrinsic value of foreign currency options is determined with respect to the spot exchange rate of the relevant market. The difference between the exercise rate contracted and the market’s discounted spot exchange rate is determined as the time value. It is discounted when it is material. Changes in the time value of options related to hedged elements are deferred in the costs of the hedging reserve in capital and the time value is amortized linearly to income. See Note 21 for further information on foreign currency risk hedging instruments. b. Interest rate risk The interest rate risk arises mainly from the Company’s sources of financing. The main exposure comes from variable interest rate obligations based on the TIIE (Interbank interest rate) and bank debt subject to LIBOR interest. Fixed rates expose the company to the fair value risk. The Company occasionally enters into derivative financial instrument agreements with a view to minimizing the market risk and the potential effects arising from a significant rise in interest rates. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 143 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S The derivative financial instruments occasionally contracted by the Company are interest rate swaps on security liabilities subject to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company maintains an interest rate swaps to hedge $1,000,000 from variable rate to fixed rate at 7.369% (see Note 13). At December 31, 2018 and 2017, a large part of the debt, considering its value in pesos, was referred to a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 $40,816 and $37,685 million representing 73% and 68% of the overall debt, was referenced to a fixed interest rate. In order to manage interest rate risks, Company policy is designed to reduce volatility of its financial expenses and keep an ideal percentage of debt in fixed rate instruments. The financial position is mainly fixed as a result of the use of long and short term debt and the occasional use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps. The terms and conditions of the Company’s obligations at December 31, 2018 and 2017, including exchange rates, interest rates, maturities and effective interest rates, are described in detail in Note 13. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, if the TIIE or the LIBOR increased 100 base points (1.00%), maintaining all other constant risk factors, the detrimental impact on comprehensive income would have been $133,045 and $14,693 ($99,149 and $15,240 in 2017), respectively. See Note 21 for further information on foreign currency risk hedging instruments. c. Risk of price of raw materials The main exposure to changes in the prices of raw materials and other production materials has to do with the supply of sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers used in the production of soft drinks. The main raw materials and other production materials are concentrates acquired from TCCC, sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers. The Company is exposed to the risk of exchange fluctuations related to the prices of sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers, which, in the aggregate, represent approximately 23% of the cost of sales of beverages at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Company contracts hedges for the purchase of these raw materials and other production materials with a view to offsetting the effect of variations in exchange rates (see Note 21). At December 31, 2018, appreciation of one Mexican pesos or one Peruvian to the US dollar, with all other variables remaining constant, would have had a negative impact on valuation of derivative financial instruments in stockholders’ equity of $5,123 and $1,116, respectively. The impact on net income for the period would not be material because the instruments exposing the Company to those risks are under highly effective cash flow hedging. See Note 21 for further information on instruments for hedging against the risk of raw and other production materials. Credit risk Regular operations expose the Company to potential default when its customers and counterparties are unable to comply with their financial or other commitments. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into transactions with a wide range of counterparties and considers that third parties that could affect its operations are unlikely to give rise to unexpected financial difficulties. The Company has established conservative policies for the management of cash and temporary investments which make it possible to minimize the risk arising from that type of financial asset, aside from which, operations are conducted only with highly accredited financial entities. The risk exposure related to accounts receivable is limited, given the large number of customers located in different parts of Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and the US; however, the Company maintains certain reserves for impairment losses of accounts receivable from customers. Risk control includes determining the credit standing of the customer, taking into account its financial situation, past experience and other factors. Given the fact that a significant portion of the Company’s customers have no independent rating of their credit standing, management determines the maximum rated risk for each, considering their financial position and past experiences, among other factors. Credit limits are set in accordance with policies established by management, which applies controls to ensure compliance. During 2018 and 2017, approximately 50% and 53%, respectively, of the Company’s sales were in cash. As much as 40.5% and 35.9% of net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively, were made to institutional customers. See Note 8 for further information on credit risk. 144 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L Liquidity risk The Company finances its liquidity requirements and capital resources mainly through the cash generated from operations and debt and private bonds issued at short medium and long term. The Company has access to local and international bank credit to cover its treasury requirements, aside from which, it has been assigned the highest rating for Mexican issuers (AAA) and a rating of A and A2, both issued by independent rating agencies, which makes it possible to evaluate local and international capital markets in the event that resources are needed. The Company’s cash surpluses are invested according to the guidelines established by the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Planning and Finance Committee. The Financial Risk Committee, comprising basically executives from the Financial and Planning Management areas, decides on a series of custodian entities of proven prestige and liquidity. Foreigncurrency investments in specific projects are authorized only in US dollars or euros. The Company does not invest in capital markets or investment companies and repos operations are entered into only with federal Mexican and US government paper. Those operations are conducted with the largest and most prestigious banks in Mexico. The foreign banks in which investments can be made are those with the greatest international coverage. Investments are made in Federal Government and Bank Debt Securities. AC does not invest in Private and/or Corporate Paper. The factors that could reduce the sources of liquidity include a significant reduction in demand or the price of its products, which could limit the amount of cash generated from its operations, and a reduction in the corporate credit rating, which could impair the Company’s liquidity and increase its new debt costs. The Company’s liquidity is also be affected by factors such as depreciation or appreciation of the peso and changes in interest rates. Company settles obligations with cash flows arising from operations. The Company’s remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities, which include basically capital and interest payable in the future up to the date of maturity at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are: UNDER 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 OVER 5 TOTAL YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS At December 31, 2018 Current and non-current debt $ 6,170,583 $ 27,800,510 $ 11,278,727 $ 31,192,028 $ 76,441,848 Suppliers, related parties, derivative financial instruments and sundry 12,825,615 6,034 12,831,649 creditors $ 18,996,198 $ 27,800,510 $ 11,284,761 $ 31,192,028 $ 89,273,497 At December 31, 2017 Current and non-current debt $ 5,393,492 $ 24,445,482 $ 14,236,870 $ 35,425,577 $ 79,501,421 Suppliers, related parties, derivative financial instruments and sundry 11,070,977 443,789 11,514,766 creditors $ 16,464,469 $ 24,445,482 $ 14,680,659 $ 35,425,577 $ 91,016,187 At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has not unused credit facilities. ii. Capital management The Company goal in managing its capital (which includes stockholders’ equity, debt, working capital, and cash and cash equivalents) is to maintain a flexible capital structure that will reduce the capital cost to an acceptable level of risk, protect the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern, and to take advantage of strategic opportunities that will allow it to generate returns for the shareholders. The Company manages its capital structure and adjusts it when changes arise in economic conditions and in the risk features of the underlying assets. The Company monitors capital based on the net debt to capital ratio. That ratio is calculated through the net debt divided by stockholders’ equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. The net debt is calculated by subtracting the cash and cash equivalents balance from the total debt (including the current and non-current portions, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position). 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 145 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S.

AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S The Net Debt to Capital ratio at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows: At December 31, 2018 2017 Total debt (Note 13) $ 55,826,808 $ 55,122,798 Less: Cash and cash equivalents (15,940,867) (23,841,697) Net debt $ 39,885,941 $ 31,281,101 Total stockholders’ equity $ 139,529,516 $ 141,576,287 Net Debt Ratio 28.59% 22.09 NOTE 5 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATIONS AND JUDGMENTS: The Company has identified certain key accounting estimations on which its financial condition and results of operations depend. Those accounting estimations normally involve an analysis or are based on subjective judgments or decisions that require management to make estimations and assumptions affecting the figures reported in these consolidated financial statements. The Company’s estimates are based on historical information when applicable, and other assumptions considered reasonable in the circumstances. Current results can differ from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions. Furthermore, estimations normally require adjustments based on changing circumstances and on securing more recent or more accurate information. When preparing these consolidated financial statements, the most critical accounting estimations under IFRS are those requiring management to prepare estimations and assumptions affecting the reported figures involved in determining the value in use for identification of impairment of indefinite-life intangible assets, fair-value accounting for financial instruments, goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets such as the result of business acquisitions and pension benefits. A. ESTIMATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FIGURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: i. Estimated impairment of indefinite-life intangible assets. The identification and measurement of impairment in indefinite-life intangible assets, including goodwill, involves the estimation of fair value (value in use or fair value). Those estimations and assumptions could have a significant impact on the decision as to whether or not to recognize a charge for impairment and on the magnitude of that charge. The Company analyzes valuation considering relevant internal information as well as public market information. Fair value estimations are mainly determined on the basis of discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Those approaches use significant estimations and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including terms), discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, multiples of exit cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparable and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparable. Certain level of risk inherent in these estimates and assumptions that the Company considers has been made in its valuations is possible, since in case the actual results were lower than the estimates an impairment charge would have to be recorded. ii. Business combinations assigning purchase price For business combinations, IFRS require the calculation of fair value, assigning fair value to the purchase price of the assets and liabilities acquired. Any differences between the acquisition cost and the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Fair value is calculated on the acquisition date. As a result of the nature of the fair value evaluation at the acquisition date, determination of fair value of the consideration paid in own shares or equity units, assignment of the purchase price and determination of the fair value requires significant estimations based on a wide range of certain variables in effect at particular point in time. Management uses all available information when determining fair value. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, management has used that basis to determine fair value of the CCSWB consideration as well as the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in other business combinations, as shown in Note 2. iii. Pension benefits The present value of pension-related obligations depends on the number of factors determined on an actuarial basis, using a number of different assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) of/for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. 146 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L The Company determines the proper discount rate at each year end. That rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle pension plan obligations. To determine the proper discount rate, the Company considers the discount interest rate as per IAS 19 “Associate benefits”, expressed in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid, at maturity dates approximating the dates pertaining to the pension obligation (see Note 17). B. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: i. Investment in associated companies Management has evaluated the level of influence exercised by the Company on its investment in Jugos del Valle, S. A. P. I. and has determined that it exercises significant influence, although it shareholding is below 20%, given its representation on the Board of Directors and certain contractual terms. Consequently, that investment has been classified as an associate. ii. Interest in joint operation Management has evaluated the terms and conditions contained in the stockholders’ agreement for joint agreement of JV Toni, S.L. in Holding Tonicorp, S.A. (Tonicorp) and has concluded that it should be classified as a Joint Operation because it considers that the design and purpose require AC’s beverage business in Ecuador to acquire, distribute and market the Tonicorp production, thus transferring to the two stockholders jointly controlling the agreement substantially the rights to the benefits and liability obligations of Tonicorp and its subsidiaries, which according to IFRS 11 ,” Joint Agreements, requires the agreement to be classified as such (see Note 30). iii. Useful lives of intangible assets The Company’s indefinite life intangible assets include the aforementioned bottler agreements entered into between AC and TCCC, which have specific expiration dates and do not guarantee they are perpetual; however, based on own experience, during the business relationship of over 90 years with TCCC, and market evidence, the Company considers it will continue to renew these agreements and has thus assigned them as indefinite life intangible assets (see Note 28). iv. Topo Chico brand name sales transactions The determination of whether or not the sale transactions of the Topo Chico brands which are described in Note 29, formed part of the business combination with CCSWB required the use of significant judgment by Management. Had these transactions been considered part of the business combination, the accounting treatment would have been similar to the current treatment, as per IFRS 3. NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING: Segment reporting is presented consistently with the internal reports provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the highest authority for making operating decisions, allocation the resources and evaluating the operating segments’ yield. An operating segment is defined as a component of an entity on which there is separate financial information which is evaluated on a regular basis. The Company controls and evaluates its continuous operations from both a geographic and product perspective. Management considers performance in Mexico, the US, Ecuador, Argentina and Peru. From the perspective of the product, management considers beverages and other products in those geographic areas separately, as well as the NPSG operations described in Note 29. Segments, by product to be reported by the Company, are: • Beverages (including carbonated, non-carbonated and dairy beverages and purified water in individual): This segment produces, distributes and sells TCCC brand beverages in different territories in Mexico, the US, Argentina, Ecuador and Peru as well as Santa Clara dairy beverages in Mexico and Toni in Ecuador. The Company’s portfolio of beverages and dairy products includes cola and flavored soft drinks, individual purified and flavored water, dairy beverages and other carbonated and noncarbonated beverages in sundry presentations. • NPSG: This segment presents income from the manufacture and supply of products to other bottlers in the territory of the US, as described in Note 29. • Other segments complementary businesses: This section represents operating segments that are not considered reportable segments on an individual basis, as they do not meet the quantitative limits, as established in the standard applicable to any of the years reported on. In accordance with this standard, the operating segments whose total income is equal to or under 10% of the Company’s total income need not be reported individually and can be grouped with other operating segments that do not meet the 10% limit, provided the sum of these grouped operating segments does not exceed 25% of total income. These segments comprise the following complementary businesses: a. Beverages in the individual format that are marketed in vending machines (Mexico and Peru). b. Snack food (Mexico, Ecuador, Peru and the US). 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 147 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S The Company evaluates the performance of each of the operating segments based on profits before the net financial results, taxes, depreciation, amortization (operating flow or EBITDA), considering that said indicator represents a good measure for evaluating the operating performance and the capability to satisfy capital and interest obligations with respect to the Company’s debt, as well as the capability to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. However, the EBITDA is not a financial performance measure under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to net income when measure operating performance, or to cash flows when measuring liquidity. The Company has defined the EBITDA or operating flow as a consolidated operating profit (loss) after adding or subtracting the following, as the case may be: (1) depreciation, amortization, and (2) non-recurring expenses incurred (such as severance, business combination expenses among others, classified in the Other expenses line item, net in the statement of income).

Accounts receivable are denominated in the following currencies: At December 31, 2018 2017 Mexican pesos $ 5,201,558 $ 3,043,162 Peruvian soles 1,164,118 1,021,925 Argentine pesos 540,964 486,920 US dollars 6,125,320 6,766,383 $ 13,031,960 $ 11,318,390 Impairment of clients Clients are subject to the expected credit losses model. The Company applies the simplified approach contained in IFRS 9 for measuring expected credit losses, using an expected loss provision over the lifetime of the instrument for all accounts receivable from customers. In order to measure expected credit losses, accounts receivable from customers have been grouped on the basis of their shared credit risk features and days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the profiles for payment of sales in a 24-month period prior to December 31, 2018 or January 1, 2018, respectively, and on historical credit losses experienced within that period. Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and prospective information on macroeconomic factors affecting client capacity to settle the accounts receivable. On that basis, the provision for losses at December 31, 2018 and at January 1, 2018 (for adoption of IFRS 9) was determined as follows for accounts receivable from customers: MORE 1 TO 30 31 TO 60 61 TO 90 91 TO DECEMBER 31, OTHER THAN 180 CURRENT DAYS DAYS DAYS 180 DAYS TOTAL 2018 CURRENT DAYS PAST PAST DUE PAST DUE PAST DUE PAST DUE DUE Average rate of 1.40% 1.40% 1.40% 1.40% 1.40% 78.40% expected loss Gross book amount of ac$ 215,206 $ 7,364,373 $ 923,465 $ 190,259 $ 128,331 $ 155,561 $ 492,100 $ 9,469,295 counts receivable Loss provision $ ($ 70,127) ($ 12,980) ($ 3,826) ($ 3,187) ($ 4,312) ($ 308,490) ($ 402,922) 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 151 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S.

Indicators showing that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the fact that the debtor suggests no payment plan to the Company and the impossibility of making contractual payments over a period of more than 180 days past due. Impairment losses from accounts receivable and contract assets are shown as net impairment losses under operating income. Subsequent recovery of amounts previously canceled are credited to the same line. The previous accounting policy for the impairment of accounts receivable In the preceding year, impairment of accounts receivable was evaluated on the basis of the incurred loss model. Individual accounts receivable known to be uncollectible were canceled, reducing the book value directly. Other accounts receivable was evaluated collectively to determine whether or not there was objective evidence of impairment; however, none had yet been identified. For these accounts receivable, estimated impairment losses were recognized in a separate provision for impairment. The Companies considered there was evidence of impairment if any of the following indicators was present: • Significant financial difficulties of the debtor; • Probability that the debtor filing for bankruptcy or conducting a financial reorganization, and • Default or delays in payments. Movements in the provisions for customer impairment at December 31, 2017 were as follows: 2017 Beginning balance $ 417,767 Provision for customer impairment 120,745 Accounts receivable written-off during the year (52,150) Increase due to business combination 38,497 Ending balance $ 524,859 The accounts receivable for which an impairment provision was recognized were canceled against the provision when there was no expectation of recovering an additional amount in cash. 152 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L B. CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Upon adopting IFRS 15, the Company changed the presentation of some amounts in the statement of financial position and reclassified, to the contract assets line item, unamortized amounts related to payments made to customers to obtain contracts (shown as prepayments at December 31, 2017). These assets are amortized by the straight-line method over the terms of the specific contracts they refer to. Balances at December 31, 2018 in the statement of financial position total $169,310, shown as contract assets. At December 31, 2017, contract assets of $147,839 are shown in other financial assets at their amortized cost. (See Note 31, point a.) These assets are tested for impairment together with the accounts receivable from customers to which they are related. Accordingly, the Company modified the presentation of amounts in the statement of financial position and reclassified, to the contract liabilities caption, liability amounts arising from discounts on volume and reimbursements shown previously as other current liabilities. Balances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 in the statement of financial position total $83,224, shown as contract liabilities and $81,174 (other current liabilities), respectively. C. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTIZED COST Other assets at amortized cost, which includes accounts receivable from related parties, are also subject to impairment requirements under IFRS 9. The impairment loss identified is immaterial. D. OTHER NON-CURRENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE The other non-current accounts receivable balance shown at December 31, 2018 is mainly comprised as follows: At December 31, 2018 2017 Guarantees received for the Famaillá sugar mill $ 109,638 $ 222,185 Other 778,133 343,858 $ 887,771 $ 566,043 NOTE 9 INVENTORIES: Inventories are analyzed as follows: At December 31, 2018 2017 Raw materials $ 2,594,456 $ 2,657,116 Finished products 3,367,582 3,261,787 Materials and spare parts 1,772,730 1,724,448 Products in process 63,267 74,583 $ 7,798,035 $ 7,717,934 For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, $77,626,891 and $66,278,889 was applied to income, respectively, corresponding to inventories consumed.

Goodwill acquired from business combinations is assigned at the acquisition date to the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the synergies arising from said combinations. The book value of goodwill assigned to the different CGUs or groups of CGUs are as follows: CASH GENERATING UNIT 2018 2017 (1) Beverages Mexico $ 7,835,007 $ 7,835,007 Beverages US 21,463,614 21,081,193 Beverages Peru 9,550,429 9,967,187 Beverages Ecuador 8,333,175 8,366,581 Beverages Argentina 2,660,159 900,148 Wise Foods 2,263,940 2,074,683 Inalecsa 967,634 971,513 Toni 1,473,729 1,479,637 Norco 363,610 379,477 Deep River 924,220 1,031,362 Nayhsa 256,773 256,773 Other 213,350 $ 56,305,640 $ 54,343,561 (1) Revised to incorporate reclassifications arising from 2017 business combination. At December 31, 2018, except for Beverages Ecuador and Toni CGUs, the estimation of the recovery value of the CGUs identified was conducted through the value in use, using the revenue approach. The value in use was determined by discounting future cash flows generated by the continuous use of the CGUs, using the following key assumptions, among others: Range among CGUs 2018 2017 Rate of growth in volume 2.0% 4.8% 2.1% 5.5% Rate of growth in income 6.7% 11.7% 6.6% 15.6% Operating margin (as a % of income) 5.3% 23.0% 7.5% 22.2% Other operating costs 4.8% 24.8% 5.3% 18.1% Annual CAPEX (as a % of income) 9.9% 2.1% 3.2% 9.3% Rate for long term growth 4.7% 11.9% At December 31, 2018 and 2017: • The determination of cash flows is based on the financial projections approved by Management for a five-year period and considering a multiple of operating cash flow to perpetuity and are dependent on the expected growth rates of the volume, which are based in historical performances and the expectation of growth of the industry in which AC operates. • The discount rate was calculated based on the weighted average of the capital (at market value) of the cost of all sources of financing that form part of the capital structure of CGUs (liabilities with cost and shareholding capital) and reflect the specific risks related to AC’s relevant operating segments. • The volume of sales is the average growth rate over the five year projection period. It is based on past performance and Management expectations for market development. • The sales price is the average growth rate over the five year projection period. It is based on actual industry trends and includes long-term inflation forecasts for each territory. 160 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L • The operating margin corresponds to the average margin as a percentage of income over the five-year projection period. It is based on actual sales margin levels and product mixture. Given the nature of the operation, no increases are expected in the cost of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers, which may have required an adjustment in the determination of future margins. • Other operating costs are fixed costs of CGUs, as a percentage of income, which do not differ significantly from sales volumes and prices. Management projected those costs on the basis of the current business structure, and adjusted increases for inflation. They do not reflect any future restructuring or cost reduction measures. The percentages disclosed above are the average of other operating costs for the five-year projected period with respect to income. • Annual CAPEX represents the percentage of income for investing in machinery and equipment in order to maintain operations at current levels. It is based on historical management experience and on plans for machinery and equipment replacement as required in accordance with the Coca-Cola System. No incremental income or cost reductions are assumed in the value-inuse model as a result of these investments. Values in use resulting from impairment calculations for all Company CGUs, prepared on the aforementioned basis, exceed the book value of each of the CGUs, as shown below: % of value in use over book value CASH GENERATING UNIT 2018 2017 Beverages Mexico 333% 278% Beverages Ecuador (1) 10% Beverages Peru 45% 30% Beverages Argentina 217% 1,127% Wise Foods 4% 21% Inalecsa 37% 18% Toni (1) 55% Nayhsa 189% 228% (1) Determined at fair value. Management considers that a possible change in key assumptions used, within a reasonable range surrounding same, would not result in the book value of the CGUs materially exceeding value in use. As a result of the macroeconomic, political and social factors occurred in Ecuador in 2018, the cash flow projections of the businesses in this country were affected, therefore the Company complemented the impairment analysis with the fair value method, different from the value of use, prepared using more conservative bases for the Ecuador Beverages CGU. The additional calculation was made by evaluating the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCOD) of the underlying assets. The valuation is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to non-observable data used in the valuation. In the case of Toni CGU, management decided to carry out the same approach in order to detect any possible impairment. No impairment was identified in any CGU. Management approach and the main assumption used to determine FVLCOD of the CGUs was EBITDA multiples, which the Administration considers to be and acceptable factor in the beverage industry.

Associated risks As concerns the defined benefit pension plan and major medical expense plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are listed below: Asset volatility Labor liability obligations are calculated at a discount rate determined as per IAS 19. If plan assets show returns below that rate, the difference is recorded as a deficit. The Company intends to reduce the risk level to a minimum, through investment in assets with a profile similar to the liabilities in question, and considers that due to the long-term nature of the labor obligations and to AC’s strength, the level of investment in capital instruments is a relevant element that forms part of the Company’s long-term strategy, with a view to managing the plans efficiently. Changes in the discount rate A decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in plan obligations. However, that would be partially offset by the increase in value of bonds held by those plans. Inflation risk Certain labor obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation would result in an increase in plan obligations. Life expectancy Most plan obligations give rise to benefits for their members, which means that an increase in life expectancy would lead to an increase in plan obligations. The Company has modified none of the processes and activities involved in managing the aforementioned risks in relation to prior years. Investments are diversified, and therefore, circumstances relating to any investment would have no significant impact on the value of plan assets.

Among other effects, it reduced the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning as from January 1, 2018. That required the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new rates at the date that Act went into effect. The effect of that adjustment to the corporate tax rate at our US subsidiaries was a reduction in the deferred tax liability of approximately $4,434,255, with the respective benefit in the provision for taxes on income for the year 2017. The deferred income tax asset arising from unamortized tax losses is recorded as the respective tax benefit to be realized via future tax profits becomes likely. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $225,080 for 2018 and $177,524 for 2017, with respect to remaining tax losses of $1,032,338 for 2018 and $507,299 for 2017, which can be amortized against future tax profits. At December 31, 2018, accrued unamortized tax losses of the Mexican entities totaling $366 expire in 2028 and those of the foreign entities totaling $1,031,972 expire from 2019 to 2027. At December 31, 2018, the Company has not recorded estimated deferred tax liabilities of approximately $2,422 million ($3,764 million in 2017) arising from the difference between the tax cost of the shares of subsidiaries and the value of net consolidated assets, mainly due to undistributed profits and exchange effect, among others, because based on the exception applicable to the Company, it considers that it will not sell its investments in subsidiaries any time in the near future and has the policy of paying dividends to its subsidiaries only up to the amounts on which tax has been paid. NOTE 19 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY: At the April 26, 2018 General Ordinary Stockholders’ Meeting (April 27, 2017), it was agreed to pay cash dividends from the CUFIN equivalent to $2.2 pesos per share ($2 pesos in 2017) on all shares issued at that date, totaling $3,881,423, which were paid beginning on May 9, 2018 ($3,528,566 in 2017). The Company’s capital stock at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was comprised as follows: Subscribed capital stock Number of shares (a) FIXED VARIABLE TOTAL Total shares at December 31, 2016 902,816,289 802,568,639 1,705,384,928 Increase in shares at January 2, 2017 58,898,228 58,898,228 Total shares at December 31, 2017 902,816,289 861,466,867 1,764,283,156 Total shares at December 31, 2018 902,816,289 861,466,867 1,764,283,156 (a) The Company’s capital stock consists of a single series of ordinary, nominative shares with no par value, and no restrictions on holding. They confer the same rights to their holders. In accordance with the Mexican Corporations Law, the net profit for the year is subject to the legal provision that requires that at least 5% of the net profit of each year be allocated to increase the legal reserve until it is equal to one fifth of the social capital paid. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the legal reserve amounts to $1,726,046 and is included in retained earnings. 176 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L At December 31, 2018, 4,733,389 own shares are retained in the repurchasing fund. As part of the restructuring agreement signed on April 8, 2016 to acquire the non-controlling portion of the subsidiaries Arca Ecuador and Arca Argentina, Spanish companies, the merger of AC and Carismed XXI, S. de R.L. de C.V. went into effect on January 2, 2017, (a company previously holding 25% of the Arca Continental Argentina shares). As a result of the merger, 58,898,228 new shares were issued with a fair value of $6,352,763 corresponding to the value determined with reference to the price of the AC shares at January 2, 2017. The difference between the fair value and the book value of the non-controlling interest is shown under retained earnings in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2017. The Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% tax on profits generated as from 2014 paid to parties resident abroad and to Mexican individuals in the form of dividends. That tax must be withheld by the Company and is considered a definitive tax. However, the Company’s retained earnings up to December 31, 2013 are supported by the balance of the CUFIN (previously taxed retained earnings), and will therefore not be subject to said withholding. Dividends are not subject to income tax if paid from the aforementioned CUFIN. Dividends in excess of that account are subject to 42.86% tax if paid in 2019. Tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against income tax for the current period or for the following two periods. According to the Mexican Income Tax Law, in the event of a capital reduction, any excess of stockholders’ equity over capital contributions, restated for inflation (CUCA), is accorded the same tax treatment as dividends, provided the Company lacks sufficient CUFIN balances to offset the deemed dividend. At December 31, 2018, the tax value of the CUFIN and the value of the CUCA total $32,788,774(*) and $31,104,335, respectively. (*) Stemming from earnings at 2013 $9,506,162 and rest from subsequent years $23,282,612.

The Company holds the following financial instruments: December 31, 2018 FINANCIAL ASSETS CURRENT NON-CURRENT TOTAL Financial assets at amortized cost: Cash and cash equivalents $ 15,940,867 $ $ 15,940,867 Clients and other accounts receivable 11,173,340 11,173,340 Contract assets 106,359 62,951 169,310 Related parties 299,622 299,622 Prepayments 386,551 386,551 Financial assets at fair value with changes in OCI: Derivative hedging instruments (1) 4,171 98,414 102,585 $ 27,910,910 $ 161,365 $ 28,072,275 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CURRENT NON-CURRENT TOTAL Financial liabilities at amortized cost: Debt $ 2,671,954 $ 53,154,854 $ 55,826,808 Factoring 811,501 811,501 Suppliers, related parties, sundry creditors 11,903,355 11,903,355 Contract liabilities 83,224 83,224 Financial liabilities at fair value with changes in OCI: Derivative hedging instruments (1) 110,759 6,034 116,793 $ 15,580,793 $ 53,160,888 $ 68,741,681 At December 31, 2017 FINANCIAL ASSETS CURRENT NON-CURRENT TOTAL Financial assets at amortized cost: Cash and cash equivalents $ 23,841,697 $ $ 23,841,697 Customers and other accounts receivable-Net 11,354,773 11,354,773 Related parties 110,975 110,975 Prepayments 709,556 709,556 Financial assets at fair value with changes in OCI: Derivative hedging instruments (1) 82,829 165,045 247,874 $ 36,099,830 $ 165,045 $ 36,264,875 178 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L At December 31, 2017 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CURRENT NON-CURRENT TOTAL Financial liabilities at amortized cost: Debt $ 1,785,229 $ 53,337,569 $ 55,122,798 Factoring 1,053,228 1,053,228 Suppliers, related parties, sundry creditors 10,013,031 10,013,031 Financial liabilities at fair value with changes in OCI: Derivative hedging instruments (1) 4,718 443,789 448,507 $ 12,856,206 $ 53,781,358 $ 66,637,564 (1) Classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 31 regarding the impact of the change in accounting policies following adoption of IFRS-9 “Financial instruments” in the classification of financial assets. The additional information related to the loan with related parties is detailed in Note 29. i. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other accounts receivable, suppliers, other accounts payable, current debt and other current liabilities, their book value is considered equal to their fair value. For most non-current accounts receivable and payable, fair values are also not significantly different from their book values. The estimated book value and fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are shown below: December 31, 2018 BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE Assets Derivative financial instruments $ 102,585 $ 102,585 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments $ 116,793 $ 116,793 Non-current debt $ 53,154,854 $ 53,384,378 At December 31, 2017 BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE Assets Derivative financial instruments $ 247,874 $ 247,874 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments $ 448,507 $ 448,507 Non-current debt $ 53,337,569 $ 62,116,185 iii. Impairment and exposure to risks Note 8 contains information on impairment of financial assets on the Company’s exposure to the credit risk. iii. Fair value hierarchy The Company applies the three-level hierarchy in measuring and disclosing fair value. Classification of an instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest value of significant data used in the valuation. Following is a description of the three levels of hierarchy: • Level 1 Prices quoted for identical instruments on active markets. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on prices quoted in the markets at the date of the statement of financial position. A market is considered to be active if quoted prices are clearly and regularly available through a stock exchange, trader, broker, industry group, price setting service or regulating body, and those prices currently and regularly reflect market transactions in conditions of independence. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 179 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S. A. B . D E C. V. AN D SU BS IDIA RIE S • Level 2 Prices quoted for similar instruments on active markets; prices quoted for identical or similar instruments on nonactive markets; and valuations through models where all significant data are observable on active markets. The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined via valuation methods. Those valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market information in cases where it is available and depends as little as possible on the entity’s specific estimations. If all significant data required to measure an instrument at fair value are observable, the instrument is classified in this Level. • Level 3 Valuations performed through techniques whereby one or more of the significant data are not observable. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. Company valuations consider relevant and observable market data to the extent possible. If one or more relevant variables is/are not based on observable market information, the instrument is included in Level 3. iv. Determination of fair value and measurement The Company generally uses quotations of market prices (when available) to determine fair value and classifies said data as Level 1. If market quotations are not available, fair value is determined using standard valuation models. When applicable, those models project future cash flows and discount future figures at observable data set at present value, including interest rates, exchange rates, volatility, etc. Items valued using said data are classified according to the lowest level of data that is significant for the valuation. Therefore, an item can be classified as Level 3, even when some of the significant data are observable. Additionally, the Company considers assumptions for its own credit risk, as well as for the risk of its counterparty. Assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost and at fair value are summarized at the top of this Note. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 nor between levels 2 and 3 in the periods shown. v. Derivative financial instruments The Company’s derivative financial operations have been privately concentrated at a number of financial entities whose financial soundness is supported by high ratings assigned by rating securities and credit risks entities. The documentation used to formalize operations is common documentation, as specified in the following contracts: Framework Contract For Derivative Financial Operations or ISDA Master Agreement, drawn up by the “International Swaps & Derivatives Association” (ISDA), accompanied by accessory documents used in this type of operations, generally known as “Schedule”, “Credit Support Annex” and “Confirmation”. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the following derivative financial instruments exist in Mexico: foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps; and in Peru, currency call spread, sugar hedge futures and coverage cross currency swap. At December 31, 2017, foreign currency forwards were held. In the US, currency forwards, aluminum and diesel hedge were held at December 31, 2018. Classification of derivatives Derivatives are only used for economic hedging and not as speculative investments. However, when derivatives fail to meet hedge accounting requirements, they are classified as “held for trade” for accounting purposes and are recognized at fair value with changes in income. They are shown as current assets and liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within the 12 months following the end of the reporting period. The Company holds the following derivative financial instruments: 180 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L a.

At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held cash flow hedging financial instruments corresponding to forwards and swaps, as well as sugar futures for hedging, aluminum and diesel swaps, which were determined to be highly effective. 182 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L For foreign currency hedges, the Company generates hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match the terms of the hedged item exactly. Therefore, the Company conducts a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item to the extent that the critical terms no longer match the critical terms of the hedging instrument exactly, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to evaluate effectiveness. In foreign currency hedges, ineffectiveness can arise if the moment of the forecast transaction changes from that originally estimated, or if there are changes in Mexico’s credit risk or of the counterpart. The Company contracts interest rate swaps with critical terms similar to those of the hedged item, such as the reference rate, the starting date, payment dates, maturities and the nominal amount. The Company does not hedge 100% of its loans, which means that the hedged item is identified as a portion of current loans in effect up to the nominal amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, the economic relationship was 100% effective. Hedging ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is evaluated using the same principles as those for hedging of purchases of foreign currencies. Can occur due to: • The adjustment to the creditor/debtor value in interest rate swaps that does not correspond to the loan, and • The differences in critical terms between interest rate swaps and the loans. There was no ineffectiveness during 2018 or 2017 with regard to the derivative financial instruments contracted by the group.

Income tax under the tax consolidation regime The Mexican Income Tax Law eliminates the tax consolidation regime. As a result of said elimination, the Company found it necessary to deconsolidate for tax purposes as from December 31, 2013. The last portion of tax payable on that deconsolidation amounting to $35,446 was paid to the Mexican tax authorities in April 2018. In 2018, the Company determined an individual tax profit of $85,930 (a tax profit of $5,316,088 in 2017). The tax result differs from the book result mainly due to items accrued over time and deducted differently for book and tax purposes, to recognition of the effects of inflation for tax purposes and to items only affecting the book or tax result. ii. Profit before taxes on income Following are the domestic and foreign components of pretax profits: For the year ended December 31, 2018 2017 Domestic $ 8,743,309 $ 13,162,274 Foreign 5,937,488 6,885,591 $ 14,680,797 $ 20,047,865 iii.

Those leases are for an approximate term of one to five years and most are renewable at the end of the lease period, at market conditions. The leasing expense charged to income is shown in Note 22. Total future minimum lease payments for the non-cancelable operating leases are as follows: 2018 Under 1 year $ 341,519 More than 1 year but less than 5 years 709,374 More than 5 years 7,214 Total $ 1,057,893 186 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L NOTE 28 CONTINGENCIES: BOTTLING AGREEMENTS The current bottling contracts and authorizations held by AC for the bottling and distribution of Coca-Cola products in the different regions are as follows: REGION DATE OF SIGNING / RENEWAL MATURITY DATE Mexico (North) July 1, 2017 June 30, 2027 Mexico (West) (1) July 1, 2017 June 30, 2027 Northeast Argentina June 30, 2017 January 1, 2022 Northwest of Argentina June 30, 2017 January 1, 2022 Ecuador (3) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2022 Peru January 31, 2016 April 30, 2020 Southwest US (2) April 1, 2017 April 1, 2027 Great Plains (2) August 25, 2017 April 1, 2027 (1) Correspond to the agreements held by AC to which AC Bebidas has access through a specific agreement contemplating the payment of royalties with respect to the total net sales generated in the western territory of Mexico. (2) In the United States there are two agreements for bottling, selling and marketing products in the Southwest of the United States, including Oklahoma City and Tulsa. These contracts are called “Comprehensive Beverage Agreement” and “Regional Manufacturing Agreement”, and have a term of 10 years with the possibility of renewing for another 10 years. (3) Corresponds to the agreement owned by AC, which grants AC Bebidas the benefit to carry out the sales generated by the Branch in Ecuador and the operation performed by the subsidiary Arcador in this country. Said benefit would be treated as a transaction between related parties. During the more than 90 years of business relations with TCCC, the latter has never refused to renew bottling agreements with AC or to enter into a new agreements to replace previous ones. As a result, indefinite useful lives were assigned to those intangibles (see Note 5). Management considers that TCCC will continue renewing contracts and extending bottling permits when they expire or will enter into new agreements or issue new permits to replace those currently in effect, although there is not absolute certainty that this will be the case. If that is not the case, the AC business and operating results will be adversely affected. TCCC provides the concentrates used in producing the products sold and is unilaterally entitled to set prices on said raw materials. If TCCC significantly increases concentrate prices, AC operating results could be negatively affected. Additionally, bottling agreements signed with TCCC establish that AC may bottle no beverages other than those of the CocaCola brand, with the exception of those specifically authorized in the aforementioned agreements. Up to the point at which the sales of the brands mentioned in Note 29 began, AC bottled and distributed several product of its own brand name (Topo Chico), with the authorization of TCCC. CONTINGENCIES IN PERU At December 31, 2018, a number of claims have been filed at the tax office and other judicial and labor processes have been brought by the Company for a total of approximately $547,953 (approximately $596,093 at December 31, 2017), which are pending a definitive sentence. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $157,763 ($165,407 at December 31, 2017); they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote or possible will be resolved favorably for the Company, which is why no provision has been created at December 31, 2018 (see Note 16). CONTINGENCIES IN ECUADOR At December 31, 2018, the Company has filed a number of claims at the tax office for a total of approximately $567,514 (approximately $850,458 in 2017), which are pending a definitive sentence. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $100,593; they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote or possible will be resolved favorably for the Company, although a provision was created at December 31, 2018 for $45,497. (See Note 16). CONTINGENCIES IN ARGENTINA At December 31, 2018, a number of claims have been filed at the tax office and other judicial, labor and administrative processes have been brought by the Company for a total of approximately $190,452 (approximately $343,680 at December 31, 2017), which are pending definitive sentences. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $33,330 ($60,251 at December 31, 2017); they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote will be resolved favorably for the Company, which is why no provision has been created at December 31, 2018. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 187 A RC A C ONTI NE NTAL , S.

Sale of Topo Chico brand names and distribution rights in Mexico and other countries On July 22, 2016, AC and its subsidiary Compañía Topo Chico, S. de R. L. de C.V. (Topo Chico) signed an agreement with TCCC assigning ownership of all the intellectual property rights, including brand names and formulas for producing Topo Chico products in Mexico and in other countries except the US, where the brand name was registered. As a result of that sale, AC received $1,488,176 (US$80,000) in cash and retained authorization for the distribution of Topo Chico products, under the bottling contracts in the regions in which it had been handling distribution up to that date, and was authorized to market Topo Chico mineral water in territories in addition to Mexico where the sale of Topo Chico is not allowed, i.e., in countries where AC operated. A supply agreement was also signed for the supply of Topo Chico mineral water to TCCC and its bottlers in Mexico. Sale of Topo Chico brand names and distribution rights in the US. On September 30, 2017, AC, AC Bebidas, Topo Chico and Interex Corp. (Interex) signed an agreement with TCCC to transfer ownership of all intellectual property rights, including Topo Chico brand names and formulas in the US (Topo Chico US) as well as the assets comprising the Topo Chico distribution business, which was owned by Interex Corp., for a cash price of $3,951,346 (US$217,132). As part of that agreement, a number of complementary agreements were signed, including a distribution agreement between a TCCC subsidiary and CCSWB for the latter to distribute Topo Chico mineral water exclusively in certain channels of that territory, as well as agreements for Topo Chico to continue bottling mineral water at its Monterey plant in order to cover demand for the product in Mexico and that of TCCC and its distributors in Mexico and the US, subject to capacity restrictions and an investment agreement, when necessary. 190 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L Because the Master Agreement and other agreements signed during the closing of the business combination with CCSWB required the parties to agree to that sale, the Company analyzed those agreements based on its terms and conditions and on background information, and concluded that this transaction must be recorded separately as per IFRS. National Product Supply Group (NPSG) in the US As part of the Framework Agreement and other agreements signed for the acquisition and operation of the Territory, as described in Note 2, on April 1, 2017, CCSWB signed the NPSG Governance Agreement, which was also signed by eight other Coca-Cola bottlers in the US, including Coca-Cola North America, which are considered to be Regional Producing Bottlers (RPBs) in the TCCC national supply system in the US. According to the NPSG Governance Agreement, TCCC and the RPBs have formed a national product supply group (the NPSG Board) composed of a CCSWB representative, a TCCC representative and one representative each of the remaining RPBs. That NPSG Board now has the maximum number of members (nine). The NPSG Agreements require the Company to comply with a product supply schedule to other RPBs, based on the needs of the US system, where the company does not unilaterally decide on respective volumes. This can give rise to revenue volatility in NPSG income. For the periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, they totaled $3,299,438 and $2,330,679, respectively. The Company evaluates the performance of its sales operations with third parties totally independently in the territory operated by CCSWB.

Impact on the financial statements As a result of the changes to the entity’s accounting policies, IFRS 15 and IFRS 9 were adopted, without reformulating comparative information. Therefore, the reclassifications and adjustments arising from these adoptions are not reflected in the statement of financial position at December 31, 2017, but are recognized in the opening statement of financial position at January 1, 2018. The following table shows the reclassifications and adjustments recognized by each item in said opening statement of financial position at January 1, 2018. Not included are the items that were not affected by the changes; therefore, the subtotals and totals disclosed cannot be recalculated from the figures provided.

IFRS-9 Financial instruments IFRS-9 replaces the pronouncements of International Accounting Standards (IAS) 39, which deals with recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, the disposal of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. Adoption of IFRS-9 Financial Instruments as from January 1, 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The new accounting policies are explained in Note 3. In accordance with the transitory pronouncement of IFRS-9, comparative figures were not reformulated. 194 A R C A C O N T I N E N TA L The total impact on the Company’s retained earnings at January 1, 2018 totaled $88,168, which corresponds entirely to the increase in the allowance for impairment of accounts receivable from clients. Classification and measurement On January 1, 2018 (date of initial application of IFRS-9), Company management determined the business models to be applied to its financial assets and has classified its financial instruments in appropriate categories in the terms of IFRS-9. On the date of initial application at January 1, 2018, Management evaluated the business models it applies to financial instruments held and has determined that classification thereof remains in the same measurement categories, as shown below: Category of measurement ORIGINAL IAS 39 NEW IFRS 9 CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS Cash and cash equivalents Amortized cost Amortized cost Clients and other accounts receivable Amortized cost Amortized cost Contract assets Amortized cost Amortized cost Related parties Amortized cost Amortized cost Prepayments Amortized cost Amortized cost Derivative financial instruments of hedging Fair value with changes in OCI Fair value with changes in OCI NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS Contract assets Amortized cost Amortized cost Derivative financial instruments of hedging Fair value with changes in OCI Fair value with changes in OCI CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES: Debt Amortized cost Amortized cost Factoring Amortized cost Amortized cost Suppliers, related parties and sundry creditors Amortized cost Amortized cost Contract liabilities Amortized cost Amortized cost Derivative financial instruments of hedging Fair value with changes in OCI Fair value with changes in OCI NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Debt Amortized cost Amortized cost Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps in effect at December 31, 2017 qualified as cash flow hedges under IFRS9. The Company’s risk management strategies and hedging documentation are in line with the requirements of IFRS-9, and therefore, these relationships are treated as continuous hedging. As a result of adopting IFRS-9 and of the fact that the Company excludes the time value of call spread hedging, the Company recognizes the changes in fair value of foreign currency options in the costs of the hedging reserve under stockholders equity and amortizes the time value linearly to income, as the option is considered to be related to a period of time. ii. Impairment of financial assets The Company has three types of financial assets subject to the new expected credit loss model of IFRS 9: • Accounts receivable from clients arising from sale of inventory • Contract assets • Debt instruments at amortized cost The Company was required to conduct a review of its impairment methodology in accordance with IFRS-9 for each of these types of assets. The impact of the change in impairment methodology on the Company’s retained earnings is disclosed in this note. Although cash and cash equivalents is also subject to the impairment requirements set forth in IFRS-9, no signs of impairment were identified. 2 0 1 8 I N T E G R AT E D A N N U A L R E P O R T Consolidated Financial Statements 195 Accounts receivable and contract assets The Company applies the simplified approach contained in IFRS-9 for measuring expected credit losses, which makes use of an expected loss provision over the lifetime of the instrument for all accounts receivable and contract assets. That gave rise to an $88,168 decrease in the provision for losses for accounts receivable and contract assets at January 1, 2018. Note 8 provides details concerning the calculation of that assignment. The provision for losses increased from $524,859 to $613,027 in accounts receivable and contract assets. Debt investments Debt investments at amortized cost are considered low risk, and therefore, the provision for impairment is determined as credit losses expected over 12 months. Application of the expected credit risk model did not give rise to recognition of a loss provision. c. IFRS-15 Revenue from contracts with customers The Company adopted IFRS-15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” as from January 1, 2018, when application of this standard became mandatory, using the modified retrospective method. The first step for applying IFRS-15 was to determine whether or not there is a contract in place and whether or not that contract was entered into with the customer. The assessment was made based on a portfolio of similar contract (or performance obligations). As from adoption of this standard, no significant impact has been identified beyond the reductions in revenue for 2017 of $352,721 and further disclosures. It was not necessary to make adjustments to the opening balance sheets, that affected the retained earnings caption, as the effects identified represented no changes in the 2017 net profits reported previously. The Company produces, distributes and sells beverages and dairy products in the Traditional channel (grocery stores, etc.) and Modern channel (self-service, convenience stores, consumer centers, etc). In both channels, sales are recognized when control of the products is transferred, which is when the products are delivered to the customer. No unsatisfied obligation has been identified, that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the products. The Company determined a single performance obligation corresponding to product delivery. Delivery is effective when the products are shipped to specific locations and the customer has accepted the products as per the formal or informal sales agreements or when there is objective evidence that all of the criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. Further to the above, it is concluded that the Company’s revenue is generated at a specific point in time. Retail customers and depending on the distribution channel, can be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, rebates on products, volume-based incentive programs and other similar programs. Product prices are set through a model of incidences and in some instances with TCCC’s participation. The amounts related to the considerations described above are considered variable under the IFRS-15 approach, and are therefore components of the price and are included as part of the Company’s net income at the end of each performance obligation. Total income recognized, including the effect of any variable consideration identified, cannot exceed the amount for which no significant reversal of income is likely to take place, when the uncertainties related to feasible considerations are resolved. As a result, the Company recognizes its income based on the amounts expected to be received, once the performance obligation has been satisfied. Sales discount are considered variable consideration and are reflected in the client’s invoices, therefore discounts are recorded at the time of sale, that is, revenue is recorded net of discounts. The list price is already discounted, therefore, make an estimate is not needed. Further to the above, IFRS-15 clarifies the classification of certain costs arising from agreements with customers.
