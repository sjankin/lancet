The accident on the 2nd of January does not change that. Our customers need to be able to take safety for granted but we must never do so.” Flemming Jensen, CEO Even if this annual report is for 2018, it would seem inappropriate not to mention that we had a serious accident in the beginning of 2019. On 2 January at 7:35 a.m., a fast train with 131 passengers was hit by parts of a freight train moving in the opposite direction. Eight passengers lost their lives and 16 were injured. This is the worst accident in over 30 years, and it has naturally had a deep impact on everyone in and around DSB. We would once again like to thank the train staff, the first responders and all the emergency response teams for the work they did during and after the accident. We would also like to express our sympathy to our passengers and the families of the deceased and stress that we are, of course, doing everything we can to help the authorities in their continued investigation of the chain of events leading up to the accident. It is still even with the accident safe to travel by train. Our customers need to be able to take safety for granted but we must never do so. Finances In 2018, DSB achieved a profit before tax of DKK 568 million compared to DKK 274 in 2017. This improvement is due to non-recurring items see table 1 in the financial management’s review, which illustrates this in detail. Adjusted for non-recurring items, the result amounts to DKK 247 million, which is DKK 301 million lower than in 2017. The most important factor in this lower result is the reduced contract payment of DKK 207 million less. In December 2017, the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing and DSB signed a supplementary contract to the current 10-year traffic contract. The Contents 3 supplementary contract reduces the contract payments by a total of DKK 2.3 billion for the remaining period of the traffic contract, from 2018 to 2024. In addition, there were more expenses of DKK 137 million for replacement traffic in connection with track works. Passenger revenue has decreased by DKK 93 million. Conversely, the result is positively impacted by lower Staff costs among other things, due to a streamlining of the administration wherein approximately 100 positions were eliminated. The net interest bearing debt has been reduced by DKK 942 million compared to 2017, and at 31 December 2018, it amounted to DKK 3,860 million. DSB is in a good financial position ahead of the coming years’ rolling stock acquisitions. For Q4 itself, DSB came out with a profit of DKK 130 million when adjusted for non-recurring items, which is DKK 21 million lower than Q4 of 2017. The result for the quarter was negatively impacted by the reduced contract payment and lower passenger revenue, though this was counterbalanced by lower operating costs. “This is a DSB in a good financial shape that is ready to battle buses and cars for market shares. In so doing, we must do our part to reduce congestion in traffic and promote a climate-friendly means of transport.” Flemming Jensen, CEO Customers decline in the number of journeys and passenger revenue stable customer satisfaction levels In 2018, 186.7 million journeys were taken with DSB in Denmark, which is a decline of 1.1 million journeys compared to 2017, equivalent to a decline of 0.6 percent. The overall decline includes an increase in the number of journeys by Long-distance & Regional trains by 0.4 million, while journeys by S-train have decreased by 1.5 million. The decline in the number of journeys by S-train is primarily due to major track works particular on the Frederikssund Line. Traffic in the East (Øresund crossing the bridge) has increased by 4 percent, mainly a result of the cessation of the ID control. The increase in the rest of the East is at 1 percent and is mainly a result of more travellers on Zealand in the Copenhagen area. The number of journeys in the West (Jutland and Funen) is similar to 2017. The development in the number of journeys crossing the Great Belt has seen a decline of 5 percent. The decline in the traffic over the Great Belt is a result of an increased competitive situation wherein cars in particular are winning market shares. Furthermore, the reduction of the bridge toll across the Great Belt in 2018 has increased the pressure that trains face from competitors even more. The bus traffic between the regions of the country is also increasing. In order to deal with the increased competition, among other things, in May we decided to reduce the prices for commuter cards over the Great Belt by 15 percent, and we have also offered more Orange tickets on departures with empty seats outside rush hours. These initiatives have paid off, as we can see increased sales compared to 2017. With an Orange ticket starting at DKK 99 for a 4 Contents journey between Aarhus and Copenhagen, customers have the opportunity to travel between regions at a competitive price. In 2018, 1.7 million Orange tickets crossing the Great Belt have been sold, equivalent to an increase in 31 percent. The combined customer satisfaction score for the year is 8.0 (on a scale of 0-10), which is an increase since 2017 when the number was 7.9. In 2018, we have worked intensively on new initiatives aimed at providing good and timely traffic information, and we are therefore pleased to see that the satisfaction levels with traffic information shows an improvement, with the result for the year being 7.5 compared to 7.2 in 2017. We continue to work on developing and launching simplified and commercially attractive ticket products with a customer-oriented focus. As part of that work, a major simplification of the total product range and price hierarchy will start in 2019. In the summer of 2018 we launched a comfort and design-related upgrade of the current train fleet. The upgrade is to ensure that our trains will still be appealing to customers and provide them with a comfortable travel experience. This will take place on an ongoing basis in the coming years. For the benefit of our customers and the environment, we have also continually over the last few years completed initiatives to reduce the particle emissions from the aging ME locomotives. Together, these initiatives have turned out to have a great impact, and with the latest initiatives completed in 2018, it has been possible to reduce the number of ultrafine particles in the train by a total of 80 percent. From 2021, DSB will begin receiving the new more environmentally friendly electric locomotives that will be replacing the aging ME locomotives. S-trains on time punctuality is high and contract targets are met With customer punctuality at 92.9 percent, DSB achieved the contract targets with the state. This is an improvement compared to 2017 of 1.1 percentage points, and the over 300,000 daily customers in the S-trains of Copenhagen have therefore reached their destinations on time in 93 out of 100 cases. Operator punctuality the part of punctuality that DSB is solely responsible for is at 98.2 percent and thus above the agreed contract target with the state. Despite the generally high punctuality for S-trains, it cannot be avoided that some customers and lines for some periods will be negatively impacted by Rail Net Denmark’s comprehensive infrastructure works. Over the summer, for example, there has been a 3-month long total closure of the line between Frederikssund and Valby. DSB has tested a number of new concepts aimed at providing better bus service and traffic information during track works and also to better compensate customers for the longer travel times. Based on our ongoing customer satisfaction surveys, it looks like these initiatives have been well-received by the customers. The punctuality of Long-distance & Regional trains has been challenged by the many infrastructure works and an aging rolling stock Customer punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains in 2018 was at 79.2 percent, and is thus below the contract target of 82.9 percent. The lower customer punctuality is due to problems Contents 5 with the tracks and signals and aging rolling stock. On top of this, the many delays from Sweden impact the trains that depart from Copenhagen Central Station to destinations across Denmark. The operator punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains the part of punctuality that DSB is solely responsible for is at 94.4 percent in 2018, and thus above the contract target of 94.1 percent. Our customers on the Coast Line (Kystbanen) have been particularly hard hit by unsatisfactory operations in 2018. The Coast Line has been partially closed due to track renovations and other works, and there has also been problems with the rolling stock. On top of this, there are the mentioned delayed from Sweden. We are paying close attention to the challenges, and together with Rail Net Denmark and the Swedish operators, we have been completing initiatives on an ongoing basis aimed at improving punctuality on the Coast Line. New modern trains will streamline and stabilise train operations It is our goal to replace the aging diesel trains with a modern and uniform electric train fleet with the benefits that this provides to the customers. This is a comprehensive renewal of the train fleet that is necessary in order to realise the societal, operational budget-related and environmental gains from the electrification of the railroad moving towards 2030. In 2018, DSB and Siemens signed an agreement to deliver 42 new Vectron electric locomotives. The new electric locomotives will be put into operation on an ongoing basis for the regional traffic in Zealand from 2021. After political approval, both the acquisition of new train coaches and new electric train sets have been called for tenders in 2018. In connection with the tender for new train coaches, it is expected that the final offer from the manufacturers will be received in the middle of 2019. The acquisition will be in the form of a framework agreement that includes 8 passenger train carriage groups with at least 440 passengers per group, and including the option to acquire further train carriage groups or individual coaches. In addition, a spare parts agreement will be signed wherein the supplier will commit themselves to supplying spare parts for the carriages for 16 years and with the option to extend for up to 30 years. The carriages will mainly be used in the international traffic to Hamburg and will be pulled by the new electric Vectron locomotives. The new carriages will, however, also contribute towards reducing the reliance on IC4 trains and they will be able to support the aging train fleet in general. It is expected that the new carriages will be deployed for passenger operations in 2022. The tender for new electric trains includes at least 100 trains. It is expected that the manufacturer who wins the tender will be awarded the contract in 2020. The first train sets are expected to be 6 Contents deployed from 2024, but the final deployment date in addition to the pace of delivery will only be known once the contract is signed in 2020. The purchase of rolling stock has been planned to fit neatly with the current plans for Rail Net Denmark’s roll-out of the Signal Programme and the electrification of the main lines. The completion of these large infrastructure projects on time is a critical factor for being able to put the rolling stock that we are investing in into operation as soon as possible to benefit the customers. We are in close dialogue with Rail Net Denmark concerning the major projects and our opportunities for contributing towards an effective execution. As the future train operations will be electric, it has been decided to optimise the workshop facilities to fit this new reality. The current locomotive workshop on Otto Buses Vej in central Copenhagen will therefore be moving to Næstved. This applies to primary functions such as maintenance and repair of electric locomotives, double-decker coaches and the new train carriages. It is expected that the newly constructed locomotive and train coach workshop will be ready in 2025. The move away from Otto Buses Vej will be a gradual process. Over time, the old DSB area in Copenhagen will be developed and be prepared for other purposes. DSB will participate actively in that process and we are engaging in a dialogue with Copenhagen Municipality in this regard. Admission to the Confederation of Danish Industry Effective as of the turn of the year 2017/18, DSB was admitted to the Confederation of Danish Industry. This happened based on a desire to become part of a large industry association and to collaborate with other Danish companies in Denmark’s largest and leading trade organisation. At the same time, this means switching to the Railroad Collective Agreement that also covers the employees of the other traffic companies, Metroselskabet and the light rail operators. In some areas, however, there will be a need for local agreements side by side with the collective agreement. Negotiations have been underway with Dansk Jernbaneforbund (Danish Railway Union) concerning new local agreements, and there is agreement concerning the content of local agreements for the following areas: The number of union representatives, working hours for S-trains and the working hours for train staff of Long-distance & Regional trains. The agreements will be formally signed at a later date once decisions have been made on other local agreements, but the agreement on the content of the agreements has been added to the record. At the end of the year, there was still no agreement for engine drivers in Long-distance & Regional trains, which is the last personnel group lacking an agreement on working hours. Contents 7 DSB is focused on ensuring that all employees will have the framework of the future work clarified as quickly as possible. With the working hours agreement for engine drivers in S-trains and train staff in Long-distance & Regional trains, it has been ensured that there will be proper conditions for employees in the frameworks of the new collective agreement.

Arrivals are considered punctual if they are less than 3 minutes delayed. Cancellations due to circumstances at DSB that are not notified 72 hours in advance are calculated as delays. In 2015, with the signing of a new traffic contract, the calculation method has changed. From 2016, Øresund is included in Long-distance & Regional Trains. Operator punctuality for Long-distance & Regional trains has in 2017 and 2018 been corrected for operational problems that the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing has approved. Operator punctuality for S-trains has in 2018 been corrected for operational problems that the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing has approved. 5) Customer punctuality for long-distance and regional train traffic is defined as the number of passengers riding on punctual trains in relation to the total number of passengers. Customer punctuality for the S-train network is defined as the proportion of passengers who may arrive punctually on the basis of passengers' expected travel pattern and the operated train traffic. Arrivals are considered punctual if they are less than 3 minutes delayed. Cancellations, which are not notified 72 hours in advance, are counted as delays. 6) Customers in Denmark in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 have been adjusted compared to previously published figures due to the final journey inventories, etc. calculated as the number of journeys. * Calculated pursuant to the definitions laid down in Definitions of Financial Ratios. 10 The financial management’s review Financial Activities which is, however, counteracted by lower costs.

The Annual Report is presented in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and the Danish DSB Act. We consider the accounting policies applied to be appropriate. Accordingly, the annual report gives a true and fair view of the group's and the parent corporation’s assets, liabilities and financial position at 31 December 2018 and of the results of the group's and the parent corporation’s operations and the group’s cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2018. In our view the management’s review contains a well-founded assessment of the development in the group’s and the parent corporation’s activities and financial conditions, the profit for the year and the group’s and the parent corporation’s financial position in general and a description of the most important risks and uncertainty factors to which the group and the parent corporation are subject. The annual report is recommended for approval by the annual meeting.

The consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts are presented in accordance with the provisions of Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. In our view the consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts give a true and fair view of the group’s and the independent public corporation DSB’s assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2018 and of the result of the group’s and the independent public corporation DSB’s activities and the group’s cash flows for the financial year 1 January 31 December 2018 in accordance with the provisions of the Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. Basis of opinion We have conducted our audit in accordance with international standards on auditing and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark as well as good public auditing practice, as the audit is carried out on the basis of the provisions in the DSB Act. Our responsibility according to these standards and requirements is described in detail in the section Auditor’s responsibility for the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts . We believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence The Auditor General is independent of the independent public corporation DSB pursuant to section 1(6) of the Danish Auditor General’s Act and the approved auditor is independent of the independent public corporation DSB pursuant to international ethical rules for auditors (IESBA’s ethical rules) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have both fulfilled our other ethical obligations under these rules and requirements. The management’s responsibility for the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts The management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and an annual account that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act and the DSB Act. Management is also responsible for such internal controls as it deems necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, the management is responsible for assessing the independent public corporation DSB’s ability to continue operations, providing information on conditions regarding continued operation, if relevant, and prepar16 Management statement and the independent auditors’ reports ing the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going concern accounting principle unless the management intends to liquidate the independent public corporation DSB, suspend operations or has no other realistic alternative than to do so. The auditors responsibility for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual account Our aim is to obtain a high degree of assurance that the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, regardless of whether this is due to fraud or errors, and to issue an auditor’s report and express an opinion. A high degree of assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with international standards on audits and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, as well as good public auditing practice, cf. the DSB Act, will always discover material misstatements when such are present. Misstatements may occur as a result of fraud or error and may be regarded as material if it can reasonably be expected that the misstatement, or parts thereof, affects the financial decisions made by the users of the accounts based on the annual accounts. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with international auditing standards and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, as well as good public auditor practice, cf. the DSB Act, we perform professional assessments and maintain professional scepticism during the audit. In addition: • We identify and assess the risk of material misstatements in the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts regardless of whether this is due to fraud or error, prepare and carry out audit procedures in response to these risks and obtain audit evidence that is adequate and suitable for forming a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for material misstatement due to error, since fraud may include conspiracies, forgery, intentional omission, misrepresentation or the disregarding of internal controls. • We obtain understanding of the internal control with relevance for the audit in order to be able to prepare audit procedures that are suitable under the circumstances, but not in order to be able to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the independent public corporation DSB’s internal controls. • We determine whether the accounting policies applied by the management are suitable and whether the accounting estimates made by management and related information are reasonable. • We express an opinion as to whether the management’s preparation of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts based on the going concern accounting principle is suitable and whether, based on the audit evidence obtained, there is material uncertainty associated with events or conditions which may give rise to significant doubt as to the independent public corporation DSB’s ability to continue operations. If we find that there is material uncertainty, we must state in our auditor’s report that the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts contain information on this or, if such information is not adequate, modify our opinion. Our opinion is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may result in the independent public corporation DSB being unable to continue operations. Management statement and the independent auditors’ reports 17 • We evaluate the overall presentation, structure and contents of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, including the information in the notes, and whether the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts reflect the underlying transactions and events and thus present a true and fair view of these. • We obtain sufficient and suitable audit evidence for the financial information for companies or business activities in the group for the purposes of expressing an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts. We are responsible for managing, overseeing and carrying out the group audit. We are solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the executive management on the planned scope and timing of the audit as well as significant audit observations, including any significant defects in internal control which we identify during our audit. Statement on the management’s review The management is responsible for the management’s review. Our opinion on the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts does not include the management’s review and we do not express any opinion with certainty on the management’s review. In connection with our audit of the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts, it is our responsibility to read the management’s review and consider whether the management’s review is significantly inconsistent with the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts or our knowledge obtained during our audit or in any other way seems to contain material misstatement. Our responsibility is also to consider whether the management’s review contains the required information pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act. Based on the work performed, we find that the management’s review is in accordance with the consolidated annual accounts and the annual accounts and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We have not identified any material misstatement in the management’s review. Declaration pursuant to other legislation and other regulation Statement on legal-critical audit and performance audit The management is responsible for ensuring that the transactions covered by the financial reporting are in accordance with reported grants, legislation and other rules and regulations, as well as with agreements concluded and the usual practice. The management is also responsible for ensuring that due financial consideration is taken for the management of the funds and operations of the companies included in the annual accounts. In that context, the management is responsible for setting up systems and processes that promote frugality, productivity and efficiency. In connection with our audit of the annual accounts, it is our responsibility to complete a legalcritical audit and a management audit of selected topics in accordance with good public accounting practice. During our legal-critical audit, we verify with a high degree of certainty for the se18 Management statement and the independent auditors’ reports lected topics whether the examined transactions covered by the financial reporting are in accordance with the relevant provisions of grants, legislation and other rules and regulations in addition to concluded agreements and the usual practice. During our management audit, we assess with a high degree of certainty whether the systems, processes or transactions examined support the appropriate financial considerations applied to the administration of the funds and operations covered by the annual accounts. If we conclude that our work has given rise to significant critical comments we must report on this in this statement. We have no significant critical comments to report in this connection.

Estimates that are sigimmaterial. nificant to delivering the accounts are made, among other things, for the life expectancy of non-current assets, the money flows from investments and the associated discounting rates, sales values, deferred provisions and contingent liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are also based on historical experiences and other factors that senior management assess as reasonable under the circumstances, but which, due to their nature, are uncertain and unpredictable. The assumptions may be incomplete or inexact, and unexpected events or circumstances may occur. Furthermore, the business activities are subject to risks and uncertainties that cannot be controlled and which may lead to the actual results deviating from these estimates. Valuation of rolling stock The valuation of rolling stock is associated with significant accounting estimates. The significant accounting estimates apply to, among other things, expectations for the future application of the rolling stock, the scrap value and the technical and financial life expectancy. The estimates made are further described in the note for Tangible assets (section 3). 30 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Section 2 Operation This section concerns items that are included in This section contains the following notes: Operating profit. 2.1 Net revenue 2.2 Work performed by the enterprise The section includes information on earnings and and capitalised costs in connection with the carrying out of 2.3 Other operating income operations. 2.4 Expenses for raw materials and consumables The main events in 2018 are further detailed in 2.5 Other external expenses Managements statement, financial Financial 2.6 Consultancy fees activities. 2.7 Audit fee 2.8 Remuneration for Board of Directors and Executive Board 2.9 Staff costs Note 2.1: Net revenue Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 Passenger revenues distributed on business areas: 3,977 3,918 Long-distance & Regional Trains 3,897 3,955 1,518 1,483 S-trains 1,483 1,518 5,495 5,401 Total passenger revenue 5,380 5,473 4,109 3,941 Revenue from traffic contracts 4,051 4,286 8 10 Repair and maintenance of rolling stock etc. 303 288 626 45 Sale and leasing of rolling stock 45 40 10,238 9,397 Total 9,779 10,087 Total passenger revenue in parent corporation and the Group include penalty fares of DKK 53 million (2017: DKK 30 million) The sale and leasing of rolling stock in 2017 is impacted by the parent company having sold 67 double-decker coaches to a group company. The sales are presented as Net revenue, as the sale of rolling stock is a natural extension of the purpose of running a railway business. Accounting practices Passenger revenues are recognised at the time of transport. Provision is made in respect of the value of tickets sold that have not been used at the balance sheet date. Discounts in connection with sales and payments relating to the travel time guarantee schemes are deducted from the net revenue. Revenues from control fees are measured after the deduction of expected losses. Revenues from transport contracts are recognised over the periods to which they relate. Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 31 Revenues from Repair and maintenance of rolling stock etc. are recognised concurrently with production, which means that revenues correspond to the selling price of work performed for the year (production method). Revenues from the sale of rolling stock that has been acquired with the intent to sell are included when the delivery and transfer of risk has taken place. Note 2.2: Work performed by the enterprise and capitalised In the parent company, the value of capitalised development projects that are covered by the rules of the Danish Financial Statements Act for binding of separate equity reserve amounts to DKK 82 million in 2018 (2017: DKK 79 million). The reserve as of 31 December 2018 amounts to DKK 138 million. (2017: DKK 92 million), and has been reduced with depreciation and deferred taxes. Accounting practices This item includes work performed by the enterprise in connection with the carrying out of, for example, major maintenance inspections of train sets, which are capitalised. The value is measured based on registered expenses for the performance of the work performed based on registrations of the expenses incurred in the form of own work etc. The item also includes directly attributable expenses and a proportionate share of indirect production costs.

(2017: DKK 254 million) Earnings from shops, etc. relate to the sales from the 7-Eleven stores at stations where DSB is the franchisee. Accounting practices Other operating income includes income of a secondary nature in relation to the railway business, including income from the group’s properties, either through rental activities or profits from selling land and buildings or earnings from shop products, etc. Intragroup income in the parent corporation includes trading with group companies. Revenues are recognised when delivery and transfer of risk have taken place at the fair value of the agreed consideration exclusive of VAT, discounts and taxes collected on behalf of a third party. 32 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 2.4: Expenses for raw materials and consumables Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 453 433 Energy for train operation 434 458 22 21 Sales from shops, etc. 563 574 704 13 Spare parts and rolling stock, etc. 869 723 1,179 467 Total 1,866 1,755 Spare parts in rolling stock, etc. in the parent company was in 2017 impacted by the acquisition of 67 double-decker coaches intended for selling on to a group company. The development in Spare parts and rolling stock, etc. in the group can also be attributed to a tight European market for spare parts and increased costs for repairs of an aging fleet, which is also reflected in the number of kilometres travelled between incidents. Accounting practices Expenses for raw materials and consumables include the year’s purchases and the year’s change in the valuation of inventory of energy for train operation, Goods for sale in shops etc. and Spare parts and rolling stock, etc. Energy for train operation is adjusted for the effect from realised diverted financial instruments.

Severance pay for senior employees in connection with dismissal by DSB not owing to breach or the like on the part of the employee does not exceed 12 months’ salary. In 2017, DSB decided to streamline the administration by eliminating approximately 100 positions in 2018. This has impacted Wages and salaries and Pensions in 2017 by DKK 77 million. Pension contributions paid to the state are recognised as an expense for civil servants. The pension contribution in 2018 amounted to 15 percent (2017: 26 percent) of the pensionable salary. In 2017, DSB signed an agreement to purchase the risk of pension contributions for civil servants, which impacted Pensions in 2017 with a total of DKK 388 million. The future pension contribution thus amounts to a fixed 15 percent of the pensionable salary. The general provisions of the Danish Civil Servants Act apply to civil servants, and the agreement signed with the state does not alter this. See also the note Contingent assets and liabilities as well as Other financial obligations. For other employees, pension contributions are expensed in accordance with collective and individual agreements. The company has concluded agreements regarding performance-related salary with a number of executive employees (primarily managers). As a starting point, agreements regarding performance-related salary accounts for 10-20 percent for managers who are not part of the Corporate Management and for 20-25 percent for members of the Corporate Management. At year-end 2018 the number of agreements regarding performance-related salary was 292, compared to 312 at year-end 2017. Accounting practices Staff expenses include wages, pension contributions, remuneration and other expenses for social security for the company’s employees including the Executive Board and the Board of Directors.

Disposals is mainly comprised of costs for external consultants, direct salaries and purchased materials. Accounting practices Intangible assets comprise primarily development projects, including rights of use and software. Development projects are included as intangible assets if the cost price can be measured reliably and there is a sufficient degree of certainty that the future earnings can cover the sales and administration costs in addition to the development costs themselves. It is a prerequisite that the projects are clearly defined and identifiable, and that the technical feasibility, sufficient resources and a potential future market or development opportunity in the company can be indicated. Other development costs are recognised as expenses in the income statement as they are incurred. Development costs included in the balance sheet are measured at cost price less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs. The cost price for development projects include costs also staff costs and amortisation that can be directly linked to the company’s development activities. Interest and borrowing expenses on loans for financing of development projects are recognised in cost provided they relate to the development period. All other financing expenses are recognised in the income statement. After completion of the development work, development projects are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. The amortisation period is usually 3-10 years. Profits and losses on disposal are calculated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale. Profits and losses are recognised in the income statement under Other operating income or Other external expenses. The description of costs for development projects on equity are found under accounting policies applied in section 1 under Reserve for development costs.

In connection with the financing of the train sets of EUR 43.6 million, DSB has provided the 10 train sets with a carrying amount of DKK 329 million as security. In 2017, in connection with the creation of the City Ring, DSB received a grant in the form of six elevators at Copenhagen Central Station from Metroselskabet I/S. The value of the grant will be recognised over the life of the assets through a reduction of the monthly depreciation of the assets. Based on previous experiences, the scrap value for rolling stock is assessed at DKK 0. The carrying amount for Land and buildings is impacted by a reclassification to Properties held for sale.

Land is not amortised. Cost includes the purchase price and costs directly related to the purchase up to the time where the asset is ready for use. With regard to own produced assets (primarily major maintenance inspections (Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of capitalised train sets), the cost covers direct and indirect costs for materials, components, subcontractors and wages/salaries as well as borrowing cost from specific and general borrowing in direct connection with the construction of the individual asset. Costs for major maintenance inspections (LCC) of train sets are recognised separately and amortised over the useful life, which corresponds to the period until the next major maintenance inspection. 40 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives based on the following assessment of their expected useful lives: Buildings 30-60 years Installations 10-15 years Rolling stock 2-25 years Operating equipment, fixtures and fittings and other equipment 3-25 years In connection with capitalisation, cost is distributed on the most important individual components (decomposition) and amortised over the useful life of this. The basis of depreciation is calculated taking into account the scrap value of the asset after the end of its useful life and reduced by any write-downs. The amortisation period and the scrap value are fixed at the time of acquisition and reassessed annually. If the scrap value exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, amortisation stops. If the amortisation period or the scrap value changes, the impact on amortisation in the future is recognised as a change of accounting estimates. Profits and losses on disposal or scrapping of tangible assets are calculated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and the carrying amount at the time of sale or scrapping. Profits and losses are recognised in the income statement under Other operating income or Other external expenses. Properties held for sale Properties held for sale include Land and buildings that were not originally acquired with the intent to sell that have been sold or are expected to be sold but where the transfer of risk is only expected to take place within 12 months. Properties held for sale are valued at cost price minus accumulated amortisations made before the reclassification from tangible assets to Properties held for sale. Leasing In terms of accounting, leasing obligations are divided into finance and operating leases. Expenses regarding operational leases are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease. Total commitments regarding operational leasing and rent agreement are disclosed under Contingent assets and liabilities in addition to Other financial obligations. Impairment of non-current assets The carrying amount of non-current assets is reviewed on the balance sheet date to decide whether there are any indications of impairment other than what is expressed through amortisation. If there are signs of such impairment, an impairment test is carried out for the relevant asset or group of assets to determine whether the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If so, a write-down is made to that lower recoverable amount. Any write-downs are recognised in the income statement. In case of subsequence reversals of write-downs as a consequence of changes in the preconditions for the calculated recoverable value, the value of the asset is increased to the adjusted recoverable value, but not to more than the carrying amount the asset would have had if it had not been written down for impairment.

Accounting practices Equity investments in group companies are measured according to the book value method. This means that equity investments are measured at the proportionate share of the companies’ book value, calculated according to the accounting policies of the group less or plus unrealised intragroup profits and losses. Equity investments in group companies with a negative book value are measured at DKK 0, and any potential receivables from these companies are depreciated to the extent that the receivable is irrecoverable. To the extent that the parent company has a legal or actual obligation to cover a deficit exceeding the receivable, the remaining amount is recognised in Other Provisions. The net value adjustment of equity investments in group companies is shown as Reserve for net value adjustment according to the book value method in equity, to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the cost price. In the parent company’s income statement, the proportionate share of group companies’ profit/loss after tax, less the proportionate share of internal profit/loss, is recognised. 44 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 4.3: Investments (continued) Amounts in DKK million Equity investSubordinated ments in asloan capital in sociated comassociated Other receivTotal investGroup panies companies ables ments Cost price at 1 January 2018 413 207 26 646 Additions 0 3 6 9 Disposals 0 -11 -6 -17 Cost price at 31 December 2018 413 199 26 638 Value adjustments at 1 January 2018 -413 0 -413 Earnings for the year 0 0 Value adjustments at 31 December 2018 -413 0 -413 Carrying amount at 31 December 2018 0 199 26 225 Carrying amount at 31 December 2017 0 207 26 233 Equity investments in associated companies Amounts in DKK million Share of book Registered ofShare value in parent Name fice Equity interest capital company, 2018 Group 2018 Rejsekort A/S Denmark 45.0% 114 0 0 Rejseplanen A/S Denmark 48.4% 1 0 0 Total 0 0 Accounting practices Equity investments in associated companies are measured according to the book value method. This means that equity investments are measured at the proportionate share of the companies’ book value, calculated according to the accounting policies of the group less or plus unrealised intragroup profits and losses. Equity investments in associated companies with a negative book value are measured at DKK 0 and any receivables from these companies are depreciated to the extent that the receivable is irrecoverable. To the extent that the parent company has a legal or actual obligation to cover a deficit exceeding the receivable, the remaining amount is recognised in Other Provisions. Subordinated loan capital in associated companies and Other receivables is measured at amortised cost. In both the group’s and parent company’s income statement, the proportionate share of the associated companies’ Profit/loss after tax, less the proportionate share of internal profit/loss, is recognised.

In the parent corporation and the group, DKK 1,844 million of the debt portfolio was raised without state guarantee (2017: DKK 1,897 million). The remaining loans are all guaranteed by the Danish state, to which a guarantee commission is payable. The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risks associated with the above Borrowing and liquidity is DKK -467 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: DKK -827 million), of which DKK -164 million is recognised in equity (2017: DKK -240 million). At 31 December 2018, derivative financial instruments with a positive and a negative fair value were DKK 28million (2017: DKK 51 million) and DKK 523 million. (2017: DKK 845 million). Accounting practices Liabilities are recognised at the date of borrowing at the net proceeds received after deduction of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, corresponding to the capitalised value using the effective interest rate. Accordingly, the difference between the proceeds and the nominal value is recognised in the income statement over the term of the loan. Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost price. 46 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 4.5: Interest-bearing liabilities, net Group Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 Long-term loans 2,162 3,030 Current portion of non-current liabilities 961 2,071 Short-term loans 200 0 Credit institutions 640 0 Others 212 322 Interest-bearing liabilities 4,175 5,423 Cash in bank and in hand -89 -402 Deposits -27 -12 Subordinated loan capital, receivable -199 -207 Interest-bearing assets -315 -621 Total 3,860 4,802 Note 4.6: Net financial items, paid Group Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 Financial income 34 30 Financial expenses -139 -163 Other including financial instruments -11 -11 Total -116 -144 Note 4.7: Minority interests The company’s group company with minority shares included DSB Øresund Holding ApS in liquidation. The liquidation of DSB Øresund Holding ApS concluded in April 2017. The liquidation proceeds to DSB and the minority shareholder amounted to DKK 0 million. Accounting practices In the consolidated annual accounts, the group companies’ items are recognised at 100 percent. The minority shareholders’ share of the profit/loss for the year and of the equity in the group companies which are not owned 100 percent is included as part of the Group’s profit/loss and equity, respectively, but is presented separately.

The group companies are included in the joint taxation from the time at which they are included in the consolidation and until they are excluded from the consolidation. The parent corporation is the administration unit for the joint taxation and consequently settles all payments of corporation tax with the tax authorities. The current Danish corporation tax is distributed by settlement of the joint taxation contributions between the jointly taxed companies relative to their taxable income. In this connection, any companies with a tax loss receive joint taxation contributions from companies that were able to use this loss to reduce their own tax profit. The tax for the year, which comprises current corporation tax, the year’s joint taxation contribution and changes in deferred tax, including differences as a consequence of changed tax rates, is recognised in the income statement with the share attributable to the profit/loss for the year and directly in equity by the share which may be attributed to items entered directly on equity. Current tax liabilities and receivables are included in the balance sheet as calculated tax on the taxable income for the year adjusted for tax on the taxable income for previous years and tax paid on account. Joint taxation contributions payable and receivable are included in the balance sheet as balances with group companies. 48 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 5.2: Deferred tax liabilities Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 1,010 917 Deferred tax liabilities at 1 January 851 918 61 -5 Adjustment at 1 January -2 62 0 -2 Adjustment regarding previous years -3 0 Change in deferred tax regarding group profit -5 -1 -154 -91 Change in deferred tax regarding the profit/loss for the year -86 -128 917 819 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 755 851 Deferred tax concerns: 1 13 Intangible assets 8 -5 1,043 915 Tangible assets 912 1,034 4 2 Current assets -31 -26 -131 -111 Other provisions -129 -151 Intragroup profits -5 -1 917 819 Deferred tax liabilities at 31 December 755 851 The group's Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated taxable income etc. The total corporation tax liability is DKK 211 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: DKK 173 million). The group’s Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for Danish withholding tax in the form of tax on dividend, royalty and interest. Any subsequent corrections of corporation and withholding taxes may increase the corporation’s liability. DSB, Kort & Godt A/S, DSB Ejendomsudvikling A/S, DSB Vedligehold A/S and Selskabet af 23.12.2014 are jointly registered for VAT and payroll tax purposes and are jointly and severally liable for payment of the companies’ aggregate VAT and payroll tax liabilities. Accounting practices Deferred tax is measured using the balance sheet liability method on all temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets and liabilities. However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences relating to goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes and on office premises and other items, where temporary differences, apart from business acquisitions, arise at the date of acquisition without affecting the profit/loss for the year or the taxable income. In cases where the calculation of the tax value may be made according to different taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management’s planned use of the asset or settlement of the liability. Deferred tax assets, including the value of a tax loss allowed for carryforward and net financing expenses, are recognised as an asset at the expected value of utilisation, either through elimination of tax on future earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities in the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Deferred tax is adjusted for eliminations of unrealised intragroup profits and intragroup losses. Deferred tax is measured based on the tax rules and tax rates in the individual countries applicable according to the legislation in force at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to crystallise as current tax. Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts 49 Section 6 Working capital Most important items regarding working capital This section contains the following notes: include inventories, receivables, prepayments, 6.1 Inventories supplier debt and other debt. 6.2 Receivables 6.3 Prepayments (assets) 6.4 Prepayments (liabilities) Note 6.1: Inventories Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 12 11 Fuel for train operation 11 12 0 0 Spare parts etc. 349 357 1 1 Sales from shops, etc. 36 37 13 12 Total 396 406 Spare parts, etc. are used for repairs and maintenance of rolling stock. For certain groups of Spare parts, etc. there is an element of uncertainty surrounding the time they are used, while emergency stockpiles are created for critical product groups with long delivery times. At 31 December 2018, the inventory has been written down due to inventory obsoleteness with a total of DKK 282 million. (2017: DKK 230 million), almost entirely related to Spare parts, etc. Accounting practices Fuel for trains and Spare parts are measured at cost according to the average cost method. Cost comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs and any processing and other costs directly or indirectly attributable to inventories. Goods for sale in shops etc. are measured at cost, calculated in accordance with the FIFO method. Cost comprises the purchase price plus delivery costs. Inventories are written down to the lower of net realisable value and cost. The net realisable value for inventories is calculated as the sales amount less completion costs and costs incurred to effect the sale. Note 6.2: Receivables Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 Trade receivables from sales and services have the following composition: 76 17 Receivables from issued control fees 17 76 265 115 Receivables, passenger revenue 115 265 102 88 Reimbursements from agencies 88 102 122 130 Others 249 261 565 350 Total 469 704 50 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts DSB is not significantly exposed to single customers, since receivables from sales and services are distributed across a significant number of customers, including private individuals, private companies and public institutions. There is no significant amount of collateral received for Trade receivables. Paid deposits are considered as collateral for receivables from leasing activities. All Trade receivables are due for payment within 1 year. Receivables from issued control fees has in 2018 decreased as a result of DSB receiving payment for control fees that have been sent to SKAT for collection. Provision for losses on receivables There is an ongoing assessment of indications for loss of value for Trade receivables. In the statement of provisions for expected losses, a segmentation of the population of Trade receivables has been made. The segmentation separates the portfolio into types of customers, types of receivable and historical experiences in relation to determining losses. An average expected loss percentage is calculated based on the percentage. At 31 December 2018, provisions for losses have not been made concerning Receivables from group undertakings, Receivable joint taxation contribution, Other receivables, Prepayment, Debt to group companies, or Subordinated loan capital in associated companies. Accounting practices Receivables are measured at amortised cost, which usually corresponds to the nominal value. Provisions for expected losses are based on historical experience and is made when there is an objective indication that a receivable or portfolio fo receivables has decreased in value. If there is an objective indication that an individual receivable has lost value, there is made provisions for losses on the individual level.

Financial risks include interest rates, foreign exchange rates, raw material prices, liquidity and Counterparty risk arises when counterparties fail to counterparties. fulfil their obligations. Interest rate risks are related to changes in financing This section contains the following notes: interest rates. 7.1 Interest risk 7.2 Currency exchange rate risk The primary currency risks relate to oil purchases 7.3 Raw materials price risk and trade with international counterparties in EUR 7.4 Liquidity risk and SEK, respectively. 7.5 Counterparty risk 7.6 Market values calculated in the equity Raw materials price risk occurs in connection with the purchase of electricity and oil. As a result of its operations, investments and financing, DSB is exposed to changes in risk relating to interest, currency exchange rates, raw material prices and liquidity. The financial management aims to address the associated financial risks. The overall framework is set out in the financial policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. In accordance with this policy, DSB must monitor, calculate, administer and manage risks, in addition to continuously monitoring risk exposure and cash resources. The purpose of the financial hedging is to limit and control the impact on profit caused by fluctuations in the financial markets. There are no significant changes in risk exposure or risk management compared with 2017. Accounting practices Initial recognition of derivative financial instruments is made in the balance sheet at cost and they are subsequently measured at fair value. Positive and negative changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments are recognised in Other receivables and Other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging of the fair value of a recognised asset or recognised liability are recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are classified as and meet the criteria for hedging of future assets or liabilities are recognised in Other receivables or Other liabilities and in Equity. If the future transaction results in the recognition of assets or liabilities, amounts previously recognised in equity will be transferred at the cost price of the respective asset or liability. If the future transaction results in income or expenses, amounts previous recognised as equity will be transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item impacts the income statement. In respect of derivative financial instruments which do not meet the conditions for treatment as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are recognised in the income statement on an ongoing basis.

The primary interest rate exposure in this regard relates to fluctuations in CIBOR, NIBOR and EURIBOR. The policy is to raise all loans so that interest rate risks are only in CIBOR and EURIBOR. Interest rate risks are normally hedged using interest rate swaps in which variable rate loans are converted to a fixed rate. Within a 12-month period, interest rate sensitivity must not exceed DKK 50 million (with a percentage point change in interest rates), the debt portfolio must have a duration of at least 10 years, and at least 50 percent of the liability portfolio must be at a fixed rate. Accordingly, the weighted average duration of gross debt is 8.3 years (2017: 6.4 years). Of the financial liabilities, 100 percent were converted to fixed rate with maturity of longer than one year (2017: 100 percent). Variable rate debt is adjusted regularly during the year. 54 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 7.2: Currency exchange rate risk Currency risks in recognised financial assets and liabilities are hedged so that at least 75 percent of the risk is in DKK. In relation to the financial policy, risks in EUR or other currencies are only permitted if they are included in the group companies’ financing or hedging of exposure from group companies. The most significant currency exposure relates to loans in EUR, NOK, JPY and SEK, which are hedged using derivative financial instruments. After hedging, DSB is not exposed to significant currency risks from financing activities. Other registered positions represent an insignificant share of the currency exposure; the future cash flow in currency is hedged 30-70 percent on average, as calculated for a rolling 12-month period. Currency risks associated with operations are primarily related to oil consumption. Other currency risks in relation to trade with international counterparts are limited, apart from SEK and EUR . DSB is exposed to currency risks related to SEK as a result of a contract that has been signed to maintain the Swedish Øresund train sets and to EUR in connection to the purchase of rolling stock. The net assets in equity investments in foreign group companies is impacted by currency fluctuations when translating to DKK in the consolidated financial statements. This translation risk is not hedged. DSB has no other significant currency risks.

DSB uses oil and electricity in its operations and is therefore exposed to raw material price risks which are hedged. The hedging is ongoing throughout the year before the budget year and is carried out through the conclusion of raw materials price swap agreements. 90 percent of the expected oil consumption in 2019 is hedged as of 31 December 2018 (2017: 88 percent). Similarly, 88 percent of the expected electricity consumption in 2019 is hedged as of 31 December 2018 (2017: 86 percent).

The target is to have a cash reserve corresponding to the development in the approved budget year’s expected net debt plus DKK 200 million, though at least DKK 1.0 billion. The cash reserve is calculated as cash in bank and in hand plus access to drawing on bank facilities. At 31 December 2018, agreements were concluded on revocable bank facilities of DKK 2,500 million and irrevocable bank facilities of DKK 1,750 million, with expiry during the period 2019-2023 (2017: revocable of DKK 1,850 million and irrevocable of DKK 2,150 million, with expiry during the period 2018-2022). Of these cash resources, DKK 3,417 million is not utilised. (2017: DKK 4.346 million). Note 7.5: Counterparty risk Risk arises when financial derivative instruments are concluded to hedge financial risks or when liquidity is placed with financial counterparties. The risk is that the counterparties will fail to fulfil their obligations. All Cash in bank and in hand and agreements on financial instruments are either placed in banks or as part of agreements with financial institutions that have a minimum of an A according to Standard & Poor’s rating. Receivables from derivative financial instruments, Cash in bank and at hand and deposits amount to a total of DKK 164 million as of 31 December 2018. (2017: DKK 527 million). If the access to offsetting exposure in financial contracts with financial counterparties is recognised, the receivables from these items as of 31 December 2018 instead amounts to DKK 27 million.

Other provisions include obligations regarding civil servants on loan and compensation obligations, etc. Accounting practices Provisions are recognised when DSB, as a consequence of an event that occurred at the balance sheet date at the latest, has a legal obligation or an actual obligation, and it is likely that financial advantages must be given up to meet that obligation. Provisions are recognised and measured as the best estimate of the costs necessary to liquidate the obligations. If fulfilment of the obligation is expected to be far in the future, the obligation is measured at fair value. 58 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts Note 8.2: Contingent assets and liabilities, as well as other economic obligations Parent corporation Group 2017 2018 Amounts in DKK million 2018 2017 0 0 Contingent assets 0 0 202 174 Contingent liabilities 256 308 3,414 3,767 Other financial obligations 3,144 2,527 Contingent liabilities include guarantees of a total of DKK 147 million.

Fewer journeys by S-train Track and infrastructure works have impacted S-train operations in 2018, and the summer’s comprehensive track shutdowns on Frederikssundsbanen (The Frederikssund Line) have resulted in fewer passengers. The number of journeys is negatively impacted by growing sales of newly registered cars, which have become cheaper. DSB is continually working towards improving operational stability, which is an important aspect of customer satisfaction, and initiatives to market the S-train as a relevant means of transportation to the Metro City Ring which will open in 2019 have also been launched .

DSB wants digitalisation to contribute to creating growth through simplified and more competitive products in addition to contributing to an optimal utilisation of capacity. The digitalisation must also contribute to ensuring efficiency through the simplification and automation of processes across the business areas. To support these significant changes that DSB is facing, the framework tool ‘Scaled Agile Framework’ (‘SAFe’) will be implemented to support the business units in supplying new products, services and solutions with the highest quality and value possible. Other risks Reputation DSB carries out an important societal function, and therefore it is of the utmost importance that DSB is perceived as a responsible company that runs its business operations focusing on ethics and compliance with legislation, while at the same time, creating growth and value for society at large. DSB is aware of the significance of having a good reputation, and it manages risk by having clear guidelines and policies aimed at ensuring that DSB’s reputation is not harmed, but instead continually improves. Social and employee conditions DSB is focusing on ensuring a good working environment. Local campaigns have been launched to minimise falling and stumbling accidents, and long-term campaigns are being worked on to prevent work-related injuries. Furthermore, there is a great focus on ensuring that employees and customers are safe at the stations and on the trains, and at the local level, there are several initiatives underway to teach employees conflict resolution skills.

At the same time, the basis for salary and employment conditions must be protected. The remuneration committee assists the Board of Directors with the preparation of recommendations concerning remuneration policy and remuneration. The framework for the committee’s work is set out in a mandate. DSB follows the state’s ownership policy and recommendations for good corporate governance, taking into consideration DSB’s special circumstances and ownership. DSB’s compliance with good corporate governance is published on www.dsb.dk. In the terms of the state’s ownership policy, the following applies: “When fixing the remuneration for the Board of Directors, one must take into account the workload, the remuneration in other state-owned companies and the remuneration in comparable privately owned companies. The objective is for the remuneration of board work to be competitive without being overly high. The salary and employment conditions for directors must be competitive in order to attract competent individuals, but companies that are partly or wholly owned by the state should not have overly high salaries compared to similar private companies.” As an independent public corporation, DSB has a special obligation to ensure that wage determination is based on integrity and openness. Remuneration is provided in return for work that is carried out. The remuneration policy is based on the relevant market for the position, taking into account the special circumstances involved in operating an independent public corporation. DSB uses Mercer’s salary statistics as its external benchmark. DSB does not wish to be a market leader but wishes to be able to attract and retain qualified employees at all levels. Board of Directors and Management Committees The remuneration for the Board of Directors is approved at the Annual Meeting. Remuneration for the chairman and vice chairman amount to, respectively, 3 and 2 times the fixed board member remuneration. The Board of Directors only receives fixed remuneration; thus, no variable remuneration is paid. The committee remuneration is set by the Board of Directors in accordance with the guidelines of the remuneration policy.

The targets are based on DSB’s KPIs for the year in question including DSB’s contract targets. DSB’s KPIs are typically set after a 3-year target of meeting prioritised strategic goals for example, on punctuality or in terms of the EBIT margin. When the targets are met, 50 percent of the framework of the performance-based salary is paid out, while payments in excess of 50 percent of the performance-based salary require extraordinary results. When results are significantly below the targets, there may be no payments at all. The performance-based salary cannot exceed more than 25 percent of the annual fixed remuneration. The performance-based salary is paid out once per year after the Annual Meeting.

Number of train kilometres per employee has fallen by 1 percent. The reason for this is fewer train kilometres in Long-distance & Regional traffic among other things due to transfer of train traffic, which is not counterbalanced by an equivalent fall in the number of employees.

The increase is driven by more journeys in the East (Zealand). The traffic in the East (Øresund – over Øresund bridge) has increased by 4 percent due to the termination og the ID control. The increase in East (Zealand) is 1 percent and is mainly due to more travellers on Zealand in the Copenhagen region. This is partially counteracted by fewer journeys as a result of the ME diesel locomotives being taken out of operations in January 2018 due to initial crack formation on the axles. This led to changes to the train schedule which reduced the number of seats and departures. 76 Operating activities Based on these surveys, DSB has identified six In the West (Jutland and Funen) the number of areas that are important in achieving high cusjourneys in 2018 is on a similar level to 2017. tomer satisfaction levels.

Viewed as an average figure for the year, the reputation has improved in relation to last year by 2.3 points to 49.9. This improvement has occurred despite issues with Rail Net Denmark’s necessary track works and the spillover effects on customer punctuality and operations. At the end of the year, the pulse score – defined in the traffic contract was 48.4, which is slightly higher than the same period last year. The trend throughout the year has been the same for both users and non-users. It remains the case that users (50.6) have a significantly better view of DSB than non-users (41.8). The reputation of S-trains has continued to improve in 2018. It has increased from 50.5 to 54.1 when comparing the 4th quarter with the same period last year.

Combined with a division of operator tasks by lines, this contributes to adding transparency to DSB’s train operations in Denmark, and DSB is also continually using the line accounts to streamline operations. The following can be emphasised: • In 2018, DSB’s S-train traffic was generating a loss of DKK 17 million. The S-train traffic has been negatively impacted by costs for replacement transport as a result of track works on the Frederikssund Line. If this is adjusted for, the profits from the S-train operations were DKK 111 million for 2018, which is similar to 2017. • DSB’s Long-Distance traffic has been operating at a loss in 2018, which is mainly due to declining passenger revenue and reduction in contractual payments from the Danish state 1. This is only partly counteracted by reduced infrastructure costs as a result of the reduction of the bridge toll for crossing the Great Belt, reduced reinvestments in rolling stock and DSB’s ongoing streamlining in the administration and support functions. • All other regional train lines are loss-making and require the transfer of funds from the state’s contract payment. The profitability of the lines is generally a factor of the extent of service as determined by the contract with the state in relation to passenger demand spread out over the operational day. Activity Area Accounts Public services delivered by DSB pursuant to the traffic contract are divided between Train Service, Train System, and General Obligations; as per Table 1. • Train Service relates to the operator task of driving trains • Train System is a collective designation for the activities that support the task of driving trains, from operation of stations, provision of rolling stock, timetable planning and monitoring, to traffic information and sale of tickets. • General Obligations are activities that are independent of the train operations, such as operation of the Danish Railway Museum and extra costs regarding civil servants. Train Service is furthermore divided into Long-Distance & Regional Train traffic, S-train traffic and Øresund traffic. Train System is divided into Stations, Rolling Stock and Systems & Channels. Systems & Channels include Sales Channels and Customer Service, as well as Traffic Operations and Shared Functions, see Figure 8. Revenue from transport contracts For 2018, income before the leasing of rolling stock amounts to DKK 10,157 million. The income finances the Public service traffic delivered. 1 Conditions for reduction of DSB’s contractual payment in Supplementary Contract 19 from the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing. In 2018, the reduction alone amounted to DKK 207 million. Line Accounts 93 For 2018, passenger revenue amounts to DKK 5,401 million, and in the Line Economy Model this is distributed to the Train Services 2), i.e. the passenger transport, while the Train System tasks in the model are almost entirely financed by the income from the traffic contract (hereinafter referred to as the ‘contract payments’. Commission revenues from the selling of tickets by other operators is distributed to Systems & Channels and amounts to DKK 95 million of the total passenger revenue. Danish train passenger traffic is characterised by a strong desire for cohesion in the public transport, including an integrated and uniform customer experience for the entire journey. In order to deliver this, the public transport sector is characterised by a high degree of integration and collaboration across traffic companies and operators, in addition to shared and integrated commercial solutions such as, for example, Rejsekort, Rejseplan, DOT and Bus & Tog. Passenger revenue has been calculated on the basis of the agreements that have been signed on revenue sharing between the traffic companies and operators. DSB works in an integrating capacity in the Danish train passenger traffic by, for example, co-financing the development of other traffic companies’ traffic systems and traffic offers. An example of this is the passenger revenue sharing in the Copenhagen area and the carrying out of contractor traffic in middle and western Jutland. In connection with the passenger revenue distribution in the Capital Area, there is a so-called Metro factor of 1.49, which means that a passenger travelling with Metroselskabet weighs more than a passenger travelling with DSB when the revenue in the Capital Area is distributed. DSB includes the effect of the current revenue model in the Copenhagen area (Metro double factor), which means that Metroselskabet I/S receives an oversized proportion of the total passenger revenues in the Copenhagen area. In return, the state’s traffic contract payment compensates DSB for this with DKK 177 million. Similarly, agreements on the handling of contractor traffic have been signed for the operator of the traffic in middle and west Jutland, Arriva Danmark. Contractor traffic means that DSB bears the costs for continuing to operate a number of departures in middle and west Jutland in order to thereby ensure direct lines for passengers to the rest of the contry. The revenues from the contractor traffic goes to Arriva Danmark, and DSB is instead compensated via contract payments from the state. Contractor traffic takes place on three lines, where DSB does not have a lot of production and thus not a lot of passenger revenues, which then go to Arriva instead of DSB, and the estimated amount is between DKK 6-7 million per year. The total contract payments amount to DKK 3,941 million, and this partially finances the train operations that are not profitable and partially also other areas of activity on the basis of principles laid out in connection with the traffic contract with the state. With the vision of a market-oriented DSB, DSB has presented an ambitious plan that, together with the investments in the railway infrastructure and the Train of the Future, will result in a significant financial room for manoeuvre in DSB up to 2030. This room for manoeuvre can either be used to eliminate the contract payments or to considerably reduce ticket prices for the benefit of passengers and society at large. 2) This is an analytical decision, as the passenger revenues are in fact also used for co-financing, e.g., stations, sales channels, timetable planning, traffic information, etc. If the passenger revenues were also allocated to Train System, the size of the contract payment to be allocated to these areas of activities would be reduced. 94 Line Accounts Of the total revenues before the leasing of rolling stock, passenger revenue amounts to 53 percentage, contract payments from the state amount to 39 percentage and 8 percentage are from other operating income. In accordance with the traffic contract, the contract payment is thus distributed so that for Stations, it reflects a risk-calculated yield on the invested capital (ROIC) of 3 percentage. For Material and General obligations it reflects a covering of costs without yield and for Systems & Channels it reflects a profit ratio of 5 percentage. The remaining contract payment falls to Train Service, see Figure 11. The positive result for Stations and for Systems & Channels is therefore due to the technical distribution of the contract payment. Of the total income before leasing of rolling stock, 70 percentage finances Train Services and 26 percentage finances Train System tasks while the remaining 4 percentage finances General Obligations.

Of this, 69 percentage are used for Train Service, 30 percentage for Train System and the rest for General obligations. Costs regarding leasing of rolling stock have been disregarded with respect to both income and expenses, as the rolling stock in the line accounts is regarded as neutral intercompany transfers in terms of profit/loss. It is assumed technically that the rolling stock is leased for Train Service without any proceeds. The breakdown of train operations on activity areas is based on Public Services, which is a statement of the activities carried out by DSB under the traffic contract. The basis for breaking down the activities this way is DSB’s Line Economy Model. This model divides the profit and loss account into activities and calculates the economy of the individual line based on an estimate of the activities required in the individual areas. Train operation expenses Most of DSBs’ expenses including depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and financial income and expenses cover Train Services (DKK 7,155 million), distributed on Long-Distance & Regional train traffic (DKK 4,810 million), S-trains traffic (DKK 1,533 million) and Øresund train traffic (DKK 812 million) in 2018, see Table 1. Maintenance of rolling stock and leasing of rolling stock total DKK 3,332 million of 47 per cent of the total expenses for Train Services while expenses for onboard staff amount to DKK 1,683 million or 24 per cent, see Figure 1.

Line Accounts 97 In the coming years, there will be carried out a large number of infrastructure works in Denmark. These infrastructure works are absolutely necessary, and once they have been completed, they will together with the new electrical trains ensure a well-functioning and sustainable train operation that will benefit DSB’s customers. While the infrastructure works are carried out, the works will impact DSB’s finances significantly. In particular, this is in the form of reduced passenger revenues as the customers opt out of taking the train and use other modes of transportation, but it is also in the form of increased costs for replacement transport. Banedanmark grants cover project costs for infrastructure works, while DSB bears the costs for replacement transport when train operations are hindered by track closures due to infrastructure works. In 2018, DSB has spent DKK 253 million on replacement traffic. It is Banedanmark that plans and carries out the infrastructure works. In accordance with the Accounting Regulations, DSB must allocate the complete costs to the activities and thereby also a part of the supporting functions, which constitute DKK 823 million or 12 percentage of the Train Service costs. The supporting functions include multidisciplinary IT functions, staff and shared functions, finance and HR functions as well as working environment and railway safety etc. Half of the supporting function costs comprise payroll and consultancy expenses while the remaining part includes expenses for software development, licences, outsourced data operation centre, insurance, rent and consumption expenses, branding of DSB and amortisation etc. Expenses for supporting functions are allocated to the activity areas based on the number of employees converted into full-time employees involved in carrying out the individual activities. This means that employee-intensive activities account for a substantial part of the expenses. As a consequence Train Services, to which the largest share of employees contribute directly as part of the train crew and indirectly in the workshops, carries a relatively large share of the expenses for supporting functions. The expenses for supporting functions are only variable to a limited extent in relation to the extent of Train Services. The handover of traffic to other operators thus has no influence of note on the costs for interdepartmental IT functions or other support functions. Expenses for Train System Expenses for the Train System, excluding rolling stock, which ensures coherence in Train Services in Denmark are DKK 2,322 million including depreciation, amortisation, write-downs and financial income and expenses, see Table 1. Systems & Channels, which consists of Traffic Operations & Shared Functions and Sales Channels & Customer Service, accounts for DKK 1,704 million or 73 percentage of this while Stations accounts for DKK 618 million or 27 percentage. Sales Channels & Customer Service comprises customer-oriented activities such as ticket sales channels (personal service, digital sale and ticket vending machines), customer service, traffic information, rejsekort (DSB’s co-financing of the travel card system) and marketing. Traffic operations and shared functions includes traffic-oriented activities such as staff, rolling stock and traffic planning, traffic training, safety, monitoring and control of train traffic at the operations centres run by DSB together with Banedanmark etc., see Figure 2. In line with train service, the figures for the train system must be calculated at the fully allocated expenses and thus carry a share of DSB’s total supporting functions. 98 Line Accounts Figure 2: Expenses for Train System 2018 Amounts in DKK million Other sales channels 238 mio. kr.

VAT and tax DSB has partial right of deduction of incoming VAT, since the group has both VAT-liable and VATfree activities. The non-deductible proportion of incoming VAT is included in the individual items in the income statement and the balance sheet. For 2018, the non-deductible VAT amounts to a total expense of DKK 383 million. DSB and part of the group companies share a common VAT registration. VAT is allocated the activity areas according to the relative VAT of the relevant activities. VAT costs then follow the actual costs through the allocation model. Corporation tax will not be allocated to activity areas and lines. In the General Accounts, corporation tax is divided between Public services according to the negotiated contract and Competitive Activities. The corporate tax related to public services has been calculated at DKK 64 million for 2018. Earnings for the year and statement of net contract payments Earnings for the year for Public services has been calculated to be DKK 254 million. The earnings for the year are allocated to DSB’s equity, and thus the owner’s the state’s value of DSB increases in line with the earnings for the year. DSB’s Board of Directors can choose for the earnings or part of the earnings to be granted to the state as dividends. In both cases, part of DSB’s contract payments return to the state. Similarly, the various duties tax, VAT and payroll tax return to the state, just as DSB pays infrastructure charges of using the infrastructure rail tracks and fixed connections that DSB uses in train operations for Long-Distance & Regional train traffic. Line Accounts 99 Figure 3 shows the state’s net contract payment to DSB once these factors have been taken into account in other words, when the contract payments have been deducted from the internal distribution of resources in the sector in addition to the redistribution to other state actors. The net contract payment is thus an expression of the state’s actual payment to DSB for Train operations.

Line accounts The Line Accounts are primarily an internal analysis tool used by DSB to understand the correlations between operations and to analyse and optimise the financial structure of the individual lines. The information on the finances of train operations on individual lines provide a good overview of the societal priorities of Danish train operations. In a broader perspective, the line accounts are suitable for demonstrating the significant extent of DSB’s activities outside the train service activities, which range from planning and monitoring of traffic, customer service and distribution systems to station operation. These are tasks that DSB also take care of on behalf of and in collaboration with the public transport in general. 100 Line Accounts However, the line accounts are not suitable for direct financial comparison between operators, even if such comparison only focused on the train operation activities. Furthermore, the line accounts cannot be used as reference with respect to adjustment of DSB’s expenses in connection with giving up lines to other operators. The reason for this is partly that the line accounts reflect absorption costing and partly that DSB’s expenses, like all other companies’ expenses, are variable to different degrees depending on the production volume. This means that parts of the expenses are only vaguely or not at all correlated with the number of train or seat kilometres driven. Therefore it is the case that there is no noteworthy correlation between the extent of the train services and expenses for, for example, sales and distribution channels, planning systems and surveillance centres. When DSB hands over train traffic, it means that DSB loses economies of scale and opportunities for inter-organisational synergy. The line accounts are based on the activity area Train Services reflecting the costs of operating train services. The costs are allocated to the lines in relation to their use of activities and the supporting functions are allocated to the lines based on the number of full-time employees involved in the individual activities, see Table 2 and Table 3. Positive results reflect that the line operated at a profit and can therefore be operated without any state subsidies. On the other hand, negative results reflect that the line operates at a loss and consequently financing has to be added from profit-making lines and/or government contract payments. According to the Accounting Regulations, DSB is required to also specify the individual lines, including all expenses, regardless of whether the individual expense concerns the extent of production. Therefore, costs for Train System for both Stations and Systems & Channels are broken down into lines in Table 4 and Table 5. In practice, this means that, e.g., expenses for stations, operation of the rejsekort system, ticket vending machines, operations centres controlling traffic to limit delays, etc. The expenses have been broken down by lines, even though these activities do not have any direct connection with the actual financial setup of the train traffic on the individual line. The key figures for Passenger revenues per seat kilometre and Expenses per seat kilometre provide the best indication of how the seat capacity is utilised on the individual lines, see Table 4 and Table 5. Seat kilometres take into account the number of seats available in the individual rolling stock class and the number of train sets/coaches coupled on a line. Train kilometres, which are often used as a key figure, do not take these differences into account. The statement of seat kilometres are associated with some uncertainty, as the statement of journeys, and thus how far the individual customer travels, is to a great extent based on passenger studies based on spot checks and passenger counts. For example, it cannot be stated precisely how often and how far a commuter with a season ticket travels, nor what line the commuter uses (see Figure 10).

Line Accounts 105 Method used for preparation of line accounts As a public undertaking, DSB must fulfil a number of reporting requirements, see Figure 4. The reporting requirements each have their own background and purpose and all aim at creating transparency and a check of DSB’s conditions. However, the requirements consider the company from different perspectives, which makes it difficult to determine the connection between the individual reports and it can also impair the transparency. Figure 4: Reporting requirements in DSB The Danish Consolidated annual accounts Financial Statements Act Annual Report and Annual Law on DSB accounts of Financial Statements affiliated companies Presentation of Public services according to a negotiated Activities exposed to Main Business contract competition RegnskabsAccounting Areas Regulations reglement for for DSB Line Accounts Train Operation Transport Activity Area General Train Services Train System contract Accounts Obligations The Danish Financial Statements Act stipulates requirements for the drawing up of accounts, which cover the whole group and provide insight into the financial position of the whole company. DSB’s Accounting Regulations are designed to separate Public Services from Competitive Activities in order to provide an insight into the activities that are subject to contract payment and ensure that there is no illegal state support. The presentation of the General Accounts, which are reviewed by DSB's External Auditor, divides the parent company’s result into Public Services under a negotiated contract and Competitive Activities. The traffic contract covers only Public Services that are performed under the contract. These services constitute a subset of the parent company's activities. For example, that means that DSB Vedligehold A/S is not covered directly by the Public Service obligation, but indirectly in the form of the preparation and maintenance services that are delivered and invoiced for Train Services. Neither is Kort & Godt A/S covered by the Public Service obligation. The line accounts are based on DSB’s General Accounts where Public Services are separated. The activity area accounts are an attempt to segment activities with reference to the split in the traffic contract. The line accounts are a breakdown of the train operations on the lines in accordance with DSB’s Accounting Regulations. 106 Line Accounts Figure 5: Elements of Train Operations Train Services covers the activities that are associated with the operator responsibilities Train Services of driving trains from A to B. Train Operations Train System covers the activities that contribute to ensuring coherence and effective Train System resource utilisation in the Danish train traffic. DSB operates trains in Denmark as a total activity, but shall, in connection with the traffic contract, prepare and implement a separation of the railway operations into activities related to the actual train movements (Train Operations), and activities related to the maintenance of the production apparatus (Train System), see Figure 5. Financial model for lines The Line Economy Model provides a basis for DSB's General Accounts and line accounts. This creates a unique correlation and a complete transaction track between the individual accounts. The model creates the General Accounts setup by dividing activities into Public Services under a negotiated contract and Competitive Activities, such as, for example, renting out properties to external customers. Public Services are further split into activity areas and the activities that DSB implements to operate the individual lines. The lines contain all accounting entries relating to Train operations, see an earlier definition.

At the resources level, the accounts are grouped and classified according to production proximity, so that the supporting functions are distributed according to the capacity unit’s relative use of resources. The model makes use primarily of objective and systematic basis of allocation based on production information. The Line Economy Model is based on a combination of full cost allocation and activity-based cost allocation . The full cost allocation results from the Accounting Regulations requirement that all costs are allocated to the lines. Definition of lines Figure 7 shows the definitions used for the individual lines that have been adapted to the production and timetable that DSB has used in 2018. The only changes compared to 2017 are that Nordjyske Jernbaner as of 6 August 2017 took over regional traffic in North Jutland, that the line going to Ystad was taken over by Öresundståg as of 10 December 2017 and that the Copenhagen Ringsted line was extended to Slagelse. 108 Line Accounts Figure 7: Line definitions 2018 Long-Distance & Regional Trains • Long-Distance trains are defined as train crossing the Great Belt (the red lines) and these consist of the lines Copenhagen Aarhus Aalborg and Copenhagen Esbjerg. • The remaining InterCityLyn and InterCity lines and ”the tails” of InterCityLyn from Aalborg to Frederikshavn and InterCity from Aarhus to Aalborg are defined as regional trains as this is, in fact, regional train traffic as the trains stop at every station. (Aarhus – Langå – Struer, Fredericia – Vejle – Struer, Struer – Thisted (tail of InterCityLyn), Fredericia – Sønderborg, Aalborg Frederikshavn (tail of InterCityLyn), Aarhus – Langå – Aalborg (tail of InterCity)). Line Accounts 109 • Struer – Thisted is viewed as a separate line, as DSB has an obligation according to the traffic contract to operate the line 6 times a day, but does not receive the associated passenger revenues. • The Øresund traffic is divided into two lines (Copenhagen – Helsingør and Copenhagen Malmø). • The train categories Regional East and Regional West follow the underlying train production. • International train systems, used to a great extent by local travellers on Zealand and in Jutland are defined as regional rail traffic. Definition of activities and division into the activity areas Trains Services and Train System The central element in the Line Economy Model is the definition of the activities carried out by DSB in the train operations. The activity definitions and groupings used support the distinction between Train Operations and Train Systems on which the Activity area accounts are based. Figure 8: Activities in Train Services and Train System Train operation On-board staff On-board service Preparation Cleaning (ticket inspection etc.) Maintenance of Train service (catering) Maintenance based on rolling stock kilometres travelled Other maintenance Energy Energy for train operation Train Services Track closures Replacement Major delays transport Track fees for crossing bridges Infrastructure and per train kilometres Leasing costs for rolling Leasing of rolling stock stock Cleaning Depreciation, Reparation and maintenance amortisation and writeStations Return and depreciation, downs and return on amortisation and write-downs rolling stock on buildings and areas Lifecycle cost Rolling stock Insurance Serviced and self-serviced sales Train System Operational management Commission to other sellers Staff, rolling stock and Sales Channels and Ticket vending machines traffic planning Customer Service Mobile sales Services for disabled Rejsekort passengers Traffic operation and shared functions Marketing Traffic support Traffic information Traffic training Safety Systems & Channels The basic accounting registrations do not directly support a division of the train services in accordance with the activity area perception in the traffic contract. The basic registrations are aimed at supporting the company's current organisation and thus the most effective total train business. That is why the reports on activity areas are based on the basis of allocation of the Line Economy Model. 110 Line Accounts Basis of allocation Development of the Line Economy Model is based on the objective that the model should reflect the revenue, cost and production structure. Since it is an allocation model, the size of revenue and costs per line will depend on the choice of activity groupings and basis of allocation. The train service activities for lines is in general distributed according to the following principles: • If the activity is performed only for operation of a single line, there will be a direct allocation to the line. • If instead the activity is carried out in order to be able to run multiple lines, the costs will be distributed to lines in accordance with an appropriate production parameter. Figure 9: The main basis of allocation for Train Services in the Line Economy Model On-board staff Time registrations by train drivers, conductors and ticket inspectors Maintenance of Rolling stock class hours, rolling stock class kilometres and seat kilometres rolling stock Energy Rolling stock class kilometres Replacement Partial journeys and directly attributed to specific lines transport Infrastructure Bridge crossings and per train kilometres Leasing Average of rolling stock Figure 9 shows the main production-based basis of allocation used in the allocation of the train service activities to the individual lines. This can be illustrated by the examples below: • The full costs of the train transport activity under on-board staff is distributed to the lines based on the locomotive driver’s time registration that is connected to the individual line via the rolling stock. • The full maintenance costs of IC3 train sets are distributed relative to the lines where IC3 train sets are used based on the litra kilometres that the IC3 train set has travelled. • The infrastructure costs for crossing the Great Belt are allocated in proportion to the number of bridge crossings made on the individual line in addition to how many kilometres the individual train has travelled. Distribution of passenger revenue to lines It is not possible to directly quantify the number of journeys in DSB due to the fact that, in public transport, it is possible to ride on buses, the metro and the train without necessarily having to have a travel warrant for a specific departure. This applies to both period tickets and single journeys, since it is possible to buy an open ticket for e.g. Copenhagen Aarhus. Thus, it is not possible to determine whether the journey is made with the long distance train headed for Esbjerg, Aarhus or Aalborg. In addition, a journey can be made across multiple operators and lines. For example, a journey from Tisvildeleje to Aarhus involving the local train from Tisvildeleje to Hillerød, S-train from Hillerød to Copenhagen H and long distance train from Copenhagen to Aarhus can be made on the same ticket. Line Accounts 111 The calculation is further complicated by the fact that there are currently many ticket systems and fare zones that need to be coordinated between different operators. Figure 10: The principles behind the allocation of passenger revenue to lines Journey Sources Journey relations Journey lines Lines Distribution of journey Distribution of journey relations Distribution of revenues to sources on journey relations on journey lines based on lines based on partial via passenger counts occupancy counts and timetables journeys Ticket sales Greater Copenhagen Division of Area journey relations on Regional journey lines, Distribution of Division of i.e. the revenue in journeys into individual lines based on departure and journey is partial Øresund destination split up into journeys one or more International journey portions Free Rejsekort For Long-Distance & Regional trains, DSB therefore uses a number of journey sources, see Figure 10, of which the most significant are DSB’s own ticket sales and Greater Copenhagen area travels in addition to the rejsekort. Among other things, the journeys are assessed by passenger counts in trains and the weighing of trains which is converted to customer numbers. The methods may vary from journey source to journey source and are agreed with the other operators in a given tariff area. The trips must then be divided into travel relationships that show from where and to where the journey is made. Among other things, this is done on the basis of passenger studies 3) looking into travel patterns that provide a statistical weighting that can be used for travel sources. This means that the distribution comes with a certain statistical uncertainty relative to the size of the samples on the individual line and total population of travellers on that line. When travel relationships are established, the journey’s line must be determined in other words, which of the possible lines have been used to travel between two destinations. Since a journey can be made over several lines, it must be shared relatively between the lines. Thus, a trip can be divided into one or more partial journeys. Occupancy counts and timetables are used for splitting across travel lines. 3) The BRIK count in the Greater Copenhagen area and the Country count, as carried out by COWI for Long-distance & Regional trains. 112 Line Accounts Partial journeys are used to allocate passenger revenue to lines in the overall travel revenue model. In the Line Economy Model, this input is used as a basis for distributing the registered passenger revenue. There is thus a certain amount of estimation involved in the passenger revenue linked to individual lines. For S-trains, the line revenues are calculated in a separate passenger count system (APS), which allocates the revenues for the eight main lines. Distribution of income from the traffic contract to areas of activity The Line Economy Model will not be broken down into the contract payment on lines, since there is no unique activity-based method on which to allocate the contract payment. For use for the Activity area accounts, DSB has chosen to allocate contract payment according to the following method. Figure 11: Principles for allocating revenues from the traffic contract to activity areas Contract payment, General Contract Obligations, Remaining Total contract payment, contract payment payment Systems & stations for Train Services Channels and Rolling Stock The contract payment to Stations is allocated so as to ensure an annual return on the invested capital (ROIC) of 3 percentage. The contract payment for General Obligations (historical) is based on cost recovery. The contract payment for Systems & Channels is based on a profit rate of 5 percentage, whereas the contract payment for Rolling stock covers all the project costs for preparation of the purchase of new electric trains for Denmark, since rolling stock rental is charged to the train service activity. The remaining contract payment accrues to Train Services where it is distributed such that the profit ratio is identical for Long-Distance & Regional train traffic, Øresund train traffic and S-train traffic. If a line generates a profit without contract payments, this payment is distributed only to the loss-making traffic areas. In addition, it is assumed that the passenger revenues accrue to Train Services and thus, according to the model, do not contribute directly to the Train System. Line Accounts 113 Distribution of rolling stock rental to Train Service All income and expenses as well as depreciation, amortisation, write-downs and financial income and expenses for rolling stock are collected in two pools, one for Long-Distance & Regional trains (including Øresund) and one for S-trains. However, both pools are exclusive of Train of the Future, which is not included. On the Long Distance & Regional train traffic lines where dedicated rolling stock is used (Odense Svendborg, Odense Ringe, Aarhus Hamburg, Copenhagen Hamburg and Copenhagen Malmø), the line costs are accounted directly with the specific rolling stock costs. The remaining rolling stock pool is regarded as a common pool that can be inserted on all lines and therefore calculated as an average rolling stock lease using the driven km on the individual lines. Rolling stock rental for S-trains is based solely on the actual costs of the rolling stock. 114 Line Accounts Management Statement DSB’s management has considered and approved DSB's Line accounts for 2018. The accounts are drawn up in accordance with the principles and methods specified in the DSB Accounting Regulations, taking into account the interpretations agreed with the Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing. It is our view that • The Accounting Regulations have been respected in 2018, including making the necessary accounting breakdown, see the Section 2 of the Accounting Regulation, such that DSB can account for the need for grants for the passenger traffic. • The model instrument and the basis of allocation used are documented in accordance with the Section 3 of the Accounting Regulations so that DSB can account for financial allocation to lines. Taastrup, 7 February 2019 Flemming Jensen Thomas Thellersen Børner CEO CFO Line Accounts 115 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) DSB’s focus on corporate social responsibility contributes to the creation of a framework within which: • The customers can travel easily, safely and securely with DSB. This includes elderly and disabled customers. • An environmentally and climate-friendly public transport company benefits society, customers, employees and DSB. • There is a good work environment, wherein, among other things, diversity contributes to the development of the DSB. • There is an internal pride in working for DSB that makes a positive contribution to society. It is stated in the ethical policy that DSB will comply with the 10 universal principles of the UN Global Compact, with a focus on human rights and employee rights. The ethical rules require that our suppliers comply with national and international rules regarding child labour, health and safety at work, discrimination, use of forced or involuntary labour, corruption, bribery and the environment. DSB’s ethical policy also includes a whistle-blower scheme providing good opportunities for handling any irregularities as quickly as possible. The environmental policy describes the efforts to actively minimise DSB’s climate impact. In addition, there is an accessibility policy that ensures that customers with disabilities can also make use of DSB’s services. Additionally, DSB has policies for working environment, diversity, employees and communication which creates the framework for proper and safe working conditions and open and honest communication. 116 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) The procurement policy aims to ensure that DSB handles purchases in a professional manner and prevents bribery. Social responsibility is also expressed in the demands that are made to suppliers. In connection with the signing of contracts with external suppliers, DSB ensures that they are familiar with the code of ethics to a relevant extent. Safety and security is a human right. The combined expression of DSB’s work in this context is reflected in the above policies and are documented through the activities below. Collaboration and support Since 2009, DSB has been a part of the UN Global Compact and reports annually on its work related to social responsibility. In 2018, DSB entered into a 4-year strategic partnership with UN’s association for children, UNICEF. The purpose of the collaboration was to make it easy for DSB’s customers and employees to get involved in helping the world’s most vulnerable children, and in that manner contribute towards the creation of a more fair and sustainable future. DSB has chosen to focus on the four of the 17 UN SDGs mentioned below : Ending hunger, ensuring clean water and sanitation, quality education and industry, innovation and infrastructure. In 2018, DSB collected donations of DKK 575,000 to UNICEF’s work, and the ambition for the coming three years is to collect 1 million each year. Since 2008, DSB has collaborated with ‘Natteravnene’, a night watch group consisting of 4,000 volunteers who patrol the cities at night including at stations and in trains. DSB provides financial support to Natteravnene. They can travel by all DSB trains free of charge when they carry out their volunteer work. In addition, DSB has added Natteravnene’s logo and colours to 2 S-trains. DSB collaborates with a number of aid organisations in Denmark by allowing them to collect donations for their charitable causes and to hand out materials to customers at the stations. These organisations include Danmarks Indsamlingen (DR and 12 of Denmark’s largest humanitarian organisations), DanChurchAid, the Danish Cancer Society, ActionAidDenmark, Save the Children Denmark, Danish Red Cross, the Danish Refugee Council and the World’s Best News. At election time in Denmark, DSB also supports the democratic process by permitting the political parties and their candidates to distribute material at the stations in the period leading up to the election. Safety and security It must be safe and secure to be a customer and employee. According to ERAIL (European Railway Accident Information Links), the Danish rail net is among Europe’s safest. This is not least due to the fact that safety is a prerequisite for DSB, and safety is deeply integrated into the way DSB conducts its business. In the safety policy, it is stated: Our customers need to be able to take safety for granted but we must never do so! Surveillance in trains and at stations contributes to safety and security. At the end of 2018, over 2,000 cameras at 143 stations and almost 4,000 cameras in S-trains were installed. As an example, the camera surveillance is used to ensure that police and extra personnel are called in when the situation requires it, and also to help police solve crimes such as vandalism, violent assaults, pick-pocketing, etc. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 117 In all DSB’s trains and at selected stations, heart defibrillators have been installed that once again in 2018 have been used several times to save lives. In 2018, DSB continued working with Trygfonden to hold courses for DSB’s staff in the use of defibrillators. Suicides and attempted suicides are, unfortunately, a recurring event. These are tragic events for the individuals hit by trains and their families, but it also impacts the customers and employees in the form of train cancellations, delays and psychological scarring. In 2018, 27 suicides and 7 attempted suicides were registered (21 and 12, respectively, in 2017). Figure 1: Suicide and suicide attempts Number 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 Suicides Suicide attempts In customer surveys, the customers’ perception of security in trains and at stations is monitored on an ongoing basis. The survey reveals that the customers’ perception of security in 2018 improved in both areas compared to 2017. Figure 2: Customer satisfaction with security Scale 0-10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 Stations Trains Every year, DSB spends large amounts to combat graffiti and to create attractive and safe environments for the customers in trains and on stations. This takes place via preventive efforts such as security guards, etc. and via the cleaning of trains and buildings. 118 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Homeless people who stay at stations and on trains are contributing towards an unsafe environment for the customers. In the winter of 2017/2018, DSB has set up a collaboration with Copenhagen Municipality’s Homeless Unit to help the homeless at stations move on. Among other things, this collaboration has resulted in employees contacting the Homeless Unit when they encounter homeless people in need of help. With the assistance of the Homeless Unit, DSB has also produced a map with a list of overnight shelters that can be handed out by employees. In addition, DSB has been participating in the collaboration ‘Tryg-By 18’ (Safe City 18) with Copenhagen’s police department and Copenhagen Municipality, and the campaign ‘Pickpockets Love Distractions’ has contributed to increasing the security levels around the ticket and payment machines and the ATMs in the Copenhagen area. Occupational health and safety Part of DSB’s strategy is to be an attractive place to work. DSB has a systematic approach towards the working environment, and in 2018 the working environment was once again audited by the OHSAS 18001 standard. In addition, it was decided that in 2020 DSB will transition to using the new ISO45001 standard. In 2018, it was once again a goal to reduce the number of work accidents and absences in general. Accidents with absences declined from 224 in 2017 to 151 in 2018. The decrease is a result of a strengthened systematic analysis of the causes and extent of work accidents in addition to a decrease in violence, threats and accidents involving falls as a result of a great focus and effort dedicated to these areas. Work accidents that did not result in absences have decreased from 845 in 2017 to 723 in 2018. One of the reasons for the decrease is a changed registration procedure, resulting in some incidents now being registered as ‘Run-up to an accident’. All together, work accidents have decreased from 1,069 in 2017 to 874 in 2018. Figure 3: Work injuries Number 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 Accidents with absence Accidents without absence 2018 has also had a focus on reducing the general sickness absence. However, this has not yielded the desired effects, as the absences have increased from 9.1 days on average in 2017 to 9.2 days in 2018. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 119 In 2018, DSB has also worked to reduce stress. This has been accomplished via informational material, tools and courses for top managers. The proportion of employees who respond that they have experienced work-related stress in 2018 was at 28 percent. Part of the action plans include a focus on preventing stress. When many people are gathered together at stations and in trains, and also when it comes to ticket controls, disagreements may occur that can escalate to threats and violence against customers and employees. DSB makes every effort to become better at preventing and managing these situations. Among other things, this is done via the training of employees in conflict management, by collaborating with the police and via a dialogue with the customers. In 2018, DSB also introduced new guidelines for preventing and managing violence and threats, and the focus was on ensuring that the health of the employees is always the top priority. Furthermore, they are guaranteed to have support available when violence and threats have taken place. Over a 3month period, there has been run an external campaign with the message that DSB will not accept violence and threats, and that DSB will report such incidents to the police. This resulted in a major decrease of the number of violent and threatening incidents faced by the employees in 2018. Figure 4: Violence and threats against employees Number 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 Violence and threats DSB has zero tolerance for abusive behaviour in all situations both external and internal. This applies to sexual harassment, violence, threats, or other kinds of harassment. The annual work place assessment include a follow-up report on the extent of abusive behaviour internally in DSB, and this forms the basis for a management-level follow-up. Accessibility DSB wants to ensure that it is easy for everyone to take the train also those challenged by disabilities. DSB offers assistance for the disabled, and it can be ordered around the clock however, at least 12 hours before the planned start of the journey. Similarly, DSB has a companion scheme that allows for the disabled person to bring along a companion at a reduced price. In 2018, DSB provided disability assistance 18,000 times and sold 58,000 companion tickets. 120 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) In 2018, DSB has signed a subcontractor agreement with Region North Denmark. The agreement means that Nordjyske Jernbaner is currently operating all trains north of Aalborg. DSB will receive the orders and handle the assistance aspect of journeys by train with Nordjyske Jernbaner. Likewise, DSB continues to provide disability assistance to customers who take the train between Copenhagen and Ystad. DSB makes a special effort for children who are part of a family living in separate parts of the country. DSB has trained 70 children’s guides who care for the children during the journey in a separate coach to which only the children have seat reservations. In 2018, over 17,000 were sold of these tickets with children’s guides. Diversity DSB wants to be an attractive workplace characterised by diversity, and it believes that a focused and prioritised effort will make the company stronger and increase its competitiveness. DSB therefore has a diversity policy with certain focus areas intended to strengthen this diversity heading towards 2020 including as it relates to trainee positions, management, ethnicity and gender. Since the middle of 2017, DSB has had 80 refugees participate in brief job training courses (4 weeks) or industry learning courses (13 weeks). DSB continues working with these initiatives in 2019. DSB has increased the number of traineeships for apprentices, and at the end of the year, there were 50 traineeship positions for apprentices at the workshops. In addition, in 2018 DSB was also focused on recruiting office trainees and there were 17 such trainee positions by the end of 2018. Equal representation at management levels is an integral part of the staff policy. Among the Board of Directors, the gender distribution was 50/50 (not counting employee representatives), and the board’s gender distribution thus meets the target of having at least one third of the members being of the underrepresented gender. At the end of 2018, the gender distribution on the director level was 29 percent female this is also the case for all managers at DSB and it is almost the same as the proportion of female employees, which is at 26 percent. DSB’s goal is to have a balanced gender composition with at least 1/3 being of the underrepresented gender, which also is a part of the considerations made when recruiting for the company’s ‘green house’ for managers and those aiming for the management levels. Bribery DSB does not tolerate corruption, and it has clear internal guidelines for receiving gifts. The guidelines are communicated to the employees via the intranet and e-learning courses and is also a topic in the introductory training for new employees. DSB also has an acquisition policy with a Code of Conduct that all suppliers must adhere to. DSB trades with both Danish and international suppliers as an integrated part of maintenance works, the acquisition of new trains and other activities. DSB makes a very large proportion of its purchases from known suppliers. In addition, purchases are subject to EU rules for tenders, which helps reduce the commercial risks. Finally, DSB has a whistle blower scheme that is administered by the head of internal audit. DSB has recorded no instances of bribes taking place in 2018. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 121 Environment and climate The most significant risks from an environment and climate point of view are assessed to be airborne emissions from train operations and noise pollution from train operations, workshops and the preparation of trains. DSB Vedligehold A/S is environmentally certified according to the ISO 14001 standard and was recertified in 2018 and in that connection received a certification based on the new version of the standard (ISO 14001: 2015). CO2 emissions The total CO2 emissions in 2018 have fallen by 2 percent compared to 2017. This is due to a significant decline in the consumption of diesel for train operations, a substantial increase in CO2 emissions from train-busses and unchanged emissions from building and workshops. Figure 5: CO2 emission per passenger kilometre Grams 50 40 30 20 10 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 DSB has set a strategic measuring point for sustainability, defined as the emission of grams of CO2 from train operations per passenger kilometre. The figure above shows the results from recent years. It shows a reduction of CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre of 5 percent compared to 2017. A CO2 emission of 36 grams per passenger kilometre makes the train, from a climate point of view, highly competitive in relation to other means of transportation, as cars and planes both emit more than 100 grams of CO2 per passenger kilometre while busses emit 80 grams. The next steps towards the electrification of DSB have been taken. After some initial issues, the line between Lunderskov and Esbjerg is now working well. This has meant that the line now uses electricity instead of diesel, and this results in decreased energy consumption and CO2 emissions. As a result of errors in Rail Net Denmark’s operational electrical power unit on the line, it was not possible to use electric rolling stock for three months of 2018, and thus the full impact of the electrification will only be completely evident in the consumption figures for 2019. 122 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) With the purchase of electric locomotives for the regional traffic on Zealand, DSB has taken the next step towards the reduction of energy consumption and emissions. With the imminent purchase of The Train of the Future, the next steps towards electric trains being in operation on all DSB’s lines will be taken. The total energy consumption for trains in 2018 has decreased by 7 percent compared to 2017. The energy consumption of the diesel train traffic has decreased by 10 percent, which is in part due to the electrification of the Lunderskov Esbjerg line that opened in the fall of 2017 and in part due to the reduced operation of ME locomotives as a result of axle issues in 2018. The total energy consumption for electric trains (S-trains and Long-distance & Regional trains) is unchanged compared to 2017. Table 1: Development in energy consumption and CO2 emissions Change from 2017 to 2018 Energy consumption per Energy consumption per CO2 emission per seat kilometre passenger kilometre passenger kilometre Long-distance & Regional Trains Diesel trains -2% 2% 2% Electric trains -3% -3% -4% S-trains 3% -1% -2% The CO2 emission per passenger kilometre for electric trains has decreased. This is due to an increased use of S-trains and the fact that the share of electric trains used for regional traffic has been increasing. Conversely, the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre for diesel trains has increased due to them representing a lower proportion of regional traffic. Energy consumption 88 percent of DSB’s total energy consumption is used for train operations, which is a small decrease compared to 2017. The energy consumption for things other than train operations has increased by 8 percent in 2018 compared to 2017. In total, this represents a small decrease in the electricity consumption and a larger increase in the consumption of heat, which mainly relates to an increased production in the workshop facilities in Aarhus. The total energy consumption and the composition thereof is shown in the illustration below. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 123 Figure 6: Energy consumption GJ (million) 4,50 4,00 3,50 3,00 2,50 2,00 1,50 1,00 0,50 0,00 2015 2016 2017 2018 Heat Electricity buildings Electricity for trains Diesel for trains Through its environmental policy and the environmental certification of workshops and preparation centres, DSB is focused both on reducing its impact on the surrounding environment and on contributing to the transport sector’s overall restructuring and the reduction of its climate impact. DSB is continuing efforts to reduce energy consumption in buildings and fixed installations. In 2018, the following initiatives have had an impact on the development in electricity and heat consumption: • The closure of four DSB 7-Eleven stores has resulted in a reduction of approximately 700 MWh • The sale of Kalvebod Brygge and the final emptying of the building has reduced both the energy and water consumption • Ongoing replacement of traditional lighting with LED lighting. Particle emissions Diesel trains make a local impact on air quality in the form of particles, NOx, etc. DSB’s main focus is on a reduction of particles, including ultrafine particles. 124 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Figure 7: Particle emissions Index 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 The total emission of particles, calculated by mass, from diesel trains has fallen by 27 percent in 2018 compared to 2017 and by 49 percent compared to 2015. The decrease is a result of a reduced use of MR train sets and the installation of catalytic converters in the MR train sets. DSB has found a solution which results in significant reductions of emissions from the ME diesel locomotives. It has been decided to install new cylinder units and nozzles and to change the settings on the nozzles. In total, this leads to a reduction of particle emissions of 50 percent, a reduction in the consumption of lubricating oil and a small reduction in the consumption of diesel oil. 15 ME diesel locomotives have been changed by the end of 2018 and at the end of 2019, the initiatives will be implemented on all locomotives that are still used for passenger traffic. Complaints and enquiries regarding environmental issues The number of noise and smoke complaints submitted by neighbours and customers increased from 130 in 2017 to 140 in 2018. Complaints and enquiries, by category: • Noise: 88 • Smoke: 8 • Noise and smoke: 25 • Air quality: 19. It is still the ME diesel locomotives which are the primary cause of the complaints and enquiries. This applies to both enquiries from neighbours regarding turn tracks/prep areas and from neighbours to the tracks in Valby and Østerport. In two cases, a municipality has been involved (Fredericia and Aarhus). All the cases were about noise, and they have been resolved. In Aarhus, the municipality has ordered that DSB must reduce Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 125 the noise from the workshop in Sonnesgade to such an extent that the Danish Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines for noise in current residential areas are complied with by no later than 2028. DSB has succeeded in solving the part of the noise issue that concerns workshop activities, and the remaining noise issue is due to shunting by the workshop’s exterior areas. With the coming electrification of train operations, DSB expects that noise from shunting will be significantly reduced and that the noise issues will thus be within the allowable limits. 126 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 127 About DSB Board of Directors The Board of Directors’ directorships in Danish and foreign commercial enterprises.
