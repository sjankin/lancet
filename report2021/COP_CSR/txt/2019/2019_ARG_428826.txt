This report on sustainability forms Letter part of our integrated 2018 annual report and focuses on those aspects of our performance, which are an integrated and necessary complement to our financial and economic performance. First and foremost is an absolute commitment to the safety of our employees, contractors and users of our products and services. While we are encouraged to be making progress on improving our safety indicators, we realize that further cultural change is still needed to achieve our safety objectives. We have decided to change the role of shift leaders in our industrial system to give them more responsibility to lead the change. The ramp up in production at our modern Bay City mill is having an impact on our environment indicators, which are showing a gradual improvement. At the same time, we are investing in our older facilities to improve air quality and material recycling performance indicators. Over 10% of our capital expenditure budget during 2018 was dedicated to projects whose primary aim is to improve our safety and environmental performance. During the years, we have been researching the application of digital, automation and machine learning technologies in our industrial processes and we incorporated many of these new developments into our Bay City mill. Now, we are beginning to introduce these new technologies and transform the rest of our industrial system. This work will be strengthened in the years ahead. We continue to work on transforming our human relations processes to strengthen the role and opportunity for employees to control their own development and career choices and encourage flexible working programs. We are pleased to note that, in our internal surveys, employee engagement has been improving. We are now extending the use of these surveys to our factory-floor employees, which is providing us additional insight into opportunities for improving working conditions. The cornerstone of our programs to strengthen the communities where we operate is our investment in technical education and providing opportunities for promising young students from all backgrounds. As our Roberto Rocca Technical School in Campana completed its fifth anniversary, Pisa and College Board tests show that its pupils are performing appreciably better in mathematics and language than their peers within Argentina and the OECD average. Tenaris 3 Over the past decade, we have focused our expansion strategy on organic growth with the construction of new rolling mills at Tamsa and Bay City and the expansion of heat treatment, threading and service facilities around the world. Now, with the acquisition of a welded pipe mill in Saudi Arabia, the launch of the Tenaris Severstal joint venture project in Russia, and our prospective acquisition of IPSCO Tubulars in the US, we are starting a new phase of industrial expansion in key markets for the oil and gas industry, with the opportunity to further integrate our operations and sustaining values in these communities.

Slag, which is the most emissions based on current technology. relevant co-product in steelmaking, is reused and recycled for multiple applications and Steel produced in our steelmaking sites has products such as roads, cement, asphalt a recycling content higher than 68% as a and coast-consolidation. Also, scale is used weighted average, calculated in accordance in the cement industry, mostly with coto ISO 14021 standards. This steel is used to products from the Direct Reduction plant. produce our pipes. We have achieved these During 2018, we used more than 400,000 values due to the use of electric arc furnaces tons of slag, 30,000 tons of iron-based which allow recycling steel scrap without products from the Direct Reduction plant altering steel properties. and 80,000 tons of scale.

For • Implement the best water management instance, during 2018 we recycled 8,500 tons technologies available for new of wood and 2,500 tons of plastic, including production lines. plastic thread protectors. Moreover, we have developed several campaigns to reduce Our actions single use of plastics. We have evaluated the water-stress level of the areas where we have operations. Our efforts focus on those facilities where the activities involve high rates of water use, such as steelmaking, rolling and heat treatment for seamless pipes. Welded pipes facilities and finishing plants processes require significantly lower amounts of water. Most of our more intensive water-use facilities are located in areas of medium water-stress risk. In all of these cases, our sites have water systems able to recycle high amounts of water. We monitor water discharges following local and also corporate references in order to make sure we meet quality requirements. The Bay City production center operates under a water system that recycles 95% of the used water, while blow down is further treated in the local wastewater treatment facility. Sustainability Report 2018 26 Environment The same concept was applied in our new heat treatment and finishing facilities in Colombia, which were designed to recycle all used water. After treatment, even wastewater from sanitary services is used to water green areas of the new site. Also in Colombia, a new wastewater treatment facility is in the start-up phase for a new coupling phosphate line, in order to treat effluents and recycle the rinsing water, since it is located in an area with low water availability. 80% of water withdrawal in our sites comes from surface water, and 17% from subsurface, with the remaining coming from the local networks. Siderca accounts for more than 95% of our surface withdrawal because the site was originally designed with an open water circuit at the shore of Parana de Las Palmas River, in an area of high water availability. The company has invested USD 20 million in a new treatment facility for the water circuit of the rolling mills, which started to operate by the end of 2018, maximizing water recycling rates, improving treatment processes and reducing water intake by up to 20%. We will continue to make more investments in the following years to change the water management system of the Siderca mill. Our efforts for better water management do not stop at our production centers. In fact, we have developed Dopeless® technology, a dry multifunctional coating applied at Tenaris mills, that minimizes the need to use water for pipe preparation. Connections using Dopeless® technology do not need to be cleaned on the field, while standard threads require between 10 to 20 liters of water per pipe.

By partnering with the customer, we reduce the costs of operations through an integrated service solution that covers technical advice for product selection, collaborative demand and supply planning, efficient supply chain management from the mill to the rig and on-site technical assistance. With Rig Direct®, we shorten the supply chain and ensure the availability of tubular products, sucker rods and accessories in the right quantity, place and time. An improved inventory management system lowers obsolescence and rejection rates, as well as reduces the need to scrap, re-thread rejected pipes, transport them and then produce new pipes, with the consequent reduction of environmental emissions. With service centers and yards strategically located closer to our customers’ operations, we are able to respond faster to customers’ needs while reducing the total energy footprint.

This results in a lower impact at the well site in terms of water use and waste generation, while ensuring a safer workplace for everybody at the rig. By implementing pipe-by-pipe traceability, we can keep track of goods and update tubular status in each part of the process. Pipe preparation, including inspection, tallying, delivery scheduling and execution, ensures tubulars are received at the field or quay in the best conditions. With our PipeTracer® technology, customers have access to technical pipe information, avoiding manual pipe measurement and reducing handling, errors and work load, thus making operations safer and more efficient. Through our Net Invoicing model and a better-planned demand, customers can reduce stocks and only pay for the tubulars that are used, enabling to cut costs while taking care of the environment, as we only need to produce and transport the pipes and accessories that will actually be utilized thus contributing to minimizing the CO2 related to the project. Less material is handled, which also improves the overall safety of the operation. Additionally, our teams also inspect and clean any surplus pipes and recover them for future use.
