(AHPI) is a social initiative funded by its founding president and CEO, duly certified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines. We are actively creating solutions, to support and advance the realization of UN’s Global Development Goals for Agenda 2030, which is to address socio-economic issues in both local and international scenes. For 2018, with our dedicated Team and Partners, we launched two (2) of its flagship projects (DeLight and LunchBox Projects) to inspire communities and strategically give way to more of our advocacies (EducFunds, Heal@Home and iProtect Projects). Though the EducFunds Project has already been started with other Organizations for years, we intend to increase its impact by engaging the community more as they are the main reason why we are doing these. Looking ahead, rest assured we will not break the momentum. There are a lot of activities installed this year and a lot of children/families who are yet to enjoy your generosity and support!!! From the Actions Hub Team, thank you very much!!! Deborah Gay A. Dayrit CEO-President Actions Hub Philippines, Inc. 3 Our Advocacies DeLight Project will provide support and participation to an organization that aims to bring sustainable solutions that are replicable, scalable and locally sourced to the grassroots level. We specifically fund the Solar Lighting Project to target beneficiaries from disaster-affected areas and households with no access to electricity. To help mitigate hunger, our LunchBox Project will provide sustenance by serving free lunch to undernourished children, primarily done in public schools that is supported by the community through backyard organic farming. The goal is to improve health, reduce absences and community involvement. Providing scholarship grants, trainings & values formation to deserving children and juvenile delinquents in impoverished areas, EducFunds will support them to have opportunities on trade and skills advancement, in partnership with accredited training institutions for future employment. Heal@Home aims to heal the hearts, provide proper nutrition, encourage good health and well-being to kids by providing them shelter. The goal is to accommodate and rehabilitate hurting children (street children, victims of molestation and out of school youths) in a built-in facility. This will prepare them in the future to be well-adjusted and productive citizens. Our iProtect Project would be focused more on the basic medical needs, protective gears and solutions to provide potable water to communities. 4 DeLight Project Launch MOA Signing Solar Lamp Assembly Earth Hour 2018 A partnership was signed together Together with the First Scout Ranger In support to UN’s Sustainable with the Hapi L.I.F.E.
