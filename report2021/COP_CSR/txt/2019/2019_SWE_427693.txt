After our best result ever in 2018 we start 2019 with a wellfilled order backlog, strong financial position and four collaborating business 4.9% areas that together give Peab breadth and stability and spread our risks. We can look back on a successful 2018 with higher net sales, profits and margins for the Group. All our business areas developed positively and we enjoyed the effect of The operating margin improved to 4.9 all the work we have put into building a stronger and more stable Peab. Operating percent compared to 4.8 percent in 2017. profit was a high of SEK 2.6 billion with an improved operating margin of 4.9 percent. Although the level of orders received was slightly lower towards the end of the year it totaled SEK 51.1 billion for the entire year, which meant an outgoing order backlog of SEK 45.8 billion. Construction and Civil Engineering, which perform contract work, delivered higher net sales and profit and Industry reported clearly improved profit. In Project Development a weaker housing market led to slightly lower net sales and SEK 45,8 billion profit in Housing Development while Property Development reported higher profits in our wholly and partially owned property holdings. Cash flow and net debt were affected during the year by more tied up working capital and continued investment in machinery and our operations and investment properties. The Group equity/assets The order backlog at the end of 2018 was ratio at year-end was 30.4 percent, a great deal more than our goal of 25 percent. record high SEK 45.8 billion (40.2). DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IN A MARKET GOING SIDEWAYS The housing market in Sweden is expected to continue to contract in 2019 while other building construction is expected to remain on the same level. Housing and other building construction is expected to level out in Norway. The construction market in Finland is expected to increase in housing and develop sideways in other building construction. The civil engineering market conditions in Sweden and Norway are expected to continue to be good in 2019, primarily driven by government infrastructure investments. Stable economies in the Nordic region and a substantial underlying need provide a solid foundation for the construction market over time. NORDIC COMMUNITY BUILDER WORKS SUSTAINABLY For Peab responsible entrepreneurship means working sustainably. Our sustainable work is based on the UN’s Global Compact (which we support), the global goals for sustainable development, our core values, business concept, vision, strategic goals and our Code of Conduct. We have established our focus areas and business plan for 2018-2020 taking the sustainable aspects Social, Environment and Economy into consideration. We have also identified risks in each sustainable aspect. Our focus PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 3 Comments from the CEO areas and business plan goals guide us when we implement and concretize our sustainable work so that every employee can include it in their role and daily work. “Our business model with IMPORTANT STEPS TOWARDS A HEALTHY INDUSTRY AND SAFE BUSINESS four collaborating business The past two years Peab has worked hard for a sustainable industry where healthy areas creates opportunities competition flourishes. There is still a substantial competency challenge in the industry throughout the entire value and to handle it, and provide customers with the products and services they demand chain in our projects.” – at the right time, for the right price and with the right quality – we need both domestic and foreign labor. A more open labor market puts higher demands on having a clear set of rules and equal terms. This is a major challenge in our industry since it is complex and consists of so many players. We have continued our work with safe business in Construction 2018 taking a number of measures such as stricter self-monitoring, tighter purchasing steering and more proactive risk management. At the same time we have made tougher demands on other parties. We have also engaged in different collaboration Most satisfied customer projects where together, through transparency and common procedures, we have Best workplace Project gradually formed a healthier industry. Today knowledge and openness in these matters Development Most profitable company Civil Engineering is much more widespread but there is still a lot more to do. Healthy competition and safe business will continue to be among our highest priorities going forward. DIVERSITY BY DEVELOPING PEOPLE Peab consists of 15,000 skilled, committed people. One of the issues closest to my Industry heart as CEO is the desire for each one of them to feel included, that they own our core values and that they can develop to their full potential in the company. This builds and spreads the Peab spirit: a culture that both attracts and retains diversity. While we develop our employees we continue to work to broaden the industry and open it up for other talented people. This is why we continue to teach every employee about diversity and equal treatment and actively develop our safety culture. At year-end we reached our goal with The 100 Club when 102 adult immigrants had either been trainees or begun working at Peab. At least that many youths have received a Swedish education through the Peab School. I am proud of our integration work and thankful for all our new, competent personnel. We have learned a lot about including people with different backgrounds in recent years. Now the work continues. A BROAD BUSINESS MODEL CREATES STABILITY AND A STRONG OFFER We have a unique business model where 15,000 employees that share the same core values are united in four business areas and together create total solutions for our customers. Our business areas give us a competitive edge and unique collaboration opportunities for rational and quality ensured production, from a to z. By increasingly using conceptualized construction methods and tech solutions we intend to take quality and efficiency a step higher for our customers in 2019. Our people, core values, business models and modern production methods all lead to achieving our strategic goals; to have the most satisfied customers, be the best workplace and the most profitable company in the industry. 60 YEARS OF COMMUNITY BUILDING Förslöv in March 2019 Peab started in 1959, which means we turn 60 this year. Our fantastic company is still building communities on the same foundation as then, underpinned by our values and our desire to build for people. Now I look forward to furthering this work. We have been constantly developing for 60 years but we have never forgotten our roots. This balance makes Peab unique and sustainable. Jesper Göransson I want to thank each and every one of our skilled, committed employees: you who President and CEO are with us today, and you who were with us 60 years ago and helped lay the first cornerstone of this unique company. We build Peab together.

PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 8 External circumstances and the market ROUTE E45 Gothenburg Nordic construction and civil engineering market Late cycle growth and weaker inflation The global business cycle was characterized in 2018 by several late cycle driving forces like a strong labor market, rising investments, high capacity utilization and recruitment difficulty. Growing concern for a recession combined with unforeseeable political gambits from the US and uncertainty about the effects of a trade war between the US and China contributed to the decline in global financial markets at the end of 2018, which meant the year began and ended with weak economic cycle data. Despite all this the global economy on the whole grew on par with 2017. Both the Eurozone and China slowed while growth in the US accelerated. The global economy is expected to slow in 2019 and level out in 2020. The slowdown is expected to be widespread and affect China and the US as well as Europe. Despite a strong labor market and the belief unemployment will continue to contract, salaries are rising at historically low rates. This, together with an increasingly global market in goods and services, digitalization and aging populations, is expected to keep the underlying inflation pressure at bay. It should also mean that interest rates remain low.

To attain this we practice responsible entrepreneurship based on our core values, business concept, vision, strategic goals and our Code of Conduct. This means we also follow the UN Global Compact. The sustainable areas Social, Environment and Economic have played a big part in forming our focus areas and business plan goals for the period 2018­-2020. These goals are aimed at achieving sustainable methods and work patterns. Responsible entrepreneurship permeates every aspect of Peab. Peab’s vision is to be the Nordic Community Builder and we want our stakeholders to experience us as such. Construction, like building homes or modern infrastructure, is one part of our contribution to a sustainable society. Another part is creating the best possible conditions for the people who will be in these environments that we plan, build and construct. In our role as a major but yet local employer it is crucial for us to have good insight into local community needs. Our ambition is to then convert this knowledge into an active commitment to society and be truly useful locally. We can do a lot ourselves but even more in partnership with others. As one of Sweden’s largest construction companies we play a big part in keeping the industry sound, safe and attractive. We can create added value for our stakeholders by running our Peab’s definition business sustainably, responsibly and long-range. of sustainability STAKEHOLDERS GUIDE US For Peab sustainability Peab’s stakeholders’ needs and demands greatly influence how the Group prioritizes and acts.

We have found that the sustainability areas previously identified as the most relevant for our business to manage, monitor and report on are still the same in 2018. During the year extensive work has been done to overhaul the monitoring processes in these areas. This has During 2018 Peab carried out an analysis and a developmental resulted in, among other things, a slight reduction in key ratios in project to determine which of the UN’s 17 sustainable development order to ensure the quality of the data. goals we have the best prerequisites to contribute to. There were several steps to this work, in our operations as well as in the Peab’s materiality areas, with their associated prioritizations, are Board and executive management, where the 17 goals with their comprehensive and complex, which means that reaching our goal 169 targets were discussed and processed. One conclusion takes time and requires persistence and continuity. Our ongoing was that as a Group Peab more or less contributes to, and is stakeholder dialogues keep us continually updated on what affected by, every global goal since they are all integrated and influences stakeholders’ decisions, and their expectations of us. inter-dependent. However, for the period 2018–2020 five of the goals are extra prioritized since they are either areas that hold significant potential risk or areas where Peab has a good chance of promoting sustainable development. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 17 Our take on sustainable operations Steering Peab’s sustainable work Working sustainably is fundamental to Peab’s responsible entrepreneurship and has therefore top priority in our core operations. Peab’s strategic sustainable work is focused on handling risks, systematic quality work and in an inventive, responsible manner making sustainable development, internally and through external collaboration, possible. Peab’s Board prioritizes sustainability matters and has given Peab’s executive management the overriding responsibility for steering the Group’s sustainability work and for monitoring the integra­tion of sustainability into every aspect of our business. For Peab working sustainably is an essential, strategic issue which is put into practice locally and in a down-to-earth manner.

PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 18 Our take on sustainable operations STEERING IN THE ECONOMIC AREA Peab’s executive management is responsible for steering purchases and the work with ethics and anti­-corruption. The central steering document for these areas is the Code of Conduct. The Ethical Council plays an important role in handling and monitoring the work with ethics and anti­-corruption complemented by the Group’s whistleblower function, which is an essential tool for pointing out deviations from the Code of Conduct and valid legislation. The Group Head of Purchasing holds the highest responsibility for purchasing. The Group’s regulations and processes are clearly communicated throughout the company. An important part of them are the basic requirements in Peab’s written contracts such STEERING IN THE AREA ENVIRONMENT as signing and following the Code of Conduct.

Most of Peab’s business operates within the framework for a management system that is certified according to ISO 14001. Some of Peab’s Swedish operations are also certified according to ISO 9001:2015 and an equivalent certification of Norwegian operations will begin in 2019. The environmental management system is an integral part of the business management system and supplemented by Peab’s Environmental Policy, which meets all the requirements for ISO 14001:2004. The business areas are responsible for creating processes and action plans that implement management systems and policies and ensure compliance in daily operations. The business areas must also continually work on improvements that lead to lower environmental impact based on the three Group goals. Peab’s work in the area Environment has an effect on our own operations but to a much higher degree it affects the world around us, particularly considering the lion’s share of global emissions that the construction and civil engineering industries represent. PEAB'S SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Peab reports its sustainability work according to the reporting standard Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and it is our belief that to all extents and purposes it follows version 4.0, CORE. The extent of the sustainability report can be seen in the related GRI appendix found at peab.inpublix.com/2018 where the GRI index and sustainability data is compiled.

SAFE, SECURE WORKPLACES AND EMPLOYEES THAT ENJOY THEIR JOBS Like the construction and civil engineering industry in general, Peab’s employees For the GRI index and are exposed to risks at work. Peab has a vision of zero workplace accidents, which sustainability data see means work on the work environment, safety and health has top priority. Compared peab.inpublix.com/2018 to last year the number of accidents (definition: more than 8 hours absence, per million hours worked) dropped from 15.1 to 14.2 in 2018. We will continue to work systematically and proactively every day with risk observations, risk assessments, risk management and other preventive measures in our daily operations in order to prevent incidents, accidents and injuries as well as promote health and well-being. Whenever we discover a risk we report and remedy it as part of our systematic work environment work (SAM) that includes important follow-up. All our 14,614 co-workers (100 percent) at Peab’s workplaces are covered by a health and safety management system. The system is only reviewed internally. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 21 Social Peab wants to prioritize preventative work environment efforts and in 2018 an extensive project was carried out to increase risk observation reports in our organization. This is done through an AIR system (Accident and incident reporting). It resulted in a notable increase in the number of observations and Peab received valuable new information on mechanisms that can cause, but above all prevent, risks. Understanding cause and effect is vital to to working proactively and encouragingly. Therefore the first stage of a Group project, created within the framework of focus area Secure business and aimed at improving the safety culture in Peab, was carried out in 2018. The overriding goal of this long-term project is to achieve our vision of zero workplace accidents by increasing awareness and changing risk and safety behavior. The project is based on current research with firm ties to our local operations in Sweden, Norway and Finland. This year Peab’s annual health and the work environment focus week, when members of Peab’s management visit workplaces, was held in August. Discussions during the week give us an understanding of the challenges as well as the good examples of what feels safe, healthy and secure. In 2018 managers and members of Group functions visited 558 (791) workplaces and 940 (798) discussion meetings were held on the work environment. The dialogues were largely about how we can be better at listening, In December 2018 we concluded our threebeing considerate and being able to ask for help; subjects of discussion that led to year participation in The 100 Club where we more of our employees than ever before saying they felt like they had been included. promised through a statement of intent to the Swedish Public Employment Service to offer internships or jobs to 100 immigrants. COMPETENCE CHALLENGES FOR BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND PEAB At the end of the year we reached our goal The construction and civil engineering industry is in sore need of people with qualified with 102 participants, thanks to the huge skills. Competition is intense and the industry continues to face major challenges in commitment by our entire organization. mirroring society’s diverse composition. In 2018 Peab further developed our work to Integration initiatives like The 100 Club are an important part of our role as community attract, recruit, develop and retain competent employees. Working together with builder but above all they are a valuable educational facilities is crucial to attracting new skills and Peab continually tries to component of our skills recruitment. develop the framework and scope of this cooperation. Some examples are internships for both university graduates and vocational studies students, tutorial help with master’s dissertations and collaboration in different development projects. Our most important mission, however, is to make sure that the employees we already enjoy their work and can develop at Peab. Nothing matters more important than our employees. NORWEGIAN TRADE COLLABORATION FOR MORE YOUNG HOUSE BUILDERS In 2018 Peab and a number of other construction companies in Norway collaborated with all the high schools in Oslo to create an entirely new kind of trade training. For a few days 800 ninth graders from 49 schools were taught how to build houses. The hope is that this unique project will inspire more young people to get an education in construction or civil engineering. Peab arranged a diversity workshop How can we create an inclusive industry that is attractive and available to everyone, independent of gender or background? Enthusiasts from various companies and organizations gathered together at a workshop to listen and learn from each other about working with inclusion, diversity and equality. Peab’s initiative came in the wake of the statement of intent for an inclusive construction industry free from discrimination that almost all the construction industry signed. “Everyone in the room agreed that diversity and inclusion are not about being competitive – they are a matter of survival for an entire industry,” says Hesho Salih, teacher at Peab and the Peab School, who led the workshop. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 22 Social POPULAR PEAB COURSE AT FINNISH METROPOLIA UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES In the autumn of 2018 Peab arranged a five-credit course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences in Helsinki. The course included responsible allocation on construction sites, diversity, communication, goal orientation and handling challenging situations. Leaders from Peab were also some of the lecturers. Around a hundred construction students participated in the course which ended with presentations of group projects at Peab’s offices in Ultimes Business Garden in Helsinki. THE IMPORTANCE OF A GOOD START We know that our new employees need a proper introduction to both our business and their role in it in order to get a good start. It is particularly important for young people who may have never had a job before. In 2018 730 (1,119) people participated in an introduction day for new employees aimed at broadening their knowledge about Peab’s business and core values. A digital introduction was also offered as a complement. More sections of the introduction will be digitalized and supplemented with a local Gold to our introduction package in 2019. leadership COMPASS GUIDES MORE EMPLOYEES ON THEIR CAREER PATH program In 2018 Peab further developed the career map we began to work on the year before Peab was awarded the 2018 Gold to ensure that all our employees can identify their career path.

In addition, quantitative goals for gender balance were established for each business area as our strategic and operative work with diversity, equality and equal treatment continued. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 23 Social All employees should know what’s what at Peab, be aware of their rights and obligations and feel a responsibility to hinder discrimination, offenses, harassment, sexual harassment and mobbing by standing up for our core values and promoting equal treatment and inclusion. We have chosen to build up knowledge and responsibility through dialogue with our employees based on our equal treatment plan. Part of Peab’s Ethical Council’s responsibility is to ensure that reports of victimization, harassment and discrimination are investigated by impartial expertise, usually an external investigator. In 2018 2,054 (3,380) employees were educated in diversity and equal treatment, which means altogether around 7,000 since the methodology was introduced in the autumn of 2015. The education will continue in 2019. The entire industry has diversity problems and Peab is no exception. Gender balance Successful summer is a particular challenge. Women still only make up 13 percent of our employees which means we need to step up the tempo of change in 2019. The Group has set tough vacation project targets regarding gender balance which provides a platform for more rapid development. During two summer weeks a group of high school students in Solna got the chance to try on the construction Another important part of diversity work is our commitment to integrating immigrants business. They renovated the youth into the labor force. By the start of 2018 Peab had achieved the goal of The 100 Club center and block courtyard Byparken and noted that more than a hundred adult immigrants had received internships and/or under the guidance of Peab counselors and Peab School construcjobs since the start of the program in the autumn of 2015.

In 2018 there were about 240 students in the construction and civil engineering program, 50 in the introduction program for vocational training and 90 students in the program Language introduction for immigrants. This means that so far 930 youths have received their upper secondary education through us and that about 70 percent of them have found employment, most of them at Peab. Having access to internships at Peab’s workplaces with our trained counselors is a key factor for success. In January 2018 all the Peab Schools underwent an extensive examination by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate without a single criticism, which is a confirmation of the level of our engagement over many years in education for youths. Peab continued to collaborate with the Mentor Foundation in 2018 and 40 (50) of Peab’s employees were mentors in some way. Peab’s long-term investment in our own schools has been broadened to include NORDIC COLLABORATION AROUND adult education and in 2018 the Peab School’s subsidiary with trained, experienced VOCATIONAL TRAINING teachers taught 3,301 Peab employees about the Code of Conduct, equal treatment, In September Peab and the Peab School received a visit from a large delegation from our core values, ethics, the safety culture the work environment and held language Finland. Included among the visitors were courses. It looks like this number will grow further in 2019.

The visit was the first step in exchanging experiences between the countries regarding the shape of modern vocational training in the future. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 24 Environment On the road to our environmental goals In 2017 Peab adopted three ambitious environmental goals for the Group and in 2018 we began the journey to reach them. We will take responsibility for our environmental impact throughout entire value chains and life cycles, in order to reduce our climate impact, ensure highly material efficient operEnvironmental ations and phase out environmental and health hazardous materials. Our step-up environmental goals are demanding and require constantly expanding our competence in this area. During the year we held educational “environmental Sustainability step-ups” and increased environmental rounds in the Group. aspects Climate impact REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS REQUIRES NEW METHODS Resource efficiency As one of the largest Nordic construction companies Peab takes a big responsibility  Phasing out environmentally and for reducing climate impact. In addition, we operate in an industry and are part of a health hazardous substances production chain that in many ways contributes to society’s energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. Most of our carbon dioxide emissions are generated by fossil fuel used in vehicles and construction machinery, heating workplaces and manufacturing products. We work proactively to reduce, and in the long run phase out and replace, fossil fuels with renewable fuels. We also work on producing energy For the GRI index and saving measures and contribute to innovations in this field. A substantial part of this sustainability data see work has to be done together with others and in 2018 Peab signed the Construction peab.inpublix.com/2018 and Civil Engineering Sector’s Road Map for Fossil Fuel Free Competitiveness. RENEWABLE FUEL AND CLIMATE SMART SOLUTIONS ARE THE FUTURE Peab works actively to reduce the environmental impact of our vehicles. We adopted a new car policy in 2018 aimed at choosing vehicles with a better environmental profile. Greater use of fossil free fuel and working on electrification are some of the measures we are developing for our vehicles and construction machines as well as in production. Streamlining our logistics is an ongoing process and contributes to reducing emissions. Peab steadily increases the amount of fossil free fuel we use and the Group’s overall consumption is now at 47 percent. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 25 Environment PEAB’S SUBSIDIARY LÄTTKLINKERBETONG IS PRAISED FOR ITS LOGISTICS Peab’s subsidiary Lättklinkerbetong is a pioneer and was praised for this at the annual Concrete Gala, in particular for the modern and climate smart way it handles logistics. Over 60 percent of precast concrete elements are transported from the factory by railroad. Since 2017 over 1,000 railroad cars with precast concrete elements have left the factory in Ucklum for deliveries to construction sites in Sweden and Norway. ECO-­ASFALT® LOWERS EMISSIONS FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW Bio­-oil is used for drying and heating the gravel material in the manufacture of Peab’s ECO­-Asfalt®, which is the process that requires the most energy. Bio-­oil is climate Peab’s comprehensive neutral and made from vegetable surplus products from food production. At the end of 2018 ECO­-Asfalt® represented 95 percent of Peab’s total production at stationary environmental goals Year 2045 we will be climate neutral plants in Sweden. Since January 2015 climate impact from production has dropped by 63 percent or 112,000 tons (70,000 tons until 2017). In 2018 the reduction was  Year 2040 our business will be 100 42,000 tons (39,000), which is equal to approximately 32,000 cars (30,000) driving percent material efficient 1,300 Swedish miles each (100 g CO2 equiv./km). In 2018 a third party reviewed  Year 2030 we will have phased out Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) was published which presents the product’s environmentally and health total climate impact. Our next step is concentrating on recycling where there is hazardous substances considerable potential to increase the amount of return asphalt in new production without affecting the quality of the product. GROWING RANGE OF GREEN MACHINES Peab’s subsidiary Lambertsson has long offered construction equipment driven by electricity: compactor tools, excavators and wheel loaders. In 2018 Lambertsson expanded its range of green machines, particularly hybrid excavators that through a power unit run entirely on electricity and are emission free. The company has also added other models of excavators and broadened its range with new kinds of electrical machines like compactor machines and rollers. Lambertsson’s new program is completely in line with the transition from being fossil dependent to fossil free that the construction and transportation sectors are going through. Civil Engineering follows The Green Line In 2018 the business area Civil Engineering initiated an extensive educational program concerning the environment. The program, which will continue into 2019, is aimed at implementing our work method for the environment, communicating our environmental goals and producing a basis for improvement work. Within the program’s framework a dialogue has been held with all the regional management groups, white collar workers in production have participated in a day of environmental education and skilled workers are participating in digital environmental education. At the same time environmental rounds with digital registration are being held to monitor environmental work. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 26 Environment >60 % CIRCULAR MATERIAL FLOWS SAVE RESOURCES Recycling operations in Peab’s subsidiary Swerock contribute to a resource efficient society by reusing and recycling residue products that also create value from industrial processes and construction and civil engineering projects.

Comprehensive responsibility and of precast concrete elements are transported by railroad. expertise ensure an environmentally and financially efficient management that prolongs the life, and maximizes the usefulness, of the materials involved. ENERGY MAPPING IN STAGES In 2016 and 2017 we began work on energy mapping in two business areas, Industry and Construction, and in 2018 it was time for Civil Engineering. Our ambition is to gain knowledge about our energy consumption to be able to prioritize the right energy saving measures. We have therefore installed meters in our concrete operations in Industry and Civil Engineering. We have also begun implementing an energy monitoring system to facilitate analysis of the energy saving measures made. ECOLABELING BUILDINGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE Peab Bostad’s newly produced apartment buildings in Sweden are certified according to the Swan ecolabel. In 2018 Peab received a service license in Sweden to build Swan labeled buildings, which means we can offer simpler and more cost-efficient labeling of apartment buildings, schools and preschools. In Norway Peab’s office operations are environmentally certified according to Miljøfyrtårn, which takes into account the work environment, purchasing profile, energy use, transport, waste and emissions. Peab’s Property Development in Finland is specialized in office properties with sustainable LEED certification. In Sundsvall Civil Engineering is involved in creating a logistics park. This is the first project of its kind that will be certified according to CEEQUAL in Sweden. Dry Wall Project – a circular flow of its own The planet’s resources are finite and as a major community builder it is important for Peab to take responsibility for more recycling and less waste. In 2018 business area Construction carried out a pilot project in all new production in Malmö. The purpose of the project was to try to create a circular flow of its own for dry wall. The project primarily concentrated on workplace equipment, information, cooperation among all the players involved and logistic chains. The pilot project showed that it is actually possible to create a circular flow for dry wall. The next step is to try to scale up the endeavor and recycle greater volumes, thereby reducing the amount of waste. Our hope is that through the circular dry wall flow we can show that higher profitability and reduced environmental impact can go hand-in-hand. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 27 Environment 42,000 MATERIAL EFFICIENT OPERATIONS REQUIRE COLLABORATION Peab’s operations generate large amounts of residue products. If we are going to achieve our goal of material efficiency we have to both generate less waste and take care of, and recycle, as much as we can. Developing more material efficient methods In 2018 Peab Asphalt reduced its CO2 requires creative collaboration with suppliers and customers in order to form new, emissions by 42,000 tons through efficient solutions. Clean material flows are also the basis for creating circular flows. ECO-Asfalt®. For example, we recycle waste insulation that becomes loose fill insulation and in a pilot project that Peab participates in mineral wool waste is sent back to the supplier to become new mineral wool products. Another example is dry wall where the recycled material can be used directly to produce new sheets of dry wall. WASTE MANAGEMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT Handling waste and residue products in an environmentally correct way, according to the laws, regulations and trade agreements applicable, is self-evident for Peab. However, our primary goal is to not generate waste and Peab strives to make a precise calculation of the amount of material and masses needed in production. For instance, there is a pilot project in Finland aimed at reducing waste. Another example is our efforts to create mass balance and refine landfill masses. Waste removal is performed by contracted waste management companies that also handle the waste and sort it into fractions based on The Swedish Construction Federation’s guidelines. With the aid of Peab’s environmental navigator, a database with waste information, we can monitor the waste in our projects and follow the amount, sorting and what has been recycled, gone to landfill and so on. Through the environmental navigator we can come to conclusions about how our waste management can be more efficient. GRADUALLY PHASING OUT ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS Peab works systematically to phase out environmentally and health hazardous materials. The Group follows a concise phasing out plan that has a challenging tempo and requires cooperation over Group function and business areas lines.

We know that a  Responsibility in the supply chain sustainable supply chain, good business ethics and healthy work conditions are key factors in the sustainable business.  Ethics and anti­corruption CONTINUING TO ESTABLISH OUR CODE OF CONDUCT In 2018 we went through Peab’s updated Code of Conduct with our employees and other stakeholders. The Code is based on Peab’s core values, business ethics, business For the GRI index and principals, human rights, work conditions and the environment. The Board of Directors sustainability data see establishes Peab’s Code of Conduct. It is applicable to everyone in the Peab Group peab.inpublix.com/2018 and contains guidelines for how we ought to behave in different situations and towards each other. We also demand the Code of Conduct be respected and complied with by our business partners. PEAB STRIVES FOR THE MOST SATISFIED CUSTOMERS The purpose of Peab’s annual SCI (Satisfied Customer Index) surveys with external and internal company customers and private housing customers is to provide us with a good understanding of our customers’ differing needs and desires along with PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 29 Economic fostering long-­term customer relations.

The Group’s four business areas are dependent on a large number of suppliers and subcontractors. Peab’s purchases make up more than 70 percent of net sales and involve more than 40,000 suppliers. The work to guarantee a sustainable supply chain is one of Peab’s most important areas of risk management. “Guaranteeing a A key factor in safe business is making sure that we only work with quality-ensured suppliers. We have the same high demands on our business partners as we put on sustainable supply ourselves. A crucial part of the quality assurance of our supply chain is guaranteeing human rights in areas like child labor, forced labor and the right to organize. The Code chain is one of our of Conduct is always included in written contracts with suppliers and the Code is most important risk rooted in Peab’s core values that guide us in everything we do. Peab has signed the UN Global Compact and our Code of Conduct is based on its ten principles within management areas.” human rights, labor laws, the environment and anti-corruption. Peab has also been a forerunner and began following the agreement in The Confederation of Swedish Enterprise of 30 day payments to all our suppliers a long time ago. This is an important part of responsible purchasing for us. All the suppliers in Peab’s supplier register go through a daily systematic control against predefined parameters. These parameters touch financial status and the risk of irregularities but they also check that the supplier has met social obligations like paying taxes and general payroll tax, and follows approved labor law conditions, e.g. SC2015. During 2018 Peab has made it possible to see 67 percent of business area Construction’s purchases via a system support that includes the Code of Conduct. This monitoring work will continue in 2019 with an implementation plan for system support for all the other business areas. In addition, during 2019 Peab will begin the process of screening suppliers based on social and environmental criteria. CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF PURCHASING During 2018 Peab began segmentation aimed at steering purchasing within the Group more clearly towards certain selected suppliers. Development of our purchasing work is vital to ensuring cost-efficiency and a sustainable work method. Segmentation consists of three levels; Approved, Prioritized or Strategic Supplier and is based on a category strategy with the dimensions supply risk, size of the deal and sustainability. The purpose is to develop our collaboration with the suppliers that create the most value and to focus on supplier categories with a potential risk. In addition to this Peab’s entire supplier base is checked daily against defined parameters such as financial status, tax debts and collective bargaining agreements. The reviewed supplier base can be seen in the shared supplier register. PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 30 Economic During the year we have also reviewed our procedures for ensuring that all our suppliers meet the requirements in Peab’s Code of Conduct. We have drawn up a self-assessment form that underpins reviews on suppliers believed to pose the greatest risks. This follow-up work will continue in 2019. PERSISTENT WORK WITH ETHICS AND ANTI-CORRUPTION LEADS TO RESULTS Working together Peab has for many years explicitly expressed our zero tolerance to corruption. Peab is a partner in the Joint Initiative Against Bribes and Corruption (JIABC) which works for healthy to jointly counteract bribes and corruption in the publicly funded construction and real competition estate sector, and we are also represented on the board of the Community Builder Peab arranged a seminar in Sector’s Ethical Council. Peab’s work with ethical issues and against corruption is Almedalen to discuss cooperation long-range and systematic. We have strict consequences but we also work with and ensuring order in the construction industry. The participants were education and tools. For example, all employees responsible for business deals are Ylva Johansson, Minister for required to take a course through e-­education in ethics and anti-­corruption as well Employment, Catharina Elmsäter as competition law. We have continued to hold workshops in our operations and our Svärd, CEO of the Swedish schools where study groups work with ethical cases related to their daily work based Construction Federation, Lena on a broad range of ethical issues. In 2018 3,689 (3,380) employees were trained in Erixon, Director General of the Swedish Transport Administration, ethics and/or anti-corruption. This educational work will be expanded in 2019 to Hanna Björknäs, Lawyer for the include e-education in ethics for all employees, with the opportunity to partake in a Swedish Construction Trade Union follow-up workshop for the individual study groups. and Jesper Göransson, President and CEO of Peab. The seminar was one of several examples of how Peab’s Ethical Council ensures that incidents in the Group such as infringement of Peab, as a major community builder, laws and the Code of Conduct receive the same consequences, regardless of takes responsibility for a more context or position. transparent and sound industry where important issues like healthy INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL WHISTLE­BLOWING FUNCTION competition on equal terms must be handled in cooperation. Transparency and openness are the watchwords for Peab’s development of the business and work climate. Employees have an important role in reporting any law infringements or serious irregular ties. We prefer open reporting but this is complemented by an external web-­based whistle­blower system that guarantees the anonymity of the reporter. In 2018 the whistle­blower system became accessible to external reporters as well. EVENTS DURING THE YEAR During 2018 (0) 0 incidents of anti-competitive activities, breaches of the competition law or monopolistic behavior leading to legal action have been discovered. In 2018 Peab discovered 2 (1) cases of suspected corruption and 6 (9) internal incidents of suspected financial irregularities. The responsible manager handled the incidents with support from members of the Ethical Council. All of these incidents led to labor law measures. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE INDUSTRY THROUGH COOPERATION As a community builder it is a given for Peab to contribute to developing social conditions in a sound, safe and attractive construction and civil engineering industry through cooperation. In 2018 we engaged in the industry’s work on diversity, a more attractive and inclusive vocational training program and ensuring a healthy industry with healthy competition and explicit rules for all players. WORKING TOGETHER FOR A MORE SECURE ID06 Peab helped develop the ID06 standard and we linked our workplaces to the system early on. The new ID06 card is under development in the industry and is being implemented. This is a necessity if Peab is going to strengthen the tie between employer and employee and make the system more reliable and secure. The standard will give Peab better control over who is at our construction sites and ensure healthy competition and safe workplaces.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR INCOME IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, has as of 2018 replaced previous standards related to revenue recognition such as IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction contracts and IFRIC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate. No material effects have been identified. Up until the end of 2017 there were differences between operative and legal accounting in the business area Project Development. This difference was also reflected in the way executive management and the Board followed up the Group as a whole. The operative and segment accounting was based on the percentage of completion. Swedish tenant-owned housing projects will continue to be recognized as previously through revenue over time while our own home developments in Sweden will, as of the implementation of IFRS 15, change over to revenue over time. IFRS 15 will not lead to any changes in reporting regarding housing projects in Finland and Norway compared to the current application since revenue is first recognized when the home is handed over to the buyer. As of implementation of IFRS 15 segment reporting mirrors legal reporting. The differences between operative and legal reporting therefore Net sales no longer exist for either business area Project Development or the Group as a whole. MSEK For business area Project Development this has entailed recalculating comparable 60,000 figures in Housing Development. Peab has chosen to apply IFRS 15 retroactively by 50,000 recalculating the financial reports for 2017. The recalculations have not had any material effect on either business area Project Development or the Group as a whole. All 40,000 comparable figures for 2017 and 2016 in subsequent report are recalculated if not 30,000 otherwise noted.

After adjustments for acquired and divested units net sales increased by four percent. A continued favorable construction and civil engineering market has had a positive Net sales per customer type, 2018 effect on the business areas during 2018. Net sales in business area Construction increased by six percent spread over all the three countries. Net sales in business area Civil Engineering increased by 16 percent and activity increased in all product areas. Business area Industry presented an increase in net sales of four percent spread over 40% all product areas except Transportation and Machines where net sales shrunk compared to 2017. Net sales in business area Project Development were slightly 60% lower in both Housing Development and Property Development. The reduction in Housing Development is due to less activity in the housing market in Sweden, primarily in Stockholm. In the first quarter of 2017 net sales in Property Development were affected by SEK 577 million from sales of assets in Arenastaden and Ulriksdal in Private, 60% (62) Public, 40% (38) Solna to Fabege. Of the year’s net sales SEK 10,297 million (9,089) were attributable to sales and production outside Sweden. PROFIT/LOSS Operating profit for 2018 increased to SEK 2,573 million (2,418) and the operating margin improved to 4.9 percent (4.8). Development has stable in both contract businesses Construction and Civil Engineering during the year. The operating margin in business area Construction amounted to 2.4 percent compared to 2.3 percent the last year and in business area Civil Engineering the operating margin was 3.0 percent (3.2). Business area Industry showed an improved PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 33 Board of Directors’ Report operating margin of 7.4 percent (6.8) mainly due to increased volumes to the construction Operating profit and margin and civil engineering market. Business area Project Development had a lower operating profit but the operating margin improved to 10.0 percent (9.6). Operating profit in MSEK % Housing Development declined as a result of fewer production starts in Sweden, 3,000 6.0 primarily in Stockholm, and lower income recognition from projects in Norway and Finland.

Being spread all over the country creates a local organization that builds close customer relationships and effectively meets the demand for new production of homes in varying price classes. Our range of housing forms is broad; tenant-owned apartments, condominiums and apartments for rent as well as homeowner or tenant-owned single homes. The housing market changed during 2018. The year began with a decline in the market trend and ended with continued uncertainty about how the housing market will develop in the next few years. This led to fewer start-ups of new projects with the greatest decline in the Stockholm region. The market is not homogeneous and has been affected to various degrees, depending on the location, by a large supply of new homes, many of which are in the same price bracket. Banks’ higher requirements for loans and the latest government amortization requirements have also had a negative effect on the market. Peab strives to be a forerunner in sustainable urban development and build attractive and sustainable projects that meet economic, environmental and social goals. Peab considers social sustainability essential which includes creating vibrant and safe neighborhoods with meeting places. All our new, own developed apartment buildings are certified according to the ecolabel Swan with Bra Miljöval (Good Environmental Choice) labelled electricity. The development rights portfolio for Swedish operations is spread over the country. Several major housing projects in Sweden are urban development projects where collaboration between a number of partners is an important success factor. In Lindholm’s historical shipyard in Gothenburg, Peab is working closely with businesses and the City of Gothenburg to develop an attractive urban environment with a clear environmental profile. Peab is developing and constructing around 200 homes in two tenantowned housing blocks lining the Göta River. Last autumn Peab completed our first Swan ecolabeled apartment building, Lindholmskajen with 67 apartments. During the year construction began in the Innovatum area in Trollhättan where Peab is developing the venerable industrial site into 69 top modern apartments in Turbinen ready for occupation in 2020. Peab continues to develop homes in the new city district Öster Mälarstrand in Västerås. In September we began construction of 70 new apartments in three different buildings, the highest of which is eight stories, in Sirenen. The Norwegian housing market contracted in 2018. Housing prices rose steadily during the first half of the year and then fell somewhat in the autumn which is normal. There are significant differences in housing prices from one geographic area to another. Prices rose during the year in Oslo and Tromsø while prices in, for example, Bergen and Trondheim fell.

The project consists of 111 apartments and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. In Tromsø the first stage of the Skir project with 180 homes is under construction and expected to be completed in the spring of 2021. A number of projects were completed in 2018, among them Himmel & Hav (Sea & Sky) in Tromsø with 87 homes and Prestegårdsgate and Flötningen B4 in Skien with 20 respectively 27 homes. The housing market has grown dramatically the past few years in Finland, a fact noticeable in the rising number of production start-ups at Peab. In 2018 we intensified investments in housing production in Helsinki. In the Jätkäsaari docklands housing project GoldenEye with 81 apartments is under construction and the first construction stage of housing project Goldfinger with 109 apartments was initiated in September. Both are expected to be completed in 2020. The first stage of Kruunuvuori Shoreline with 91 apartments was completed in 2018 and the second stage comprising 140 apartments is under construction.

Klemettilänpuisto IV, in the historical Milka dairy district Klemettilä in Vasa. Construction of the final apartment building began in 2018 and it will be completed in 2019. Net sales and operating profit Net sales decreased by three percent and amounted to SEK 7,106 million (7,330). Operating profit amounted to SEK 615 million (706) and the operating margin was 8.7 percent (9.6). The number of start-ups of our own developed homes during the year amounted to 2,213 units (3,048) with a good geographic spread in Sweden as well as in Norway and Finland. The number of sold homes during 2018 was 1,825 (2,734). The number of own developed homes in production at the end of the year was 6,231 (6,333). The level of sold homes in production was 63 percent compared to 72 percent at year-end 2017. The number of repurchased homes per 31 December 2018 was 104 (33) and was spread over the three countries. At the end of the year capital employed has increased in Housing Development due to higher investments in project and development property and greater activity in our own housing developments in Norway and Finland, which remain on the balance sheet until completion.

It is primarily geared to run development projects based on development rights on our own balance sheet. Collaboration with partners via joint ventures may occur at different times during a project. In 2018 the market for office buildings in Swedish big city regions was strong and so was the transaction market. The market for office rentals is expected to continue to develop positively and real estate prices are expected to have a stable development. During the year several major property projects were started up in Sweden. During the first quarter Peab decided to gather all our offices in the Oresund region to a new Peab Center in Hyllie, Malmö and invest around SEK 200 million. The new office building The first office building of five in the project The Gate, Peab’s new offices in Hyllie, is the first of a total five buildings in the project The Gate. The first stage comprises Malmö, will be completed in 2020. The area two buildings containing a total of 10,200 m2 in office space. In May Peab signed a has an excellent communications location rental agreement with the wellness chain Actic that will move its headquarters and being close to the city, countryside and open a gym in a new building in Ulriksdal, Solna. They will occupy around 2,600 m2, public transportation. of which 1,150 m2 will be offices and the gym will take up the rest on two floors. Peab is investing around SEK 280 million in the eleven story building. The top three floors are the offices and gym and the other eight floors are a multistory car park with 475 parking spaces. The building is expected to be ready the summer of 2020. Growth in the Finnish economy contributed to an active real estate market during the year. The office market in Finland is expected to be positive in 2019 as well. During the year no new projects were started in Finland but renting out and planning for the third stage of Ultimes Business Garden, in Sockenbacka Business Park in Helsinki is underway. The seven story office building has around 7,900 m2 rentable office space and 150 parking spaces. Occupation is planned for March 2019 and a total of six office buildings with around 50,000 m2 office space are planned for the area. There is still an optimistic perspective on the office market in Norway, primarily as a result of rising rent levels in central Oslo. The positive market development creates opportunities for Peab’s operations in Oslo and Tromsø. Several large projects were started up in Norway in 2018, among them Peab’s own developed project, Carl Berner Torg in Oslo. The project consists of 3,500 m2 commercial space, all of it PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 48 Board of Directors’ Report rented out to Coop. The project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2020. The first stage of the Skir project in Tromsø with 1,500 m2 commercial space was launched in December. The project is expected to be ready in the spring of 2021. Nadderuveien 1 in Bekkestua outside Oslo, a joint venture where Peab has a 50 percent participation, started up at the end of the year. The project consists of 67 homes and about 3,500 m2 commercial space, all of it rented out to Norgesgruppen. The entire project is expected to be completed in 2021. Net sales and operating profit During 2018 net sales were SEK 738 million (1,013) and operating profit was SEK 170 million (98). The increase in operating profit is primarily due to improved profit from wholly owned and partially owned companies. Profit from partly owned companies was SEK 101 million (72) during the year. In the first quarter last year assets In Ulriksdal in Solna Peab is constructing an in Arenastaden were divested to Fabege, which affected net sales by SEK 577 million entirely new city district.

In 2018 Peab divested Ångkraftverket 2 in Västerås which is rented by Steam Hotel and Kokpunkten Actionbad. Centur, owned equally by Peab and Balder, purchased the property.

MSEK Calculation basis Change Pre-tax profit effect Operative Volume (operating margin constant) 52,000 +/10% +/255 Operating margin (volume constant) 4.9% +/1 percentage +/520 Production costs 36,000 +/1% +/360 Financial Net debt (interest rate constant) 3,551 +/10% +/5 Average effective interest rate (net debt constant) 1) 1.4% +/1 percentage +/22 1)  he calculation is based on the assumption that the interest-bearing liabilities have SEK 4,660 million in a fixed interest term shorter than 1 year and T which is therefore relatively immediately affected by a change in market rates.

All in PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 55 Board of Directors’ Report all building construction investments are expected to contract in 2019 and then level out in 2020. Civil engineering investments look like they might increase during the coming years and the new government will most likely strive to achieve the ambitions laid out in the latest infrastructure proposition. Housing construction investments in Norway declined in 2018 and are expected to level out in 2019 before they turn up again in 2020. Other building construction is expected to have the opposite development, partly as a reaction to the increase in 2018 and partly because of interest hikes and a global recession. Civil engineering investments, however, are expected to grow at a good rate in 2019. In Finland housing investments increased in 2018 and are expected to grow in 2019 as well, which is largely due to higher income in households and a pent up need for investments. Investments are then expected to level off in 2020. Weaker growth in the economy is reflected in the forecasts for other building construction which is basically showing no growth in the period 2018–2020. The forecasts for civil engineering investments signal weak growth for the period 2019 on the whole. PARENT COMPANY The parent company’s business consists of executive management and Group functions.

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 32–119 in this document. In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2018 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2018 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. The Board of Directors´ report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. We therefore recommend that the AGM adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. Our opinions in this report on the the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the Group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the period in question. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Revenue recognition for construction projects See notes 3 and 27 and accounting principles in note 1 in the annual account and consolidated accounts for detailed information and a description of the matter.

We have also evaluated reports from the Group’s own and externally engaged legal experts concerning disputes and PEAB ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 assessed whether and how these were taken into consideration in project forecasts. 121 Auditor’s report Valuation of project and development propertiesr See notes 3 and 24 and accounting principles in note 1 in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts for detailed information and a description of the matter.
