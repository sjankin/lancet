Our game-changing solutions are dedicated to optimizing the construction and management of our clients’ well stock, from well completion design and construction to the intervention services required to ensure performance and integrity. We address the factors that maximize value creation, continuously innovating to reduce well construction time, speed up access to the hydrocarbons and reduce the capital expenditure compared to more conventional methods. This results in maximized hydrocarbon production and increased total recovery while minimizing operating downtime. It’s Welltec’s philosophy to challenge existing conventions and think laterally in order to develop products and services which increase oil and gas recovery while improving the sustainable, economic, environmental and safety aspects of our industry. In practice we develop, test and manufacture state-of-the-art technology to enhance the production and recovery rates for our clients, thereby improving their profitability through a longer term revenue stream, while at the same time improving upon health, safety and environmental attributes. In an industry challenged by low oil prices, our Flex-Well® design provides new perspective to drilling and completing wells, adopting a holistic approach which adds value continuously over the life-cycle of the well. From reducing geological uncertainty, accelerating first production, minimizing CAPEX, reducing costs and simplifying P&A our approach can boost cash flow now and over the life of the well. Our value proposition is compelling; our technology enables clients to unlock more production from their assets and to address reservoir complexities and uncertainties with a greater number of options, which are cleaner, safer and more sustainable.

As we enter into 2019 the global supply of oil continues to outpace demand which combined with complex geopolitical topics continue to fuel volatility and uncertainty across markets. As a result of the volatile market back drop and the challenging industry environment, Welltec is currently not able to offer qualified guidance for the full year 2019. However, Welltec will continue to evaluate forward looking reference points and commence on outlook guidance again once visibility has improved. 9 ANOTHER CHALLENGING YEAR FOR THE INDUSTRY IS IN THE OUTLOOK ...

The determination of local tax liability is 11 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2018 / MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY always subject to review or examination by authorities in operating jurisdictions. If a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews filed tax returns and based on filing proposes an adjustment, including adjustments of transfer prices and terms applied, such an adjustment could have a negative impact on Welltec’s net profit. Liquidity Risk Welltec’s ability to make payments, refinance indebtedness, fund planned capital expenditures and other strategic investments will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This is, to a certain extent subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Welltec expects to continue making capital investments in order to develop and purchase additional equipment to expand our services, increase our capacity and replace existing equipment. Such capital investments require cash that could otherwise be applied to other business needs. However, if Welltec does not incur these expenditures our competitive strength may decline and our business may be adversely affected. Legal Risks Regulatory Welltec conducts business in multiple jurisdictions in a highly regulated industry. As such, Welltec is, directly or indirectly, subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines, in all such jurisdictions, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations including business ethics and trade compliance, taxation, the protection of the environment and the manufacture, management, transportation and disposal of certain materials used in operations. Accordingly, Welltec could become subject to liabilities relating to the violation of such regulations in multiple jurisdictions, with an adverse effect on profits. Technology Welltec is a technology company, constantly challenging the operational boundaries in the industry. However, third parties may assert that our products, services, solutions and other intellectual property may infringe, on their proprietary rights. Any such potential future claims, regardless of merit, could result in multi-jurisdictional litigation, which could result in substantial expenses, causes significant delays and materially disrupt the conduct of business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS 3.1 Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers The Group derives revenue from rendering of services and sales of goods in the following geographical regions: Europe, Africa & Russia Americas Middle East & Asia Pacific Total 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 USD in thousands Rendering of services 127,360 88,044 56,905 44,952 40,263 27,747 224,528 160,743 Sale of goods 6,528 4,106 4,451 1,425 1,634 3,228 12,613 8,759 Total 133,888 92,150 61,356 46,377 41,897 30,975 237,141 169,502 3.2 Assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers 2018 2017 Current contract assets relating to contracts with customers: Trade receivables 49,771 49,353 Loss allowance (1,961) (367) Other receivables 93 163 Total contract assets 47,903 49,149 Current contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers: Deferred revenue 85 Total contract liabilities 85 Significant changes in contract assets and liabilities Revenue grew by 40% compared to 2017. The growth in revenue has not generated an increase in trade receivables at year end 2018. The reason for this is the Management’s increased focus on collecting receivables during 2018. For more information about trade receivables and loss allowance see note 15 Trade receivables. 3.3 Revenue recognized in relation to contract liabilities The following table shows how much of the revenue recognised in the current reporting period relates to carried -forward contract liabilities. 2018 2017 Revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period: Deferred income 85 46 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2018 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.4 Unsatisfied long-term contracts 2018 2017* Aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to long-term contracts 703 that are partially or fully unsatisfied at 31 December 2018 *As permitted under the transitional provisions in IFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to (partially) unsatisfied performance obligations as of 31 December 2017 is not disclosed. In the amounts for unsatisfied long-term contracts only considerations for the notice periods in the customer contracts are included according to IFRS 15. Management expects that all of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied contracts as of 31 December 2018 will be recognized as revenue during the first quarter of 2019. The amount disclosed above does not include variable considerations, which is constrained. The Group has applied the practical expedient in IFRS 15:121, whereas contracts with a duration below 12 months is not included. 3.5 Performance obligations Rendering of services The Group’s major part of the revenue derives from rendering of services (95% of total revenue). Sales are recognized over time, when the services have been performed and certain milestones (output-method) has been reached. Final revenue recognition takes place when there is no unfullfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the service. Revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A trade receivable will be recognized when the last miletone of the service contract has been fulfilled. Payments are typically due within 30 days from receipt of invoice and volume discounts is found in a few contracts. There is no financing component included in payment terms. Sale of goods The Group’s minor part of the revenue derives from sale of goods (6% of total revenue). Sales are recognized at a point in time, when the control of the goods has transferred, being the goods delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer’s acceptance of the goods. The delivery takes place when the goods has been shipped to the specific location and the Group has the objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance has been satisfied. Revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A trade receivable will be recognized when the control of the goods has transferred. Payments are typically due within 30 days from receipt of invoice. There is no financing component included in payment terms. 3.6 Significant judgments The transaction price is determined by the price specified in the contract and estimated discounts are included in the transaction prices. Incremental costs of obtaining a contract is recognized as an expense, when incurred, if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized, is one year or less. 47 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2018 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4.

Effect of exchange rate adjustment in USD and DKK on Danish corporation tax is caused by the exchange rate adjustments between USD and DKK in the USD account.

No income tax has been recognized in other comprehensive income in 2018.In 2018 USD 0 thousand (2017 USD 0 thousand, 2016 USD 1,699 thousand) was recognized directly in equity related to tax credit arising upon exercise of warrants. Denmark – credit for taxes paid abroad The Danish tax authorities have in 2014 issued tax assessment notices for the financial years 2009 to 2011 following the assessment made regarding the financial year 2008. The new assessments adjust the tax payable due to non-recognition of credit relief calculated on withholding taxes paid abroad. The additional tax payable has been paid and expensed. The decisions are appealed to the National Tax Tribunal. The tax credit calculations for the financial years 2013 to 2017 and the preliminary tax calculation for 2018 have been made up based on similar principles as applied by the Danish tax authorities for previous years.

The impairment test performed in 2018 revealed no need for impairment of goodwill. Impairment of other intangible assets Impairment of development projects amounted to USD 3.1 million Goodwill has been tested at the aggregated level and the goodwill (2017: USD 7.6 million), which has been recognized in the stateamount is allocated to the group’s cash-generating unit, Welltec ment of comprehensive income under cost of services provided as A/S Group. It is the opinion of Management that the carrying the projects are closed. The recoverable amount was calculated amount for goodwill does not exceed its recoverable value based on the basis of Management’s re-assessed estimate of the value in on an estimate of present value of expected future net cash flows use of the assets. from the Welltec A/S Group (value-in-use). The calculation of the value-in-use is based on the following key assumptions; expectations about future earnings, growth rates and discount rates. Expectations are based on financial budget for 2019 and longterm forecasts until the end of 2024. A growth rate of 2.4% has been applied in the terminal period from 2025 and onwards. The discount rate applied is based on a risk-adjusted after tax discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) of 11.1%. The weighted average cost of capital before tax is 12.6%. In 2017 the weighted average cost of capital used was 10.7% which equals a before tax discount rate of 11.8%. Impairment test is based on following assumptions and market views: Consensus suggests that the overall demand for Oil & Gas is expected to continue to increase as a result of a growing world economy. The global oversupply of oil gradually diminished during the course of 2018 amid production declines and reduced investments. The weakening supply fundamentals coupled with a resilient demand paved the way for higher oil prices and more importantly a more stable oil price environment by the end of 2018. Looking into 2019, market consensus suggest a continued stabilization albeit with risk of increased volatility should geopolitical unrest or the OPEC production coordination yet again fail. For Welltec, the market potential remains unchanged, as the global demand continues to increase.

The Group’s services are provided to a variety of contractual counter parties and are therefore subject to the risk of non-payment for services or non-reimbursement of costs. Receivables consist of a relatively small number of customers, but the customers are large corporations in the oil industry and have high credit ratings. The Group’s loss on trade receivables are historically immaterial. There is an ongoing centralized followup on out-standing trade receivables in accordance with the Group’s dunning procedures. The maximum credit risk related to financial assets corresponds to the carrying amount. The Group has 2 customers, which accounts for 10% or more of the total revenue in 2018 (2017: 3 customers). 16.2 Impairment of trade receivables The Group’s financial assets and trade receivables relating to revenue, are subject to the expected credit loss model. The IFRS 9 simplified approach is applied to measure the expected credit losses. The contract assets have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group has concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets. The expected loss rates per 31 December 2018 are based on the payment profiles over a period of 3 years before 31 December 2016, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group has assessed the economy and market conditions of the countries in which it sells its services and goods and accordingly adjusted the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors. The revenue has increased by 32% since 2017, which has had an impact on the increased loss allowance in 2018. On that basis, the loss allowance as at 31 December 2018 was determined as follows for both trade receivables and contract assets: 31 December 2018 Not past Less than 30 30 to 60 days More than 60 due days past due past due days past due Total USD in thousands Expected credit loss rate 1.0% 4.0% 9.2% 15.8% Trade receivable 31,705 8,647 3,210 6,209 49,771 Contract assets 93 93 Loss allowance 332 353 294 982 1,961 68 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2018 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 17.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 25.1 General capital structure The group is financed partly through equity and partly through long-term debt. Management assesses on a regular basis whether the group’s capital structure is in accordance with the group’s and shareholder’s interests. The overall objective is to ensure a capital structure that supports long-term growth and also maximizes returns to the shareholder of the group by optimizing the debt to equity ratio. The group’s overall objective remains the same. 25.2 Market risk Due to the group’s foreign activities and credit facilities in foreign currencies, its profit/loss, cash flows and equity are affected by changes in exchange rates and interest rates for a number of currencies. A significant part of this change in exchange rates has been eliminated by changing functional currency for the Danish companies to USD from 2012. 25.2.1 Foreign currency risk management The reporting currency of the group and the parent company is US dollars. The functional currency of the Danish companies is considered to be US dollars, and the rest of the group’s subsidiaries have the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary is domiciled. A proportion of the group’s revenues, expenses and other liabilities are denominated in currencies other than US dollars, in particular Danish kroner, Norwegian kroner and British pounds. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters. PARENT The carrying amounts of the company’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows stated in the material currencies affecting the group: Assets Liabilities (USD in thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 DKK 263,764 190,495 (246,389) (182,431) GBP 0 0 0 0 NOK 0 0 0 0 GROUP The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows stated in the material currencies affecting the group: Assets Liabilities (USD in thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 DKK 263,764 190,495 (246,389) (182,431) GBP 3,692 3,696 (3,212) (456) NOK 8,070 15,262 (5,614) (9,671) 82 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2018 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25.2.2 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following tables detail the parent and group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in DKK, INR, NOK and GBP against the relevant foreign currencies. The percentage used is the sensitivity rate and is representing Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity where the currency strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the currency against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative: PARENT Currency DKK impact Currency INR impact Currency NOK impact (USD in thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Profit/(Loss) 267 130 465 (925) 0 0 Equity 0 0 (1,317) (4,403) 0 (2) GROUP Currency DKK impact Currency GBP impact Currency NOK impact (USD in thousands) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Profit/(Loss) 267 130 37 28 260 240 Equity 0 0 (53) (327) 295 623 83 WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2017 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25.2.3 Interest rate risk management From the beginning of 2012 the group’s interest rate risk relates to the group’s interest bearing debt to bondholders. The interest is fixed at an effective rate of 8.5%. In November 2017 the interest bearing debt was refinanced with a new bond loan. The interest is fixed at an effecitive rate at 9,75% As the interest rate is fixed the group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments. Thus any changes in fair value are recognized directly in statement of comprehensive income as financial income or financial expenses. 25.2.4 Interest rate sensitivity analysis A 250 basis point increase or decrease represents Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 250 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s: Profit for the year and equity as of December 31, 2018 would be affected with USD 850 thousand (2017: 675 thousand). 25.3 Liquidity risk management It is the group’s policy that capital raising and distribution of cash are managed centrally by the group’s finance department to the extent it is deemed appropriate. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. The group is adjusting centrally the cash outflow in investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in Denmark. For general corporate and working capital purpose the Group holds a USD 40 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The RCF contains requrements for mandatory prepayments upon certain events, also the RCF contains financial covenant. Please see note 19.2.
