April 24, 2019 Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm that Robin Industries, Inc. continues to support the ten principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labor rights, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to continue to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We have been, and will continue to be, committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operation of our company. During the last year Robin Industries has continued to make investments to develop our personnel and to improve our manufacturing facilities in the U.S., China and Mexico. These investments have improved the quality of life and the quality of the work environment for our employees in all of our locations. We are, will continue to engage in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Robin Industries, Inc. has made, and will continue to make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our companyâ€™s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to continuing to report on our progress according to the Global Compact COP policy. Sincerely, Mr. Mark Fischer President & CEO
