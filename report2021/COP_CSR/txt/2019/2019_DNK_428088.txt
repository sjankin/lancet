BroBizz A/S has substantial experience with payment solutions across national borders. BroBizz® currently functions on toll roads, bridges and ferries in Denmark, the rest of Scandinavia and Austria. In addition, the BroBizz@ solution is used in certain parking areas and for access control. BroBizz A/S’ business concept is unique and widely used in the Danish market, but the company expects to encounter growing competition from foreign companies and new technologies. The company’s strategy is to be a competitive, digital mobility company based on business excellence and which, through strong partnerships, delivers exemplary services to customers in Scandinavia and during their journeys through Europe. In 2018, this resulted in an intensification of the company’s business development, including through digitalisation in order to continue to provide efficient payment solutions and good services to customers, making BroBizz@ attractive at even more points of use. The company thus launched both a new app at the end of 2017 and the option to pay by number plate with the product PayByPlate@, launched in March 2018. In November 2018, an agreement with APCOA enabled customers to pay for parking with their BroBizz@ and at the start of 2019, this will also be possible on the Øresund Bridge and on several ferry services. By the end of the year, 170,000 customers had signed up for PayByPlate@ while 200,000 customers had downloaded the BroBizz@ app. BroBizz A/S, in accordance with the strategy, delivered a slight increase in revenue in 2018. This was despite the toll charge reduction on the Storebælt fixed link on 1 January 2018 of 15 per cent. Ongoing streamlining of the business means that the profit for 2018 has increased.

Instead, customers pay via the internet, BroBizz® or similar device and the vehicle’s number plate. BroBizz Operatør A/S can also bid on other future toll systems in connection with the establishment of user-financed infrastructure in Denmark, including other payment collection solutions such as charging by vehicle equipment, camera recording of the vehicle's number plate, etc. No key figures for 2018 are included because the project was established on 5th October 2018 and the first phase of the project (the design phase) was submitted at the end of 2018.

In issuing the executive order on the delegation of certain tasks and powers for the construction and operation of a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark, the role of client was given to Banedanmark on 17 September 2015, while A/S Femern Landanlæg remained responsible for the ownership and financing of the landworks. Based on an updated financial analysis, the parties behind Fehmarnbelt link reached a political agreement on 4 March 2016 on the way forward for the project. The financial analysis included the total cost of the upgrading of the Danish landworks. This was DKK 9.5 billion (2015 prices). The overall timetable for the Danish landworks gave the green light for full expansion and upgrading of rail facilities down to Nykøbing Falster. Completion is due in 2021, apart from electrification, which is to be finished in 2024. In addition, the life of the section from Nykøbing Falster to Holeby on Lolland is to be extended until it needs to be developed and adapted for the opening of the coastto-coast link. Based on the decision, Banedanmark signed a number of contracts in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Most recently, in August 2018, the Austrian engineering contractor, Swietelsky, was awarded the contract for track works on Zealand and Falster for DKK 516 million. The tract work comprises approximately 60 km of new track, the establishment or replacement of 52 sets of points as well as the renewal of large parts of the existing track. Thus, all major contracts for completing the work between Ringsted and Nykøbing Falster have been agreed and in the case of the signalling programme, an option was agreed with Alstom for DKK 104 million in July 2018. On 12 December 2017, the CEF Committee voted in favour of the European Commission's proposal that the Danish railway landworks for the forthcoming Fehmarnbelt link should be allocated support from the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility programme. The subsidy amounts to approximately 20 per cent of the total construction costs for the period 2017-2023.

The rails are recycled whereas the sediment from wells is sent to landfill. These two extraordinary items amount to approximately 700 tonnes. Water consumption in 2018 decreased compared to the previous year. Water discharge, which derives from rain and drainage water, reduced slightly in 2018, probably because of the dry summer. Overall, electricity consumption in 2018 increased by 141,000 kWh to 10.6 million kWh. This slight change in consumption is probably due to increased operation and maintenance activities.

Sund & Bælt takes a proactive approach to traffic safety, i.e. by preventing accidents through analysis and screening all incidents. In 2018, there were five traffic accidents resulting in one fatality, two serious injuries and seven less serious injuries. In 2018, the Storebælt Bridge was closed to all traffic for almost three hours. The nationwide police action on 28 September caused a two-hour closure, and a lorry fire on 2 July meant that the Storebælt Bridge was closed for 46 minutes. In addition, there were 16 closures in one direction of a total duration of 14.5 hours, primarily because of traffic accidents on the link. Nature conservation on Sprogø Sund & Bælt policy is to maintain green areas by taking nature into account and pursuing an active management of natural areas, which includes Sprogø being preserved as a unique natural area.

International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for the annual reports of companies with listed debt instruments (Class D companies). Additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports are laid down in the IFRS order issued pursuant to the Danish Financial Statements Act and NASDAQ Copenhagen. The accounting policies are in accordance with those applied in the Annual Report 2017 with the exception of changes referred to in the section New accounting standards below. The accounting policies for operating income, other operating expenses, leasing, staff expenses, participating interests in subsidiaries, participating interest in jointly managed company, receivables, prepayments and accrued income, cash at bank and in hand and accruals and deferred income are described in the respective notes. The company has opted to use the so-called Fair Value Option under IFRS 9. Consequently, all loans and derivatives are measured at fair value and changes in the fair value are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Loans are measured at fair value on initial recognition in the balance sheet whereas derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair value, c.f. IFRS 9. The rationale for using the Fair Value Option is that the company consistently applies a portfolio approach to financial management, which implies that the intended exposure to financial risks is managed through different financial instruments, both primary and derivative financial instruments. Accordingly, in the management of the financial market risk, the company does not distinguish between, for example, loans and derivatives, but solely focuses on overall exposure. Using financial instruments to manage financial risks could, therefore, result in accounting inconsistencies were the Fair Value Option not used. Hence this is the reason for exercising it. It is the company’s opinion that the Fair Value Option is the only principle under IFRS that reflects this approach as the other principles lead to inappropriate accounting inconsistencies between otherwise identical exposures depending on whether the exposure relates to loans or derivative financial instruments or necessitates extensive requirements for documentation of hedging as is the case with the rules on hedge accounting. As both loans and derivatives are measured at fair value, recognition in the financial statements will produce the same results for loans and related derivatives when hedging is effective. Thus, the company will achieve accounting consistency. Loans without associated derivative financial instruments are also measured at fair value in contrast to the main rule laid down in IFRS 9 pursuant to which loans are measured at amortised cost. This naturally leads to volatility in the profit/loss for the year as a result of value adjustments. The consolidated accounts and the parent company accounts are presented in DKK, which is also the Group’s functional currency. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are disclosed in DKK million. New accounting standards With effect from 1 January 2018, the Group implemented the following new standards and interpretations: IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRIC 22. The implementation of IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” changes among other things the classification and measurement of financial assets. Currently, the Group does not use hedge accounting, which is why the introduction of the new rules on hedge accounting are not expected to have any effect. Only to a limited extent does the Group have financial assets in the form of debt instruments. It is assessed, therefore, that the new rules on provision for future credit losses will not have a significant effect. Under IFRS 9, a company can continue to measure financial liabilities at fair value (Fair value option). Under IFRS 9, the impact of changes attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income instead of, as before, in the income statement. As a result of the guarantee from the Danish State, the companies have maintained the highest achievable credit rating, and thus there is no effect from the changes in own credit risk on the calculation of the fair value of the companies' debt items. IFRS 9 also changes the provision for future credit losses for not yet due receivables However, this has not had a significant effect. Previously, under IAS 39, the Group recognised treasury shares at fair value, which is not possible under IFRS 9 because the shares are primarily held for collateral. From 1 January 2018, treasury shares are recognised at amortised cost price in accordance with IFRS 9. The effect has been insignificant. The implementation of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers” means that, in the 2018 financial year, there is a transitional effect. The transition effect entails the recognition of previously unrecognised contractual debt relating to obligations to BroPas customers of Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S. See Statement of changes in equity for details of the transition effect and Note 15 Participating interest in jointly managed company. IASB has issued the following new or updated standards and interpretations which have not yet become effective and are not valid in connection with the preparation of the 2018 Annual Report: IFRS 16 and IFRS 9 (a minor change on classification). These standards and interpretations will be implemented when they come into force. 42 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The implementation of IFRS 16 “Leasing” in the 2019 financial year is expected to have an effect on the balance sheet. Reference is made to Note 5 Other operating expenses where the expected effect of the standard is described. Other new or updated accounting standards, which have not yet become effective, are not expected to significantly impact the Group’s financial reporting. Consolidation The consolidated accounts cover the parent company Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the 100 per cent owned subsidiaries A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund, Sund & Bælt Partner A/S, Femern A/S, BroBizz A/S, BroBizz Operatør A/S and A/S Femern Landanlæg. Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is recognised in the consolidated accounts according to the equity method whereafter the Group’s share of the annual results and equity, corresponding to 50 per cent, are recognised in the consolidated accounts. Any negative equity is recognised as a provision since Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is structured as a partnership with joint and several liability. The consolidated accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounts for Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the subsidiaries by the addition of items of a uniform nature. The accounts on which the consolidation is based are submitted in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. On consolidation, elimination is made of internal income and expenses and internal balances. The parent company’s participating interests in the subsidiaries are offset against the corresponding equity. Newly established companies are included in the consolidated accounts from the time of establishment. Foreign currency translation On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates at the transaction date. Foreign exchange differences arising between the exchange rates at the transaction date and the rates at the date of payment are recognised in the comprehensive income statement as financial income and financial expenses. Receivables, payables and other monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. The difference between the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the rates on the date at which the receivable or payable arose, or the rates recognised on the previous balance sheet date are recognised in the comprehensive income statement as financial income and financial expenses. Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, which have not been revalued at fair value, are translated at the time of transaction to the rate of exchange on the transaction date. Translation of financial assets and liabilities are recognised in value adjustments and translation of receivables, payables etc. are assigned to financial income and expenses. Segment information According to IFRS, revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities per segment must be disclosed. Sund & Bælt's assessment is that the Group consists of one segment. Internal reporting and senior management's financial control take place on the basis of one overall segment. Public subsidies Public subsidies are recognised when it is reasonably probable that the subsidy conditions have been fulfilled and that the subsidy will be received. Subsidies to cover expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement proportionally over the periods in which the associated expenses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. The subsidies are offset in the costs incurred. Public subsidies related to the settlement of the road and rail facilities are deducted from the asset’s cost. Financial income and expenses Financial income and expenses comprise interest income and expenses, realised inflation indexation, foreign exchange gains and losses on cash at bank and in hand, securities, payables, derivatives and transactions in foreign currencies as well as realised gains and losses relating to derivative financial instruments. The difference in fair value at the balance sheet dates amounts to the total financial income and expenses, which, in the comprehensive income statement, are split into financial income, financial expenses and value adjustment. Financial income and expenses comprise interest income, interest expenses and realised inflation indexation from payables and derivatives. The value adjustment includes exchange gains and losses as well as foreign exchange translation for financial assets and liabilities. Financial expenses for financing assets in progress are recognised in the cost of the assets. Tax on the year’s result The company is subject to the Danish rules on mandatory joint taxation of the Sund & Bælt Group companies. The subsidiaries are jointly taxed from the date they are included in the consolidated accounts and until such time when they may be omitted from the consolidation. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the administrating company for joint taxation and therefore settles all tax payments with the tax authorities. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 43 Balances below the interest deduction limitation rules of the Danish Corporation Tax Act are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to such balances are recognised in the balance sheet while deferred tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for doing so are met. Current Danish corporation tax is distributed by settlement of joint taxation contributions among the jointly taxed companies in proportion to their taxable earnings. Moreover, the companies with tax losses receive a joint taxation contribution from companies that are able to use these losses to reduce their own tax profits. Tax for the year, which comprises the year’s current corporation tax, the year's joint taxation contribution and changes in deferred tax – including the change in the tax rate is recognised in the comprehensive income statement with the proportion attributable to the year’s results and directly in the equity with the proportion attributable to the entries made directly in the equity. Financial assets and liabilities Initial recognition of financial assets and liabilities takes place on the trading date. Securities comprising bank deposits and treasury shares are recognised at amortised cost on initial recognition, as well as on subsequent measurement, in the balance sheet. Holdings and returns on treasury shares are set off against equivalent bond loans issued and are therefore not recognised in the consolidated accounts’ comprehensive income statement and balance sheet. Loans are initially and subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet. On recognition, all loans are classified as financial liabilities at fair value via the comprehensive income statement. Irrespective of the scope of interest rate hedging, all loans are measured at fair value with value adjustments being recognised continually in the income statement, stated as the difference in fair value between the balance sheet dates. The fair value of treasury share issues of bilateral loans is determined as the market value by discounting future known and expected cash flows with the relevant discounting rates, as there are no quotations available for unlisted treasury share issuers and bilateral loans. The discounting rates used are based on current market rates deemed to apply to the Group as a borrower. Real rate loans consist of a real rate plus an allowance for inflation indexation. The expected inflation is recognised in the determination of the fair value on the real rate loans and is determined from the equilibrium inflation from the so-called break-even inflation swaps where a fixed inflation rate payment is exchanged against realised inflation, which is unknown at that time. Danish equilibrium inflation is calculated by a spread to Europe's break-even inflation swaps with HICPxT as reference index. Discounting follows from the general principles referred to above. The fair value of loans with related structured financial instruments is determined collectively and the market value of any options for payment of interest or instalments on the loans are measured using generally accepted standard valuation methods (locked formulas) with the volatility of reference rates and foreign currencies being included. Loans that contractually fall due after more than one year are recognised as non-current liabilities. Derivative financial instruments are recognised and measured in the balance sheet at fair value and initial recognition in the balance sheet is stated at fair value. Positive and negative fair values are included in Financial Assets and Liabilities respectively, and positive and negative values on derivatives are only set off when the Group has the right and intention to settle several financial instruments collectively. Derivative financial instruments are actively used to manage the debt portfolio and are therefore included in the balance sheet as current assets and current liabilities respectively. Derivative financial instruments include instruments where the value depends on the underlying value of the financial parameters, primarily reference rates and currencies. All derivative financial instruments are recognised with financial counterparties and are OTC derivatives. There are no listed quotations for such transactions. Derivative financial instruments typically comprise interest rate swaps and currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, currency options, FRAs and interest rate guarantees and swaptions. The market value is determined by discounting known and expected future cash flows using relevant discounting rates. The discounting rate is determined in the same way as loans and cash at bank and in hand, i.e. based on current market interest rates that are expected to be available to the Group as borrower. As with real rate loans, Inflation swaps contain an allowance for inflation indexation. The expected inflation is recognised in the determination of the fair value on the inflation swaps and is determined from the equilibrium inflation from the so-called break-even inflation swaps, where a fixed inflation rate payment is exchanged against realised inflation, which is unknown at that time. Danish equilibrium inflation is calculated by a spread to Europe’s break even inflation swaps with HICPxT as reference index. Discounting follows from the general principles referred to above. The fair value of derivatives with optionality in the payment flows, such as currency options, interest rate guarantees and swaptions, is determined by recognised and standardised valuation methods (closed formulas) wherein the volatility of the underlying reference rates and foreign currencies is included. Derivatives comprising a combination of several underlying financial instruments are recognised together with the sum of the fair value of the individual financial instruments. According to IFRS 13, financial assets and liabilities, which are recognised at fair value, should be classified in a 3-layer hierarchy for valuation methodology. Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy includes assets and liabilities recognised at quoted prices in active markets. At level 2 assets and 44 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S liabilities are valued using active quoted market data as input to generally accepted valuation methods and formulas. Finally, level 3 includes assets and liabilities in the balance sheet that are not based on observable market data, and therefore require separate comment. Intangible assets On initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation and writedowns performed. Intangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life, not exceeding more than 5 years. Property, plant and equipment On initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price and any expenses directly attributable to the acquisition until the date when the asset is available for use. Subsequently, the assets are measured at cost less depreciation and writedowns performed. During the construction period, the value of the road and rail links was stated using the following principles:  Expenses relating to the links are based on concluded contracts, and contracts are capitalised directly  Other direct expenses are capitalised as the value of own work  Net financing expenses are capitalised as construction loan interest  EU subsidies received are set off against the cost price Significant future one-off replacements/maintenance work are regarded as separate elements and depreciated over the expected useful life. Ongoing maintenance work is recognised in the comprehensive income statement as the costs are incurred. Depreciation on the road and rail links commences when the construction work is finalised and the facilities are ready for use. The facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives. For the road and rail links across Storebælt and Øresund, the facilities are divided into components with similar useful lives:  The main part of the links comprises structures designed with minimum expected useful lives of 100 years. The depreciation period for these parts is 100 years  Mechanical installations, crash barriers and road surfaces are depreciated over useful lives of 20-50 years  Software and electrical installations are depreciated over useful lives of 10-20 years  Technical rail installations are depreciated over 25 years Other assets are recognised at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the assets’ expected useful life: Administrative IT systems and programmes (software) 3-5 years Leasehold improvements, the lease period, but max. 5 years Acquired rights 7 years Other plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 5-10 years Port facilities and buildings at the ports 25 years Buildings for operational use 25 years Wind turbine facilities 25 years Amortisation and depreciation are recognised as a separate item in the income statement The depreciation method and the expected useful lives are reassessed annually and are changed if there has been a major change in the conditions or expectations. If there is a change to the depreciation method, the effect is recognised moving forward as a change in accounting estimates and judgements. The basis of depreciation is stated on the basis of residual value less any writedowns. The residual value is determined at the time of acquisition and is reassessed annually. If the residual value exceeds the book value, depreciation will be discontinued. Profits and losses in respect of disposal of property, plant and equipment are stated as the difference between the sales price less sales costs and book value at the time of sale. Profits and losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement under other operating income or other operating expenses. Writedown of assets Property, plant and equipment, intangible fixed assets and financial fixed assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that the accounting value may not be recovered (other assets are covered under IFRS 9). Impairment losses are recognised at the amount by which the asset’s book value exceeds the recoverable amount, i.e. the asset's net sales price or its value in use, whichever is higher. Value in use is calculated at the present value of expected future cash flows using a pre-tax discount factor that reflects the market’s current required rate of return. In determining impairment losses, assets are grouped in the smallest group of assets that generate separate identifiable cash flows (cashgenerating units). See also note 24: Profitability. Impairment losses are recognised in the comprehensive income statement. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 45 Inventories Inventories are measured at cost determined by the FIFO method or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost of merchandise, raw materials and consumables includes cost plus delivery costs. Securities Listed securities are recognised under current assets from the trading day and are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. Equity Dividend proposed by the management for the financial year is shown as a separate item under Equity. Current tax and deferred tax Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the jointly taxed companies are liable for tax on earnings, etc. for the jointly taxed companies and for any obligations to include tax at source on interest, royalties and dividends for the jointly taxed companies. Current tax liabilities and tax receivable are recognised in the balance sheet as calculated tax on the year's taxable income, adjusted for tax on taxable income for previous years and for tax paid on account. Joint tax contributions payable and receivable are recognised in the balance sheet under inter-company accounts. Deferred tax is measured in accordance with the balance-sheet oriented liability method for all temporary differences between book value and the value for tax of assets and liabilities. When the statement definition of value for tax can be performed according to different taxation rules, deferred tax is measured on the basis of the management's planned utilisation of the assets or settlement of the liability. Deferred tax assets, including the value for tax of tax losses entitled to be carried forward are recognised under other non-current assets at the value at which they are expected to be used, either through the elimination of tax on future earnings or by set-off against tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity and jurisdiction. Balances below the interest deduction limitation rules of the Danish Corporation Tax Act are distributed among the jointly taxed companies in accordance with the joint taxation agreement. Deferred tax liabilities relating to such balances are recognised in the balance sheet while tax assets are recognised only if the criteria for deferred tax assets are met. Adjustment of deferred tax is carried out as regards eliminations of non-realised intra-group profits and losses. Pension obligations The Group has established defined contribution schemes and similar agreements for its employees. Defined contribution schemes are recognised in the comprehensive income statement in the period to which they relate, and any contributions outstanding are recognised in the balance sheet as Trade and other payables. Any prepayments are recognised in the balance sheet under Receivables. Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost which usually corresponds to the nominal value. Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement has been prepared in accordance with the indirect method based on the comprehensive income statement items. The Group’s cash flow statement shows the cash flow for the year, the year's changes in cash and cash equivalents as well as the Group’s cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the year. Cash flow from operating activities is calculated as the profit/loss for the year before financial income and expenses adjusted for non-cash income statement items, calculated corporation tax and changes in working capital. The working capital comprises the operations-related balance sheet items recognised in current assets and current liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities comprises the acquisition and disposal of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and financial assets. Cash flow from financing activities comprises borrowing, dividend to the shareholder, repayment of debt and financial income and expenses. Cash at bank and in hand comprises cash and short-term marketable securities with a term of three months or less at the acquisition date less short-term bank loans. Unused credit lines are not included in the cash flow statement. Financial ratios The following financial ratios presented under financial highlights are calculated as follows: Profit ratio: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of turnover. Rate of return: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of total assets Return on facilities: Operating profit (EBIT) in percentage of investment in road and rail links 46 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Note 2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements Determining the carrying amount of certain assets and liabilities requires an estimate on how future events will affect the value of such assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Estimates which are significant for the preparation of the financial statements are, for instance, made by computing depreciation of, and impairment losses on, road and rail links and by computing the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities. Depreciation of the road and rail links is based on an assessment of their main components and their useful lives. An ongoing estimate of the assets’ useful life is undertaken. Any change in these assessments will significantly affect the profit/loss for the year, but will not affect cash flows. For certain financial assets and liabilities, an estimate is made of the expected future rate of inflation when calculating the fair value. The calculation of fair value on financial instruments is based on estimates of the relevant discounting rate for the Group, volatility of reference rates and currency for financial instruments with an option for cash flows and estimates of future inflation for real rate loans and swaps. Estimates for determining fair values and the need for impairment are, as far as possible, based on observable market data and continuously adjusted to actual price indications, see note 1 Accounting policies. With regard to the calculation of deferred tax, an estimate is made of the future utilisation of tax losses carried forward and reduced net financing expenses, which are based on the projected future earnings of the Group and the projected lifetime of the assets. As far as possible, the estimates are based on observable market continuously adjusted in line with inflation indexation and current price indications. See note 13 Deferred tax. A/S Øresund and Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S’ facilities are deemed to be cash generating units in that the companies’ road and rail links function as one overall unit. A/S Storebælt’s facilities are deemed to be a cash generating unit in that the company’s road and rail link functions as one overall unit. Note 3 Segment information The segment information below is the information that is mandatory even if there is only one segment, c.f. Note 1 Accounting Policies. Revenue from the road link comprises fees per vehicle for crossing the link. Revenue from the rail link comprises payment from Banedanmark. This operating income thus includes net sales to one customer amounting to more than 10 per cent of the company's total net turnover. The company’s entire turnover is generated in Denmark and there are no transactions between operating incomes. Besides the payments from Banedanmark in the operating income Railway , the company is not dependent on individual major customers and has no transactions with individual customers that amount to 10 per cent of the company's net turnover or more. Other income comprises revenue from the use of fibre optic and telephone cables on the bridge. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 47 Note 4 Operating income Income from the sale of services is recognised as the services are provided, and if the income can be measured reliably and is expected to be received. Income is measured excl. VAT, taxes and discounts in connection with the sale. Operating income includes income from the road and rail facilities, charges for the use of port facilities and the sale of electricity produced by wind turbines. Income from the road link comprises payment per vehicle crossing the Storebælt link. Payment is charged in cash via debit/credit card with subsequent invoicing or as prepayment. Prepaid journeys are recognised as they are consumed. Income from the rail link includes fees from Banedanmark for the use of the rail links. The charges on the Storebælt link and the rail fees have been set by the Minister of Transport, Building and Housing. Income from wind turbines comprises the sale of electricity. The wind turbines were sold in the spring of 2018. The proceeds from the sale amount to DKK 65.7 million and are recognised in other income. In addition, other income also comprises the sale of development rights for DKK 7.5 million in 2018. Other income comprises items secondary to the Group’s activities, including income from the use of fibre optic and telephone cables.

Deferred tax is offset as the underlying assets and liabilities are realised, including that the companies in the joint taxation under Sund & Bælt Holding A/S achieve positive taxable income. The Group was responsible for the construction of the fixed links across Storebælt and Øresund and during the construction phase, the companies realised tax losses in that the income base could only be realised when the links were ready for use. The utilisation of the companies’ losses carried forward extends over a period longer than five years, but since the main components of the companies’ property, plant and equipment have an estimated service life of 100 years, it is deemed prudent to recognise the tax value of the losses carried forward and the reduced net financing expenses without impairment.

Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 55 Note 15 Participating interest in jointly managed company The participating interest in the jointly managed company is measured in the balance sheet according to the equity method, after which the proportionate share of the company's calculated carrying amount is recognised. Any losses on the participating interest are recognised under provisions in the balance sheet. Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is jointly managed by A/S Øresund and SVEDAB AB. It is a shared ownership both legally and in terms of voting rights. Furthermore, the two owners are jointly and severally liable for the jointly managed company's liabilities, and the owners cannot transfer rights or liabilities between each other without the prior consent of the other party. Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is based in Copenhagen/Malmö and the Sund & Bælt Group's ownership interest is 50 per cent.

(2017: DKK 1,468 million). The Group’s share of Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S profit of DKK 691 million (2017: DKK 734 million) is recognised in the comprehensive income statement as Share of profit in jointly managed company. The value of the participating interest in Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S is affected by a transitional effect as a result of the implementation of IFRS 15 in 2018. The transitional effect entails the recognition of a previously unrecognised contractual debt relating to obligations to BroPass customers. An annual fee is paid for BroPas whereby customers receive a reduced price for 12 months. Income from the annual fees are recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 during the period in which the customers are entitled to the reduced price. Payment of the annual fee is made in advance and this advance payment is allocated as a contractual debt in the balance sheet for the remainder of the customer's contract period. The recognition of the contractual debt in 2018 reduced the equity in Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S by DKK 44 million of which Sund & Bælt’s share amounts to DKK 22 million before tax. 56 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Note 16 Financial income and expenses The Group recognises fair value adjustments of financial assets and liabilities through the comprehensive income statement. The difference in the fair value between the balance sheet dates constitutes the total financial income and expenses allocated between value adjustments and net financing expenses where the latter comprises interest income and expenses. Net financing expenses comprise accrued nominal/real coupons rates, realised inflation indexation and amortisation of premiums/discounts while premiums and expected inflation indexation are included in the value adjustments. Value adjustments comprise realised and unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Net financing expenses for the Group were DKK 177.6 million lower in 2018 compared to 2017. This is primarily due to the repurchase of an inflation swap with a relatively high real rate relative to the market rate and refinancing to lower real rate exposure, as well as reduced inflation exposure in addition to a lower inflation trend in 2018. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 57 Note 17 Receivables Trade receivables are measured at amortised cost. Trade receivables comprise amounts owed by customers, balances with payment card companies and receivables relating to the rail fee (DKK 53 million). As at 31 December 2018, payment card companies represented approximately 9 per cent of the total trade receivables. Write-downs are made to offset losses where it is deemed that an individual receivable or a portfolio of receivables is impaired. Impairment losses are determined based on historical loss experience and future expected losses. As at 31 December 2018, of the total trade receivables of DKK 356 million provision for unsecured receivables was recognised at DKK 2.3 million, which thus constitutes the calculated risk from customer losses. The book value of receivables thus represents the expected realisable value. There are no significant receivables due that are not impaired. Receivables also comprise accrued interest in respect of assets, receivables in respect of affiliated companies and other receivables. Other receivables are measured at the current value of the amounts expected to be received.

23 Financial risk management Financing The companies’ financial management is conducted within the framework determined by the companies’ Boards of Directors and guidelines from the guarantor, the Danish Ministry of Finance/Danmarks Nationalbank. The Board of Directors determines an overall financial policy and an annual financing strategy, which regulates borrowing and liquidity reserves for specific years and sets the framework for the companies’ credit, foreign exchange, inflation and interest rate exposure. Financial risk management is also supported by operational procedures. The overall objective is to achieve the lowest possible financing expenses for the infrastructure facilities over their useful lives with due regard for an acceptable risk level as acknowledged by the Board of Directors. A long-term perspective has been applied in the balancing of economic performance and the risks associated with financial management. The following describes the companies’ funding in 2018 as well as the key risks. Funding All loans and other financial instruments employed by the companies are underwritten by the Danish state. In general, this means that the companies can achieve capital market terms equivalent to those available to the State, even if the companies do not have an explicit rating from the international credit rating agencies. The adopted financial strategy seeks to maximise funding flexibility in order to take advantage of developments in the capital markets. However, all loan types must adhere to certain criteria partly because of the demands from the guarantor and partly because of internal guidelines set out in the companies’ financial policy. In general, the companies’ loan transactions should consist of common and standardised loan constructions that, as far as possible, limit the credit risk. The loan transactions do not contain any special terms that require disclosure with reference to IFRS 7. In certain cases, lending itself can profitably occur in currencies in which the companies cannot expose themselves to currency risks (see below). In such cases, the loans are translated through currency swaps into acceptable currencies. Thus, there is no direct link between the original loan currencies and the companies’ currency risk. A/S Storebælt has established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 5 billion of which USD 0.4 billion has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 4.6 billion remains. In addition, the company has a Swedish MTN programme of SEK 5 billion of which SEK 0.6 billion has been utilised. A/S Øresund has also established a standardised MTN (Medium Term Note) loan programme in the European bond market with a maximum borrowing limit of USD 1 billion of which USD 37 million has been utilised. Thus, an available credit limit of USD 963 million remains. Since 2002, the companies have had access to on-lending, which is a direct loan from Danmarks Nationalbank on behalf of the State to the companies based on a specific government bond, and subject to the same conditions under which the bond is traded in the market. In 2018, funding requirements were mainly covered by on-lending from Danmarks Nationalbank, which was a particularly attractive source of funding. A/S Storebælt raised on-lending to a nominal value of DKK 3.5 billion. A/S Øresund raised on-lending to a nominal value of DKK 1.8 billion. A/S Femern Landanlæg raised on-lending to a nominal value of DKK 1.5 billion. The extent of A/S Storebælt’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2019, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 4.6 billion, and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 3.6 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans and the debt issued to cover collateral demands. The extent of A/S Øresund’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2019, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 0.9 billion and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 1.3 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans and the debt issued to cover collateral demands. The extent of A/S Femern Landanlæg’s funding in any individual year is largely decided by the size of the repayments on the existing debt (refinancing) and the impact from operations. In 2019, such refinancing will amount to approx. DKK 0.2 billion and the expected net borrowing requirements will be around DKK 1.3 billion. This is beyond what is needed for the financing of any extraordinary repurchase of existing loans and the debt issued to cover collateral demands. The companies have the flexibility to maintain a liquidity reserve of up to 6 months’ liquidity consumption with the objective of reducing the risk of borrowing at times when the general loan terms in the capital markets are temporarily unattractive. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 63 Financial risk exposure The companies are exposed to financial risks inherent in the funding of the infrastructures and linked to financial management as well as operational decisions, including bond issuance and loans from credit institutions, the use of derivatives and deposit of liquid funds for liquidity reserve, receivables from customers and trade payables. Risks relating to these financial risk exposures primarily comprise:  Currency risks  Interest rate risks  Inflation risks  Credit risks  Liquidity risks Financial risks are identified, monitored and controlled within the framework approved by the Board of Directors as determined in the companies’ financial policy and strategy, operational procedures and in accordance with the guidelines from the Danish Ministry of Finance/Danmarks Nationalbank, which has issued guarantees for the companies’ liabilities. Currency risks The companies' exposure to currency risks primarily relates to the part of the net debt denominated in currencies other than the base currency (DKK). Financial derivatives and liquid funds are included in the disclosure of the currency risk measured at fair value.

The companies’ currency risks are managed within the limits of the composition of the currency allocation and can be distributed with no constraint between DKK and EUR. Based on the stable Danish fixed exchange rate policy and the relatively narrow fluctuation band vis-a-vis EUR +/2.25 per cent in the ERM2 agreement, exposure to EUR is not considered to represent any substantial risk. The currency distribution between DKK and EUR will, over the coming years, depend on the exchange rate and interest rate relationship between the two currencies. The proportion of other currencies comprise AUD, JPY, NOK, SEK and USD and are attributed to the hedging of bond loans in these currencies where premium/discounts in the currency swap result in an exposure based on market-to-market values although the cash flows are completely hedged. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Storebælt amounted to DKK 21 million in 2018 (DKK 28 million in 2017) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Øresund amounted to DKK 10 million in 2018 (DKK 10 million in 2017) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Foreign exchange sensitivity for A/S Femern Landanlæg amounted to DKK 1 million in 2018 (DKK 2 million in 2017) calculated as Value-at-Risk. Value-at-Risk for foreign exchange risk sensitivity expresses the maximum loss as a result of an unfavourable development in the exchange rate within one year, with a 95 per cent probability. Value-at-Risk has been calculated based on historical volatility and correlations within one year in the currencies that pose a risk. Interest rate and inflation risks The companies’ financing expenses are exposed to interest rate risks because of the ongoing funding for the refinancing of debts maturing, refixing of interest rates on floating rate debt and deposit of liquidity from operations and investments. The uncertainty arises as a consequence of fluctuations in market interest rates. The companies’ interest rate risk is managed within several lines and limits, and the combination of these limits the interest rate risk on the net debt. For A/S Storebælt, the following framework for 2018 was applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 40 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 4.0 years (variation limit: 3.25-4.75 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. For A/S Øresund, the following framework for 2018 was applied in the interest rate risk management:  Interest rate refixing risk may not exceed 40 per cent of the net debt  Duration target on net debt is 9.0 years (variation limit: 8.0-10.0 years)  Limits for interest rate exposure with fluctuation bands. The companies' interest rate risk is actively managed through the use of interest rate and currency swaps and other derivative instruments. Floating rate debt or debt with a short remaining maturity imply that the loan must have the interest rate reset at market interest rates within a given time frame, which typically involves higher risks than fixed rate debts with long maturity when fluctuations in the current interest expenses form the basis of the risk management. By contrast, financing expenses are usually a rising function of the maturity, and the choice of debt allocation is thus a question of balancing financing expenses and risk tolerance. The debt allocation between fixed and floating rate nominal debt and real rate debt in conjunction with the maturity profile (maturity on the fixed rate debt) and the currency distribution comprise the uncertainty on the financing expenses. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 65 Besides representing an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest refixing risk on the net debt, the companies’ risk profile is also affected by linkages to the operations. This means that a balancing of risk is targeted across assets and liabilities with the aim of achieving a lower risk by combining the debt mix so that there is a positive correlation between operating revenue and financing expenses. This relationship was evident in the downturn that followed the financial crisis, when a sluggish trend in traffic revenues was offset by lower financing expenses. Typically, floating rate debt and real rate debt have a positive correlation with general economic growth because monetary policy will often seek to balance the economic cycle by hiking interest rates when economic growth and inflation are high – and vice versa. The economic relationship between operating revenue and financing expenses justifies some proportion of floating rate debt. Developments in road traffic revenue, which is the primary income source, are particularly dependent on economic conditions and low economic growth typically entails low traffic growth, and thus a less favourable development in revenue. This revenue risk can, to a certain extent, be offset by a high proportion of floating rate debt in that adverse economic trends normally lead to lower interest rates, notably at the short end of the maturity spectrum. Fixed rate debt may, on the other hand, serve as a hedge against stagflation, with low growth and high inflation, which cannot be passed on to the tolls for crossing the bridge. Furthermore, the companies have a strategic interest in real rate debt where the financing expenses comprise a fixed real rate plus indexation dependent upon general inflation. The reason is that operating income, by and large, can be expected to follow inflation developments as both road tolls and rail revenue are normally indexed. Real rate debt, therefore, represents a very low risk and functions as a hedge of operating revenue and the companies’ long-term project risk. Based on the overall financial management objective to attain the lowest possible financing expenses within a risk level approved by the Board of Directors – the companies have established a strategic benchmark for the debt portfolio’s interest rate allocation and the nominal duration. This benchmark serves as an overall guideline and a financial framework for the debt management and implies that the companies target a real rate debt allocation of 25-45 per cent and for 2018, the duration on the nominal debt was set at 4.0 years for A/S Storebælt and 9.0 years for A/S Øresund. The calculation of the duration will be assessed without discounting. Maximum variation limits for the interest rate allocation and duration target are established. The basis for determining the strategic benchmark in the debt management is economic model simulations that estimate the outcome and expected earnings development of the companies’ assets and liabilities on a large number of relevant portfolio combinations with different interest rate allocations and maturity profiles and consists of a balancing of financing expenses with revenue risk. Besides the above-mentioned strategic elements, the interest rate risk is also managed on the basis of the expectations for short-term interest rate developments and an isolated balancing of financing expenses and interest rate refixing risk on the nominal debt. For A/S Storebælt, the target for the duration on the nominal debt was 4.0 years for 2018 and the actual duration was between 3.3 years to 4.0 years and was predominantly underweighted in relation to the benchmark, which primarily coincided with the period following dividend distribution when the net debt was relatively higher. The duration of the strategic benchmark for 2019 was maintained at 4.0 years for A/S Storebælt and the target for the real rate debt ratio is unchanged. For A/S Øresund, the target for the duration on the nominal debt was 9.0 years in 2018 and the actual duration was between 8.9 years and 9.5 years and was largely balanced in relation to the benchmark. In the period following the receipt of dividend, the duration was high due to the debt reduction. For A/S Øresund, the duration on the strategic benchmark for 2019 is maintained at 9.0 years and the target for the real rate debt ratio is unchanged. Long-term interest rates were rather volatile in 2018, and after beginning the year with interest rate rises, interest rates fell back over the summer and took another fall in Q4. A/S Storebælt is exposed to interest rates in DKK and EUR, and here interest rates on the long maturities fell by 0.10 percentage points overall over the year. Seen in isolation, interest rate developments produced a small fair value loss, which, however, was offset by the effect of the general maturity shortening, so that, in 2018, there was an unrealised fair value gain of DKK 101 million from fair value adjustments. A/S Øresund is exposed to interest rates in DKK and EUR, and here interest rates on the long maturities fell by 0.10 percentage points overall over the year. Seen in isolation, interest rate developments produced a small fair value loss, which, however, was offset by the effect of the general maturity shortening, so that, in 2018, there was an unrealised fair value gain of DKK 113 million from fair value adjustments in 2018. A/S Femern Landanlæg is exposed to interest rates in DKK and EUR, and here interest rates on the long maturities fell by 0.10 percentage points overall over the year. Seen in isolation, interest rate developments produced a small fair value loss of DKK 105 million from fair value adjustments in 2018. 66 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S The management of the interest rate risk aims at attaining the lowest possible longer-term financing expenses with no specific regard for the annual fluctuations in the fair value adjustment. The fair value adjustment has, however, no impact on the companies’ economy, including the repayment period. The yield exposure on the net debt is based on the nominal value (the notional) split in time buckets at the earliest of the time to maturity or the time to the next interest rate refixing. Thus, the floating rate debt is included in the next financial year and shows the cash flow exposure to the interest refixing risk. The companies use derivatives to adjust the allocation between floating and fixed rate nominal debt and real rate debt, including, primarily, interest rate and currency swaps, FRAs and interest rate guarantees.

As regards real rate debt, this is exposed to the Danish Consumer Price Index (CPI). The financing expenses’ sensitivity to an interest rate or inflation rate change of 1 percentage point can be estimated at DKK 30 million for a symmetrical interest rate change and for inflation, a rise will increase financing expenses by DKK 46 million. A fall in inflation will result in savings of DKK 43 million. There is no optionality in the hedging of the variable interest rate while for inflation, there is a sold “floor” on the inflation indexation (notional EUR 190 million). When interest rates change, this affects the market value (fair value) of the net debt and, in this respect, the impact and risk are greater on fixed rate debt with long maturities. This is primarily owing to the discounting effect and offsets the alternative cost or gain relating to fixed rate debt obligations in comparison to financing at current market interest rates. The duration denotes the average remaining maturity on the net debt. A long duration implies a low interest rate refixing risk since a relatively small proportion of the net debt needs to be reset to the current interest rate. The duration also expresses the interest rate sensitivity on the net debt stated at market value. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Annual report 69 Duration, A/S Storebælt 2018 2017 Duration Duration (years) BPV Fair value (years) BVP Fair value 3.9 5.4 -14,001 Nominal debt 4.7 5.5 -11,724 8.0 5.8 -7,289 Real interest debt 4.1 4.2 -10,346 4.4 11.2 -21,290 Net debt 4.4 9.7 -22,070 Basis point value (BPV) expresses the rate sensitivity to a parallel shift in the yield curve of 1 bp. . A/S Storebælt’s duration totalled 4.4 years at the end of 2018, of which 3.9 years relates to the nominal debt and 8.0 years to the real rate debt. Rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 11.2 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. As regards A/S Storebælt, the fair value adjustment’s sensitivity to an interest rate change of 1 percentage point can be calculated as a fair value loss of DKK 1,183 million (2017: 1.022 million) with an interest rate fall and a fair value gain of DKK 1,069 million (2017: 930 million) with an interest rate rise. Duration, A/S Øresund 2018 2017 Duration Duration (years) BPV Fair value (years) BVP Fair value 7.8 5.4 -7,260 Nominal debt 7.9 5.6 -7,167 11.4 6.1 -5,387 Real interest debt 12.2 6.7 -5,480 9.7 11.5 -12,647 Net debt 9.7 12.3 -12,647 Basis point value (BPV) expresses the rate sensitivity to a parallel shift in the yield curve of 1 bp. A/S Øresund’s duration totalled 9.7 years at the end of 2018 of which 7.8 years relate to the nominal debt and 11.4 years to the real rate debt. Interest rate sensitivity can be calculated at DKK 11.5 million, when the yield curve is shifted in parallel by 1bp. This will imply a positive fair value adjustment in the income statement and balance sheet when interest rates rise by 1bp, and vice versa. As regards A/S Øresund, the fair value adjustment’s sensitivity to an interest rate change of 1 percentage point can be calculated as a fair value loss of DKK 1,296 million (2017: 1.393 million) with an interest rate fall and a fair value gain of DKK 1,095 million (2017: 1.172 million) with an interest rate rise. The calculated sensitivity to interest rate changes on the fair value adjustment takes account of the convexity of the debt portfolio. The sensitivity calculations have been made on the basis of the net debt on the balance sheet date, and the impact is similar in result and balance sheet as a result of the accounting policies where financial assets and liabilities are recognised at fair value. Credit risks Credit risks are defined as the risk of losses arising as a result of a counterparty not meeting its payment obligations. Credit risks arise in connection with the deposit of excess liquidity, amount receivables from derivative transactions and trade receivables. The credit policy for the deposit of excess liquidity has continuously been tightened with increased requirements for rating, credit limits and maximum duration. The companies have, to the greatest possible extent, limited excess liquidity and have only had deposits in banks with high credit ratings or invested liquidity in German government bonds for pledging collateral. There have been no incidents of overdue payments as a result of credit events. Companies' derivative transactions are regulated by an ISDA master agreement with each counterparty, and it is explicitly set out that netting of positive and negative balances will apply. The credit risk on financial counterparties is managed and monitored on a daily basis through a specific line and limit system which has been approved by the Board of Directors in respect of the companies’ financial policy and determines the principles for calculating these risks and limits for acceptable credit exposures. The allocation of limits for acceptable credit exposures is determined on the basis of the counterparty’s long-term rating by either Standard and Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s) or Fitch Ratings. The credit risk is limited to the greatest possible extent by diversifying the counterparty exposure and reducing the risk exposure to individual counterparties. The financial counterparties must adhere to high standards for credit quality and agreements are only entered into with counterparties that have a long-term rating above A3/A-. The rating requirement can be eased to BBB/Baa2, provided that the counterparty is resident in a country with a AA/Aa2 rating and that a number of strict collateral requirements are met. The companies have entered into collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with the majority of the financial counterparties and since 2005 have only entered into derivative contracts that are regulated by such agreements. The CSA agreements are two-way and imply that both the company 70 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S and the counterparty must pledge collateral in the form of government bonds or mortgage bonds with high credit quality when the balance is in favour of one of the parties. The parties have title of right to the collateral with mandatory return of income and securities in the absence of bankruptcy. Credit exposure is effectively limited by low threshold values for unhedged receivables and greater collateral is required for counterparties with lower credit quality, i.e. with a requirement for supplementary collateral for lower ratings. The bonds, provided as collateral, must have a minimum rating of Aa3/AA-. The companies are not covered by EMIR's central clearing obligation for derivative transactions. The IFRS accounting standard stipulates that the credit risk is calculated gross excluding netting (the offsetting of positive and negative balances for each counterparty), even though such agreements exist. Net exposure is given as additional information and constitutes a better measure of the companies' actual credit risk.

The guarantee provided by the Danish state, and the flexibility to maintain a liquidity reserve of up to 6 months’ liquidity consumption imply a limited liquidity risk for the companies. In order to avoid substantial fluctuations in the refinancing for individual years, the objective is for the principal payments to be evenly dispersed. Unexpected cash outflow can arise from demands for collateral as a result of market value changes on derivative transactions.

Interest payments are recognised at agreed terms and implicit forward interest rates and inflation form the basis for the variable interest payments and inflation indexation. Repayments, principal amounts and interest payments are disclosed for the net debt and neither refinancing nor cash flows from operating activities is included, c.f. IFRS 7. Note 24 Profitability A/S Storebælt A/S Storebælt’s debt will be repaid from the revenue from road and rail traffic. As a basis for the calculation of the repayment date in the long-term profitability calculations, the company uses a real interest rate of 3.0 per cent on the part of the debt that is not hedged, whereas the interesthedged debt is included within the agreed interest rate terms. The political agreement of 21 September 2017 concerning a 25 per cent reduction in toll charges and the obligation to co-finance the extension of the Funen motorway to the tune of DKK 2.1 billion resulted in the repayment period being extended to 34 years whereby the debt is expected to be repaid in 2032. In the current financial year, the repayment period is unchanged at 34 years. The railway companies’ payments for use of the fixed links across Storebælt and Øresund were reduced in connection with the 2016 Finance Act. As regards A/S Storebælt, revenue depends on actual train traffic and the reduction in the railway payment resulted in a reduction in rail revenues of DKK 270 million in 2016 prices. Co-financing of the political agreement, A Green Transport Policy, from 29 January 2009 is included in the repayment period calculation whereby the company pays a dividend to the State of DKK 9.0 billion (in 2008 prices) up to the financial year 2022. After payment of the expected dividend of DKK 1,411 million for the 2018 financial year, a total of DKK 7,063 million will have been paid to the shareholder. The main uncertainties in the profitability calculations relate to the long-term traffic developments and the real interest rate, which is assumed to total 3.0 per cent. Traffic growth is expected on average to total 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent for lorries and passenger cars respectively. Operating expenses assume annual efficiencies of 2 per cent per annum over the next five years whereafter they are expected to rise in line with inflation. Moreover, there is some uncertainty as regards the size and timing of reinvestments in the railway link. 74 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S A/S Øresund The investment in the Øresund fixed link’s landworks will be repaid in part through payment from Banedanmark for use of the Øresund rail line and in part through dividend payments from Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S of which A/S Øresund owns 50 per cent. As a basis for the calculation of the repayment date in the long-term profitability calculations, the company uses a real interest rate of 3.0 per cent on the part of the debt that is not hedged, whereas the interest-hedged debt is included within the agreed interest rate terms. As a consequence of the 2016 Finance Act, the railway payment is gradually reduced until 2024 and will be reduced by a total of DKK 200 milion in 2016 prices when fully phased in. In addition, A/S Øresund is obliged to cover the railway payment for Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S, which was previously financed by the Finance Act. Also, as a consequence of the joint taxation with the Group’s other companies, A/S Øresund obtains a cash flow benefit. This is because joint taxation with A/S Storebælt means that A/S Storebælt can immediately offset A/S Øresund’s tax loss against paying the proceeds of the tax savings for A/S Øresund. A/S Øresund can thus forward the use of its tax loss over time. The repayment period for A/S Øresund is now calculated at 45 years, which is 5 years less compared to last year. This relates to the fact that the adoption of a new dividend policy for Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S has brought forward the dividend payments. A/S Øresund is sensitive to changes in the finances of the two above-mentioned companies.

At year end, work under contracts amounted to DKK 277 million (DKK 333 million in 2017). Concerning the conditional contracts for the construction of the Fehmarnbelt tunnel, the company has a contingent liability of DKK 112 million (2015 prices). Femern A/S has also entered into conditional contracts relating to land acquisitions. The company has a contingent liability related to the conditional contracts of DKK 17 million. The Act on construction and operation of a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark was adopted by the Danish Parliament on 28 April 2015. The Act authorises A/S Femern Landanlæg to build and operate the Danish landworks associated with a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt. With the issue of the statutory order on the delegation of certain tasks and powers concerning the construction and operation of a fixed link across the Fehmarnbelt with associated landworks in Denmark on 17 September 2015, client responsibility was assigned to Banedanmark while A/S Femern Landanlæg remains responsible for the ownership and financing of the landworks. The notes to the Construction Act stipulate that a reassessment of the overall economics of the project, including an updated risk assessment, are to be submitted to the political parties behind the Fehmarnbelt project before construction work can begin. The total cost of the upgrading of the Danish landworks is budgeted at DKK 9.5 billion (2015 prices). Based on the political agreement by the political parties behind the Fehmarnbelt link of 4 March 2016, the company is authorised to begin work on the Ringsted-Nykøbing Falster railway line so that the section is upgraded to dual track with new signalling systems by 2021 and electrified by 2024. The section between Nykøbing Falster and Holeby near Rødby will be extended, so that the section will be complete before the opening of the coast-to-coast link. These works are budgeted at DKK 7.5 billion (2015 prices) and contractual obligations are primarily assigned to Banedanmark. On 13 December 2018, EU Court ruled on the two cases brought by Scandlines and Stena Line against the European Commission to annul the EU Commission's decision on State aid to the Fehmarnbelt link. The Court upholds the Commission’s state aid approval as far as the financing of A/S Femern Landanlæg is concerned, while the Court annuls the Commission’s state aid approval for the coast-to-coast project. The Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing is in discussions with the Commission about the matter with a view to preparing a new and legally robust approval of the State guarantee model pursuant to the State aid regulations. Femern A/S was prepared for all possible outcomes of the judgement and has, following prior agreement with the owner, obtained advance loans in order to ensure the necessary liquidity for the project for a period with no State guarantee. Operating leasing comprises contracts with a maturity of between 1-7 years. The leasing liability totals DKK 125.6 million (DKK 131.6 million in 2017) of which DKK 26.9 million falls due in 2019. In accordance with the Act on Ferry Operations, A/S Storebælt is required, within a specified extent, to maintain car ferry operations between Zealand and Jutland across Kattegat and between Spodsbjerg and Tårs. For the Spodsbjerg and Tårs service, with effect from 1 May 2018, an agreement was entered into with Danske Færger A/S (purchased by Molslinjen A/S during 2018) with regard to the operation of the service for a period of 10 years with the option of a further two years. In 2019, costs are expected to amount to DKK 35 million. In 2013, HH Ferries et al lodged a complaint with the EU Commission claiming that the Danish/Swedish State guarantees for Øresundsbro Konsortiet I/S’s loans, etc. are illegal according to the EU’s State aid rules. In October 2015, the EU Commission decided that the guarantees are covered by the State aid rules, but that they are in compliance with these rules. HH Ferries et al brought this before the EU Court, which reached a decision on 19 September 2018. The decision was an annulment of the EU Commission’s decision from 2015. The judgement did not state whether the State aid was illegal or not, but only that the Commission had made certain procedural errors. The Commission is initiating a formal investigation procedure, which will lead to a new decision, probably in the second half of 2019. A/S Storebælt, A/S Øresund and A/S Femern Landanlæg have entered into two-way collateral agreements (CSA agreements) with a number of financial counterparties and are required to pledge collateral in the form of government bonds for outstanding exposure from derivative contracts in the counterparties’ favour. A/S Storebælt has currently pledged collateral for DKK 727 million to hedge outstanding exposure from derivative transactions in favour of three counterparties. A/S Øresund has currently pledged collateral for DKK 434 million to hedge outstanding exposure from derivative transactions in favour of four counterparties. A/S Femern Landanlæg has not pledged collateral. Sund & Bælt Holding A/S is the management company in a Danish joint taxation agreement. As from the financial year 2013, according to the rules of the Danish Corporation Tax Act, the company is jointly and severally liable with the other jointly taxed companies for corporation tax. Otherwise, the Group’s companies have not pledged any collateral. 76 Annual report Sund & Bælt Holding A/S Note 28 Related parties Related parties comprise the Danish State, companies and institutions owned by it.

On 25 February 2019, Scandlines and Stena Line appealed against the EU Court’s rulings of 13 December 2018 to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Femern A/S has prepared for possible outcomes of the judgements. The company has obtained advance loans in order to ensure the necessary liquidity for the project for a period without a state guarantee. On 15 February 2019, Scandlines and Stena Line issued a writ against the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Minister of Finance is prohibited from granting state-guaranteed loans or granting state guarantees for the use of Femern A/S under the authority of the Construction Act. In addition, the ferry companies have claimed that the Minister of Finance must demand a repayment of the financial benefit that Femern A/S has obtained through state-guaranteed loans and state guarantees issued pursuant to the Construction Act.

A company may, for example, raise a fixed interest loan and subsequently enter a swap with the bank by which the company receives fixed interest corresponding to the interest on the loan and pays variable interest +/a premium. The company’s net obligation will be the payment of the variable interest +/the premium. Such transactions are called swaps. In a currency swap, payments in two different currencies are exchanged. Interest rate and currency swaps may also be combined. Denominated ... issued in ... A bond can be issued (denominated) in EUR, but carry interest related to an amount in DKK. Interest-bearing net debt The interest-bearing net debt comprises financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, excluding interest due and receivable under accruals and deferred income. Fair value Fair value is the accounting term for market value and expresses current purchase and selling rates on financial assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value can be primarily attributed to developments in the level of interest rate, exchange rates and inflation. Fair value adjustment An accounting principle in financial reporting requiring the value of assets/liabilities to be determined at their market value (fair value) i.e. the value at which an asset could be sold or a liability settled in the market. In the period between the raising and repayment of loans the fair value will change as interest rates change. AAA or AA rating International credit rating agencies rate companies according to their creditworthiness. Companies are usually rated with a short and a long rating that expresses the company’s ability to settle its liabilities in the short-term and the long-term respectively. The rating follows a scale, with AAA being the best rating, AA the second best etc. The Danish State, which guarantees the liabilities of Storebælt and the Øresund fixed link, has the highest credit rating: AAA. The largest credit rating agencies are Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Real rate The nominal interest rate minus inflation.
