Statement of support MTI Worldwide Logistics is committed to the principles and goals of the United Nations Global Compact advancement of the ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Signature Position CEO Karl Krug We have chosen to list all of the 10 principles in our COP even though some of them may never require significant updating. The complete list will be a good reminder of where we’ve been, and where we’re going. We ensures the principles are maintained in our own operations to the extent that they are relevant (for example, we have never had an issue with human rights abuses, child labor, forced or compulsory labor, corruption, etc.). On the other hand, we have found room for improvement in the environmental category and are creating several procedures for improving our environmental impacts. PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. PRINCIPLE 2 BUSINESS SHOULD ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS Our Commitment or Policy The MTI Worldwide Logistics policy guarantees to all employees the right to collective bargaining as well as the freedom of association. PRINCIPLE 4 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED AND COMPULSORY LABOUR Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Our Commitment or Policy We actively promote diversity in our staff recruitment. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • As a small business and by comparison -MTI Worldwide Logistics provides a good health insurance, liberal annual vacation schedule, employer funded pension plan and a profit sharing program for all employees. • VOIP allows flex-work-flow from home or office whenever feasible... decreasing the need to commute for some to the office. Measurable Results or Outcomes • All our employees have health insurance, a pension & participate in a rewarding profit sharing plan. • Almost a half of the employees are able to work from home on a partial/selective basis. We have two full-time remote employees, three that work from home four days a week with one in the office, and two others that currently have two remote work from home days. PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES Our Commitment or Policy Our policies are to reduce the environmental footprint of our operation. A brief description of our Processes or Systems Recycle system and Electronic Document Repository Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • We have continued our “go-green” initiative with both internal (MTI & Global Partner Network) and external clients & vendors. • Implementation of 100% vendor electronic invoicing continues with every new vendor that works with our company. We now only retain invoice copies electronically, no longer printing hard copies, with very rare exception. All are retained within our system for reference. GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS effectively improves the environmental impact by reduced printed materials, and the handling and resources taken to mail the invoice. • Implemented in all offices, our operational files are now retained within our system electronically, with a goal of 100% electronic storage and no printing by the end if 2019. This will not only reduce cost in materials, but energy output in the elimination of an additional printer, less paper waste. • We are currently in the process of implementing the IATA e-AWB, which allows for electronic communication between our company and the airlines. The e-AWB and electronic documents will eliminate the need for printed document pouches that historically must accompany each air shipment. Additionally, this will afford us the opportunity to allow additional personnel to work remote, as they no longer need to print documents in a central location. Additionally, the elimination of paper and fuel to transport these documents will dramatically help the environment and reduce costs. PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our Commitment or Policy MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are focused to reduce the environmental footprint of our operation Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • Continued the refinement of company intranet that provides online access to essential documentation, eliminating the need for employees to print reference or essential materials to carry with them when outside of company offices. • Continued conversion of vendors to electronic invoicing. This reduces the environmental impact of printing, processing, and delivery of the document. • Consolidated office space and employees in Florida, reducing the environmental impact of multiple offices in close proximity. • Are actively phasing in multi-day work from home program, currently ranging up to three days working remote, and two days in the office. This reduces our carbon emissions, and we estimate a reduction of 20 or more commute trips per week that we have effectively eliminated. Continued implementation will progress as feasible through the year • Continued push for electronic invoicing to all new customers, and to move existing customers to electronic delivery, resulting in a reduction in the environmental impact of our daily billing function. • Implementation of our electronic e-AWB and move to 100% electronic document storage will greatly reduce our impact on the environment. Not only through the reduction of paper, but also in carbon emissions with the enhanced ability for more employees to work from home, as electronic communication is further implemented. PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES Our Commitment or Policy The MTI Worldwide Logistics provides help to existing & start-up companies which are attempting to develop environmentally friendly technologies. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year We offer recyclable cardboard pallets to targeted customers in order to replace the wooden pallets which account for almost 30% of all the trees cut each year in the USA alone. Measurable Results or Outcomes Cheap wooden pallets (and a strong political lobby..) during a recession are a major hurdle for companies resisting change to a more environmentally friendly cardboard pallet. However we are GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS starting to see positive momentum in the willingness of companies to entertain eco-friendly pallet alternatives. PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESS SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US and Host Nation government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. How do you intend to make this COP available to your stakeholders? The MTI Worldwide Logistics COP will be provided to all staff for review and feedback in order to continue to refine our policies and procedures to remain compliant in this process.
