The Company takes following precautionary measures in this direction. • Company’s vessels are fully compliant of MARPOL regulations and hold valid International Oil Pollution Prevention certificate (IOPP). Each vessel is provided with a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) or Shipboard Marine Pollution Emergency Plan (SMPEP) • Ships maintain weekly inventory of oil residues. Disposal and transfer carried out as per regulations and record is maintained in “Oil Record Books”. • Each vessel is holding valid International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate (ISPP). Page 7 of 16 • Each vessel is holding valid International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate (IAPP). • Vessels use low sulphur bunkers with less than 0.1% in Sulphur Emission Controlled areas (SECA) and less than 3.5% in other areas. • Vessels use bunker with sulphur content less than 0.1% in European ports, Hong Kong etc. • Inventory of Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) is maintained on all Fleet vessels. • Company has Garbage Management Plan and each vessel complies with the same. • The Company tries to avoid supply of goods which are packed in plastic and promotes eco-friendly/ biodegradable items such as garbage bags, envelops etc. • The company is also in the process of modifying its existing tanker fleet to be ECA compliant. The tanker vessels trading in ECA areas are fitted/being fitted with necessary equipments certified by Classification to be fully compliant with the emission limits while trading in these areas. 8 (eight) tankers are already modified to be ECA compliant and arrangements are in process for other vessels. • The company has procedures to identify and minimise source of marine and atmospheric emissions and ensure that they are always within permissible limits. This includes Fuel Analysis, VOC Management, Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP), Trim Optimisation etc. • Energy Efficiency and Fuel Management are being done by monitoring fuel consumption, vessel speed, vessel’s condition (Laden/Ballast) trim, sea and wind condition, proper polishing and hull cleaning. • SCI is already in process of achieving the SOx control requirements as per Revised MARPOL Annex VI for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships (Chapters 1 3) well before the due date. The global sulphur limit will reduce to 0.50% on 1st January 2020. • All B&T vessels are fully prepared for the global sulphur limit of 0.50% coming in effect from 1st January 2020. Environmental Safety • A procedure for leak detection at pre-determined intervals of CFC based refrigerants in all refrigeration and air-conditioning systems on board are being complied. (Record of same is being maintained in vessels’ Planned Maintenance System). • In order to reduce the disposal of lead and other hazardous substances into the sea/land; lead – acid batteries and other batteries are returned to the manufactures. • As per International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001, the Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on existing tankers (less than 20 years) have been replaced by non-harmful anti-fouling systems since 31st December 2007 onwards. Page 8 of 16 Liner Vessels The Liner ships of the Company are sometimes engaged in the carriage of Hazardous and dangerous goods, both in the break bulk as well as container vessels. As the sulphur cap (0.5% sulphur fuel) will come into force from 01.01.2020, SCI is in the process of preparing all the vessels for use of compliant fuel prior to the due date set by IMO. The company has developed an in-house manual which caters to shipment of International Dangerous Maritime Goods Code (IMDG) cargoes in containers. This document also highlights the company’s policy and procedures in respect of carriage of hazardous and dangerous goods and also their procedures adopted in implementing such carriage. The officers connected with dealing of hazardous goods are trained by attending various workshops and seminars and their knowledge is updated on matters involving carriage of hazardous goods. Frequent interaction with our partners in the container line, owners of vessels, other bodies have benefited SCI in developing hazardous cell. Principle 8: Business should undertake initiatives to promote greater Environmental responsibility The company is committed to environmental protection as per International Conventions for the prevention of pollutions from ships. Towards conserving energy and Fuel Efficiency, in addition to the earlier four SCI tankers, one more tanker and one bulk carrier has been audited by Classification, thereby taking due steps towards economising on Fuel and Energy Efficiency. Page 9 of 16 All ship repair workshops are strictly instructed that they should not use ASBESTOS material in any form during repairs/renewals on board vessels, as use of ASBESTOS is prohibited on ships in any form as per MSC 1/Circ 1426 and SOLAS regulation. SCI is the technical consultant to UTL Administration for the acquisition of 2000 LPG Cylinder carriers and 500 Pax vessel. On these vessels SCI has specified CFD analysis along with Model tests to arrive at optimum engine power, thus lowering the fuel consumption.
