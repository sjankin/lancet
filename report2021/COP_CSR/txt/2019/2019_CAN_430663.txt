ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2018 2 A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT & CEO Respect, relationships and responsibility have been at the core of Eldorado’s approach to operating for the past 25 years. Much has changed in that time, but putting people first and finding safer and more sustainable ways to operate have not. Today, we continue to be guided by our values of honesty, openness and I was pleased to see a 21% reduction in our 2018 lost-time incident accountability. These drive us to seek out and implement leading safety frequency rate, particularly given the intensified construction work on and environmental standards and work with local partners to create refurbishing the Sigma Mill that occurred throughout the year. However, opportunities beyond our mines. Our success and the success of our despite this improvement, our 2018 total recordable incident frequency stakeholders are based on making the most of the opportunities before rate rose by 23%, indicating we must do more to strengthen our health us.

Our global teams As the world transitions to a lower-carbon economy, we are doing our executed on a number of key milestones, including identifying solutions for part to mitigate the impacts of our operations by focusing on reducing our technical challenges at Kışladağ, advancing underground development at emissions, water use and land use. We are proud that we had no reportable Lamaque, completing refurbishment of the Sigma Mill and pouring first gold spills last year. at Lamaque. On the safety front, various initiatives succeeded in improving In 2018, we completed a project to optimize underground ventilation at our lost-time incident frequency rate and strengthening our safety culture. our Efemçukuru mine, which we estimate will reduce our CO2 emissions We also continued to align our operations with leading environmental significantly going forward. Ventilation-on-demand technology has also standards and practices. been installed at our newly operational Lamaque Mine in Québec. However, despite these operational, safety and environmental successes, Across our operations, 78% of our total water use involves recycled the Company’s performance was overshadowed by a decreasing gold price, or reused water. When areas are no longer needed for mining use, we begin global geopolitical uncertainty and a shift in market sentiment towards reclamation efforts. On this front, we restored almost 22 hectares of land rewarding short-term results and free cash flow. We ended the year in a in 2018. solid financial position, with total liquidity of approximately $543 million, including $293 million in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits, and Another area where we are making an impact is in tailings management. $250 million in an undrawn line of credit. Almost all of our tailings facilities use dry stack technology, which allows for a reduced environmental footprint, more water to be recycled, and Throughout 2018, we continued to provide positive opportunities for our increased safety through higher-density, more stable tailings that can employees, local communities and the regions where we operate, and built be stacked and contoured to the surrounding landscape. In 2018, we upon the relationships we have with our stakeholders. committed to using dry stack tailings at Skouries, which, if approved by the Government of Greece, reduces the project’s surface footprint by 40%. BUILDING A SAFE WORKPLACE We also began to evaluate the use of dry stack tailings at Lamaque. At Eldorado, our primary goal is zero harm. Every person that steps onto our sites must return home safely. It is our shared responsibility to look out WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE SHARED SUCCESS for each other at work, in addition to minding our own personal safety. Everywhere we operate, we seek to provide opportunities for host Operating safely requires constant effort, and I am proud of the progress communities and governments to benefit from our investments and the made by our teams in 2018 towards making our workplaces safer. revenues we generate. Over the past year, our Lamaque project drove During the year, we introduced the Golden Rules, a health and safety economic growth through the generation of 320 jobs, local procurement handbook that outlines critical controls and mandatory actions related practices and skills-based training for First Nations people.

By working together we create shared prosperity and a better future. unemployment benefits and find opportunities for employment elsewhere. With the resumption of mining at Kışladağ, we have prioritized former employees in the re-hiring process. We continue to seek ways in which our business activities can support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. We have incorporated SDG targets into this Report’s materiality assessment and aligned our materiality process to the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards in order to better understand how we can positively contribute to the SDGs. Throughout 2018, we continued to advance our alignment to the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights, and conducted assessments and training at our Tocantinzinho project in Brazil. As we continue to embrace diversity across our operations, we developed a formal Gender Diversity Policy for our Board and senior management team and became a signatory to the 30% Club Canada, which recognizes the benefits of diverse perspectives and gender balance in delivering superior business performance. LOOKING AHEAD: COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT As the industry finds new and innovative ways to increase productivity and positive impacts, we are proud to work collaboratively with our peers to raise the bar for sustainable mining practices. We actively participate in several industry associations and apply world-class standards to our operations. Going forward, we will continue to focus on strengthening our health and safety performance and reducing our environmental impacts everywhere we operate, as the mining industry continues to make progress on environmental, social and governance performance. I am proud of what we do at Eldorado but nothing is more rewarding than seeing the progress our people deliver every day. We have started 2019 with the achievement of two major milestones: Lamaque commercial production and resuming mining and heap leaching at Kışladağ. We expect that the increased production from Lamaque and Kışladağ will generate significant free cash flow over the next several quarters, giving us the financial flexibility to pay down debt, reinvest in our business, and contribute to the sustainable development of the communities where we operate.

In order to do so, we work to restore land used by our mining operations to its original state and even improve environmental conditions in cases where we have inherited environmental damage from previous owners. While the majority of our environmental rehabilitation and reclamation work begins after mine closure, we conduct remediation and reclamation alongside mining activities, reducing the amount of disturbed land while the mine operates. Prior to and throughout a mine’s operation, our Operations teams continuously enhance plans for mine reclamation and closure in order to: ■ Protect public health and safety ■ Eliminate the potential for environmental damage ■ Return the land to its original condition (or an acceptable and productive alternative) ■ Provide for long-term socio-economic benefits ■ Set aside sufficient funds as part of asset retirement obligations Key economic, social and environmental impacts of reclamation and closure ■ Jobs and government revenues decrease as business activities wind down ■ Environmental impacts such as land disturbance are reversed, and the ecology of the mine site is restored to its near-original state Reclamation work at Olympias, Greece. ELDORADO GOLD YEAR IN REVIEW 2018 10 OUR PRODUCTS Eldorado is committed to responsibly producing gold and other metals that offer a wide range of uses. Our products are essential elements in a variety of goods that advance sustainable development and contribute to economic growth around the world. We focus on producing gold and other metals responsibly, and all of our gold-producing sites receive independent assurance under the World Gold Council’s (“WGC’s”) Conflict-Free Gold Standard (“CFGS”). PRODUCT RESPONSIBILITY Eldorado supports industry-wide efforts to responsibly produce gold and other precious and base metals. We acknowledge and believe that our licence to operate requires that all of our activities be conducted in a manner that does not cause, support or contribute to human rights abuses, unlawful conduct or breaches of international humanitarian law. As a member in good standing of the WGC, Euromines and the Mining Association of Canada (“MAC”), we are committed to operating to robust social and environmental standards that benefit all stakeholders. Our operating mines adhere to the following: ■ ISO 14001 Environmental Management System Standard (1) ■ OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System Standard ■ WGC’s CFGS ■ International Cyanide Management Code (“ICMC”) Our primary operating cash flows derive from the sale of unrefined gold bullion bars (or doré), and gold, silver, lead and zinc concentrates. PRODUCT HANDLING All of Eldorado’s products are sold in bulk to downstream refineries for secondary treatment. We do not sell our products to the public and our products do not require packaging. At Kışladağ, doré is sold and transported to metals refineries in Istanbul, Turkey, to be further processed into pure (99.9%) metals. At Efemçukuru, Olympias and Stratoni, metal concentrates are transported to offshore smelting facilities for further refinement. At our Lamaque Mine in Canada, which produced 35,350 ounces of pre-production gold in 2018, gold doré produced on site and through custom milling is transported directly to the Royal Canadian Mint for further refining. As 100% of Eldorado’s metal products are sold to downstream refiners for further processing, we do not undertake product recycling or reclamation. Our doré, which largely contains gold and silver, has no environmental or safety risks associated with handling or disposal; it therefore requires no product service or labelling. As such, beyond our product transport and security procedures, we have not developed detailed protocols, procedures or public labelling for product handling or responsibility. Concentrate is loaded into bags at Olympias, Greece. (1) In 2018, our Efemçukuru mine began taking steps to adopt the recently released ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems Standard.

Approximately 900,000 tonnes of ore were placed on an inter-lift lined test pad in Q1 2018. Late in the year, results from this pad were showing recoveries of approximately 58% from an extended leach cycle approaching 250 days (compared to approximately 40% recoveries from the original 90-day column tests). In early 2019, the Company analyzed the new data and developed revised heap leaching plans, showing improved economics for the heap leaching scenario. As a result, the Company decided to resume mining and heap leaching. Gold production, sales and revenue increased despite stacking of new ore being halted in the spring of 2018. Increased solution concentrations and solution injection were able to increase the gold production from the leach pad. Cash costs were higher year on year due to non-cash inventory adjustment charges to account for the draw-down of the leach pad inventory. (1) Based on current proven and probable reserves.

The 17 SDGs set targets for achieving progress in poverty reduction, education, health care and employment while protecting the environment. While the scope and scale of the SDGs require action from governments for them to be achieved, business plays an important role in influencing social and economic conditions and contributing to the SDGs. By considering the values found in the SDGs when making business decisions, we support the communities and countries in which we work. We are also contributing to Canada’s commitments to sustainable development at home and abroad. Although our business has direct and indirect impacts with respect to all 17 SDGs, we have chosen to focus on the areas in which our business operations have the most significant impacts for the regions where we operate.

It focused on security and human rights, working with vulnerable peoples, use of force, and applying Eldorado’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

ADVANCING PERMITS AND LICENCES In 2018 Eldorado received its mining concession for the Tocantinzinho project in Brazil as well as key permits required to operate the Sigma Mill and tailings areas at Lamaque. The Company also maintained its obligations under permits granted at operations at Kışladağ, Efemçukuru, Olympias and Stratoni. A number of critical permits related to the Skouries project in Greece remain outstanding, and Eldorado continues to work to advance permitting. Despite the Company’s efforts and the well-defined merits of our projects, obtaining permits and licences can be a complex process subject to political uncertainties.

HEALTH AND SAFETY In working together, we can accomplish our most important task: the prevention of harm. In order to strengthen our health and safety performance and mitigate risks, we continuously evaluate our practices and procedures. As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we study the use of new technologies that can help our workers accomplish tasks more safely and reduce the risk of harm to people and the environment. In our underground mines at Efemçukuru, Olympias and Lamaque, innovations in underground communications technology have allowed us to implement tagging and tracking technology for our equipment and our workers. Tagging and tracking involves placing transmitters on employees and equipment so that everyone can be accounted for, even if they are working in areas of restricted visibility. This technology allows us to reduce the risks of collisions and helps our workers avoid mobile machinery. Other innovative technologies (such as dry stack tailings) also improve health and safety conditions for our workforce and local communities while reducing our environmental impacts.

Land disturbance poses a significant impact on local environments and local communities, so we design and construct our projects to minimize land disturbance while prioritizing a safe working environment for our employees and contractors. Although we have impacts on local environments due to land disturbance, many of these impacts can be reversed through environmental reclamation practices, such as de-constructing facilities that are no longer needed, treating contaminated soil, and re-vegetating areas where trees and/or other plants were removed. Reclamation efforts at the Kassandra Mines, Greece. We reclaim land on an ongoing basis at all of our operations, meaning that once land is no longer needed, we begin restoring it to its previous condition. At some sites, such as Olympias, we are currently working to reclaim land that was left disturbed by previous operators. We also work to restore parks, marine environments and other environmentally damaged areas surrounding our operations. For example, in 2018 we worked with government authorities in Brazil to restore Utinga State Park and conduct environmental reclamation works at Lake Bologna, transforming these previously degraded ecosystems into welcoming environments for locals, visitors and wildlife. Our environment teams at each site conduct reclamation activities, which are overseen by site General Managers. Eldorado’s COO is responsible for the reclamation of disturbed land. Ultimately, Eldorado’s President & CEO is responsible for advancing environmental reclamation, and these activities are overseen by the Sustainability Committee at the Board level.

Water availability varies by site. At Stratoni, Olympias and Skouries in Greece, groundwater flowing into our underground mines provides the majority of water we need to operate, with small additional volumes collected via rainwater and municipal supplies. For our operations that have limited access to water, such as Kışladağ in Turkey, we have implemented an extensive water conservation and recycling program to reduce our need to withdraw water. The Kışladağ water treatment plant treats up to 5,000 m3 of surface water per day from the waste rock dump and groundwater from the open pit. Recycled water makes up the majority of our water use, particularly at those sites where we have zero water discharge requirements, such as Skouries. Recycled water is used for mineral processing, dust suppression and slurry transport as well as throughout our leach pad areas and adsorption, desorption, recovery (“ADR”) carbon plants. All water that comes into contact with our sites is treated and tested before being used or discharged back into the environment (e.g. rivers, lakes and reinjection into groundwater) where regulations allow.

Eldorado continues to work with the Thessaloniki Areo-club to identify and monitor wildfires in northern Greece, in an effort to improve safety and mitigate the human and environmental risks THE DIVERSE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE caused by wildfires and other climate-related disasters. The effects of rising global temperatures vary by region, resulting in the desertification of certain areas while simultaneously causing increased precipitation and flooding in others. As Eldorado’s operations are situated in geographically disparate areas, the effects of climate change vary by location, but all of our operations and stakeholders are exposed to climate change risks. Climate change may affect many aspects of ecological and socio-economic life related both directly and indirectly to mining. Precipitation Regions that may experience increases in precipitation – such as the CLIMATE MATERIALITY Halkidiki region of northern Greece and Pará State in Brazil – are subject According to the UN SDGs, the effects of climate change include changing to greater risks of flooding and infrastructure damage.
