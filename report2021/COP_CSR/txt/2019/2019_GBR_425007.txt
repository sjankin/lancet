Introduction This year, the total portfolio comprised by floor area The following sets out the overall principles, boundaries, scope and methodologies applied when reporting sustainability data in the Sustainability and Stakeholder section of the Annual Report 2018 (pages 33-39) and this Annual Data Report. Retail 25.7% 1.1 Scope The report covers the period from 1 October 2017 to 30 September 2018. Offices Data is reported where we have operational or management influence. 23.6% This includes all wholly-owned properties as well as the joint venture at Longmartin. This represents 100% of the portfolio by value. Restaurants Residential 31.7% 19% It should be noted that it is not possible to report performance data for the portfolio broken down by use (offices, retail, restaurant and residential). This is due to the following: • The portfolio is divided into ‘villages’ i.e. Carnaby, Soho, Covent Garden (Opera Quarter and Seven Dials), Fitzrovia (reported as part of Opera All the portfolio is located in central London. Quarter) and Chinatown managed by the different agents –CBRE and MJ Mapp, which each supply the data for their part of the portfolio. For Environmental performance data is reported on a like-for-like basis in line this reason the data for Covent Garden is reported separately as Seven with EPRA reporting guidelines. Dials and Opera Quarter. The detailed scope, boundaries, calculation methodologies and data are • Each ‘village’ has a mix of uses which are often in the same building with provided within each data reporting section. shared landlord controlled areas and services, hence it is not possible to attribute energy, water and waste data to the specific use classes. Data is reported for all refurbishment projects above £150,000 capital value, which represents over 89% of the total construction cost of the commissioned projects in the reporting period. Data from properties acquired during the reporting period are reported from the date of purchase. 1 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 1.2 Company Overview Shops Restaurants Offices Residential Carnaby 180,000 114,000 304,000 67,000 sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft Covent 147,000 178,000 88,000 133,000 Garden sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft Longmartin* 73,000 39,000 102,000 55,000 sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft Chinatown 83,000 221,000 25,000 97,000 sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft Soho 44,000 62,000 39,000 37,000 sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft Fitzrovia 16,000 48,000 10,000 25,000 sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft sq. ft TOTAL 2,187,000 sq. ft * In previous reporting years this was reffered to as St martin’s Courtyard 2 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 1.3 Reporting Standard Code Performance Measure Reporting Location Social Performance Measures 1.31 European Real Estate Association Diversity-Emp Employee gender diversity Section 4.1 Diversity-Pay Gender pay ratio Section 4.1 Relevant environmental data has been reported, where possible, following Emp-Training Employee training and development Section 4.1 the European Real Estate Association Best Practice Recommendations on Sustainability Reporting, September 2017 (EPRA sBPR).

Energy data was reported for all 13 sites with water data wholly owned portfolio, Longmartin and properties undergoing refurbishment. reported for 11 of the 13 properties.

This year Carbon Smart are acting as independent verifiers for the GHG verification. 5 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 1.5 Community Investment and Charitable Contribution 1.51 Measurement and Benchmarking In-Kind We joined the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) in 2009. LBG seeks We provide space for charities, not for profit organisations or educational to ensure a consistent approach in the measurement of benchmarking establishments in our properties where vacant between lettings across our of community investment. We have followed the LGB framework and the portfolio. This can be for oneoff “pop-up’ events or for longer periods of principles adopted in relation to our reporting are set out below. time. We account only for the cost of providing services to these spaces and not for the rent that would have been incurred if the organisation was paying 1.52 Inputs the market rate for the space. We allocate an LBG agreed benchmark cost per square foot per day. We also pay the cost of any additional services such as electricity of the area that is paid for by us and would otherwise not have With only 30 employees, the majority of the contributions are in the form been consumed. of cash to other organisations and/or activities. The Sustainability Policy identifies how we spend our charity and community engagement budget. 1.53 Value of Contributions The value of our contributions is presented as a percentage of EPRA pre-tax Cash earnings. We support many different charities which are located in or near our portfolio. This enables us to establish long term and effective relationships with local charities and organisations. Time Where employees contribute time during working hours, this is recorded on an agreed cost basis rather than actual salary. Management Costs We employ a part time member of staff for whom co-ordination of fundraising events forms approximately 75% of their time. The Company Secretary also oversees community engagement. The average employee cost calculated for time is applied to these roles to generate a management cost. 6 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 1.54 Outputs and Impacts Community Outputs Where possible, we have measured and included the number of people directly reached or supported and the number of organisation’s supported by our activities. In some cases we have estimated the number of people impacted but where there is insufficient information to justify an estimate, we have not included a number. Leverage We have, where possible, reported resources contributed to community organisations and activities that come from outside of Shaftesbury as a result of our own direct contributions, encouragement and/or support. Community Investment Not Included in the LBG Benchmark We have taken into account the two key principles identified within the LBG Methodology when deciding whether or not to include activity in the benchmark data and only activity that is both voluntary and charitable in nature is included. Activity that falls outside these parameters is recorded separately. Mandatory Contributions Where a contribution is mandated by a third party, such as local planning authority via Section 106 Agreements, it is excluded from the LBG Benchmark data. 7 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 2.1: Performance Against Targets One of our strategic goals is to work with our stakeholders including tenants, suppliers, employees, agents and the local community throughout our operations.

Total electricity consumption across the managed portfolios has seen a small decrease of 0.25% from 2017 to 2018. Gas consumption has increased slightly (4%) due to an error of the reading of imperial meters in the previous reporting period. This accounted for less than 2% of the total GHG inventory and was concluded to not be a material consideration for restatement. The addition of several recently refurbished properties across the portfolio has also contributed to increased gas usage. The category ‘shared services’ accounts for electricity and gas which is distributed among areas which are additional to common parts (e.g.. lifts and external lighting). These areas are generally not easily associated with a floor area. The category ‘other’ is the usage which cannot be differentiated between uses i.e. buildings which report external lighting, gas and common parts electricity. 13 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 3.1.2 Like for Like Energy Consumption EPRA Elec-LfL Number of properties Number of properties 2017-2018 % Site 2017 2018 Difference reported on 2017 reported on 2018 change Head Office 1 1 92,434 99,549 7,115 7.7% Carnaby 41 41 551,281 496,800 -54,481 -9.88% Seven Dials 30 30 122,051 123,305 1,254 1.03% Electricity Chinatown 18 18 59,207 61,833 2,626 4.44% Usage (KWh) Fitzrovia and Opera Quarter 33 33 114,375 113,811 -564 -0.49% Soho 8 8 18,121 19,258 1,137 6.27% Longmartin 11 11 462,787 468,760 5,973 1.29% Total Electricity 142 142 1,420,256 1,383,316 -36,940 -2.60% EPRA FuelLfl Number of properties Number of properties 2017-2018 % Site 2017 2018 Difference reported on 2017 reported on 2018 change Carnaby 8 8 367,579 386,184 18,605 5.06% Seven Dials 0 0 0 0 0 0% Gas Usage (KWh) Fitzrovia and Opera Quarter 2 2 154,871 193,930 39,059 25.22% Longmartin 1 1 78,752 79,967 1,215 1.54% Total 11 11 601,202 660,081 58,879 9.79% 14 Shaftesbury Sustainability Data Report 2018 Data Commentary Like-for-Like electricity for 2018 has decreased over the reporting year (<3%) compared with 2017 reflecting continued variation in occupancy and improvements as a result of refurbished properties across the portfolios. It should also be noted that electricity for all solely owned and managed portfolios is sourced from green tariff providers (See 4.1.5). The Like-for-Like performance on gas has remained relatively constant however, the Opera Quarter experienced a large increase in gas consumption owing to the harsher winter temperatures this year.

Principal contractor companies are also expected to register as a company with the CCS. Compliance with the Code incorporates a number of factors including environmental and social considerations important to the overall goals of corporate responsibility. Only seven of the reported projects were visited in the reporting year, the remainder having been visited and reported in 2017 did not require an additional CCS assessment visit. Compliance with the scheme involves achieving a score of 25/50 and the company sets a more stringent target for its contractors of 30/50. The average score achieved is 35.6/50 with only one scheme scoring below the target score.
