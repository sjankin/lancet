Our services are, however, also provided to globally operating companies, and therefore we need to take human rights into consideration in our business as we are helping our customers to respect them in their world-wide operations, and in their supply chain.

Telecommuting, working at home and flexible working hours are actively used. As a part of our CSR work we also offer learning possibilities for trainees and students. Over the years we have had several students utilizing our virtual brainstorming technology and platform in their Master´s thesis work.
