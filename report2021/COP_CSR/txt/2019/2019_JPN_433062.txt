Courtesy of NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 27 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Discussion with External Directors on Corporate Governance — Enhancing NSG Group’s corporate value — Günter Zorn External Director Chairman of the Board Toshikuni Yamazaki External Director Chairman of the Audit Committee Two of NSG Group’s External Directors — Günter Zorn (Chairman of the Board) and Toshikuni Yamazaki (Chairman of the Audit Committee) — discuss how the Group’s Corporate Governance seeks to enhance corporate value. 28 NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 Corporate Governance and Board of Directors Mr. Zorn, you have been a director for five years and Mr. Yamazaki for four years. As Independent External Directors, firstly, how do you think corporate governance should function and secondly, how do you evaluate the current corporate governance and Board of Directors of NSG Group? Mr. Zorn (Chairman of the Board): When establishing a robust governance system, not only is the role of the Board very important, but crucially, it also creates a system whereby the External Directors can check whether the process is secure. Board meetings should be held in a venue where each Director can express their opinions frankly and engage in an open discussion. Mr. Yamazaki (Chairman of the Audit Committee): Corporate governance is a necessary mechanism for the Board to function properly. As stipulated in Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, the Board owes a fiduciary duty to the Company’s shareholders and I believe that it must oversee management so that the Company can achieve sustainable growth and enhance corporate value over the medium to long term and also improve profitability and capital efficiency. In addition to this, the Board must ensure that governance is functioning and being implemented systematically. Mr. Zorn: Following the acquisition of Pilkington in 2006, our aim was to adopt a sophisticated governance Foundations Supporting the structure inline with a global company, shifting to a committee-based governance structure in 2008. This system may not be suitable for all companies, but it works well for us, which is why I place great value on it. The Board oversees management and the Executive Officers are in charge of business execution. The three committees (the Corporate Value Compensation Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Nomination Committee), of which the majority of members are External Directors, each play their respective roles. At NSG Group, an Independent External Director assumes the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors, which is my role at present. Some people may think that a person from within the Company, who is more familiar with the business should be the Chairman, but for us, because management supervision and business execution are clearly separated, I think it is right that an Independent External Director serves as Chair. Mr. Yamazaki: Executive officers run the Company, the Board oversees it, and the Audit Committee works closely with Internal Audit and auditing firms to conduct audits. In this way the Company′s governance structure can be rated very highly. However, one of our challenges from now on is to facilitate improved corporate value over the medium to long term. One new External Director has just been appointed. Please tell us what you think about the composition of the Board of Directors. Mr. Zorn: Director candidates are selected by the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee is chaired by an Independent External Director, and the only member of that committee hailing from inside the Company is the CEO. For the selection of External Directors, they have been and will be selected only from among those candidates whose qualifications and experts are diverse enough in terms of internationality, gender diversity, global management and academic achievements. As an External Director, Dr. Jörg Raupach Sumiya, brings diversity and a wealth of experience and knowledge as an academic and a business person. As a professor at the Faculty of Business Administration at one of the major universities in Japan, he will strengthen the Company’s governance. At the same time, we recognize that gender diversity within the Board is a continuous challenge for us. NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 29 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Mr. Yamazaki: If the Board alone tried to find External Directors, we would be limited in what we could do, so we decided to make active use of outside consultants to introduce candidates to us. That is why it is hard to imagine somebody who is on friendly terms with the CEO becoming an External Director. Currently, we have External Directors with different backgrounds, which in my view ensures that the composition of the Board is very balanced. The addition of Dr. Raupach Sumiya will further strengthen governance from a different perspective and we expect it will contribute to the Company’s sustainable growth. Appointment/Dismissal and Compensation System of Senior Management How is the CEO appointed? Mr. Zorn: We prefer to appoint the CEO from within the Company, but if necessary, we will also consider external candidates. Candidates are selected by the Nomination Committee which is chaired by an External Director. The criteria for selecting CEOs have been established over the years, and because the right image of the CEO changes depending on the business environment, e.g. consolidation versus growth phase, it is not an absolute standard and should be adjusted as necessary. In addition, the opinions of experienced external consultants are also helpful. The CEO is appointed in a highly objective and transparent process, without being influenced by personal preferences. Mr. Yamazaki: The term of the Directors and Executive Officers of the Company is one year. In other words, each year at appointment time, the suitability of the CEO is put into question and in that respect the role the Nomination Committee plays is a major one, making it a highly transparent system. In terms of the compensation scheme for the senior management, please tell us how you ensure fairness. Mr. Zorn: There are objective standards determined by the Compensation Committee for the basic payment and performance-related compensations of our Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee uses these criteria to make its evaluations. It is chaired by an Independent External Director, and the only member of the committee who is an Internal Director is the CEO. The CEO himself cannot take part in discussions about his own compensation. Performance-related compensation is determined on the basis of short-term results such as yearly performance, and achieving long-term goals such as improved profitability and progress on growth strategies. In addition, the long-term incentive plans, or LTIPs, which are based on long-term results, the Executive Officers are required to invest 50 percent of LTIP proceeds to purchase the Company′s shares. The purpose of this is to further align the interests of Executive Officers and shareholders. We have also introduced Malus and Clawback 30 NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 systems to reduce or cancel this incentive if any inappropriateness is detected at a later stage, even after compensation has been paid. There are various ways of thinking about the level of compensation and incentives, but I think that it should serve as a means to improve motivation. Since we operate globally, it is especially important that senior management′s compensation be at a competitive level for each of the different regions. That is why we have set the medium level as the standard, referring to the standard compensation level in each country. Mr. Yamazaki: Senior management will never be allowed to determine its own compensation. It is a highly transparent compensation system. However, we do not have enough information in our Company about the right levels of competitive compensation to secure necessary personnel, which is why we also use information from external consultants to help us. On the other hand, incentives should be continuously reviewed. As the business environment is always changing, we also need to consider changes in order to be effective in advancing our current strategies. Highly Effective Audit System and Group Governance Please tell us about the features of the Company’s auditing system and the activities you conduct. Foundations Supporting the Mr. Yamazaki: The main feature of our Audit Committee is that everyone who sits on the committee is a partCorporate Value time Independent External Director. There are no full-time members. But the full-time staff members of the Audit Committee Office, which serves as the secretariat, properly relay required information to the Audit Committee. It is a supporting framework so it functions very well. Ultimately, the role of the Audit Committee is to make an audit report confirming, at the AGM (Annual General Meeting of Shareholders), that the Board of Directors is fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities. For that purpose, four members of the Audit Committee attend the required meetings, read through the necessary paperwork, hear from the relevant people, and if required, make site visits, either in Japan or overseas, to carry out their checks. However, the basic premise for the activities of the Audit Committee to carry meaning is a strong governance system. The Audit Committee takes steps to approve the Internal Audit’s audit plan, while the external accounting firms also examine its content. The accounting auditors also appropriately perform audits on management’s internal controls (J-SOX) regarding financial reporting. Because of this, we think the conditions within the Company are suitable for auditing activities to be carried out safely. Mr. Zorn: It is very important that the Chairman of the Audit Committee has financial expertise. Also, because no Internal Directors sit on the Audit Committee, there is the added advantage that they are able to talk openly and directly with people when visiting a site to conduct an audit. The accounting auditors can also have more honest discussions when only talking with External Directors. These advantages are achieved only because the Audit Committee consists solely of Independent External Directors. NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 31 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Company has many subsidiaries and affiliated companies, including overseas subsidiaries, but what is your view on the Group governance? Mr. Yamazaki: Internal Audit, the Audit Committee, and accounting auditors all have their own respective functions. As such, I believe that the global Group governance framework is robust in terms of internal control of subsidiaries, including those overseas. But no matter how strong the governance system is, not all minor wrongdoings can be prevented. Our in this context it should be whistleblowing system allows hidden issues to be properly followed up. We also liaise as much as possible with local accounting auditors in regions where our Group companies are based. Better governance can be realized with checking by both the Audit Committee and local accounting auditors. Mr. Zorn: The Audit Committee holds monthly meetings and conducts interviews with Executive Officers and other key personnel. The Committee checks to see whether there are any discrepancies in the information they receive from the management team and what is actually happening on the ground. That being said, it does not aim to carry out audits on trivial issues — it lets local management handle them. The committee’s focus is on more important things, such as material issues, serious problems, or potentially significant matters. Challenges for the Group and Future Direction In light of the Group’s current situation, what issues do you recognize to be most important at present? Mr. Zorn: There are two important issues to recognize. The first, naturally, is to develop a growth strategy. The Company’s aim is to generate corporate value over the medium to long term to satisfy the expectations of its shareholders, employees, society, and all other stakeholders. To that end, it is necessary to make effective use of the Company’s resources to encourage the creation of new business opportunities. With our efforts over the past several years, the Group has achieved a certain level of financial stability, and we are finally at the stage where we can make investments to secure growth opportunities. The second is risk management. As well as economic risks, we are exposed to environmental risks (such as resource and energy problems and climate change) and geopolitical risks (such as trade wars). The Company’s risk management has been strengthened and is in a good position, but we must always consider what we can and should do going forward. Mr. Yamazaki: The purpose of the Company is to achieve sustainable growth and, based on this, enhancement of corporate value. Until now, financial stability had been a priority. The Company struggled to find and invest in new growth opportunities, which meant the whole Company was in a contracted state. But with the resumption of dividends on common shares, like Mr. Zorn, I now think it is a good time to actively pursue growth investments. An important role of the Board is to ensure that no undue risks are taken, but if anything, I think it may be necessary for the Board to think of ways to assess the risk-taking of the executive side a little more positively. 32 NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 Finally, what are your thoughts on the future direction of the Group? Mr. Zorn: The Company’s management base is very robust. Products, technology, manufacturing, R&D, and governance are all at a high level for a global company. Now the focus is on increasing our sales ratio of ValueAdded products and I believe we need to further accelerate such initiatives. Within the Company, a manufacturing culture where the customer comes first has taken root, but I think it is necessary to foster a culture that will further develop the market even more aggressively. We command a strong market position in providing Value-Added products in the fields of architectural, automotive and technical glass, but this is not enough if we consider future growth. I believe we need to actively branch out into new fields, beyond the traditional business fields. Setting the Company in this direction is probably the most important role for the Board up ahead, a good example is the recent establishment of the Company′s Business Innovation Center (BIC). Mr. Yamazaki: We are now at a turning point, from defensive to proactive. But in order to grow aggressively, the mindset of not only the senior management, but also of the employees is important. From now on, we need to think about things positively, that is, we have to become a Company where employees are more proactive in coming up with ideas, where they look for better ways of doing things. Creating such an atmosphere and making the Group even more vibrant than before will be a major management task up ahead.

Corporate Value Lathom New Canister NSG Group Integrated Report 2019 53 AIR EMISSIONS The main emissions from a flat glass furnace come from the combustion of fuel and the decomposition of the carbonate and sulphate raw materials. The raw materials are melted at a very high temperature so the process is extremely energy-intensive. Emissions to air Novel pollution control plant installed at The most significant pollutants from a glass furnace are: Ottawa nitrogen oxides formed from the nitrogen and oxygen in the The abatement plant just installed on NSG Group’s OT1 air at high temperature; sulfur oxides from the refining agent furnace in Ottawa, USA, is a CCF unit purchased from McGill (and from oil fuel if that is used); and particulate matter AirClean.

Alkali, in this case lime, Carbon dioxide comes from both the decomposition of is added to the waste gas and the resultant reaction products carbonates and from combusted fuels. and primary particles are collected by the filter. The novelty We are tackling pollutant air emissions with a range of of the process is that the fibers of the filters are coated with primary and secondary abatement techniques. Primary a metal catalyst so when the gases pass through the methods, such as special burners or carefully-chosen raw structure nitrogen oxides are also removed. It is expected materials, including more cullet (recycled glass), reduce that CCF technology will become the standard for new pollutant formation and can also improve the thermal furnace pollution control plant throughout NSG group. performance of the furnaces. Secondary abatement removes the pollutants from the furnace waste gases before they are emitted through the chimney. Until recently, the furnace emission pollution control plants in operation around NSG Group have all been based on standard technology. This removes the pollutants from the waste gases in three stages: alkali is injected into a scrubber to remove acid gases, the resultant reaction products and particulate emissions are then collected in an electrostatic precipitator, and finally nitrogen oxide is removed using ammonia injected into a selective catalytic reduction unit. However, the latest pollution control plant built by NSG Group uses a novel technique called a catalytic ceramic filter, or CCF.

Recycled glass to improve efficiency and reduce emissions Glass for recycling is a valuable resource. Wherever quality allows, we recycle any glass off-cuts or cullet within our own glass melting lines. Glass from our downstream operations and from our customers represents a potentially useful resource to us. We gain a double benefit from the use of such cullet: its use to make glass reduces the requirement for raw materials and avoids disposing of what would otherwise be a waste material and closes the recycling loop. Ten percent cullet use saves three percent furnace energy and leads to reductions in CO2 emissions. One of our sites has manufactured glass using only cullet. Cullet return projects are ongoing to try to minimize the need for virgin raw materials. Landfill is the least favored disposal option. If glass is produced that cannot be remelted on-site, it is sent, where practicable, for external recycling.

Corporate Value Automotive glazing components In Automotive, all supplied glazing parts and their materials are registered in the global IMDS (International Material Data System) to ensure we have complete visibility of components confirm material compliance and to identify opportunities for recycling. This data is shared with our Automotive customers to support their own material compliance and recycling efforts. Water management In glass-making, water is used for cooling, and most of our plants operate with closed loop systems and so only require top up. Water is also used for washing glass in plants but there the need is for very high purity, so water is treated and Timber then reused. We seek to minimize our water consumption by In Europe, much of our glass is transported on steel stillages working with suppliers to recycle water and to install in cycles with the customers without packaging and advanced water treatment facilities. This not only reduces utilizing specialist ‘Floatliner’ vehicles for the large raw glass the consumption of water itself but also the chemicals used plates.
