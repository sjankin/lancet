It is a considerable challenge to engage all employees and stakeholders throughout the value chain across businesses in several countries around the world, while ensuring that everyone understands and adheres to the same principles. Policies and guidelines Mitr Phol Group has created good governance policies and guidelines for all board directors, executives, and employees across the group. These policies and guidelines are reviewed regularly to ensure that they are up to date and relevant to the working environment. Key policies include: Good Governance, Anti-Fraud and Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Whistleblowing, and the Mitr Phol Code of Conduct. In 2018, the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) policies were introduced to protect Mitr Phol Group from falling victim to money laundering and financing terrorism activities. In addition, the Mitr Phol Suppliers Code of Conduct was also introduced to guide company suppliers on best practices. 42 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group Mitr Phol Code of Conduct (102-16) The Mitr Phol corporate culture encourages all employees to conduct themselves appropriately and ethically, comply with local laws and regulations, and maintain a sense of responsibility for society. Because Mitr Phol believes its employees are integral to driving the company’s growth, the Mitr Phol Code of Conduct contains regulations, measures, and guidelines that all executives and employees must adhere to in order to ensure that they carry out their duties ethically. The Code of Conduct contains guidelines on anti-fraud and anti-corruption practices, conflicts of interest, receiving and giving gifts, stakeholder accountability, and corporate social responsibility. The Mitr Phol Code of Conduct is reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains relevant to the changing environments of the business world and society. In 2018, the Mitr Phol Suppliers Code of Conduct was introduced. The guidelines were adopted to ensure that all suppliers working with Mitr Phol Group followed business practices that were in line with Mitr Phol Group’s policies and corporate culture. Suppliers are important stakeholders who are crucial to the company’s sustainable growth. Mitr Phol Group is committed to equal, transparent and fair treatment of all suppliers, and has pushed for supplier governance. Communicating and creating awareness about the Code of Conduct is carried out through several types of activities and communication channels, such as the Mitr Sampan journals, signage boards on Mitr Phol Group premises, e-mails, intranet posts, and training. The Board of Directors, executives, employees and suppliers have all signed the Code of Conduct as a pledge to follow its guidelines. The Board, executives and employees are required to review the Code of Conduct on an annual basis to refresh their understanding. In 2018, the “Mitr Phol Code of Conduct and Corporate Culture” training was provided for executives, employees, and suppliers to create awareness about topics including: the Code of Conduct policies, guidelines and grievance mechanism; the importance, principles, and control measures of anti-corruption practices; and procurement regulations. The training also provided a platform for executives, employees and suppliers to express their opinions through a suggestion box, nicknamed the “Black Box”. A total of 30 training sessions were held throughout areas where Mitr Phol Group operates.

Mitr Phol Group’s key governance plans are as follows: 1. Improving communication to the Board of Directors, executives, employees, and suppliers by having them sign the Mitr Phol Code of Conduct on an annual basis to promote better understanding and accessibility. 2. Increasing attendance rates of the “Mitr Phol Group Code of Conduct and Corporate Culture” training in 2019 by 15% from previous year. 3. Improving the grievance mechanism and channels to make them more efficient. Incorporating suggestions and feedback from 2018 to help improve the mechanism. 4. Creating online media about good corporate governance for employees and running an e-learning course. Mitr Phol Group has established a new team that is directly responsible for ensuring governance. The function’s task is to implement and cascade policies from the Board of Directors and executives throughout the organization. The team is also responsible for ensuring awareness and understanding about good governance, promoting a corporate culture of Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance, and supporting such practices throughout the business value chain. Mitr Phol Group’s Risk Management (102-30)(102-31) Mitr Phol Group places great importance on risk management in the economic, social and environmental realms. In accordance with good corporate governance practices, the Risk Management Committee assesses the company’s risk policy on a yearly basis in order to add value and enhance security for the utmost benefit of all stakeholder groups. The risk management policy is run in accordance with the company’s strategic, operational and project plans, as well as relevant laws and regulations governing Mitr Phol Group’s business operations. Reviews of the Risk Management policies are conducted by the Risk Management Committee on an annual basis. Mitr Phol Group has adopted COSO Enterprise Risk Management Integrated Framework throughout the enterprise. The framework is used for objective setting, event identification, risk assessment, risk response, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. An annual report is compiled to assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to the company to ensure that they are up to date and relevant to the current business landscape. Mitr Phol Group has appointed a Risk Management Committee, which assigns important functions such as policy, guidelines and procedures, oversight and review of practices to improve risk management. The Risk Management function ensures that risk management policies and other recommendations from the Board are implemented throughout the organization. The function is also responsible for reviewing, monitoring, and reporting risk management performance on a regular basis. The head of risk management oversees the function and reports directly to the Sustainable Development department. 49 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Risk Management principles are as follows: 1. Maintaining a balance between risks and returns to ensure business targets are achieved, stakeholders’ expectations are met, and optimal benefits are generated for shareholders, all while staying within an acceptable level of risk to the organization. 2. Business strategies must be aligned with the level of risk deemed acceptable by the Board of Directors. 3. Risk management is an important part of the corporate culture that must be carried out with efficiency and effectiveness by all management and employees. Communication and appropriate activities to promote understanding and awareness of risk management as an integral part of business operations must be performed on a continual basis. Employees are encouraged to report any risks they encounter to their supervisors or executives through appropriate channels. Examples of mechanisms include: the corporate risk management manual, annual risk reviews, risk management training for employees, and clear risk reporting processes. 4. Risks that pose a threat to Mitr Phol Group’s ability to achieve business targets and strategies must be managed in a timely manner and continuously. 4.1 Risk identification must be thorough and timely. 4.2 Reviews of the likelihood and impact of risks must be carried out. 4.3 Risks must be maintained at a level deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors and management. Risks and returns must also be reviewed concurrently. 4.4 Regular monitoring and reporting on risk management must be conducted to ensure that actions are carried out in an efficient and timely manner. Mitr Phol Group's Risk Corporate Financial Legal and Risks Risks from Risk Regulatory Operations Compliance Risk 50 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group In 2018, Mitr Phol Group’s key risks were as follows: 1. Corporate Risks 1.1 Corporate risks • Risks posed by climate change and the natural environment Climate change and threats originating in the natural environment such as droughts and floods are key risks that affect sugarcane yields both in terms of volume and quality. Climate change is also a key factor in water resource management in production processes and can have an effect on storage and transportation. Mitr Phol Group reviews climate-related risk factors and trends on an annual basis to ensure proper and efficient management, and that short and long-term solutions are in place. As a result, the fluctuation of cane volume this year was considered acceptable. Key preventive measures and solutions to assist cane farmers include: 1) Promoting knowledge and understanding about water resource management in cane farming, so cane farmers can be self-reliant. 2) Collaboration with the government sector, communities, and farmers to provide water sources and maintain small and large irrigation systems, ensuring adequate water for farming and consumption, both in the short and long terms. 3) Using the Mitr Phol ModernFarm project to incorporate innovative concepts and technology to improve cane farming management, and enhance the cane planting, harvesting and transporting processes for farmers. The project has helped to increase productivity and cane quality, and deal with shortages of manual labor. 4) Selecting cane species appropriate for the topography and climate of each region. Mitr Phol’s research center develops cane species as well as agricultural inputs with an aim to increase productivity per rai, resulting in economic benefits for cane farmers. 5) Regular communication with farmers in order to create awareness of and preparedness in dealing with droughts throughout the farming and harvesting seasons, as appropriate. In addition, Mitr Phol Group uses contract farming to mitigate risks of cane volume fluctuations and regularly communicates with farmers from the beginning of the farming season through to harvesting, to ensure mutual understanding of the process. Other related businesses also have plans in place to mitigate risk from cane volume fluctuations by contracting additional cane from other external sources. Evaluations of water resources required for production processes are also carried out for efficient water management. All sugar mills have adequate water supply for usage throughout the year. However, to ensure business continuity, Mitr Phol Group also has contingency plans in case of extreme droughts. • Risks from international investments and operations Mitr Phol Group has had a foreign investment policy for more than 20 years, in markets including in China, Laos, and Australia. Foreign investments diversify risks and revenue sources, thereby minimizing the impact of global economic volatility. In 2018, Mitr Phol Group expanded its foreign investment portfolio to include a refined sugar business in Indonesia, building on the group’s existing businesses and increasing its competitive edge in the global arena. As well as return on investment assessments, Mitr Phol Group also considers several aspects of risks, for example trade promotion policies, local laws and regulations, tax systems, and currency exchange fluctuations. Using careful and thorough analyses and focusing on its area of expertise, highly experienced executives from Thailand who are experts in their fields have also been relocated to Indonesia to oversee the business operations. Regular executive meetings are held to ensure smooth operations. 51 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 1.2 Risks from operations • Risks concerning product quality and safety Product safety is a top priority at Mitr Phol Group. We ensure that all of our products comply with international standards, and are hygienic and free from contaminants that may pose a threat to the health and safety of our customers. Our products must also serve the needs of consumers. Compromised product quality can adversely affect our customers’ health and lead to dissatisfaction, complaints, product withdrawals, lawsuits, or boycotts. All such incidents can impact trust, reputation, and image, and may lead to loss of revenue and market share. In 2018, Mitr Phol Group announced a new policy with an aim of encouraging cane farmers to minimize the usage of agricultural chemicals, especially ones that are harmful to human health, such as Paraquat dichloride. All suppliers were also informed that Mitr Phol Group does not use genetically modified cane. In the wood substitute business, high-quality products are made in the strictest compliance with formaldehyde emissions standards as consumer health is of the utmost importance to the company. A dedicated team is in charge of ensuring quality standards, analysis and planning for all business units. Mitr Phol Group has received several international certifications, including the Bonsucro Production Standard, the Forest Stewardship CouncilTM Forest Management (FSCTM FM), the Forest Stewardship CouncilTM Chain of Custody (FSCTM CoC), TISI, ISO, GMP, HACCP, FSSC and HALAL. Advanced technology is applied for product development and to improve production processes and machinery efficiency, helping to enhance quality control and product safety, build consumer trust, and raise global competitiveness. • Environmental risk Mitr Phol Group has continually committed to improving environmental management systems. In addition to complying with all relevant rules, regulations, laws, and commitments, Mitr Phol Group has also taken precautions to minimize environmental impact on employees, communities and other stakeholders throughout the value chain, from cane farming, juicing, and production, through to storage and transportation. Several preventive measures have been put in place. To mitigate any possible environmental impact, regular audits are performed by internal departments within Mitr Phol Group, central and regional government offices, and independent external agencies. Knowledge sharing helps to improve farmers’ understanding of the importance of efficient water usage and the harm of cane burning. Environmental management standards are continually improved. Through ISO 14001, the company carries out machinery maintenance and the installation of equipment to help minimize the environmental impact. For example, planting rows of pine trees, installing netting, and spraying water help to reduce dust dispersion caused by byproducts of the production process. A tri-partite committee comprised of representatives from the factories, government agencies and local communities create recommendations on how to improve environmental management systems sustainably. Mitr Phol Group also promotes community relations through several activities to ensure a correct understanding and create healthy relationships between the factories, the government sector, and local communities. Opinions and suggestions from villagers are also taken into account in order to improve the group’s environmental management systems. 52 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group 1.3 Financial risk • Risks from commodity price fluctuations Volatile sugar prices in the global market can have an impact on operational costs and can result in revenues not meeting expectations. Other commodity prices can also impact Mitr Phol Group’s businesses, for example oil prices have an effect on ethanol sales and transportation costs both domestically and internationally. Mitr Phol Group closely monitors and analyzes trends as well as possible impacts of relevant commodity prices. Discussions in executive meetings take place on a monthly basis in order to respond to any potential situations by adjusting strategies, plans, and policies in a timely manner. A special task force was created to directly oversee and manage risks posed by fluctuating sugar prices. In addition, efforts are made to use technology and innovation to reduce costs and increase productivity in order to improve production, storage and transportation management and efficiency. Mitr Phol Group also has policies to manage risks from global sugar price volatility by arranging advance contracts, managing the sales mix and product prices, and negotiating clear contracts with transportation providers. Such measures allow Mitr Phol Group to balance revenue and costs at an acceptable and manageable level despite volatility risks of sugar and other commodity prices on the global market. • Risks from currency exchange rates Currency exchange rates are volatile and can change rapidly, causing a direct impact on Mitr Phol Group’s business operations, as the group’s main source of revenue comes from sugar exports, the wood substitute business, and other overseas operations. The Financial Risk Management Committee is responsible for establishing the financial and currency exchange risk management framework and ensuring appropriate actions are taken as necessary. Committee meetings are held on a monthly basis to stay abreast of any current or potential situation. A task force has been set up to directly oversee financial risk management, monitor global economic trends, and analyze factors that may impact currency exchange rates. Appropriate financial tools are used for certain situations, for example forward contracts, options contracts, and natural currency hedging. RISK B 53 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 • Risks from non-performing loans to cane farmers Mitr Phol Group has a policy to provide financial funding to farmers through cane contracts, which are also considered a risk management method to ensure raw materials security. The group provides important items for farming such as cane species, fertilizers, machinery and other equipment. In addition, farmers are provided with access to low-interest loans for building irrigation systems, and purchasing machinery and equipment, as well as for operating cash flow during cane farming seasons. When farmers deliver cut canes to the factory, their revenue is deducted for loan repayments. Risks related to this system stem from farmers’ failure to supply cane or meet the repayment amount, which can be due to a variety of reasons such as natural disasters, diseases, or choosing to sell their cane elsewhere. In order to effectively manage such risks, Mitr Phol Group uses an integrated technology system to maintain a database of cane farmers, their historical productivity rates, their loan information, collateral, repayments, cane delivery, and receipt of revenue. The database helps to identify farmers and assess their ability to make loan repayments. Processes for establishing loan limits and assigning credit ratings to farmers are clearly defined. Support is also provided to educate farmers about leasing machinery and equipment, borrowing cane species, and securing fertilizers, in order to maximize productivity. A GPS system is also used to collect information about geographical data, yields, and farm management, and help to increase planning efficiency. A special committee has been established to oversee loan approvals, and to monitor and analyze the loans, thus ensuring that farmers’ debts are at an acceptable and manageable level. 1.4 Legal and regulatory compliance risk Failure to comply with the laws, rules, and regulations relevant to Mitr Phol Group’s business operations may result in a negative impact to its business and reputation. To ensure compliance, Mitr Phol Group has established a task force that is directly responsible for ensuring compliance with current laws, supporting and coordinating with representatives from all business units, and monitoring overall compliance performance. The company has also established the Mitr Phol Group Compliance Guideline. As Mitr Phol Group’s businesses span across several industries, representatives from each business unit are responsible for compiling checklists to ensure full compliance and prevent any unintentional breaches of the laws, rules, and regulations. Clear and official roles and responsibilities are defined for each business unit. 54 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group 2. Emerging Risks 2.1 Risks relating to the restructuring of the Thai sugar industry Thailand is currently undergoing a systemic restructuring of the cane and sugar industries to become more aligned with international standards and obligations, and to become more fair toward consumers and stakeholders. The restructuring, which is being led by the Ministry of Industry, began in 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2021. As such, operators must adapt their business strategies accordingly in order to maintain a competitive edge. On January 15, 2018, the Royal Gazette – the government’s official publication – announced that revisions will be made to the laws to be compatible with the overhaul of the cane and sugar industries (2018, pages 20-21). A crucial part of the changes is the cancellation of fixed sugar prices for domestic consumption and the floating of domestic sugar prices according to market mechanisms. This results in lower sales prices at sugar mills that are in line with global market prices and expectations. Mitr Phol Group is monitoring the situation closely. To enable Mitr Phol Group to handle future changes, the group will continue to monitor the situation, perform feasibility assessments, and work closely with other entities including Thai Sugar Millers Company Limited, the Office of the Cane and Sugar Board, and representatives from farmers associations. The floating of domestic sugar prices when global prices are low could lead to situations in which cane farmers switch to growing other crops instead. The Thai government plans to utilize a special cane and sugar fund designated as an assistance mechanism if such incidents were to occur. Mitr Phol Group pays great attention to the floating of sugar prices and fully realizes the risk of fluctuations in cane volume received for juicing. As a result, Mitr Phol Group will continue to monitor the situation in order to make preparations, while keeping up constant communication with cane farmers. 2.2 Risks from digital disruption Technology has influenced the way businesses operate, the way we live, and consumer behavior. As a result of the growth of technology, organizations must be adaptable and agile in order to effectively cater to the needs of consumers. Efficient and smart management, coupled with innovation, help organizations to enhance their competitive edge and bring about sustainable growth. Mitr Phol Group closely monitors technological changes and advancements in an effort to understand, analyze, and benefit from opportunities that will arise. The goal is to apply appropriate technology in Mitr Phol Group’s value chain in order to improve work processes, production, storage, and delivery. Technology can also help to improve sales channels, payment methods, and communication. Moreover, we also establish the digital transformation unit to drive digital strategies into a new way of operations for enhancing efficiency, convenience, speed, cost effectiveness, environmental protection, and safety. Benefits brought about by technology include initiating the farmer cards with commercial banks, direct access to consumers via social media platforms, new sales channels from e-commerce, and artificial intelligence and robots now deployed in the sugar packing processes. Technology also brings about opportunities to reach untapped markets and create new business models. 55 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Employees: “Caring for Employees, United for Success” Employee Synchronized Performance Employee Information Employee and Evaluation Care Organizational Development 56 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group Mitr Phol Group places great importance on human resources, as the effective management of our workers is integral to our organization’s success.

In 2018, the group compiled the Life Saving Rules (403-7)(403-9) for employees, contractors, and all relevant persons. The Life Saving Rules are standards by which they must live to promote occupational safety. It is one of several measures to promote awareness and prevent accidents and incidents that may lead to loss of life or assets. The Life Saving Rules were first implemented in the sugar, energy, and wood substitute businesses, and will be expanded to cover all of Mitr Phol Group’s businesses next year. The rules can be applied, modified and improved to fit the work conditions of each business unit. Must Must not 1. Must 2.

Mitr Phol Group places great importance on effective environmental management adhering to global standards, sharing knowledge and instilling sound environmental management practices organization-wide that cover all manufacturing processes and products, raw materials, water resources, packaging, pollution and waste. Sufficient funds are also allocated for effective environmental management and impact mitigation. To ensure that our business operations are environmentally friendly, Mitr Phol Group has implemented the Safety, Occupational Health and Environmental Management policies as key drivers of the group’s environmental management efforts to deliver the highest efficiency. ISO 14001:2015 international environmental management standards as well as relevant regulatory requirements form the framework within which we operate our business. Sustainable use of resources Raw materials management Mitr Phol Group’s continued business growth means higher demand for raw materials, both renewable and non-renewable. We place great importance on sustainable management of natural resources, with plans and controls devised in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to ensure the sustainable sourcing of raw materials for production processes. ISO 14001:2015 standards are implemented throughout the value chain, from the sourcing of raw materials to energy and ecosystem management. The effective management of raw materials also brings benefits in terms of cost savings and the optimal usage of resources. Mitr Phol’s main raw materials are categorized into two groups: renewable materials, namely cane and rubber wood; and non-renewable materials, including fuel and chemicals. Raw materials also include packaging products. In 2018, the usage of raw materials was as follows: Volume of raw materials used in Mitr Phol Group’s production processes (301-1) Main raw materials Renewable materials 21.50 18.00 18.80 27.39 (Million tonnes) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Non-renewable materials 57,496.50 9,957.40 8,511.10 216,525 (Million tonnes) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Recycled materials 5,484.40 6,004.30 5,887.60 40,992 (Tonnes) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Remarks: * 2015-2016 data covers the period from 1 January – 31 December of each year ** 2017 data covers the period of 1 November 2016 – 31 October 2017 *** 2018 data covers the period of 1 November 2017 – 31 October 2018 81 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Water resource management Water is a crucial natural resource for farming and production. Due to climate change resulting in extreme weather patterns including severe drought, Mitr Phol Group has thoroughly assessed risks associated with water shortages in all locations where the company operates its businesses, to ensure that proper water management processes are in place and adequate a supply is available. This is due to the fact that Mitr Phol Group’s operations throughout the supply chain require a high volume of water. Also, this helps to ensure that our operations’ demand for water will not impact the environment and surrounding communities. Mitr Phol Group works closely with local authorities responsible for water resource management such as the Royal Irrigation Department, the Department of Groundwater Resources, and the Provincial Waterworks Authority. Continuous discussion and planning through tri-partite committees takes place between Mitr Phol Group and local authorities so as to minimize the impact on stakeholders, assure them that the Company’s usage of water resources complies with local laws and regulations, and assert that our operations will not cause water shortages for any surrounding communities. Mitr Phol Group has devised policies regarding the usage of water resources, focusing on reducing and reusing water where possible through the 3R initiative. The goal is to ensure maximum efficiency and to minimize water losses both in our office buildings and our factories. Mitr Phol Group has set a target to reduce water usage by 10 percent from 2017, with continuous monitoring of the performance annually. Our efforts according to the 3R initiative for water usage reduction are as follows: project has successfully lowered the usage of water by 8,380 cubic meters per year 1.

With this in mind, we incorporated added value into our sugar business by expanding into the alternative energy industry via the production of biomass, ethanol, and other types of renewable energy. In addition to using alternative energy within our own business operations, we have also begun to cater to energy demand in Thailand by selling excess biomass electricity to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand and the Provincial Electricity Authority. Within our own factories, we have devised an energy management plan in line with legal requirements, and implemented the ISO50001 standards. Representatives from all departments are appointed to join the Energy Conservation Working Group, which is tasked with drafting an energy management plan, setting objectives and targets, promoting energy efficiency awareness and engagement among executives, employees, and contractors, and compiling reports for high-level executives about Mitr Phol Group’s energy management efforts. As a result of having such measures in place, energy efficiency has significantly improved at all operation sites, while operating costs have also fallen. Mitr Phol Group’s energy usage in 2018 is as follows: 2018 Target: Reduction in electric power consumption Mitr Phol Group’s Energy Consumption (302-1) per revenue by 5% compared with 2017 Energy types 714.30 767.12 692.58 109.01 Total non-renewable energy (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Total renewable energy 73,163.34 72,922.45 56,407.01 64,681.49 (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** 623.79 662.27 611.77 5,605.44 Electricity 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Non-renewable energy purchased NR NR NR NR Exhaust Steam (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** NR NR NR NR Live Steam 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** NR NR NR NR Electricity 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Non-renewable NR NR NR NR energy sold Exhaust Steam (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** NR NR NR NR Live Steam 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** 73,877.64 73,689.57 57,099.59 70,395.99 Total Energy Consumption (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** NA NA NA 8,756.06 Total Energy Expenses (Million Baht) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Remarks : NA = Not Available, no date was collected * 2015-2016 data covers the period from 1 January – 31 December of each year NR = Not Relevant ** 2017 data covers the period of 1 November 2016 – 31 October 2017 Net Calorific Values (NCV): 1 kWh = 3.6 MJ and 1 tonne = 2,676 MJ *** 2018 data covers the period of 1 November 2017 – 31 October 2018 84 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group Mitr Phol Group’s external energy usage data (302-1) Energy types Volume of energy usage for raw NA NA NA 1,138.55 material transportation by third-party organizations (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Volume of energy usage for product NA NA NA 2,347.58 transportation by third-party organizations (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Volume of energy usage for air travel NA NA NA 53.48 (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Volume of energy usage for ground NA NA NA 34.85 transportation for employees (Million MJ) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Remarks: NA = Not Available, no data was collected Net Calorific Values (NCV): diesel oil (B5) 1 Litre = 35.778 MJ (DEDE) Gasohol 91:1 Litre = 30.462 MJ domestic travel: 1 person/ 1 kilometer = 2.4206 MJ (TGO) * 2015-2016 data covers the period from 1 January – 31 December of each year ** 2017 data covers the period of 1 November 2016 – 31 October 2017 *** 2018 data covers the period of 1 November 2017 – 31 October 2018 Energy Intensity (302-3) Energy types Energy intensity consumed within NA NA NA 961,260 organization (MJ / Million Baht) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Energy intensity consumed outside NA NA NA 48,809 organization (MJ / Million Baht) 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Remarks: NA = Not Available, no data was collected Energy consumed within the organization = electricity, steam, liquid petroleum gas, biomass gas, diesel, benzene, solar energy Energy consumed outside the organization = diesel, benzene * 2015-16 data covers the period from 1 January – 31 December of each year ** 2017 data covers the period of 1 November 2016 – 31 October 2017 *** 2018 data covers the period of 1 November 2017 – 31 October 2018 From the 2018 data, energy from renewable sources made up 91.88 percent of Mitr Phol Group’s total energy usage. 85 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Packaging management Food packaging is an important issue of today and a common part of everyday life. Mitr Phol Group ensures that the right type of packaging is used for each product, with safety and convenience being of the utmost importance. Transportation services of syrup and sugar in tank cars have helped to reduce packaging usage, as industrial customers are able to directly connect the pipe from the tank car to their production process machinery, helping to enhance convenience and speed. Tank Car Containing Syrup Tank Car Containing Sugar In 2018, 220,000 tonnes of syrup and 60,000 tonnes of sugar were delivered to industrial customers, helping to reduce plastic packaging by 184.5 million bags. In addition, we pay great attention to the materials used to make packaging, selecting more environmentally friendly plastic, paper, and ink options for our packaging. 86 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group Environmental protection For efficient environmental management and protection, Mitr Phol Group implements the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) in our operations: Wastewater Management (303-2) Mitr Phol Group ensures that wastewater from our operations is properly treated according to local laws and regulations. Wastewater from sugar production is treated using two systems: 1. Biological Treatment 2. Constructed Wetland At the Mitr Phu Wiang Sugar Mill, we also use the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) for enhanced efficiency of wastewater treatment. The biogas produced from the closed system is then utilized as fuel for burning carbon coal, which is then used in place of resin for color absorption. This helps to reduce the usage of salt water for resin cleaning in the production process. All wastewater from the sugar production process enters the above mentioned wastewater treatment systems. Once the treated water meets the legal quality requirements, it is then reused in appropriate activities within the plant, for example for farm irrigation, watering plants, and cleaning around the factory.

Other non-hazardous waste is managed in different ways according to their characteristics, such as for energy production or for reuse. 89 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Air pollution management Mitr Phol Group’s business operations that may have an impact on air quality include emissions and dust pollution from conveyor belts, piles of bagasse and wood chips, or the production processes in general. Mitr Phol Group’s key policies for air pollution management include: 1.1 Air pollution management measures using appropriate fuels to reduce NOx and SOx levels and ensure complete combustion: • Installing wet scrubbers to capture dust and ash from burning • Installing electrostatic precipitators to control boilers’ burning levels to be within necessary limits, ensure complete combustion, and reduce the emissions of NOx and SOx 1.2 Dust control measures from conveyor belts that transport bagasse into the biomass power plants: • Inspecting dust leakage points • Installing covers for the conveyor belts • Using mobile belts to move the bagasse 1.3 Dust control measures for piles of bagasse stored for biomass production: • Training employees on bagasse dust control • Planting pine trees to help reduce dust dispersion • Installing wind breaks to change wind directions and wind socks to monitor the wind • Using water cannons to spray water and fog in strategic locations including and dust nets 1.4 Dust control measures from the wood substitute materials production process: • Installing a dryer system and cyclone air filters • Installing electrostatic precipitators 1.5 Dust control measures from travel and raw material transportation: • Spraying water in operational areas and along traffic routes 90 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group In 2018, air quality results captured from chimneys at Mitr Phol Group’s factories were as follows: Air quality from Mitr Phol Group factory chimneys (305-7) Air quality by year Air quality Benchmarks 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** NOx (ppm) ≤ 200 50.42 61.79 55.08 70.39 SOx (ppm) 60 1.42 3.37 5.30 4.04 CO (ppm) 690 279.10 254.79 188.39 215.42 TSP (mg / m3) New power plants 120 47.30 58.96 62.06 32.79 TSP (mg / m3) Old power plants 320 61.50 17.40 1.10 11.80 Cd (ppm) 0.03 0.005 0.005 0.005 0.005 Remarks: NOx, SOx, CO and TSP benchmarks per the Ministry of Industry’s announcement on contaminants in emissions from power plants producing or selling electricity B.E. 2547 Old and new power plants according to the definitions from the Ministry of Industry’s announcement on contaminants in emissions from power plants producing or selling electricity B.E. 2547 Cadmium (Cd) benchmark per the European Emission Standards in the Environment Impact Assessment report of the 16MW biomass power plant at Mae Sod Clean Energy Company Limited, 2010 * 2015-2016 data covers the period from 1 January – 31 December of each year ** 2017 data covers the period of 1 November 2016 – 31 October 2017 *** 2018 data covers the period of 1 November 2017 – 31 October 2018 91 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Cane transportation and traffic management Traffic congestion caused by transporting sugarcane from fields to the sugar mills is a challenge in our industry. Cane harvesting season runs from November to April, during which time farmers must transport their sugarcane to the mills to be juiced as soon as possible. Failure to do so in a timely manner can result in continually decreasing sweetness, which can in turn have an effect on cane prices. Cane transportation and traffic management cover several aspects including ensuring trucks do not exceed load limits, minimizing cane falling off trucks and littering the streets, lowering dust pollution from trucks, and controlling traffic congestion around sugar mills. Mitr Phol Group has implemented the following measures and policies to lessen the impact of cane transportation: Designating responsible persons and communication channels to provide assistance. Providing contracts for trucks with clearly-defined terms and conditions. Failure to adhere to these terms and conditions may result in withholding security deposits and terminating agreements. Putting up signage and setting up a call center to facilitate the cleaning up of public roads where sugarcane has fallen. Sub-stations have also been established for sugarcane farmers with smaller volumes in order to reduce transportation. Promoting the correct methods of transporting sugarcane. Controlling the height of the load on trucks to ensure the tops do not exceed 4.2 meters from the ground. Promote using straps to tie down the sugarcane and hold the loads in place. Promoting fresh cane cutting Issues in the upstream sugar business involve a lack of local manual labor, which results in delays in delivering cut cane to sugar mills. To address this problem, farmers turn to cane burning to reduce labor costs and make harvesting faster and more convenient. However, the practice of cane burning causes significant environmental damage as it produces carbon dioxide and releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which in turn contribute to climate change. In addition to environmental problems, cane burning also compromises the quality and efficiency of sugar production. Mitr Phol Group actively encourages sugarcane farmers to reduce burning and promotes fresh cut cane as a way for them to increase their income. The group has worked with the government sector on several measures: Knowledge Providing Purchase price Promoting the Setting cane field Providing fire transfer about financial deductions for use of machine as firebreaks engines to local cane farming incentives for burnt cane harvesters communities freshcane 92 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group The above measures have proven effective in reducing cane burning, thereby helping to preserve natural ecosystems while also leading to a decrease in operational costs from fertilizers and pesticides. Mitr Phol Group also provides funding in research and development efforts to ensure optimum farming efficiency, from soil preparation and cane planting, to the improvement of cane species and harvesting. The goal is to yield high-quality, clean, and safe raw materials for sugar production. In addition, Mitr Phol Group uses a pricing strategy to discourage farmers from burning cane. Prices for each cane type are as follows: Long fresh Fresh cut Long top Burnt canes Long top Burnt canes with cut canes canes with fresh canes burnt canes impurities (sugarcane impurities with impurities tops/leaves/ roots/dirt/sand) Deduction of Deduction of Deduction of Deduction of Deduction of Deduction of 20 20 40 20 40 40 baht / tonnes baht / tonnes baht / tonnes baht / tonnes baht / tonnes baht / tonnes In 2018, fresh cane cutting made up 41.72% of the total volume of cane within Mitr Phol Group’s operations, which is more than the national average of 33.72%.

If not properly controlled and prevented, noise pollution especially from production processes can have a significant impact on the health and safety of sugar mill employees and the surrounding communities. Mitr Phol Group strives to minimize the impact of noise pollution and uses a systematic approach in managing noise pollution at the source and throughout the production line. After machinery maintenance, production line flushing is performed by using high-pressure steam. The following measures have been implemented to minimize noise pollution throughout the production line. • Preventative measures at the source: using efficient machinery and ensuring proper maintenance and care of all machinery and equipment. • Preventative measures on the production line: using factory safety lines, soundproofing, installing noise-reduction equipment, displaying noise level and control zoning signage, planting trees to absorb noise, and conducting regular checks in problem areas to ensure noise levels do not exceed standards. The checks are performed during operation on the premise as well as in surrounding communities on an annual and bi-annual basis.

In order to bring about significant change, all sectors must be involved. Mitr Phol Group’s efforts to lower the impact of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from our business operations are as follows: 1. Direct GHG emissions reduction (scope 1) by 3,525.79 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. A key program that had a significant contribution to GHG emissions reduction was the decrease of the humidity level of bagasse used as fuels for boilers, which resulted in a smaller volume of bagasse required. 2. Indirect GHG emissions reduction (scope 2) by 927.35 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. Key programs included switching to LED light bulbs, increasing efficiency in cane juice boiling, and switching off pumps and motors that were not currently in use, such as water pumps and condenser water pumps. Mitr Phol Group is committed to promoting the most efficient and optimal use of natural resources, reducing GHG emissions across all business units, increasing production efficiency, and taking part in the Carbon Reduction Label program, which is considered one of the most effective market mechanisms to drive industrial producers and service providers toward becoming a low-carbon business. Key performances throughout the past year included: 1 Promoting a low-carbon society Mitr Phol Group promoted a low-carbon society by joining other leading organizations in the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction Program (T-VER). Mitr Phol Group is one of the largest carbon credit sellers in Thailand, with 489,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent certified, from carbon emissions reductions at Mitr Phol Bio-Power Plant in Suphan Buri Province. Plans are in place to increase this volume. Since joining T-VER, Mitr Phol Group has sold carbon credits to 26 organizations, with a total of volume of 190,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, or around 90% of the Thai carbon market. Mitr Phol Group hopes that its participation in the program will motivate other sectors to take part in solving climate change problems together. With more companies committing to purchasing carbon credits, it is hoped that more GHG emissions reduction programs will be developed in Thailand. Mr. Isara Vongkusolkit, Chairman of Mitr Phol Group, and other executives at the T-VER carbon credit signing ceremony with the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization), represented by its director Mrs. Prasertsuk Chamornmarn, on October 29, 2018. 96 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group 2. The Mitr Phol Bio-Power (Dan Chang) Company Limited Project This involves the construction of a thermal (steam) and electricity power plant that will use biomass from bagasse as the main source of fuel. The bagasse will come from the adjacent Mitr Phol Sugar Mill. The project involves a complete installation of new thermal power systems comprising one set of 170 tonnes / hour steam boilers and one set of 31.93 MW power generators. This part of the power plant is called “Block 2”. Around 1,400 tonnes of bagasse from the adjacent Mitr Phol Sugar Mill per day will be used as the main source of fuel, along with other supplementary types of bio-energy. Currently, other supplementary fuels are transported from nearby sources located within a 200 kilometer radius of the power plant. The thermal energy produced is supplied to the sugar mill, while the electricity is sold to Mitr Phol Sugar Mills and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. The project currently generates thermal power 300 days out of the year. Calculations show that Mitr Phol Bio-Power (Dan Chang) – Block 2 helps to reduce GHG emissions by 489,000 tonnes of CO2, using biomass as the main source of fuel in place of natural gas.

Solar farm This involved using land that is not suitable for farming or waste and converting it into a 2 MW solar farm in the Dan Chang District of Suphan Buri Province. The solar farm has been supplying electricity since January 2016, with a 25 year Purchase Power Agreement (PPA) with the Provincial Electricity Authority. The project has helped to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1,500 tonnes per year. Solar farm in Dan Chang District, Suphan Buri Province 5. Mitr Phol ModernFarm The Mitr Phol ModernFarm model is a proprietary farming program that combines knowledge and techniques from cane farming in Australia – where cane yields are some of the highest in the world – with local farming wisdom and the Thai way of life. Mitr Phol ModernFarm management in Phu Khieo District, Chaiyaphum Province The Mitr Phol ModernFarm philosophy comprises four key pillars: growing soil-boosting crops, reducing tillage, lowering soil compaction, and decreasing cane burning by using mechanical harvesters. These four pillars are then supported by effective irrigation management. The most important aspect of the philosophy is for farmers to change their mindset about cane farming. They must be equipped with textbook knowledge as well as practical learning from demo farms. New technology must also be embraced, for example the Smart Farm Systems to control heavy machinery and irrigation. Technology helps to increase cane yields and promotes more environmentally friendly farming. There is a myriad of benefits from the ModernFarm method: soil becomes more nutrient-rich; farmers are able to reduce operating costs by more than 25%, going from 8,000 baht per rai to just between 5,000–6,000 baht per rai; yields increase, resulting in a higher income for farmers; labor shortage problems are alleviated; and carbon emissions are reduced by 0.012 tonnes of CO2 per one tonne of fresh cut cane. In the 2017-2018 production year, Mitr Phol Group’s fresh cut cane from the Mitr Phol ModernFarm project totaled more than 4.2 million tonnes, which helped to reduce CO2 emissions by 50,459.11 CO2 tonnes. 98 Sustainability Report 2018 Mitr Phol Group Mitr Phol Group’s direct and indirect GHG emissions Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) Electricity indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) Total GHG emissions GHG emissions (tCO2e) 10,000,000 10,787,288.55 10,823,655.68 9,000,000 8,875,529.20 8,447,376.97 8,123,568.44 8,000,000 7,000,000 6,000,000 5,000,000 4,842,995.70 4,364,462.00 4,468,053.30 4,000,000 4,032,533.40 4,082,914.80 3,655,515.10 3,000,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 19,064.83 NA NA NA 17,302.31 Year 0 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** GHG emission intensity for scope 1 GHG emission intensity for scope 2 GHG emission intensity for scope 3 (tCO2e / Million Baht) (tCO2e / Million Baht) (tCO2e / Million Baht) GHG emissions intensity (tCO2e / Million Baht) 2018 Target: 160 Reduction in greenhouse 147.30 gas emission intensity for 140 scope 1 per revenue by 120 5% compared with 2017 100 80 75.11 66.35 70.92 62.57 62.54 60 51.15 2018 Target: Reduction in greenhouse 40 gas emission intensity for scope 2 per revenue by 20 5% compared 0.23 0.26 0 NA NA NA Year with 2017 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Remarks: Direct GHG emissions (scope 1) cover methane gas from septic tanks, biological carbon dioxide emissions from bagasse used as fuel in biomass production, carbon dioxide from refined sugar production, GHG emissions from waste water treatment systems, GHG emissions from land filling, or waste disposal in on-premises landfills, GHG emissions from non-renewable fuels such as liquid petroleum gas, GHG emissions from renewable fuels such as biomass, GHG from solar power production, and GHG from coolants.

There are only a few suppliers with the right level of expertise and operating technology as required 2 by Mitr Phol Group. 3 They provide supplies valued at more than 5 million baht per year. 4 They are the main providers of raw materials, such as sugarcane famers. Critical suppliers management is applied to those who manufacture special products or have a direct impact on production processes. Before purchases can be made from new suppliers, the Supplier Management team must be notified. The team then makes careful considerations and may perform a site visit alongside the procurement team, or they may ask prospective suppliers to complete a questionnaire. In cases in which such suppliers have already attained all certifications required by the Quality Assurance department, they are allowed to submit copies of ISO9001, ISO14001, ISO22000, FSSC22000, OHSAS18001, GMP, HALAL, and HACCP certificates. Only after passing these criteria can new suppliers be registered and purchase orders issued. Every time a delivery is made at a factory, the Quality Control department audits random lots of each shipment, then records the results and approvals on the MPS. The Procurement department and Supplier Management team jointly performs a site visit or issues a questionnaire to evaluate annual performance and risk assessment the suppliers. The system then grades suppliers on an annual basis and creates the Approved Vendor List in order to efficiently mitigate risks. Moreover, Mitr Phol Group has prepared a risk assessment for raw material supplier in the future. 2018 Mitr Phol Group Suppliers (204-1) Type Unit 2015* 2016* 2017** 2018*** Newly registered corporate suppliers No. of suppliers 150 372 449 543 Newly registered local corporate suppliers No. of suppliers 75 191 270 237 Percentage of newly registered local corporate suppliers Percentage 50.00 51.34 60.13 43.65 from local corporate suppliers Percentage 83.10 70.31 81.35 24.85 Remarks: * Data from year 2015-2016 was collected from January 1 to December 31 each year. ** Data from year 2017 was collected from November 1, 2016 to October 31, 2017. *** Data from year 2018 was collected from November 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018.

They grow well has a natural cane aroma and a golden hue. in loam and clay soil, and can be harvested at the beginning or Its unique color and flavor make the syrup middle of the juicing season. a fantastic choice for drinks and desserts that require a hint of yellow, a mildly sweet taste and natural aroma. The syrup is another great choice for food producers to create new and exciting menu items. As part of Mitr Phol Group’s commitment to research and development to create new products that serve the needs of both food producers and general consumers, several great products have been born. Choosing the right type of sugar for specific types of food is at the heart of creating added value. Chosen correctly, food producers are able to further enhance flavors and the quality of their food, allowing them to satisfy New cane species Phu Khieo 1 consumers and bring success to their business. Develop Cane Quality Detector : Portable NIR Wood substitute business Detector Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) technology is capable of In order to serve the changing needs of consumers, Mitr Phol checking cane components quickly without destroying the sample. Group has developed two new products with enhanced durability It does not require the usage of chemicals. The NIR detector and modern aesthetics. can be used to assess other variants that determine cane quality, such as sucrose quantity, dry mass weight, amount of Synchronous panels: a new innovation fiber, and water-soluble solids. A handheld prototype was for interior design. Wood patterns are mimicked successfully co-developed with Kasetsart University and King on paper, with deep engraving on a plate. The Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi in 2015. Its small perfectly synchronized design and engraving give size makes the device more convenient to use in cane fields and the panels a texture that is similar to real wood, also helps to lower lab expenses. making the panels a great wood substitute. High gloss lacquered wood panels: the reflective surface of the panels is the result of advanced technology and machinery from Germany. Melamine-coated MDF boards undergo a process of applying a polyurethane coating, which gives the boards a lacquered finish and enhances resistance for scratches and bumps. The new technology also reduces risks of breakage during cutting. The panels are easy to maintain. A thin film has also been developed to protect the panels from scratches during Portable NIR Detector transportation. 135 Mitr Phol Group Sustainability Report 2018 Appendix Appendix 136
