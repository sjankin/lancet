Naouri Group of Companies is committed to boost awareness of human rights throughout the group, and extend our capacity to handle human rights issues. Naturally we never accommodate human rights violations in any form within our culture nor policies. Naouri Group seeks to avoid complicity in human rights abuses by its suppliers and business partners, by taking human rights standards into account and conducting an assessment of its supply chain to identify which suppliers encompass the greatest risk of human right abuses. Hence before signing an agreement of collaboration with any company, Naouri Group conducts analysis of the company’s background, financial situations and worldwide reputation. We also ask for references to make sure the supplier is not involved in any kind of human right complicity. Moreover, any contract or agreement shall be approved by our group’s Legal Department to confirm that all clauses are accepted and safe. Our group’s commitment to human rights application is governed by conducting thorough training and awareness sessions for relevant management and procurement staff, these sessions are held on regular basis with employees to emphasize acknowledgment on methods of unfair employment practices. Additionally, all employees are required to sign a Code of Ethics document, commencing the first day of employment. This code of ethics is part of our internal system and any noncompliance is dealt with in a strict manner as per our Regulation of disciplinary penalties provided by Naouri Group’s internal system.

Increasing the effectiveness of collective bargaining among our employees and partners is always our focal point of concern; we’re always keen to increase the specified budget for training and awareness sessions for our employees inside the group. This in turn, ensured that all employees are given equal opportunities to improve themselves through a set of internal and external as well as behavioral and technical training courses, which are chosen upon their needs. In addition to our self-learning business courses, which give our employees the chance to improve their skills, and bridge the gap between their current knowledge and job requirements giving them the chance to evaluate their learning outcomes by conducting an exam for each course.
