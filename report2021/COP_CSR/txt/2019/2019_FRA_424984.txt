IPACKCHEM’s CSR STRATEGY To know more about IPACKCHEM’s CSR Strategy and its commitments, please refer to the “2017 Integrated and Sustainability Report” available online on IPACKCHEM’s website. To ensure a good understanding by every employee or stakeholder of the Group, a Digest (executive summary of the report) is available in 7 languages: English, French, Portuguese, Russian, Hungarian, German, Chinese These publications feature all aspects related to IPACKCHEM’ sustainable approach. On this “2017-2018 contribution to the 2030 Agenda of SDGs” report, we highlight the major & recent evolutions from 2017. 2. ANALYSIS OF MAJOR IMPACTS on STAKEHOLDERS In the context that places the plastics industry as a growing and constantly evolving sector, IPACKCHEM is converting business opportunities into operations through more product efficiency and integration of new technological innovations (weight reduction, bio sourcing and recycling of raw materials, etc.). In addition, IPACKCHEM continues to expand its operations in new geographical areas where customer demand of high-performance plastic packaging is increasing. In the future, IPACKCHEM strengthens its sales and competitiveness and reduces its impacts through deployment of innovative solutions, sharing of good operational practices and customer collaborative approach. IPACKCHEM Group UN-SDGs Reporting Page 2 VALUE CHAIN The following picture shows where are the major impacts created by IPACKCHEM and the strategies developed by the Group to minimize negative impacts and maximize positive contributions to stakeholders and the Society. Transparency, good governance and business ethical conduct Open dialogue with key stakeholders Environmental management Sustainable innovation & sourcing Human capital development Customer product stewardship Contribution to society 3. MATERIALITY AND INTEGRATED STRATEGIC ROADMAP In 2016, IPACKCHEM carried out an ISO 26000 diagnosis to assess the maturity of its Corporate Responsibility approach. IPACKCHEM pursued the stake identification with a materiality assessment based on the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standards. IPACKCHEM launched a survey to prioritise the relevant issues for its activities from the most critical stakeholders. An international benchmark on sustainability frameworks (such as GRI) as well as on main industrial players in the field, helped to identify the most material issues among the sector. A consultation of main stakeholders has been launched to prioritise the most material stakes on governance, economic performance as well as environmental, social and civic corporate responsibility. This work helped to define the most strategic issues for the company. 20 priority issues have been defined as the most material for the development of IPACKCHEM activities and to respond to its stakeholders’ expectations. IPACKCHEM Group UN-SDGs Reporting Page 3 INTEGRATED STRATEGIC ROADMAP In 2017, an integrated strategic roadmap was built to develop the CSR deployment action plan. IPACKCHEM has identified SDGs that are aligned with its business strategy. 4. VALUE CREATION MODEL IPACKCHEM’s value creation model shows the resources the Group relies on to produce and create value for its stakeholders. It highlights the importance of its workforce, of natural resources and of its capacity to innovate. As an international group, IPACKCHEM cannot only create value for its business and the Group gives contribution to its local communities and society at large. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a comprehensive framework to support our business in understanding global needs and developing appropriate business solutions. IPACKCHEM Group UN-SDGs Reporting Page 4 5. SDGS’ CONNECTIVITY TABLE IPACKCHEM Group has defined strategic goals that support the SDGs targets and apply at all geographies.

IPACKCHEM Group UN-SDGs Reporting Page 11 In 2017, the Business Ethics Programme was revised to enlarge the scope of our ethical behaviour principles to all our value chain. The Business Ethics Programme is a common reference document for all our managers and employees around the world as well as for all our different stakeholders: customers, suppliers and contractors, host countries, local communities, business partners and shareholders. Our business partners are expected to apply standards that are equivalent to ours, in particular towards their employees. Business ethics involves the development of standards grounded in values, the implementation of practices to reinforce these values and a system based on transparency. Business Ethics Programme digital learning In 2018, the Business Ethics Programme -already available in Englishwas translated in French, Hungarian, Portuguese and Russian. During 2018, a digital and interactive e-learning journey was designed to embed all the principles and values of the Business Ethics Programme. In September 2018, Jean-Philippe Morvan, CEO of IPACKCHEM Group invited 57 managers to take actively part in the Business Ethics e-learning module to ensure they understand what constitutes Business ethics at IPACKCHEM and to comply with relevant Group policies. A minimum score of 90% for the final exam is necessary to be certified. As of November 2018, 100% of the IPACKCHEM’s managers have been successfully passed the exam and are now certified.
