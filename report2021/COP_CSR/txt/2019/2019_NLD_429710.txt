Letter from the board of directors As a growing company, with its services at present only in the Netherlands, every year PROFI-SEC affects the lives of more and more people. Our success is due to the strategic direction we follow since 2007 and our employees who make it possible with their daily efforts to achieve these objectives. We provide facility services, mainly security and reception services. Our clients can directly use our employees and indirectly the knowledge and skills that our organization in its 19-year existence has built. We believe that our ability to unburden our clients can make them focus on their core business. PROFI-SEC is adapting its services to the wishes and needs of its clients. In a dynamic environment, we identify relevant trends and developments on which we base our choices and trade-offs. The relevant social trends and developments are described in more detail in this report. By transparent and familiar contact with our clients, we work continuously to increase our customer focus. We invest in customer contact via bilateral contact, websites and social media. Also we make sure our customer can reach us 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. For years we work in an economic climate that is characterized by a negative sentiment. This also touches the facilities services industry. The competition is fearsome and the rates are under pressure. The reality is that the price is most important and that excel in the quality of service has become less important. In 2018, PROFI-SEC focused on further enhancing the quality of our services. Our intern strategy became more focused on our workforce and our social efforts. In the Netherlands in 2018 there was a very low unemployment percentage. As a result of our changed strategy we realized an outflow of just 4,8%. Another focus was a broadening of our services. We started PROFI-SEC Technology BV who had a very promising start. Furthermore we realized several optimization initiatives so that our costs decreased. The cumulative operating result has had a small growth to 20.1 million. We are working on improving our customer contacts. So we can hear what the clients find good and where our opportunities lay to improve. This reinforces the bond with our clients and gives us the ability to improve our operational and strategic services. Also in the area of sustainable management, we continue to take steps. Our business is focused on a minimal environmental footprint . A more proactive personnel policy not only make our planners even better aware of the impact of their actions on our environmental footprint so that our objectives with regard to reducing greenhouse gas emissions are met, new personnel are selected with more strict framework conditions and personal competencies. At PROFI-SEC we are aware that we contribute to society, taking responsibility for our planet, now and in the future. We therefore consciously take account of social, environmental and administrative aspects. We do not conduct business operations in high-risk or conflict-affected areas. PROFI-SEC had made a strong commitment as supporter of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and its principles. In line with membership regulations, we are committed to communicate our strategy and business operations with the ten principles of the UNGC. As such, corporate responsibility for PROFI-SEC Group means our continues commitment to contribute to responsible business practices. Communication on Progress 2018 Page 7 of 42 Corporate responsibility also means the continuous improvement process by which we are able through strategic and operational choices our goals, including the 10 objectives of the United Nations Global Compact, to achieve. Thereby resulting in respecting applicable laws and regulations in the Netherlands as well as appoint human rights in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. This report and the prioritization of its contents has been drawn up after consultation and agreement with the key stakeholders, being the Management Team and the Work Council. This report is drawn up by the Quality & Environment manager of PROFI-SEC and has been approved by the Executive Board. We are proud to provide our Corporate Responsibility Report so you can read about our goals, our initiatives in the areas of People, Planet and Profit and our achievements.

Strategy 4.1. Towards being the most trusted partner in the Dutch security industry Our ambition is that our customers experience us as the most trusted partner in the Dutch security industry. Clients need to be confident that we are ready for them whenever they need us, both to the frontend as to the backend of our services. For them we are easily and directly accessible. We see it as our duty to act responsible and forward-looking. We want to do this by focusing on the client and act in a manner that results in actual significant added value. From this principle we are customer-driven and result-oriented. The manner and speed with which we communicate with our clients, combined with a sharp pricing, PROFI-SEC holds a unique position compared to other larger facility (security) companies. On this basis PROFI-SEC has developed in 19 years into a strong and diversified facility service provider where our clients can be confident that their importance is paramount. We unfold our strategy from our four main stakeholders for whom we want to create value: our clients, our staff, our (business) partners and shareholders. 4.2. Create value as facility service provider As a facility service provider we offer our clients customers return handling of tasks that do not belong to their core business. Profitability contributes to the financial health of PROFI-SEC so that we may comply with our agreements with our customers and in a strongly developing and competitive market. Our commitment to a responsible rate of return is important to obtain a financially healthy organization. 4.3. Our analysis In 2018 we replotted a multi-annual path to obtain trough customer-driven dynamics, responsible efficiency and competitive rates to be a more customer-oriented company and a larger market share. The coming years we have to evaluate is this strategy is more successful as our previous 5-year plan. We have a good starting position by the width and minimum stratification of our organization, our market position and the rise of familiarity of the brand PROFI-SEC. Our customer satisfaction is high and our financial position continues to improve. But the changes in our environment, our industry and our customers continue. This means that we face considerable challenges. The growth of the security market in the Netherland will expand, due to rising (political) tension and changing and new risks. At the same time the pressure to keep the rates low mount which results in our profits being under pressure. More and more organizations will transform to a newer, more futureproof configuration of security services were security solutions are sought in the integration/combination of human deployment with enhanced technical support. Within the next 5 years the nature and scope of the services provide by PROFI-SEC will significantly change due to changes in risk profiles, technology and needs. Communication on Progress 2018 Page 13 of 42 SWOT –analysis  High customer satisfaction  Some business units have a low return  Top 5 largest security company in Holland  Level of automation  Good service diversifications  Overhead costs STRENGHTS S W WEAKNESSES OPPORTUNITIES O T THREADS  Increasing demand for high-quality services at  Dutch market is mature and very competitive better prices (leads to pressure on margins)  Combination of advanced tech & manguarding  Low unemployment rating  Strategic alliances  “unattractiveness” profession security guard  Technology  Hunting of our employees by competitors Materiality matrix PROFI-SEC keeps track of the developments in the security industry and the facility services. We do this so that we can tailor-make our services for the (changing) needs of our customers. This are changes in the medium and long term, where we like to tune our service development. For a proper and transparent display PROFI-SEC using a materiality matrix based on the periodic contacts with our stakeholders and internal analyses. A development is seen as material if this is relevant to our stakeholders and of significant influence on the development of PROFI-SEC. The greater the impact on society, business operations, the results and the strategy of PROFI-SEC, the greater the materiality of the development. In order to be more relevant as an organization, to continue and to realize our strategy, these developments translate into our business operations and management. The GRI index can be found in Appendix B. Materiality matrix * Development of technology Increase relevance to stakeholders * Employee satisfaction * Decline in turnover * Cost of implementation * Capital position * Customer satisfaction and good service * Changing laws and regulations * Climate change * Labour market Increase current or potential impact on PROFI-SEC Communication on Progress 2018 Page 14 of 42 Strategic risk analysis Every year we make a comprehensive risk analysis of the PROFI-SEC holding. We acknowledge the following strategic risks in the medium and long term, which directly impact on the realization of our objectives  Profitability. The risk of low structural profitability and a belated respond to changing circumstances and business models. This will, in time, place our continuity under pressure. Different perspectives such as (office) cost base and market shifts play a roll.  Laws and regulations. The risk that changing laws and regulations often lead to cost increases while this hardly can be discounted in the rates. Also is the implementation of new laws and regulations in our primary planning and ERP processes complex.  ICT systems. The risk that regard of continuous upgrading our computer systems are not sufficient to support to the complexity of business operations.  Talents. The risk of insufficient talented employees to realize our ambitions.  Public tenders. The risk that assignments acquired by public tenders within a relatively short period of time, regardless of the performance of PROFI-SEC, are put out to tender again.  Liquidity risk. The risk that the rapid growth and the associated costs result in that actual and potential payments fall due.  Strategic risk. The risk related to the vision of PROFI-SEC on its risk profile in the medium and long term, where there is a risk that an incorrect assessment is made of the future situation or events that adversely affect PROFI-SEC. Besides these above mentioned strategic risks (medium and long term) also shorter term risks that can manifest heed our attention. Possible topics are: extreme shifts in customer needs, upcoming markets and responding conform customer requirements. Risk Management process components Organizational structure Risk identification Risk strategy Risk classification Monitor, preserve Risk assessment Risk appetite & report Risicobeleid Tools & techniques Systems & data Implementation Risk response measures Human, culture & awareness Communication on Progress 2018 Page 15 of 42 We see risk management as a cyclical process where risks are periodically discussed and decisionmaking is based on a proper balance between risk, capital and expected return. During the year there are several risk assessments carried out by the Executive Management Team including strategy and operational risks. A Quality Management System (QMS), ensured by regular internal and external audits, is used to monitor and guard systematically major risks within the entire organization. Within the QMS are references to the review framework of: ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 26000, VCA** and the quality certificates of the Dutch security sector. For the main risk types the Executive Management Team periodically verifies whether the risk is still within the limits laid down. The strategic principles of risk appetite in respect of risks – accepting and taking risks – are regularly evaluated by the Executive Management Team. The applicable principles are:  financial principles  creating and maintaining a capital buffer  a liquidity position so that obligations can be met  obtaining a sound financial return  realizing a stable procurement portfolio  non-financial principles  providing transparent solutions with competitive rates  complying with laws and regulations  monitoring risks as a result of internal processes , people, systems or external events  in a socially responsible manner achieving business objectives. 4.4. Our Approach Our analysis shows that our long-term business strategy is needed. So far, this led to the accomplishment of many of the intended results. We therefore hold on to direction we have chosen, but also need to observe that we have to tighten up the pace of periodically refreshing our business model and improve our financial position. In the customer domain, we focus on improving our customer service through close contact, thinking along with the customer and offering innovative propositions. By enhanced services, we want to reach a higher level of customer loyalty. To support our multi-annual plan we strengthen the supporting departments. To realize our ICT ambitions we strengthen ICT execution and governance. As financial type of control we increasingly choose for direct result control. Our human resource policy focuses on: flexibility, employability, control cost, attracting talents and ensuring the desired size and shape of the workforce. We are aware of the challenges of the necessary transition and any uncertainty that that brings with it, we choose this approach in which urgency and inspiration. Communication on Progress 2018 Page 16 of 42 4.5. Our Control To control strategic risks and to be able to timely anticipate (market) changes, we have for the six perspectives of our strategy defined twelve critical success factors (CSF). These CSF are translated to a set of concrete and measurable Key Performance indicators (KPI’s). By measuring these KPI’s periodically and make adjustments where necessary, we try to achieve our strategic objectives. In the following chapters our achievements of 2018 and our ambitions of 2019 will be explained.

Our Customers To realize our ambitions, we must be and remain a customer-driven organization. We do this through anchor the voice of our customer in our organization. Furthermore, we employ transparent processes where the customer extensively is informed and/or supported. We are now 24 hours, 7 days a week available for our customers. Also our department planning has wider working hours (07:00 – 19:00). Based on multiple customer surveys PROFI-SEC identifies where its services can be improved. We believe it is important to know how our customers feel about us. That is why we evolved our CRM policy. De most important change is that all operational managers must make a location visit at least once per month. Keurmerk Beveiliging , Keurmerk Evenementenbeveiliging and Keurmerk Horecabeveiliging are Dutch security quality certifications for the quality of service. The Dutch Security Association “Nederlandse Veiligheidsbranche” awards these quality marks and audits them annually. 4.5.2. Our Social Results We focus on a sustainable future for our customers, employees, society and our company. This goes beyond offering facility services. We want to contribute to social value creation. New developments and risks ask for renewed and appropriate propositions with which our customers are helped and that strengthen our society. In order to understand social issues we have the dialogue with our stakeholders and think along with them in terms of solutions. Renewal of services from social perspective offer new opportunities. Services that realize results for PROFI-SEC and society. We want to contribute to a sustainable, healthy and safe society in which people are (financially) self-reliant. As an employer we take our responsibility for a healthy society. For example to advise our staff on how they can take – where possible – more responsibility for their own health. By this we invest in the quality of life of all our employees. Facility services is particularly suitable for people with a distance to the employment market to again integrate into working life. PROFI-SEC focuses on an intensive cooperation with municipalities, UWV and training institutions to make this happen. The social added value of our services, however, is not easy to quantify. We are looking for opportunities to measure the added value of our organization and its services even better. Until that time, we determine our added value for the society on the basis of figures with respect to our workforce, for example local or regional start from employees and the travel distances. Communication on Progress 2018 Page 18 of 42 4.5.3. Our Employees Changing customer needs require that the employees change also. This means that the traditional employee is to be replaced by an employee that is willing to continuously improve in areas such as: customer service, hospitality and expertise. We work to customer orientation and customer drive to getting better to service our customers. The customer is therefore an important component in our supervisory processes. PROFI-SEC invests in expertise of its employees by internal and external training. There are various training opportunities offered through which each employee can develop themselves personally. All of our employees can participate in this training program. The PROFI-SEC Academy works with several trainers in order to continue to facilitate optimal herein. Our operational leaders (managers and coordinators) are essential in the realization of our strategy. Especially as responsibilities in the organization are placed as low as possible, the operational leaders are important first point of contact for the employees. Within PROFI-SEC therefore is much attention for our operational leaders. New operational leaders are intensively accompanied and trained, in which they, inter alia, meet the leadership model of PROFI-SEC. Another important theme is long-lasting employability and how executives that can stimulate in their subordinates. For all the operational leaders there are periodically meetings and trainings to inform them or to deepen into relevant topics. 4.5.4. Our Partners Our partners are divided into two categories: (strategic) subcontractors and strategic partners whose core business is different from that of PROFI-SEC. We invest in a (commercial) collaboration in which knowledge, skills and opportunities strengthen the interests and support of a mutual cooperation. To be able to position our proposition even better in the market, we determine how the expertise of our different partners best and most effective / efficient can be deployed to acquire the best possible cost reductions and results in social oriented programs. 4.5.5. Our Processes Process improvements are relevant for customer satisfaction, cost reduction and transparency. To control costs, we want to standardize processes, products and systems, as much as possible. Our goals is to continue to serve our clients as best as possible. With the modifications that we make to our Enterprise Resource Planning system, we respond to the needs of our customers. So they can 24 hours a day, 7 days a week login, follow real-time events and retrieve a documents from within a secure environment. We invest in online customer contact via websites and social media (Twitter and Facebook). By our presence on the internet we respond to the opportunities offered by digitization. By improving our administrative processes, we provide a higher quality of process flow and create a basis for continuous improvement. A process-based design of our ERP system results in cost savings and customer satisfaction improvements. In 2018 several administrative processes were improved, including: financial management, sales & marketing. Furthermore, based on feedback from our clients, customers and personnel structural improvements in services, processes and communication were made. In this way PROFI-SEC improves its service on both operational, tactical and strategic level. Communication on Progress 2018 Page 19 of 42 4.5.6.
