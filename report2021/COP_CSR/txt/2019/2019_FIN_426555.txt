Retirement salary for DB schemes is calculated based on the average monthly salary and related statutory pension insurance contributions over the ten years prior to retirement.

The award for President and CEO varies between 0–100% of annual salary, based on performance and share price appreciation. Awards for NEB members vary between 0–80% of annual salary. Target award levels for both the President and CEO and NEB members are 30% of salary.

Change of control terms are same as for termination. Supplementary information Benchmarking approach: The Personnel and Remuneration Committee reviews market benchmark data from Finnish and, where necessary, international industrial companies of a similar size and complexity to Neste when setting total remuneration packages for the President and CEO and the members of the NEB. This is used more as a guide than a direct determinant of pay levels. Other factors considered include each individual’s role and experience, as well as Company and personal performance. Shareholder alignment: The Company’s largest shareholder, the State of Finland, issued updated Government Resolution on State-ownership Policy in 2016. Neste’s Board of Directors has deemed it correct to take these guidelines into consideration, along with the interests of its wider shareholder base, when determining the remuneration policy for its senior executives.

Palm oil (CPO) was leading the overall vegetable oil complex down as CPO inventories were increasing. This Key financials was mainly due to stronger than expected production growth in Indonesia and a major 2018 2017 demand reduction induced by increased import tax in India. Even the acceleration of Revenue, MEUR 3,241 3,243 Indonesian biodiesel mandate implementation during the fourth quarter was not able to EBITDA, MEUR 1,026 586 curb the decline, and CPO price reached a new record low level in November.

However, towards the end of year RSO started to decline. European FAME biodiesel producers’ margins were very low in early 2018, but recovered to healthy levels for the rest of the year. The margins were boosted by larger than normal spring maintenance in biodiesel production, and by strong demand combined with limited availability, particularly during the winter period in the fourth quarter. US SME biodiesel producers’ margins remained positive throughout the year, supported by the end of SME imports from Argentina. SME producers’ margins declined in the fourth quarter as anticipation of a retroactive BTC implementation lead to overproduction. The US Renewable Identification Number (RIN) D4 price peaked in February at 84 cents per gallon before turning on a continuous downtrend through October. That was impacted by the gradual decline in SBO price, and the negative impact of the biofuel mandate waivers granted to small refineries. D4 RIN price started to rebound just before the year end as Review by the Board of Directors / Neste Annual Report 2018 109 Strategy Sustainability Governance Review by the Board of Directors Financials crude oil and oil product prices came down.

Comparable operating profit eliminates both the inventory valuation gains/losses generated by the volatility in raw material prices and changes in open derivatives, and better reflects the company’s underlying operational performance. Also, it reflects Neste’s operational cash flow, where the change in operating profit caused by inventory valuation is mostly compensated by changing net working capital. Items affecting comparability are linked to unpredictability events of a significant nature that do not form part of normal day-to-day business. They include among others impairment losses and reversals, gains and losses associated with the combination or termination of businesses, restructuring costs, and gains and losses on the sales of assets. Only items having an impact of more than EUR 1 million on Neste’s result will be classified as items affecting comparability. 2)  AME = Fatty Acid Methyl Ester biodiesel RED seasonal, CPO = Crude Palm Oil Bursa Malaysia 3rd month + USD 70/ton freight to ARA (Amsterdam–Rotterdam–Antwerp), SME = US Gulf Coast Soy Methyl Ester biodiesel mid-price, LCFS F = California Low Carbon Fuel Standard Credit price Review by the Board of Directors / Neste Annual Report 2018 125 Strategy Sustainability Governance Review by the Board of Directors Financials Financial Statements Consolidated financial statements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 126 Consolidated Statement of Income. . . . . . . . . . . . . 126 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 126 Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. . . . 127 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.. . . . . . . . . . . . 128 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.. . . 129 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.. 130 Parent company financial statements. . . . . . . . . . . 184 Parent Company Income Statement .. . . . . . . . . . . 184 Parent Company Balance Sheet.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184 Parent Company Cash Flow Statement. . . . . . . . . 185 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 186 Proposal for the distribution of earnings and signing of the Review by the Board of Directors and the Financial Statements. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 203 Auditor’s Report. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 204 Financials / Neste Annual Report 2018 126 Strategy Sustainability Governance Review by the Board of Directors Financials Consolidated Statement of Income Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income EUR million Note 1 Jan–31 Dec 2018 1 Jan–31 Dec 2017 EUR million 1 Jan–31 Dec 2018 1 Jan–31 Dec 2017 1 2 Revenue 4, 5 14,918 13,217 Profit for the period 779 914 3 Other income 6 17 22 4 Share of profit (loss) of joint ventures 15 –9 1 Other comprehensive income net of tax: 5 Materials and services 7 –12,459 –10,927 6 Employee benefit costs 8 –400 –372 Items that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 7 Depreciation, amortization and impairments –614 –371 Remeasurements on defined benefit plans 4 2 8 Other expenses 9 –429 –399 9 Operating profit 1,025 1,171 Items that may be reclassified subsequently to 10 profit or loss 11 Translation differences –16 –15 12 Financial income and expenses 10 Cash flow hedges 13 Financial income 7 4 recorded in equity –53 69 14 Financial expenses –48 –79 transferred to income statement 7 –15 15 Exchange rate and fair value gains and losses –34 –2 Share of other comprehensive income of investments 16 Total financial income and expenses –75 –77 17 accounted for using the equity method –4 2 Total –65 40 18 Profit before income taxes 951 1,094 19 Income tax expense 11 –172 –180 Other comprehensive income for the period, 20 Profit for the period 779 914 net of tax –61 42 21 22 Profit attributable to: Total comprehensive income for the period 718 956 23 Owners of the parent 778 911 24 Non-controlling interests 0 3 25 Total comprehensive income attributable to: 26 779 914 Owners of the parent 717 952 27 Non-controlling interests 0 3 28 Earnings per share from profit attributable to 718 956 owners of the parent (in euro per share) 12 29 Basic earnings per share 3.04 3.56 30 The notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
