Whilst this summation of the key investment considerations of our industry groups are meant to provide a snapshot for ease of understanding, this section should be read in conjunction with the Industry Group Review section of this Report to obtain a more comprehensive insight of the drivers and strategy of our businesses. While it may be premature to assess the medium to long-term impacts on the economy as a result of the Easter Sunday attacks, we believe that the macro-economic fundamentals will be able to withstand and overcome these incidents, and as such we have not revised the outlook of our business, with the exception of the short-term impact on Leisure, at this juncture of time. In any event, it should be noted that the Strategy and Outlook section of the ensuing write-up reflects strategic priorities, including, and beyond, the short-term horizon.

SLFRS 16 ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON LEASES Effective 1 April 2019, the Group will adopt SLFRS 16 – the accounting standard on Leases which will primarily affect the accounting treatment of the Group’s operating leases and lease commitments. The new standard introduces a single accounting model for leases, requiring the lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases, eliminating the concept of operating leases as per the previous standard. In this regard it is important to note the following: Income Statement Lease expenses under the previous standard is replaced by depreciation and interest expenses The impact to the Income Statement is front-loaded due to the higher finance expense at the inception of the lease. The expense will gradually decrease overtime, with the repayment of the lease rental. Balance Sheet A ‘right-of-use’ model replaces the ‘risks and rewards’ model, recognising an asset and liability at the inception of a lease. ´ Given the reclassification in expenses, Group EBITDA will be higher under SLFRS 16. ´ Group EBITDA under SLFRS 16 will reflect the operational performance of the Group excluding impacts from long-term lease obligations. ´ To depict the underlying performance of the Group on a like-with-like basis, Group EBITDA in 2018/19 will be adjusted to exclude the lease expense in the 2019/20 interim reports and 2019/20 Annual Report, where applicable.

It is encouraging to note that subsequent to the refurbishment of Cinnamon Dhonveli Maldives , the average room rates of the hotel have been above expectations. ´ Revenue growth of the Destination Management sector was predominantly driven by Walkers Tours Limited, which benefited from the depreciation of the Rupee on account of its foreign currency denominated revenue streams. ´ The Hotel Management sector recorded a decline in revenue as a result of a reduction in management fees from the City Hotels sector and the closure of hotels in the Maldivian Resorts segment.

However, it should be noted that the depreciation cost pertaining to the properties has increased by 13 per cent in 2018/19, whilst finance costs of approximately Rs.144 million were incurred on the long-term loan facilities undertaken for the refurbishments in 2017/18 and 2018/19. ´ PBT of the Sri Lankan Resorts segment was impacted by exchange losses on the translation of its foreign currency denominated debt arising from the depreciation of the Rupee during the quarter. The business will however accrue the benefits of the depreciation on account of its foreign currency denominated revenue streams over the ensuing periods.

The discussion on the forms of Capital, where relevant is structured to emphasise goals, targets and initiatives undertaken. Goals under Targets we set for Our initiatives relevant Capital ourselves Financial and Manufactured Capital Revenue* (Rs.million) 2018/19 2017/18 % Total 711 1,231 (42) Property Development 137 676 (80) Real Estate 574 555 4 *Including share of revenue of equity accounted investees ´ The significant decrease in the revenue of the industry group is driven by the Property Development sector. The sector recorded a one-off gain of Rs.558 million in 2017/18 due to the recognition of deferred revenue arising from the re-assessment of the revenue recognition policy at Rajawella Holdings Limited (RHL) on the sale of leasehold rights. ´ Excluding the impact of the one-off gain at RHL, the revenue increase within the sector was recorded at 6 per cent. The resort operations and golf course operations at RHL were intermittently closed due to the ongoing refurbishment at the premises in the year under review. ´ It should be noted that revenue from the Cinnamon Life project will only be recognised post the handover of units whilst revenue from the Tri-Zen project will be recognised from 2019/20 onwards. ´ The increase in revenue of the Real Estate sector is on account of higher occupancy at K-Zone Ja-Ela.

The Group is of the view that fair value gains/losses on IP is integral to the industry group’s core operations, given the land banking strategy of the Property industry group, and the view of monetising such lands in the near-term through development and sales. ´ The decrease in EBITDA of the Property Development sector is mainly attributable to the aforementioned one-off recognition of deferred revenue at RHL in 2017/18 and the ramp-up of administration and promotion costs of the two on-going projects – Cinnamon Life and Tri-Zen . ´ The Real Estate sector of the industry group recorded a decline in EBITDA as a result of a fair value loss on IP at Crescat . K-Zone Ja-Ela, also reported a decline in its IP valuation gain in 2018/19, impacting EBITDA. Collectively, both properties resulted in a decline in fair value amounting to Rs.295 million compared to the previous year.

During the year under review, debt at Cinnamon Life increased by Rs.3.56 billion to Rs.17.07 billion. 130 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2018/19 MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Assets (Rs.million) 2018/19 2017/18 % Total 113,452 93,183 22 Property Development 104,831 83,662 25 Real Estate 8,621 9,521 (9) ´ The increase in assets of the industry group is primarily driven by an increase in non-current assets as a result of work-in-progress costs relating to Cinnamon Life and the land acquisition in central Colombo during the year. ´ The decrease in the Real Estate sector stems from the reduction in IP gains within the mall properties during the year under review Natural Capital In engaging in its core business of effluent and waste in line with the Group’s The material topics relevant to the Property development and sale of residential and environmental policies, guidelines and industry group, identified under Natural commercial real estate, the Property industry best practices.

This is particularly of importance given the absence of a pension scheme on the back of insurers for all citizens. It should be noted that rising consumer wealth and the increasing prevalence playing a more active role in of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have led to growth in life insurance in the past and is providing long-term health a likely trend that will continue. and annuity solutions to an Leveraging on the business’ strong brand presence, UA will continue to capitalise on the ageing population.

The dip in valuation ratios in 2018 rendered the CSE one of the most undervalued equity markets in the region, and it is expected that the current low valuations will attract renewed investor interest and stronger market participation which should improve market turnover levels. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT REVIEW Progressing from the discussion on the External Environment and Operational Review, the discussion that follows captures the forms of Capital available, and how each of these forms of Capital are combined to create value for all stakeholders. The discussion on the forms Capital, where relevant, is structured to emphasise goals, targets and initiatives undertaken. Goals under Targets we set for Our initiatives relevant Capital ourselves Financial and Manufactured Capital As the key businesses within the industry group comprise of the Banking and Insurance sectors, the ensuing discussion will predominantly focus on PBT and PAT, in order to capture the net earnings of the businesses as reflected in the financial statements of the Group.

Whilst a normalisation in line with usual course of operations was anticipated, the business was impacted by the downturn in economic conditions. As such, UA recorded an annual life insurance surplus of Rs.1.10 billion in 2018/19, a notable decline against the life insurance surplus recorded in the previous year. ´ It is pertinent to note that UA profits for 2017/18 included a one-off surplus of Rs.3.38 billion attributable to non-participating and non-unit fund of unit linked business, which was transferred from the life policyholder fund to the life shareholder fund based on the directive issued by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (IRCSL) to the entire insurance industry, dated 20 March 2018. ´ In addition to the lower life insurance surplus, profits of UA were also impacted by mark-to-market losses on its equity portfolio and regular new business premiums which were static partly due to the disruptions caused by the transition to a new ERP platform. Premiums ceded to reinsurers increased due to a change in reinsurance agreements, whilst other costs increased in line with growth in gross written premiums (GWP) and strategic initiatives as per the long-term business plan of UA. ´ Up to the period ending 31 March 2018, UA did not recognise a deferred tax asset against its reported tax losses given uncertainty regarding the availability of taxable profits. However, with the introduction of the new tax base as per the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, going forward, UA will have taxable income based on UA’s historical experiences and future projections. It is noted that UA is eligible to claim its brought forward tax losses against its taxable income. Accordingly, during the year under review, UA recognised a deferred tax asset of Rs.1.57 billion, arising from brought forward tax losses. In this light, the net income tax charge for 2018/19 of Rs.528 million was offset by the one-off recognition of the deferred tax asset of Rs.1.57 billion in the Income Statement, which resulted in a net income tax reversal of Rs.1.04 billion. ´ NTB recorded a growth of 21 per cent in net interest income driven by steady loan growth. ´ The cost to income ratio of NTB also improved during the year, despite an increase in operating expenses on the back of investments in training and development, branding and technology. ´ Profitability of NTB was impacted by higher impairment charges due to the heightened credit risk from subdued macro-economic conditions and the implementation of SLFRS 9, as discussed under the External Environment and Operational Review section of this Report. Impairment charges increased by 139 per cent during 2018/19, to Rs.3.32 billion. ´ Market share of the Stock Broking business increased, contributing to a 4 per cent YoY growth in revenue, despite the lacklustre performance of the CSE. ´ The 75 per cent decrease in PBT in JKSB was mainly attributable to an increase in operational costs associated with upgrading and strengthening back office systems.

A DRL of Rs.387 million resulted in a 16 per cent increase in taxes and levies on financial services during the year under review. ´ Fairfirst Insurance Limited; the associate company having interests in the general insurance business, witnessed a 5 per cent decline in PAT driven by a decrease in investment income and higher expenses for branch and infrastructure enhancements. ´ Recurring PAT for the Financial Services industry group was Rs.2.47 billion for 2018/19, compared to a recurring PAT of Rs.5.19 billion in 2017/18. 141 INDUSTRY GROUP REVIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES Natural Capital The Financial Services industry group has The material topics relevant to the Financial All traditional bulbs a comparatively lower exposure to natural Services industry group, identified under resources than other industry groups Natural Capital are: were replaced with given the service-oriented nature of its LED lights, resulting in ´ Energy and emissions management businesses.

JKH is conscious of the need to have effectiveness and opportunities for a Board which comprises of Directors who reflect the needs of its businesses and vision and process improvement by analysing aligned to the needs of its customers, employees and other stakeholders. The Group places movement of the compliance posture great emphasis on attracting appropriately skilled personnel to the Board and will continue to strike a balance in this regard, whilst ensuring that Board diversity does not come at the Digital Oversight and Cyber Security expense of Board effectiveness. The rapidly-advancing nature of technology and the continual integration of the Given that women comprise a significant proportion of the customer and employee Group’s operations with technological populations, the Group will make every effort to attract appropriately qualified women to progress has resulted in the Group being its various Boards and we are confident of attracting women who are proficient, competent more vulnerable from a digital standpoint. and capable to represent our Boards.

Given the emergence of such regulations, data integrity and information management will be of pivotal nature. Thus, in furtherance of this initiative, the Group will strengthen its data governance structure in the ensuing year to ensure ownership and accountability of clearly articulated data governance policies and processes and Group-wide data quality standards. Implementation of the same across data domains in the Group will be supported by dedicated data owners and data stewards to ensure data privacy, data quality and rights management. Board Refreshment and Independence Although some argue that frequent board refreshment is needed to ensure independence, fresh ideas and new experiences in line with the changing nature of business, others argue that tenured and experienced Directors who are well aware of the nature of the business are better decision makers. The Group believes in striking a balance between board refreshment and independence, particularly given the complex nature of its operations in a diversified conglomerate setting. Greater Employee Involvement in Governance Employees play a pivotal role in reinforcing an effective governance system across the Group. Going forward, JKH will continue to encourage greater employee participation through: ´ a further strengthened continuous performance management process, which envisage continuous feedback and enhanced engagement via the newly implemented employee information systems ´ engagement and empowerment via greater delegation of authority ´ increased communication and collaboration ´ adoption of differentiated means of communication based on the age dynamics of employee segments Key Governance Disclosures Section under Corporate Governance Commentary The Governance System 2 The Board of Directors 3.1 Audit Committee 3.2.1 Human Resources and Compensation Committee 3.2.2 Nominations Committee 3.2.3 Related Party Transactions Review Committee 3.2.4 Chairman-Chief Executive Officer 3.3 Group Executive Committee and other Management 3.4 Committees Human resource governance 4.2 Stakeholder management and effective communication 4.5 Assurance mechanisms 5 Compliance summary 7 167 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMENTARY 2 THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE SYSTEM LEVEL INTERNAL GOVERNANCE INTEGRATED ASSURANCE REGULATORY STRUCTURE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS BENCHMARKS Board of Directors and Senior Integrated Governance Management Committees Systems and Procedures Human Audit Companies Act No. 7 Resources and Committee JKH Code of of 2007 Compensation Strategy Formulation Conduct Committee and Decision Mandatory compliance Making Process Refer 5.1 Nomination Board Committee Refer 4.1 Listing Rules of the of Colombo Stock Group Directors Senior Exchange (CSE) and Independent Securities and Exchange Director Commission of Related Party Sri Lanka Act No. 36 Transactions Project Risk Refer 5.2 of 1987 Review Assessment Human Resource Committee Committee Mandatory compliance Governance Refer 4.2 Board The Code of Best Committee Practice on Corporate Chairman-CEO Governance (2013) Refer 5.3 as published by the Securities and Exchange Group + Commission and the Industry / Institute of Chartered Function Group Executive Committee (GEC) Accountants, Integrated Risk Employee Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) Management Participation Voluntary compliance Refer 4.3 Refer 5.4 Group Operating Committee (GOC) Code of Best Practice on Corporate Industry / Governance (2017) Function Internal issued by CA Group Management Committee (GMC) Control Sri Lanka Refer 5.5 Voluntary compliance with IT Governance almost the full 2017 Code, to the extent of business Refer 4.4 exigency and as required Sector Committee by the John Keells Group Sector / Function / Ombudsperson Sub-sector Recommendations Refer 5.6 of the UK Corporate Management Committee Governance Code Stakeholder as practicable in the Management and context of the nature Effective of businesses and risk Business / Communication External profiles Function / Employee Empowerment Assurance BU / Voluntary compliance Department Refer 4.5 Refer 5.7 Refer Section 3 Refer Section 6 ´ All 4 Board Sub-Committees are chaired by Independent Directors appointed by the Board ´ The Chairman-CEO is present at all Human Resources and Compensation Committee meetings unless the Chairman-CEO’s performance assessment or remuneration is under discussion.

Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Impairment of property plant and equipment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, except that, impairment losses in respect of property, plant and equipment previously revalued are recognised against the revaluation reserve through the statement of other comprehensive income to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation surplus. An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life. 265 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21.
