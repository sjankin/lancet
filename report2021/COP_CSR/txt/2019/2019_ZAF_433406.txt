Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) is our key value chain provider as they rail coal from various mines across South Africa to RBCT. A total of 9 337 trains were railed for off-loading at RBCT in 2018. The Train Turnaround Time (TTT) is a value chain contracted target between RBCT and TFR and can be defined as the time taken from handover of a loaded train to RBCT, to handback of an empty train to TFR. The TTT in 2018 was 3 hours 42 minutes. Trains can either be stacked on the ground or bypassed directly to a vessel. In 2018, 19% of trains were bypassed. We continue to be aligned with our business partner, TFR, to ensure the supply chain performs well and contributes to increasing volumes.

This enables the business to meet employee’s career aspirations and current as well as future business requirements. RBCT also prides itself for going beyond compliance on Employment Equity. In 2018 we met and exceeded all our Employment Equity targets, with 30% of the workforce being women. RBCT is also above the sector norm on hiring disabled people.
