AEON REPORT 2018 Aeon Basic Principles Pursuing peace, respecting humanity, and contributing to local communities, always with the customer’s point of view as its core. Peace The Customer People Community The word (Aeon) has its origins in a Latin root meaning “eternity.” The customers’ beliefs and desires comprise the central core of our philosophy. At Aeon, our eternal mission as a corporate group is to benefit our customers, and our operations are thus customer-focused to the highest degree. “Peace”  Aeon is a corporate group whose operations are dedicated to the pursuit of peace through prosperity. “People”  Aeon is a corporate group that respects human dignity and values ­personal relationships. “Community” Aeon is a corporate group rooted in local community life and dedicated to making a continuing contribution to the community. On the basis of the Aeon Basic Principles, Aeon practices its “Customer-First” philosophy with its everlasting innovative spirit. Front Cover Okadaya, one of Aeon’s predecessors, was founded in the city of Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture, in 1758. In 1887, the store relocated to a bustling new area of the city. This period saw the formation of the family motto “give wheels to the central pillar.” Comparing a store to the central pillar of a house, the motto implies that businesses should respond to changes in customer needs by moving the “central pillar,” in other words, by moving things that would never normally be moved. The design of this report’s cover incorporates the wheel of a large daihachiguruma wagon. These wagons were used to transport goods from the Edo period (17th century) to the beginning of the Showa period (20th century).

However, this is not (Kanamaru) simply a matter of organizing the Company’s own 40 AEON Report 2018 AEON Report 2018 41 Dialogue with Stakeholders Pedersen: I agree.

Japanese people often think that silence is a virtue, and that it is sufficient to generate good results without saying anything. But that approach does not result in communication. In a globalized world, if we provide explanations then we can ultimately achieve understanding. Why In Japan as well, if companies respond to global trends and incorporate them into their business strategies, then I think we will see the formation of markets and the evolution of the national energy strategy.

In Japan, ivory can be traded under a nationally administered control system, which is based on the Act on Conservation of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Nonetheless, since June 2015 Aeon has adopted a policy of not carrying ivory products at its directly managed sales areas.
