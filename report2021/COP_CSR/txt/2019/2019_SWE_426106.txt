Where are we headed...? Here, at the end of the year, it may be appropriate to follow up on the plans we drew up at the beginning of 2018. “Castellum’s primary objective is to create sustainable shareholder value for the long term, at moderate risk,” we emphasized in the Q1 interim report. I feel we accomplished this in 2018, and it also applies going forward. As part of this ambition, we started 2018 by mentioning continued development along three market dimensions: geography, type of premises and customer offering. As regards geography, the move towards greater growth is fully diversified financing base (the Eurobond market). continuing. We took a significant step in early 2019 through our At the end of the year, the net asset value had increased to sale of our entire portfolio in Sundsvall via an exchange that SEK 176 per share, but with a share price (at December 31) at the same time provided us with critical mass in the growth of SEK 163.35, however, Castellum is still listed with a small region of Linköping.

At the same time, yearly new production of offices represented only 1–1.5% of the total share of office space. In general, this has led to historically low vacancy rates in Swedish cities, especially Stockholm and Gothenburg, which has resulted in growth in market rent. Rental growth continued in 2018, driven by a favorable economy, robust demand and a limited selection of office premises.

The rental trend in Norrköping rose somewhat, driven by a small number of property owners. Rent levels in Växjö and Västerås were relatively stable during the year. Copenhagen The rental market for office space in Copenhagen trended positively in 2018, with an increase in office rents in the CBDs of approximately 5%. This is due to economic growth, falling vacancy rates and increased construction costs that have driven up rent levels in newly produced premises.

In small to medium-size logistics facilities with terminal functions, and warehouse buildings, strong demand has been noted with a positive rental trend. In the market, there is limited access to modern logistics facilities with terminal functions. The Godståget 1 property in Stockholm is a good example from Castellum’s portfolio of this type of property, and the rental value there in SEK per square meter has increased approximately 25–30% over three years. Increased e-commerce places new, more stringent requirements on the logistics chain and on access to well-placed logistics and warehouse premises. E-commerce in Sweden is expected to grow around 15% annually over the next ten years. In seven years, e-commerce is expected to represent approximately 30% of total retail trade. This will lead to a need for more lettable area in the form of warehouse and logistics premises. Specifically, the demand for warehouse premises in “last mile” locations will increase.

In this context, owning building rights in attractive locations with local zoning plans already in place is a competitive advantage, as this involved the shortest possible lead time before customers can occupy the premises. At year-end, Castellum had approximately 786,000 square meters of unutilized building rights (leasable area). A number of these include finalized project plans which can be launched relatively promptly. During the year, Castellum made several major potential projects public, and these are summarized on the following pages. The projects are characterized by their location in attractive development areas, in combination with a clear sustainability focus. Unutilized building rights are valued at MSEK 1,154 (1,508), BUILDING RIGHTS BY VALUE AND REGION equivalent to approximately SEK 1,500 (1,700) per square meter on average.

Söderstaden in the Globen area, Stockholm At the end of 2017, it was announced that Castellum had won the City of Stockholm’s land allocation competition for Söderstaden, a major development area south of the Stockholm city center. This urban development project, one of Castellum’s largest, will be carried out in consortium with two property companies, Wallenstam AB and Åke Sundvall AB. The project covers approximately 100,000 square meters; Castellum’s share of 30,000 square meters will comprise commercial properties such as office space, hotels and restaurants. The remaining 70,000 square meters will be designated as residential premises and space for new hockey training rinks. Depending on the final design and volume, and provided that the proposal is implemented, Castellum estimates that the total investment, after the acquisition of development rights as well as land development, will amount to about MSEK 1,200–1,400. Through the site registration, Castellum and the other parties gain the exclusive right to negotiate with SGA Properties, the City of Stockholm’s wholly owned subsidiary, about how the site is to be developed and will subsequently have the possibility of acquiring development rights. It is still too early to comment in detail on the time schedule for the project, but the consortium estimates completion over six to eight years, with the earliest possible start in 2020. The opportunity to enable the development of a completely new city district in one of Stockholm’s most exciting areas — with major arenas, a subway line and proximity to Södermalm — is an important development project for Castellum in the Stockholm region.

Monitoring takes place in various ways, in part through auditing Castellum’s environmental management system, inspections, questionnaires and site visits. In 2018, Castellum purchased services or products from a total of 6,998 suppliers, of which the 69 largest suppliers with a purchase volume over MSEK 10 accounted for 63% of the purchase volume. Furthermore, no significant changes occurred in Castellum’s chain of suppliers during the year.

A pivotal element is that all employees understand and follow the Code of Conduct. Castellum has a whistleblower function that can be reached via the Group’s web page and Intranet. The function aims to help both employees and external parties act responsibly. All whistleblower cases are handled in accordance with established procedures. Those reporting a whistleblower case receive prompt feedback and then the aim is to maintain a dialogue with the initial notifying person. He or she is also encouraged to contact the Compliance Department. All cases are handled confidentially. In 2018, Castellum received some ten cases through the whistleblower function. Some of the cases led to a change in routines or to targeted communication efforts. Community involvement For Castellum, community involvement is about offering healthy and productive urban environments where people do well. It is also about contributing to urban development that encourages the integration of different societal groups. Another important aspect for Castellum in this area is to contribute to more young people and people with varied cultural backgrounds entering the labor market. Castellum holds stakeholder dialogues and participates in joint projects with other property owners and players to create better living environments together. In 2018, a total of 85 young people worked at Castellum as vacation workers, interns, apprentices, with academic degree projects, or as trainees.

This is a venture to bring in more academics who are new arrivals to Sweden into the job market. Jobbsprånget is a national internship program that offers four-month internships. At Castellum, we see this as an opportunity to match our needs for competence with relevant candidates currently outside the job market. The participants, or “Jobbsprångare,” are assigned a mentor; the internships can vary depending on the Jobbsprångare’s experience and expertise.

However, as stones: diversification, liquidity, strength, long as the Stibor rate (3 months) is negative, transparency and flexibility. derivatives in the form of interest-rate swaps CASTELLUM'S FIVE FINANCING CORNERSTONES DIVERSIFICATION Castellum is to have a diversified loan portfolio and avoid dependence on both single sources of financing and counterparties. In addition, the maturity of various sources of financing and individual credits is to be distributed over time. Castellum will monitor and follow developments on financial markets for the purpose of acting quickly and matching the needs of the operation. At year end, Castellum's interest-bearing financing amounted to SEK 40.1 billion, of which SEK 27.0 billion came from capital market financing (an MTN program totaling 16.5, an EMTN program totaling MEUR 500, and a commercial paper program totalling SEK 5.4 billion) equivalent to 67% and the remainder comprising loans in major Nordic banks and credit institutions. As regards loan-to-maturity structure, it totaled 3.4 years at year end and the interval for the loans ranged from 1 month to 24.0 years. LIQUIDITY Castellum will have unused credit facilities available to respond rapidly to the needs of the operations and the opportunities provided. Moreover, there will be revolving credit facilities for the purpose of reducing the need to invest the surplus liquidity. At year end, Castellum had SEK 56.4 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 40.1 billion was utilized. STRENGTH The Group’s financial key metrics must be strong, with a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 50% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%. The strength of our property portfolio is enhanced by the quality of our cash flow as well as by the composition of our debt and interest rate portfolio. Castellum aims to reduce the risk of a sudden negative impact on net financial items, arising from changes in the general interest rate and/or the assessment of Castellum as a borrower, that cannot be offset by earnings from operating activities. The loan-to-value ratio was 45% at year end, while the interest coverage ratio for 2018 was 454%. TRANSPARENCY Castellum encourages long-term relationships with both banks and other lenders/investors; its aim is to be transparent in order to increase the relevant parties’ understanding of the Group’s operations and thereby its credit exposure. FLEXIBILITY Castellum must have flexible financing arrangements in order to support the development of operations in relation to acquisitions, divestments and development. Our credit facilities will provide us with strong flexibility to withdraw and repay on short notice and at no extra cost. Furthermore, Castellum is to have access to flexibility, both in terms of pricing (fixed and floating) and maturities. At year end, Castellum had SEK 26.1 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 20.5 billion comprised revolving credit facilities.

Castellum’s risks are divided into six overall categories: business environment, strategic risks, operational risks, sustainability, people and financing. Castellum therefore works continually, in a structured manner, to identify and actively monitor financial and other risks that operations encounter or are faced with. The Group’s risk management involves a structured process of decision-making with the aim of establishing a balance between the desire to limit uncertainty or risk and the task of generating growth and shareholder value. Castellum will construct the new Swedish National Courts Administration building in the Nyhamnen district of Malmö. The investment comprises a key element of Castellum’s strategy for further growth in the Öresund region and will be one of Castellum’s largest construction projects in its history. 92 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R ’ S R EP O RT, 20 18 R IS K A N D R IS K M A N AG E M EN T Risk and risk management Risks, exposure and risk management To facilitate risk management, Castellum has chosen to classify Castellum defines risk as an uncertainty factor that may affect risks into the following categories: the company’s ability to achieve its objectives.

Governance is an important component in managing Castellum sustainably and responsibly — all in accordance with the applicable laws, other rules and best practices, and customized based on Castellum’s operations. This Corporate Governance Report starts off with the Chairman’s comment, followed by information on the structure of corporate governance, shareholders and the Annual General Meeting, the Nomination Committee, the auditor, the Board of Directors and committee work, Group Management, and compliance and internal control. Castellum completed the first stage of Hisingen Logistics Park in 2018, and the second stage was begun at the end of the year. Upon completion of the second stage, Hisingen Logistics Park will be one of the Nordic region’s largest logistics facilities: 65,000 square meters with modern standards for a fully automated warehouse. 102 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT, 20 18 CO R P O R AT E G OV ER N A N CE R EP O RT Chairman of the Board’s comment Shareholder value in the form of strong total yield A significant portion of the total yield is the dividend.

The autumn was marked by international For a number of years, the business community in general — unrest, increased uncertainty and rising volatility in the world’s and the capital-intensive real estate industry in particular stock markets. — have been living in a “perfect storm” of low financing Castellum’s objective — or promise to shareholders, if you costs and a strong economy, something that has also favored will — is to create long-term, sustainable shareholder value ­Castellum. We have been prospering, but Castellum’s executive and growth under moderate risk. Castellum’s ability and permanagement — challenged and assisted by the Board — has formance in the stock market is graded on a daily basis in its also carried out a thorough repositioning of the company’s pricing, and through the total yield we can measure our value real estate portfolio, with a top-quality customer offering and creation, both in absolute terms and relative to our sector in concentrating on growth hubs in the Nordic region. The fruits of the geographies where the main portion of our shareholders these improvement efforts, which otherwise are a permanent are located. component of building a company, will be harvested for a long Over the past year, we owners of Castellum shares have time to come. In the short term — viewed over a few years — enjoyed a very strong yield on our investment — just over larger sales or acquisitions may impact growth so that it rises 22% — compared with the four percent downturn for the stock above or falls below the long-term trend. market as a whole, but also compared with the property index in Sweden (+15%), the Eurozone (-8%) and the UK (-13%). Back in 1994, when Castellum rose out of the ashes of the real estate crisis of the early 1990s, its long-term target function was formulated from a clear shareholder perspective. As support for this architecture, the structure for the incentive program for senior executives was also established; it has run in three-year cycles and the Annual General Meeting will consider the period from 2020 to 2023 in March. It consists of two elements: one annual, and one measured over three years. One of the tasks of the Board is to routinely evaluate the structure and level of remuneration for Group Management. We set aside the proper amount of time and energy to discuss, monitor and compare with other companies, as well as to set challenging goals that drive value. The basic philosophy is to keep fixed costs in the form of salaries down, and in return to offer variable remuneration that adds up to a competitive total. If the shareholders receive a healthy yield, it is reasonable to reward executive management as well. In the real estate industry, a number of larger players and competitors for Castellum are publicly owned, and are thus prohibited from offering variable remuneration to management; this has promoted a high level of fixed remuneration. Through its incentive program, Castellum can limit this burden. To further link the interests of executive management with those of shareholders, the participants additionally pledge to purchase Castellum shares for at least half of the variable remuneration paid, after tax. This gradual investment of taxed income promotes an understanding of long-term value creation, and gives the confidence to drive change. The three-year portion of the ongoing program, which is linked in its entirety to the Castellum share’s total yield, expires in May 2020 at which point the outcome will become clear. Viewed over a longer succession of periods, Castellum has offered its shareholders a healthy average yield: just over 20% over the last three years and just over 16% over ten years.

The economic and financial functions are managed from the head office, meaning that routines and processes are uniform but also provide the conditions for various parts of the functions to review one another’s processes — a form of self-assessment. All this is to increase and improve internal controls. The business units and the company monitor the income statements and balance sheets on a quarterly basis. Clear documentation through policies and instructions, along with frequent monitoring and regular discussions with the auditors, continually ensure the work to improve these processes. Management and reporting are reviewed twice a year by the company’s auditors and reported to both the Audit and Finance Committee and the Board. In addition, there is a whistleblower function on the Group’s website. Taken together, this means that a particular division for internal audits is not considered justifiable. “A cornerstone of Castellum’s corporate culture has been its decentralized organisation, which creates committed employees who take on responsibilities and feel that they are part of operations.” C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R S’ R EP O RT, 20 18 119 Financial reporting Castellum’s financial reporting for 2018 consists of a financial summary and financial reports, as well as accounting policies and notes. The financial summary consists of a quarterly and multiyear summary, and key performance measures. The financial reports consist of consolidated and Parent Company statements of comprehensive income and balance sheets, as well as the Parent Company’s income statement, changes in shareholders’ equity and a cash flow statement. The accounting policies and notes provide detailed company-specific information that more thoroughly describes the company’s financial position. Castellum is constructing the Citypassagen office property at the north approach road to Örebro; completion is expected in the second quarter of 2019. Samspelet is a project being run during the construction process in collaboration with Peab. The aim is to create a platform for meetings, inclusion and integration for children and young people. 120 C A S T EL LU M ’ S D I R EC TO R ’ S R EP O RT, 20 18 FI N A N CIA L R EP O RT I N G

R EC TO R ’ S R EP O RT, 20 18 FI N A N CIA L R EP O RT I N G Key financial metrics A number of the financial measures presented by Castellum are not defined in accordance with the IFRS accounting standards. However, the company believes that these measures provide useful supplementary information to both investors and Castellum’s management, as they facilitate evaluation of the company’s performance. It is to be noted that, since not all companies calculate financial measurements in the same manner, these are not always comparable to measurements used by other companies. These financial measurements should therefore not be seen as a substitute for measures defined under the IFRS. Unless otherwise stated, measurements that are not defined under IFRS are presented along with their reconciliation. Definitions for these measures appear on page 208. Jan–Dec 2018 Jan–Dec 2017 Average number of shares, thousand (key financial metrics related to income statement)* 273,201 273,201 Number of shares outstanding, thousand (key financial metrics related to balance sheet)* 273,201 273,201 *The number of shares from a historical perspective has been restated to take the bonus issue into account (i.e. the value of the subscription right) in the completed new share issue, and has been utilized in all calculations of metrics for SEK per share. The conversion factor is 1.15. INCOME FROM PROPERTY MANAGEMENT Castellum’s operations are focused on cash flow growth from ongoing management operations (i.e. income growth from property management), the yearly objective being a 10% increase in income from property management. Income from property management also forms the basis of the annual shareholder dividend: at least 50% of income from property management. Income from property management is calculated before tax paid, as well as after the theoretical tax that Castellum would have paid on income from property management had there been no loss carryforwards.

Based on this equity, Castellum wants to create return and growth at a low level of risk. Net asset value can be calculated both long and short term. Long-term net asset value is based on the balance sheet, with adjustments for items that will not lead to any short-term payment. In Castellum’s case, these would include such things as goodwill, derivatives and deferred tax liability. Actual net asset value is shareholders’ equity according to the balance sheet, adjusted for the market value of the deferred tax liability.

Further, it has been assumed that tax loss carry forwards are realized over 2 years with a nominal tax of 21.4%, which yields a current deferred tax liability of 21%, and that the properties are realized over 50 years where 33% are sold directly with a nominal tax of 20.6% and 67% are sold indirectly in corporate wrappers where the buyer’s tax discount is 8%, which yields a current deferred tax liability of 6%.
