Table 4. UAE nationals representation in senior management EMIRATI VOICES It was a huge opportunity for me to be able to go from being passionate about bikes to entering a professional career in the same field. The opportunity arose during a workshop, where I learned that Al Naboodah was opening a new branch of its Harley Davidson franchise. I followed the hiring procedure and got accepted to be part of the Al Naboodah family. One of the key success factors, which I haven’t felt anywhere else I’ve worked, is the friendly environment we work in. It feels like a second family. Moreover, we have opportunities to grow, which we find in the support provided from our senior management, such as training or door-opening opportunities for talented employees. I am very satisfied with my job, I enjoy every single day working with my team and I am really proud to be part of the Al Naboodah legacy. Omar Altamimi Manager Customer Service 6 Please note that the local representation in executive and senior management was inaccurately reported in 2017. 36 ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS GRI 102-43, GRI 102-44 ANGE firmly believes its sustainability journey is a pathway of learning, flexibility and adaptation. As such, in 2018, under the Working as a Family pillar, the Group amended its approach to stakeholders from ‘educating’ to ‘engaging with’. This reflects the two-way dialogue necessary to share material topics and build a relationship based on mutual benefit and trust. ENGAGING WITH OUR EMPLOYEES The successful integration of sustainability is enabled by the engagement of employees. ANGE strives to capture the interest of employees through interactive and engaging activities that culminate in the annual Sustainability Week. Upon joining ANGE, employees are immediately introduced to the Group’s sustainability approach and framework during an induction programme. In addition, employees are required to participate in an online sustainability training that explains its strategic importance and emphasises the role of the employee in the Group’s sustainability journey. During 2018, 170 new employees completed this online training. SUSTAINABILITY TOOLKIT In 2018, the Sustainability Team developed a Sustainability Toolkit that includes detailed information about ANGE’s sustainability approach, general information on sustainability related topics and explains how employees can get involved. 37 ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS SUSTAINABILITY WEEK For the third consecutive year, ANGE’s Sustainability Week brought ANGE’s Sustainability Week focused on the Group’s top five material topics: together employees, key partners and suppliers, alongside sub-contractors Employee Welfare Customer Experience Occupational Health & Safety and other lines of business, to focus on ANGE’s sustainability pillars and Anti-Corruption Sustainable Supply Chain; assigning a full themed day material topics. The planting of a Ghaf tree, the Group’s sustainability for each topic. emblem, marked the launch of the week.

In 2018, the commitment was reinforced and made available to more employees. The online Sustainability Pledge reached over 2,000 employees during 2018 and was signed by 777 employees. 38 ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGING WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY Local communities are a key stakeholder to ANGE and the Group endeavours to one of Dubai’s most advanced science attractions. 270 students attended to host and participate in activities that help develop and protect local the presentations and a group of 25 students went on the school trip. communities.

ANGE has a target to encourage 1,000 posed by a construction site. The initiative included competitions for students employees to participate in these social activities during 2019. to design a safety poster and a safety video for the chance to win a school trip ENGAGING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANGE is aligned with the strategy and vision of the UAE government and seeks to engage with government entities, in support of both national and international priorities. Alongside leading business leaders from global brands, ANGE General Manager of Sustainability, Fatima Al Naboodah, participated in a roundtable discussion with business, policy and investment leaders to discuss the need for sustainable practices and diversification initiatives to meet global goals, such as those contained in the Paris climate accords and the UN’s SDGs. In a further demonstrable commitment to preserving heritage and working for a sustainable future, during 2018, ANGE signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the UAE’s Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, to preserve the UAE’s natural resources and ecosystem balance. 39 EMPLOYEE WELFARE Employee welfare ranks as the fifth most material topic for ANGE and employees are at the core of its success. Major investments are made in the well-being, growth and development of employees along with industryleading remuneration, benefits and training opportunities. ANGE’s worker welfare policy and programme ensure the Group is in line with EXPO 2020 mandates and principles, whilst at the same time upholding UNGC Principles on Labour and Human Rights. In addition to briefings on employment and human rights given directly by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, ANGE workers have access to award-winning accommodation, free health check-ups, regular recreational activities and trips, barbers, ATMs, gyms, free Wi-Fi and cuisine tailored to their origins. Regular open forums take place in employee accommodation villages and offer workers the opportunity to ’have a voice’ and make suggestions for improvement or raise any challenges they may face, in a non-confrontational environment. Feedback informs the Group that operatives appreciate this opportunity and the suggestions that ANGE has adopted as a result. Our sustainability initiatives are fully aligned with the long-term goal of our HR department of being a source of positivity and inspiration for employees and community alike, and assisting individuals to progress and flourish.

In 2018, with a survey response rate of 70% (10,183 responses) and an overall satisfaction rate of over 99%, the survey indicated that: 2016 2017 o 99% of employees are satisfied with their working conditions and feel management recognises good job performance; Response rate 67% 70% o 99% of employees feel that management and employees trust each other and that ANGE listens to them; Overall operative satisfaction 93% >99% o Over 99% feel safe in their work environment; o Areas for improvement include working on the food at the accommodation sites, since 7% of the respondents are unsatisfied with the food options. Table 8. Outcomes of the 2018 Operative Happiness survey These improvements from last year’s performance show that listening to employees and engaging them, as the engine of ANGE progress, is worth 20 the effort. For 2019, the Group aims to reach an 80% response rate, using regional languages to facilitate participation. 7 EMPLOYEE HAPPINESS SURVEY 2 It is also important for ANGE to evaluate the happiness of employees in offices and managerial positions. In 2018, 949 employees, out of approximately 2,000, participated in a survey and rated their 71 satisfaction with ANGE as an employer. 91% of employees rated themselves as ‘Happy’ or ‘Very Happy’. During 2019, ANGE will consider this feedback to develop incentives and performance-driven rewards. VERY HAPPY NEITHER HAPPY NOR UNHAPPY HAPPY UNHAPPY 42 BETTER HYDRATION FOR EMPLOYEES In a recent move to ensure optimal hydration of workers, and to reduce the use of single-use plastic, ANGE has introduced durable water bottles to the standard kit issued to workers. Construction site workers can refill their bottles on site and the reduction in the consumption of PET bottles is significant. Additionally, as a result of worker consultation, the Group has trialled the use of oral rehydrating supplements as an additional measure to ensure hydration particularly in hot weather conditions. Both these initiatives have been welcomed by the workforce. 2016 2017 2018 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS & Total number of employees covered by the parental leave policy PARENTAL LEAVE Breakdown of employees by gender MALE 3,183 2,952 3,379 Contributing to SDG 3 good health and well-being and to the UAE FEMALE 195 284 244 Vision 2021 Agenda for world-class healthcare, is at the foundation of the Total number of employees that took parental leave Group’s efforts, and employee benefits reflect this contribution.

The policy is in the process of being communicated to employees through a broad number of channels, including a volunteering app, and the Group is expanding the list of volunteering options for employees. PARTICIPATION IN THE SAHEM INITIATIVE In collaboration with the Royati Family Society, the Sahem Initiative provides nonperishable food items to those in need in the UAE during Ramadan. The initiative took place during Thursday and Friday, for which 14 employees took advantage of paid leave hours to attend. As a result, 1,500 Ramadan boxes were packed and distributed, equating to nearly 30 tonnes of food. 44 HEALTH AND SAFETY (H&S) Health and Safety is consistently identified by stakeholders as ‘what to speak up on site if they identify any H&S related issue that may impact matters most’ during materiality workshops.

H&S performance Due to regular and mandatory training, a solid framework, and engaging H&S activities, the LTI figure has consistently reduced over the past three years and now stands at 4. The Lost Day Rate decreased among the Group’s own employees compared to the previous year, meeting the target of 5. The LTI rate for contractors’ workers was significantly reduced to zero. As in the previous two years, ANGE recorded zero fatalities in 2018. 11 Lost Day Rate is also known as Injury Severity Rate. It is calculated as follows: Number of days lost x 1,000,000 divided by total number of man-hours worked. Therefore: ISR of 6 is calculated as follows 243 x 1,000,000 / 40,525,796= 6. 12 Lost Time Injuries are injuries that result in more than 3 days off work, not including the day of the accident. 47 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY The monitoring and reporting of Near Misses13 is an important element of the Group’s H&S Strategy and a key leading indicator. During 2018, ANGE identified a knowledge gap among the workforce regarding how and when to report Near Misses, as they were often reported as unsafe acts or unsafe conditions. To address this gap, ANGE conducted classroom and Visual Impact Training sessions aimed at encouraging the workforce to accurately report Near Misses. As a result, an increase of 28% was reported in the Near Misses leading indicator during 2018. NOMINATION FOR THE ‘SUPERVISOR OF THE YEAR AWARD’: REWARDING H&S EXCELLENCE Baldev Singh was nominated by ANGE for EXPO 2020’s ‘Supervisor of the Year Award’ because of his positive attitude and high standards regarding H&S, and his consistency in warning workers and preventing unsafe activities. Operatives consider him a trustworthy supervisor with whom they can discuss any concerns in the workplace. Baldev empowers operatives to actively participate in site safety meetings, ensuring the buy-in of the team, which is key to the achievement of ANGE’s safety goals and objectives. By nominating employees like Baldev, with a strong commitment to safety and an engaging attitude, for internal and external recognition, ANGE reinforces the desired HSE culture among employees. 13 A Near Miss is defined as an unplanned event which did not result in injury, illness, or damage but had the potential to do so. 48 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY Lagging indicators Leading indicators KPI TARGET ACTUAL KPI TARGET ACTUAL Lost Time Injury frequency rate 0.08 0.07 Project Management HSE inspections 100% 100% (four per calendar month) Critical incident frequency rate 0.03 0.05 Near miss reporting frequency rate 16.90 23.49 All accident frequency rate 5.90 3.11 Delivery of structured HSE training 100% 100% Injury severity rate 5.00 4.98 1 Mass tbt per project per week 100% 100% RWD (Restricted Work Days) To be measured in 2019 USACFR To be measured in 2019 (Unsafe Acts & Conditions Frequency Rate) Table 12. ANGE Health & Safety continuous targets SAFER TOGETHER To complement its Sustainability Week and underpin the H&S culture ingrained in the Group, in 2018, ANGE conducted an additional Occupational Health & Safety Week to increase H&S awareness among employees. Across offices, workshops, projects and facilities, awareness-raising activities focused on the importance of Occupational Health & Safety, under the umbrella of “Safer Together”. The activities covered topics like safety at height, road safety, mental health, safe use of personal protective equipment, fire safety, occupational health, and nutrition and exercise. The Emirates Civil Defence Academy and Emirates Driving Institute Safety both attended the event and gave safety awareness demonstrations. The week culminated with a family H&S Fair focused on the importance of a healthy lifestyle through exercise classes, presentations on nutrition and sports competitions. 49 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY All the rates listed in previous page are calculated in the same manner: Number of items times 1,000,000 divided by total number of man-hours worked. The critical incident frequency rate indicator (lagging indicator No. 2) will no longer be monitored in 2019. Conversely, two new indicators will be monitored starting in 2019: 1) Restricted days, which refers to the days in which a worker or employee is partially incapacitated but can still come to work and conduct alternative tasks; 2) Unsafe Acts & Conditions Frequency Rate (USACFR), which refers to the reporting of unsafe activities. With these two indicators, ANGE expects to improve the monitoring of the Group’s operations safety by implementing more leading indicators. ANGE’s Life Saving Rule focuses on high-risk activities that have the potential to result in a critical injury. During 2018, ANGE updated and expanded the list of activities that are considered high-risk: Work at Height Live Energy Trafﬁc Excavations Conﬁned Spaces Lifting Operations Safety in the Heat Temporary Works Fire Plant & Management Equipment At Al Naboodah Construction Group, we believe that safety is everyone’s responsibility. Our See It, Sort It (SI2) initiative is the cornerstone of active leadership and engagement within our business and aims to improve the health and safety awareness of all employees through a proactive, enthusiastic and blame-free culture. We believe in rewarding behaviour that looks to enhance and sustain a safe working environment with the message that whoever you are, your personal action will make a difference. Gareth Main – Senior HSE Manager, Operations ANCG 50 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY HAND SAFETY CAMPAIGN Internal injury data revealed that a high proportion of reported injuries were related to hands and fingers. Hand injuries are considered critical for operatives’ health, and can have associated costs to ANGE’s operations. Having identified this trend, during 2018 the Group ran a ‘Hand Safety Campaign’ across its projects, facilities and yards to reduce the number of hand and finger injuries. The campaign included safety presentations on the common causes of hand injuries, the importance of basic hand safety, and the simple steps needed to help prevent hand injuries. Awareness posters and ‘Hand Safety Notice Boards’ were displayed around projects and facilities, as well as talks and open discussions among workers and supervisors across ANGE. HEALTH AND SAFETY LEARNING Ownership of H&S by employees starts with awareness and self-care. Performances are tailored to the needs, risks and priorities of the project and ANGE updated the employee charter during 2018, and included this the client, and are delivered to employees in their native language.

Operatives who completed the ECITB training since 2016 VISUAL IMPACT TRAINING (VIT) – A SUCCESS STORY A key success factor of VIT is that it can be tailored to the specific risks of each project. For the RTA-PK3 project, for example, a high frequency of incidents was reported regarding utility cable strikes and damages. ANGE took proactive action through an eight-week campaign directed towards operatives and sub-contractors. The campaign held 16 sessions with over 250 attendees. Due to its effectiveness, external stakeholders such as contractors and partners have reached out to ANGE asking for support to enable their in-house implementation of VIT. ANGE has worked with DEWA and the Abu Dhabi Occupational Safety and Health Centre (OSHAD) to deliver Visual Impact sessions for their projects, and EXPO 2020 will begin implementing this learning initiative on their project sites. ANGE strives to be a leader in the industry and foster positive change, by sharing best practice and knowledge with external stakeholders. 14 ECITB safety passport: issued by the Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB), it is a scheme that ensures basic H&S knowledge for all operatives on site to navigate the site safely.

ANGE has met EXPO 2020 environmental standards for construction products by implementing the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) in the Al Naboodah Ready-Mix Concrete (ARCON) production facility and is the first concrete supplier with EPD capacity in Dubai. EPD is a standardised way of quantifying the environmental impact of a product, based on ISO 1404016 and ISO 1404417 . Declarations include information on the impact of material acquisition, energy use, content of chemical substances, air emissions, pollution and waste generation. The EPD software allows the facility to review, track and change concrete mix designs to improve its sustainability parameters Though the initial use of the EPD software at ARCON was applied to concrete mix, the process can be used for other construction materials, which can change the whole culture of construction material manufacturing in the region, as clients look for products that fit their environmental needs and add value to their projects through the production process. The ARCON facility is capable of meeting those needs. 16 ISO 14040:2006 Environmental management -Life cycle assessment -Principles and framework: https://www.iso.org/standard/37456.html 17 ISO 14044:2006 Environmental management -Life cycle assessment -Requirements and guidelines: https://www.iso.org/standard/38498.html 63 RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION 18 RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION KEY 2018 TARGETS PROGRESS IN 2018 TARGETS FOR 2019 MANAGING ENERGY Implement an energy management ANGE’s Energy Policy was Obtain ISO 50001 certification by the system in accordance with ISO updated and an Energy third quarter 50001 criteria Management team was established EFFICIENCY Continue to conduct Internal auditor training was Continue to conduct Level 1 and plan Level 1 and plan for provided. for Level 2 energy audits Level 2 energy audits An internal audit was conducted on one of the most significant 5% energy reduction target in energy uses, the HQ chiller the UAE Set up 2018 as the baseline year for energy consumption in the UAE REDUCING Improve data quality Data collection system was Streamline the data collection improved to include all significant WASTE process ANGE operations Maintain or exceed 30% diversion To maintain or exceed a 24.38% of the waste generated rates from landfill 30% recycling rate in main sites was recycled Reduce the amount of waste generated by 2% per person per year Identify areas where avoidable Areas of potential losses were Develop remedial action plans losses occur and develop remedial investigated. action plan SAVING Identified four projects and implemented improvements such as WATER Conduct water audits for each of the push taps significant areas of water inefficiency Conduct Level 1 water audit annually identified Annual Level 1 audits were not conducted The boundary for Responsible Consumption section has been expanded in 2018 to include all ANGE’s footprint in the UAE, 18 for better comparability the 2017 data was revised to reflect the same boundary followed in this reporting cycle. 65 MANAGING ENERGY EFFICIENCY 19 ANGE is committed to minimising its negative impact on the The EnMS scope includes ANGE head office, National Plant, and all the environment while improving operational efficiency, reducing costs and Group’s owned properties.

Table 17. Breakdown of energy consumption across ANGE In support of the UAE government efforts to combat climate change along with all Paris Agreement25 signatories, ANGE is determined to 2017 2018 monitor and reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. ANGE follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol by the World Resources Institute (WRI) Total carbon emissions Tonnes of eCO2 88,685.4 74,675.8 (Scope 1 and 2) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to calculate its GHG emissions for its UAE operations. For 2018, the Table 18. Direct (Scope 1) emissions reported by ANGE through its fuel consumption Scope 126 and Scope 227 GHG emissions estimate stood at 74,675.8 tonnes of CO2e28 . This represents a decrease in carbon emissions of 15.80%, which is a result of the adoption of clean energy sources and TAKING THE LEAD ON SOLAR POWER GENERATION efficient energy use. Climate change will have a tremendous impact on people and businesses, as became evident with the IPCC 1.5 °C report29. It will take everyone’s efforts to tackle this challenge and mitigate the impact of climate change on the environment and businesses. In line with this, ANGE launched in 2017 its Solar Energy Project, an initiative to capitalise on the solar energy sources available in the region for the benefit of the clients, the community, and the environment. The adoption of clean energy use starts at home and ANGE deploys solar energy on its owned facilities. A 200-kW solar installation was completed at National Plant during 2018, which generated 20,400 kWh between July and November, and continues to be operational. ANGE is aiming to be a driving force for clean energy by developing the necessary skills and capacity locally to provide solar generation arrays across the UAE. Starting in 2018, ANGE is an approved contractor of the Shams Dubai programme, a government initiative to encourage household and building owners to install solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and generate clean electricity. Al Naboodah Engineering is now supporting clients with design, installation, commissioning and maintenance of solar products supplied by Al Naboodah Electrics. These new services are part of the Group’s drive towards responsible consumption and advancing Dubai’s clean energy strategy30. .25https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement 29 https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ 26 Scope 1 emissions refer to GHG emissions derived from non-renewable energy consumption. 30 https://government.ae/en/about-the-uae/strategies-initiatives-and-awards/federal-governments-strategies-and-plans/uae-energy-strategy-2050 27 Scope 2 emissions refer to the electricity consumption by the Group’s assets. 28 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions only include CO2 gas.
