Obayashi Corporation increased the number of independent directors*1 to three in June 2018. The three current independent directors came together for a candid dialogue. Their discussion ranged from the corporate culture ― What is your impression of corporate Otake: My background is in communications and of the Obayashi Group, their impressions of the Group, their roles and aspirations as independent directors, and governance at Obayashi? technology, so I’d like to apply my knowledge to what form the Group needs to take in a new era. Otake: I was Obayashi’s first Independent Director and help Obayashi decide how to use its technological *1 Independent director An outside director as per Article 2, have been in that position for six years. At the start of capabilities. How to use ICT and communications Section 15 of the Companies Act my tenure, there was some trial and error even between technology is a big challenge for all types of industries me and the Board of Directors. More recently, however, nowadays, including the construction industry. I feel I’ve had more opportunities to attend not only Board of that Obayashi is dealing with the challenge promptly Directors meetings but also the president’s interviews and making good progress. However, drawing on intellectual property based on open innovation is a Business Report with business units. It seems to me that our function is more meaningful now in the sense that there is a better weakness, in my opinion. I see it as my role to offer Shinichi Koizumi Obayashi my suggestions on this. Independent Director environment for us to get information. Later, Mr. Koizumi and Mr. Izumiya joined me in this role, and each of them Koizumi: I’ve had years of business experience outside has a different background and frame of reference than Japan. I’d like to offer my knowledge particularly where me. That really energized our discussions. Obayashi is stepping up its overseas business. I actually Koizumi: I feel that Obayashi’s initiatives to strengthen have many opportunities to visit overseas bases and governance have really moved quickly in the last year construction sites and dialogue with local managers. or two. Particularly under the new system in effect I get the sense that the Group as a whole has not since 2018, independent directors make up a majority yet optimized the operational functions of Obayashi of the members of the Recommendation Committee Corporation and its overseas bases. Open innovation is a Shinichi Otake Independent Director and Remuneration Committee and an Independent good example. Let’s say that an overseas base or Group company has come up with an innovation. Obayashi Sustainability Report Director is even sometimes the committee chair. Since these committees deal with important matters like does not yet have a system in place to incorporate that executive personnel and compensation, this is a bold innovation into the Group overall. At Board of Directors reorganization. I can sense Obayashi’s intent to really meetings, I try to speak up candidly on issues that come solidify its governance system so it can work positively up in the course of business activities. The result is often as the Company grows. As for Chairman Obayashi, an immediate and appropriate response, and that’s his position lets him restrain the executive side of rewarding to me as well. management. His approach is characterized by seeking out the opinions of outsiders. That makes it easy for us to say what we think. Izumiya: Society has long sought governance reform from enterprises, but you can tell that Obayashi took on reform on its own initiative. We’re under a bit of tension Naoki Izumiya because the Company really urges us to attend even less Independent Director Corporate Data important meetings. These are fundamental to business execution in the sense that this is where we share information. This expectation reinforces for us the need to do good work. Information is surprisingly open within Obayashi, but I get the impression that Obayashi could do better at getting outside attention. That seems to be an issue it needs to address for the sake of achieving both governance transparency and fairness at Obayashi. 41 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2019 OBAYASHI CORPORATE REPORT 2019 42 Sustainability Report Feature A Dialogue on Governance Izumiya: To describe it straightforwardly, my on the renewable energy business–solar, wind, and employees at the site on how to think about risk and About Obayashi Group perspective as an Independent Director is to promote geothermal.

Then, it needs to long-term enhancement of corporate value. As come from. In any case, to produce sustained earnings to make the process of execution at the work site visible mentioned earlier, Obayashi is extremely quick to for the Group going forward, it will certainly have to and incorporate it to the point where it is possible to respond. But the thing that’s really important is how change its existing business conditions while it is still on carry out. When you’ve got that cycle working, rigorous that response enhances sustainability and corporate firm ground. implementation will start to show up in the corporate value. For example, Obayashi is developing IoT and Koizumi: It’s not possible for the construction industry culture and employees’ attitudes. robotics to deal with the mediumto long-term to go on unchanged when the world is changing at Otake: If people think of legal compliance as manpower shortage, but unless it gets a reasonable such a dizzying speed.

The important thing is to make work site Business Report That is the perspective that I need to speak from. the environment and build a foundation for corporate employees really understand that rigorous compliance earnings that remains steady in the face of even greater helps increase sales and productivity, and to build it into change in business conditions. the corporate culture.

If it can give concrete expression to its Izumiya: Obayashi builds national infrastructure.

ESG perspective. next 10 years, it could really raise expectations. The question is, how is the Obayashi Group using its Izumiya: We talk about “ESG” as a single thing, but Otake: Whether they realize it or not, enterprises invisible assets? For example, how is it contributing unless the G is sustained, the E and S won’t continue that have lasted for the long term have survived by to the SDGs in ways that make the Company Rigorous Compliance into the Corporate Culture long either. In that sense, a big assumption of ESG meeting society’s ESG expectations. Now, however, the Sustainability Report indispensable?

People expect these enterprises to contribute to possibilities of the Obayashi Group going forward. rigorous compliance. negatives and increase the positives of E and S to make meeting the SDGs, which are to be achieved by 2030. I Otake: The building construction and civil engineering Koizumi: Obayashi is making strong progress in its a real contribution to the world. I hope that Obayashi hope that, as a leader in the construction industry, the markets in Japan are going to reach a peak. Without systematic response. It has put all sorts of mechanisms will begin by building governance into its best practices Obayashi Group will show it has the willingness and question, the mainstream for business will be making into effect following cases of misconduct.

Its effective use of existing stock, which can include is to get assent to the new systems and mechanisms Koizumi: The industrial waste generated by the ESG management will mature if it does so. building renovation. The Obayashi Group is also taking from employees who are actually on the job site. In construction industry has a big negative impact on any mechanism, the important thing is not to say society. Obayashi has already begun addressing certain acts are forbidden, but to convince employees this, but it needs to break away from the scrap-andthey don’t need to do those acts. If the delivery date or simply getting the job done takes priority over everything else, we can’t eliminate the possibility that Profile rules will get broken. That type of mechanism building Shinichi Otake Mr. Otake joined NTT Public Corporation (the predecessor of NTT) in 1971.
