CSR APPROACH 2.1 CSR COMMITTEE Being responsible and acting this way, is a natural part of Ball groups business approach. This counts for both our internal and external activities, where we basically believe in treating others in a fair and ethical way and expect other to act in same way towards us. 5 The CSR Committee is headed by Mette Würtz Nielsen (Head of Product & Buying) and further consisting of Kuno Kildetoft Mehlsen (Chief Executive Officer), Rikke Knudsen (Finance Director) and Chalotte Bahr Skoett (Back office coordinator).

As a member of UN Global Compact, our Code of Conduct is based on the UNGC’s guiding principles for universally recognised principles on human rights, labour rights, the environment, anti-corruption and additional ethics regarding animal welfare. All our suppliers have accepted and signed our Supplier manual incl. the Code and therefor all involved parties also accept the addition regarding the limit for incentives and encouragement. When we engage with new suppliers, they firstly have to accept and sign our Supplier manual and Code of Conduct, before any purchase order can be placed. The Code extend to all Ball Group’s suppliers (1) and all their workers, regardless of their status or relationship with the supplier, and therefore applies to the workers engaged informally, on short-term contracts, or on part-time basis. The supplier is responsible for ensuring that their business relationships is including home based workers, sub-contractors (2) and other suppliers (3) in the supply chain taking part of the production. (1) First tier (T1) The supplier is the legal entity that invoices BALL GROUP for goods or services directly. (2) The subcontractor is doing work on behalf of the T1 supplier. (3) Second tier (T2) The supplier is delivering goods or services to the T1 supplier. 6 Human Rights  We support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuse.

ACTIVITIES AND RESULTS This year our focus has been the implementation of our sourcing strategy and responsible supply chain management. We have reduced our supplier base, increased the volume for more direct sourced articles and gained more insight and transparency in the global supply chain. 3.1. CHEMICAL MANAGEMENT In 2018 we have had more than 50 chemical tests performed, as part of our random chemical testing program. In comparison we have had 25 tests performed in 2017, and our goal for 2019 will be 60 chemical tests. 5% of the performed tests has failed according to our RSL, and each of the cases has been handled individual and solved in co-operation with the respective supplier. Our goal for 2019 will be that less than 3% of the performed tests will be failed. The random chemical testing program is representative and gives us a good indication on each supplier’s performance, level of knowledge and attitude, which is also very valuable as part of the evaluation of our supplier base. The backbone of the testing program is the Ball Group RSL (Restricted Substance List) that is updated annually and with criteria’s that is beyond EU legislation. We believe the testing program is a big step in the right direction, when it comes to reduce and control the use of restricted and harmful substances in the supply chain. For further information, the RSL can be found on www.ballgroup.com 8 3.2 SOCIAL COMPLIANCE We believe that frequent visits to our suppliers, is essential for having a close cooperation and relation with our suppliers. Part of the purpose with these visits, is to get more insight and knowledge in relation to the level and standard of the various production sites and make sure they are compliant to international standards and is aligned with ILO (International Labour Organisation). Many of our suppliers already have a social certification or follow a similar standard like SA8000, Amfori, Sedex, WRAP. As part of our Responsible Supply Chain management strategy we have conducted onsite audits and inspections for 3 suppliers and their factories, regarding social compliance, transparency and quality assurance. Our goal for 2019 is to conduct onsite audits and inspection for 5 suppliers and their factories. 3.3 CERTIFICATION We support our suppliers in the aim for a social certification or standard, and this also provide us with more transparency in our supply chain. Figure 1: Map of suppliers with a certificate No. of No. of No. of No. of suppliers suppliers suppliers suppliers 2018 2017 2016 2015 Holds a certificate 43 40 21 34 No certificate 12 3 47 61 Total 55 43 68 95 9 Ball Group has successfully increased the number of certified suppliers, and in general reduced the number of suppliers in order to optimize and build an even stronger supplier base. 3.4 ANIMAL WELFARE Ball Group still enforce the ban of real fur and in 2018 we also refrain from using Angora fibres or fur originated from rabbits in our garments. Most of the global Angora production is made in countries with poor animal welfare standards and traceability. As part of our 2018 strategy within responsible sourcing and transparency in our supply chain we are going to put even more efforts into the complex areas of traceability of raw materials in. 3.5 ENVIRONMENT Ball Group has focus on our environmental impact and with our new chemical management program we have taken an important step to prevent and reduce the use of chemicals proven to have a harmful impact on the environment and based on a precautionary principle in our supply chain. This year we have started to use certified organic cotton and certified recycled polyester, and in 2019 we aim to increase the volume of more sustainable materials. However, it takes time to implement new materials and so far, result of sales has not as expected. We have been screening some of our suppliers as part of gaining more knowledge about Eco labelling and the criteria for the environmental impact in textile production. This is an area where both we and our suppliers are still learning, and we will continue to gain more knowledge in this field in 2019. A larger part of our goods is produced outside EU and being shipped by sea. 27 % of this volume is being sent by air because of delays or immediate demands from the shops. We are aware of that the impact from air shipments are significant higher compared to sea shipment, and in 2019 we will aim to reduce the volume of air shipments to be less than 20%. In our warehouse we re-use export boxes in good condition for further transportation of goods to our own shops. 10 In the headquarter in Billund and in our shops we have a policy around not using disposable plastic water bottles and instead Ball Group provide the employees with their own refillable water bottle. We are also in a process where the traditional lightning step by step is replaced with LED lightning. 4. BALL GROUP EMPLOYEES 4.1. THE UNDER-REPRESENTED GENDER One of the bearing beams of the UN Global Compact is the wish for equality across genders, races and religions. In 2018 the executive management team consists of 2 females, and 3 males incl. the CEO. 4.2 APPRENTICES / TRAINEES Ball Group wishes to support young people in their aim for education and currently we have 7 employees following an apprentice program – 3 at the head office and 4 in the shops respectively. We expect to continue the support of new trainees and apprentice in the future and aim for the same number in 2019. 4.3 WORKING CONDITIONS Figure 2 illustrate that we are a company that mostly attracts women – due to our position in women’s fashion industry.

In 2018 we had 3 female and 1 male employees on maternity leave. We are very happy that everything has gone well for our employees and that healthy children were born.

At Ball Group we take pride in the fact that our employees are healthy and happy. We believe that it should be fun, safe and satisfying to be at work, while keeping a balance between work and family life. Therefore, at a certain extent we offer our employees flexibility to work from home from time to time. Our employees can use an onsite massage therapist during work hours, get advice from a chiropractor in proper working conditions at the workstations and attend first aid course. Furthermore, we have a station with first aid kit and a defibrillator. Ball Group offers all employees a pension and health care scheme. For a small monthly fee there is free access to tea, coffee, water, fruits and luncheon. 12 5. OBJECTIVES FOR 2018 5.1 RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT In 2018 Ball Group will continue to follow our strategy for responsible supply chain management where transparency and traceability are one of the cornerstones. Being aware of that RSCM is a long haul move and an ongoing process. We will continue to work with various projects within environment impact, more sustainable materials and evaluation of our supplier base. We will also continue with our on-site audit and inspection program as an integrated part of supplier evaluation and cooperation. In 2018 we conducted 3 audits, and we expect to increase the number to 5 onsite audits in 2019. This is based on the fact, that a competent follow up of audits and their findings are more important than just the number of audit reports. In 2018 we have performed more than 50 chemical tests which was what we aimed for in 2017. The Ball Group RSL will be updated once a year and become more comprehensive to prevent and reduce the use of harmful chemicals. 6. CONCLUSION The large increase of new employees this year has been a great challenge, and we have invested a great deal of energy and resources within our organization, in order to have a smooth integration of the many new employees. Responsible Supply Chain management is a never-ending journey and process, and we will continue to focus on direct sourcing, building a strong supplier base and strict chemical management. We hope that the demand for more sustainable materials will be stronger, and the number of garments made of certified organic cotton and recycled materials will increase in 2019. We look forward to continuing our work and development of business in 2019, in close collaboration with our customers, partners and suppliers. 13
