Together with our Brazilian distributor H. Strattner, KARL STORZ has been supporting the project “EC-FMUSP – Expedição Cirúrgica da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo” (Surgical Expedition of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo) since 2013. This project was originally designed by medical students in collaboration with physicians from HC FMUSP (Hospital das Clínicas FMUSP) and the Cleveland Clinic and each year a new generation of students is involved in this activity. The main objective is to contribute to the social, academic and professional formation of the university students through actions which are designed to improve the health conditions in remote and vulnerable places in Brazil. EC-FMUSP aims at objective improvements in the present, by providing deprived populations with clinical care and by the development of a critical awareness and technical learning for future doctors. The medical care includes diagnostics, medical imaging and minimally invasive surgeries. The project combines aspects of medical training, research and free medical care as well as the establishment of medical structures in remote regions. In the project, the medical students have contact with each stage of the process, starting from project planning through to scientific assistance and medical care. In addition, a Scientific Symposium with themes on Gynecology, Gastroenterology and Anesthesiology was The project consists of three pillars: Assistance, Education and Research. held for local staff. • With regards to assistance, the project is designed to alleviate part of the surgical Together with the Expedição Cirúrgica team, every year, we have been able to increase the number demand in the poor areas, perform complete gynecological, digestive and ultrasound examinations of people that can benefit from minimally invasive surgeries and spread the knowledge about these and realize educational activities for the population. Furthermore, it brings minimally invasive procedures, improving the health care in remote areas of Brazil. technology to places where it has not been present so far, including local continuity plans. Finally, The project thereby contributes to improving medical care in Brazil’s rural areas, spreading minimally the project proposes management measures at the hospital, municipal and state level to invasive techniques, and providing training in the handling of endoscopic instruments and devices. improve the situation. Together with the local dealer, KARL STORZ supported this activity again in 2019 by providing the following: • In relation to education, the project brings the undergraduate student in contact with a different reality from that seen in tertiary hospitals in big cities. It integrates the student in each stage of the • Supply of endoscopic equipment and instruments surgical process, so that they experience the surgical procedure in a global and longitudinal • Prior training of program participants on the handling of devices and instruments at the manner, from admission to hospital discharge and it provides technical learning of surgeries and KARL STORZ training facility in São Paulo diseases, in radiology and ultrasound.

In addition, the expedition promotes the application of previously developed projects related to surgery and it is designed to motivate graduates to better understand the area of academic research. Currently, about 50 students and physicians of the renowned Brazilian Medical School (FMUSP) and Cleveland Clinic are involved in the project and this year the expedition was realized in São Gabriel do Oeste – Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) between June 29 and July 6, 2019. São Gabriel do Oeste has a population of 24,000 inhabitants and is located in a less privileged area of Brazil, with few resources for the health system. Complex procedures, such as laparoscopic hysterectomy, are not available in this region. The nearest place would be Campo Grande, the state capital, which is located over 137 km away. The local economy is dependent on agriculture, pig farming and cattle breeding. This town has now been selected for this project, and the number of surgical procedures performed during this initiative has helped hundreds of people, many of whom would not be able to go through this kind of treatment elsewhere. Since the first Surgical Expedition (Expedição Cirúrgica) in 2013, the amount of performed surgeries has doubled, starting with 32 procedures and now in 2019 we have reached a total of 67 procedures. In five Students of the renowned Brazilian Medical School FMUSP participating in the EC-FMUSP program (July 2019) days of surgeries, a total of 67 procedures (laparoscopic and transvaginal) were performed, with a total of 43 gastric procedures and 24 gynecological procedures.

Importantly, this fact co-exists with a relatively high level of unemployment. It also contributes to individuals’ low levels of success in finding employment after successful completion of education and training. It is clear that there is a tangible problem arising from the mismatch between the supply of and demand for skills in the South African labor market. The best way to address this mismatch and to ameliorate the implications that arise as a result, is to implement a successful, comprehensive and credible HRD (Human Resources Development) strategy. In view of our current and projected economic and social development activities and objectives, it is necessary to adopt a shortas well as medium-term perspective. To this end, KARL STORZ South Africa has successfully contributed towards the Human Capital Development Strategy of South Africa by investing in the improved qualifications of students as well as providing graduates an opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge and gain valuable work The KARL STORZ staff joined in together with all the donations secured for the cats and dogs (July 2019) experience for the purpose of them obtaining gainful employment.

CHOC is a non-profit organization made up of caring, committed and passionate people who stand up for and support the well-being of children and teenagers diagnosed with cancer or lifethreatening blood disorders and their families. They have homes throughout the various regions in South Africa. CHOC homes depend on support and donations for food, payment of medical bills, transport and the support of caretakers. Some caretakers travel 2-3 hours to support their children with most being unable to afford the costs as they come from underprivileged communities. The Centurion home accommodates children under the ages of 18 but the most common age group is between the ages of 3 and 12 years. They can accommodate 8 children and their caretakers. The number of children in the house varies as their treatment processes differ due to the hospital protocol. Employees of the KARL STORZ Johannesburg office had a tour of the home and were given a lecture about cancer and educated on how they can take care and support our families and friends affected by this disease. With great teamwork amongst colleagues, KARL STORZ managed to donate food as per CHOC’s wish list, put together party packs for the children at the home and did some much-needed cleaning. 36 37 IX.

It is It aims to raise adolescents’ interest in mathematics, IT, natural sciences, important to them to understand existing things, comprehend interrelationships, and and technology as well as to discover and nurture young talent. Nationwide, discover new things. This year’s Jugend forscht motto “Don’t ask me. Ask yourself!” more than 100 regional competitions are held each year. Participants range puts this motivation and participant initiative in a nutshell.” (February 2019) in age from 4th grade through to age 21. (Source: http://www.jugend-forscht. de/) “Looking for the researchers of tomorrow” was the motto of the first Jugend Michael Beck forscht event in 1965, initiated by the publisher Henri Nannen. Mayor of Tuttlingen “In our town, research plays an increasingly important role. Many of our companies This year’s Jugend forscht competition (2019) was held under the motto “Frag nicht mich. Frag Dich!” have been active in this area for many years, and our university campus now regularly (Don’t ask me. Ask yourself!). This was the 54th round of Germany’s most successful youth competition. contributes new impulses as well. Last summer’s opening of the Innovation and Regional competitions were held throughout Germany and the winners qualified for the next round in state Research Center was a milestone in this regard. This makes it all the more important and federal competitions.

Available via QR code (please scan): The competition’s sponsors are already looking forward to the next Donau-Hegau regional competition, which will be held in late February 2020: “Schaffst du!” (You can do it!) is the motto of the 2020 “Jugend forscht” youth research competition. The next regional competition will again be organized by the sponsors KARL STORZ and City of Tuttlingen and held at the KARL STORZ Visitor Centre and the Civic Center of Tuttlingen. For 2020, we expect a total of 134 participants and around 70 projects in seven disciplines (as of December 2019). School meets medical technology To give young adults an idea of how medical technology is designed currently and will be in the future, in July 2019, KARL STORZ invited about 150 students of Tuttlingen academic secondary schools as part of the “School meets medical technology” event. In an introductory presentation, the 11th graders gained a variety of practical insights into current challenges and solutions in medical technology. Innovations that make surgical procedures less invasive and digital solutions that offer added value to both surgeons and patients were presented as well. Afterward, the future graduates had an opportunity to gather valuable information related to their potential training and career choices and learned about the varied vocational training and university degree programs available at the company. In a question and answer session, important information and practical tips about work and opportunities at KARL STORZ were exchanged. The presentations were followed by the practical part of the program, where students were invited to actively take a closer look at the training of future surgeons. Using virtual reality test simulators, they tested their hand-eye coordination and tried to perform various medical techniques. At three further hands-on stations, they took advantage of the opportunity to put their new theoretical knowledge directly into practice by trying out the presented instruments and devices. They were once again invited to prove their dexterity by performing intubation on an airway model, for instance. A tour of the KARL STORZ Visitor Centre completed the program. 38 39 School project with the Wild Wings team For the sixth year in a row, KARL STORZ has implemented school partnership projects “Strong Together” in collaboration with the local ice hockey club Schwenninger Wild Wings. Whereas in the past, school classes and groups of students were invited to apply with social projects or projects related to the topic of “Exercise & Sports”, the focus topic in 2019/2020 was “Healthy Nutrition”. In this new project round, students were asked to think about why healthy nutrition is so important and how they can integrate healthy nutrition into their school days. Participating is very easy and well worth it: KARL STORZ provides the three student teams that present the three best project ideas with up to €1,500 in funding for implementing these ideas. To end up in the top three, it is a good idea to combine a creative application with a strong project idea and a clearly defined goal, that is, to state how the project manages to integrate healthy nutrition into daily life. In addition, KARL STORZ and the Schwenninger Wild Wings support the three winning projects in the organizational implementation of their projects. As part of the closing event after project implementation, the three top projects have an additional chance to win between €500 and €1,000 for their project implementation, achieved results, and student dedication. A motivational trailer was used to contact the schools of the counties Rottweil, Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, and Tuttlingen, and invite them to participate in the competition. Classes may still apply with their project ideas until February 2020.

The class established a waveboard club, where students can learn and practice the basic techniques of waveboarding while wearing appropriate safety gear in an effort to integrate more sports and fun into everyday school life. They also wrote detailed instructions containing useful tips and tricks for waveboarding safety for future club members. At the closing event held at the KARL STORZ Meeting Center in Tuttlingen, the three project teams had yet another chance of winning. The student groups presented their projects to the invited public, and KARL STORZ and the Schwenninger Wild Wings awarded prizes on the basis of the project idea, creativity in implementation, and the project’s achieved results. KARL STORZ Head of Human Resources, Stefan Ahlhaus, ice hockey player Simon Danner, and Dennis Heitzmann, Head of Sponsoring & Hospitality at the Wild Wings, congratulated all students and announced the following results: First place in the idea competition went to the “#leParcoursula” project team of St. Ursula Schools in Villingen, who received an additional €1,000 for their class fund. With its equally excellent project, the class from Rupert-Mayer School in Spaichingen also received first place with an award of €1,000. The waveboard club of Eichendorffschule in Donaueschingen took an outstanding second place with an award of €750. In addition, the Wild Wings forward Simon Danner, who has been sponsoring the project since its initiation, was available to the students for a signing session and selfies. “The goal of this year’s ‘Strong Together!’ idea competition is to integrate exercise, play, and sports into everyday school life, even beyond physical education class. Together with KARL STORZ, we want to support and strengthen the involvement of our young generation. We are pleased that as part of the cooperation project, we were Closing event of the “Gemeinsam stark” (Strong Together) cooperation project. KARL STORZ and the able to highlight exercise as a means for learning and the development of team spirit,” explained Schwenninger Wild Wings congratulate the students from Villingen, Spaichingen, and Donaueschingen (June 2019) ice hockey player Simon Danner. In late 2018, we started the fifth round of the school partnership project “Gemeinsam stark!” (“Strong Together!”), which was initiated by KARL STORZ and the Schwenninger Wild Wings: Whereas in the past, students were invited to apply with social projects, this year’s focus was on “Exercise & Sports”. In this year’s event, students were asked to think about how they can create opportunities for getting more Global Compact Principles 3 – 6: Labor exercise and doing more sports in everyday life to make it less sedentary and more active. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right By January 2019, groups of students in grades 7 and up were invited to apply with a creative project to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; the effective idea related to the topic of “Exercise & Sports”. From among 11 applications, a jury made up of abolition of child labor; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and representatives of KARL STORZ and the Schwenninger Wild Wings chose the projects of Rupert-Mayer occupation School in Spaichingen, St. Ursula Schools in Villingen, and Eichendorffschule in Donaueschingen. As a family business, KARL STORZ consistently strives to design the workplace such that employees can In recent months, KARL STORZ funded the implementation of these projects with up to €1,500 per optimally contribute to the company while allowing for personal creativity and creation of meaning. project.

Parkour particularly requires in September 2018, women still only hold about 15% of German technical jobs (MINT = mathematics, creativity and teamwork. Using obstacles, the students taking part in the club learn and practice various informatics, natural sciences, and technology). At KARL STORZ, women represent 44.6% (2018: 38.4%) techniques, which they can later perfect outside. of workers in manufacturing and 26.1% (2018: 32.1%) of those in Research & Development. The company is happy about this stable result, which is far above the state average. This is considered the result of consistent human resources policies that focus on abilities rather than gender roles. 42 43 I. KARL STORZ Employee Representative Committee II. Support of working parents Background To promote and intensify direct communication between staff and company management, a new body – the Employee Representative Committee – was established in August 2017. The goal of this Employee Representative Committee is to offer employees direct contact persons within the staff to whom they can voice their concerns, wishes, and criticisms regarding their work at KARL STORZ. The Employee Representative Committee collects these concerns and discusses them with the company management during periodic meetings. Through this body, KARL STORZ aims to engage in an open, honest, and transparent dialog with employees – regardless of hierarchies. The body currently includes a total of 20 participants across all areas and functions. Employees can confidentially contact the employee representatives either personally or via email and submit any topics for discussion. Results In 2019 KARL STORZ again increased its long-term commitment to supporting working parents. For the In 2019, the Employee Representative Committee addressed the following topics to company management tenth consecutive year, KARL STORZ expanded its cooperation with the local childcare facility “Haus and contributed to a solution to benefit the staff: der Familie” [House of Family] and the childcare facility Denk mit!

The theme of Beijing Expo is “live green, live better”, which coincided with KARL STORZ values toward nature preservation, environment protection and people’s wellbeing. Integrating horticulture into nature and touching souls with nature were fully demonstrated in the 503 hectares of expo park area. 140 KARL STORZ staff and their family members observed the biodiversity, the co-existence of wetlands and woodlands, and the self-sustainability and self-sufficiency of the ecosystem. To make the trip a learning and bonding experience, KARL STORZ staff planned and prepared group games, picnics, and children’s activities for the 140 people. Co-workers and their families got to know each other more through the group activities, whilst their children became immersed in the outdoors and the quality parenting time. KARL STORZ China offices, including Xi’an, Nanjing, and others have been also regularly hosting company-wide outdoor activities to enable staff to regain the balance of strong body and clear mind, unleash the creative potential of human nature under the sun, and provide a healthy and sustaining cycle of working hard and living better.

Support of education and apprenticeship training Following up on our previous Progress Reports, we want to highlight our efforts in the area of education and apprenticeship training. The preservation of proven structures and concepts and the initiation of new projects demonstrates the great commitment of KARL STORZ to the field of apprenticeship training. Training and university studies at KARL STORZ Employees are a company’s most important resource. Therefore, KARL STORZ places great value on young people receiving a solid education today, as they are tomorrow’s qualified employees. In 2019, we hired 42 trainees and 13 university students who are enrolled in a practice-oriented program at the BadenWürttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW). In addition, 52 trainees and students successfully completed their training or university degree and we offered more than 90% of them an unlimited employment. Currently, there are a total of 180 young people who are in training or enrolled in university studies. Since 2006, KARL STORZ has also been inviting interested parents of first-year apprentices to an afternoon event, where they receive a company tour and the opportunity to talk with representatives of the Human Resources department. This year, 40 participants attended the parent afternoon and learned about how KARL STORZ medical devices are manufactured at various workplaces. In the trainee workshop, they were familiarized with the work environment and tasks of industrial apprentices and could admire the first items made by the job entrants. While touring the Visitor Centre, parents additionally gained an impression of the wide range and variety of medical device and system innovations and were invited to try out the virtual reality simulators used by trainee surgeons to practice their hand-eye coordination. Xi’an staff and their families group trip (August 2019) China: “Trees or Forest” – KARL STORZ China 14-day corporate walking challenge During October 2019, KARL STORZ China concluded a 14-day corporate walking challenge using mobile apps that connected all KARL STORZ China offices in 43 cities. The challenge was participated in by 435 employees, with total walking steps reaching 50,897,368 steps. The mobile app randomly assigned all KARL STORZ China employees with a group number, so staff across offices formed virtual walking groups online and accumulated group walking steps in different cities at different times of their choosing. The app calculator then reported live and daily group progress as well as individual walking champions. Walking steps accumulated by the group will then be converted to the number of trees that the KARL STORZ company will donate and plant in the western desert plateaus of China. Next year, 39 trees will be planted in Ejina in the name of KARL STORZ. 2019 marks the second annual corporate walking challenge organized by KARL STORZ China, in support of the “better work, better life” tradition that the company pursues. KARL STORZ walking champions brought their perseverance and sports spirit to work and to life, while at the same time contributing to the invaluable future of forestry in western China. The apprentices proudly showed their parents the various workplaces in the trainee workshop (November 2019) 48 49 Trainee exchange with supplier Germany’s best young surgical instrument makers: KARL STORZ is proud to have trained the national winner for the third time in a row To promote the professional qualification and the exchange of experience of our trainees, we established an exchange program with a local supplier which has been running since 2009. The industrial apprentices in For his excellent performance, Dennis Mitecki, who completed his apprenticeship as a surgical both companies spend 2 months at the other company on an exchange basis to learn new processes and instrument maker at KARL STORZ in the beginning of this year, was recently selected chamber winner skills. The exchange especially expands the apprentices’ understanding of processes involving cooperation and then state winner. With his final exam piece – a bone punch – he is now also national winner in the between companies. country-wide “Pros accomplish something” performance competition of the German craft trades, an award that honors him as one of the best young tradesmen in Germany. Cooperation without handicaps – one-week internship for trainees at a facility for Following an internship, Dennis Mitecki started his apprenticeship as a surgical instrument maker at people with disabilities KARL STORZ in 2015. Like all surgical instrument makers, he completed the Metals introductory course at the trainee workshop and was introduced to various skills such as laser welding, brazing, and offhand grinding in the first year of his apprenticeship. From his second year onward, he rotated through In collaboration with an association for people with disabilities, “Lebenshilfe für Menschen mit various departments in Manufacturing and took additional courses, such as a CNC class. In the Behinderungen” [Life aid for human beings with disabilities], Tuttlingen District Association, KARL STORZ KARL STORZ trainee workshop, Dennis Mitecki intensively prepared for the practical final examination. has been offering a one-week internship at Lebenshilfe for trainees in their first year of training through The examination particularly tests manual skills in conventional cutting, off-hand grinding, joining the project “Cooperation without handicaps” since 2003. Beyond professional qualification and the social techniques (laser welding/soldering/riveting), surface treatment, and assembly. Due to his excellent interaction with co-workers, this project enables trainees and students to learn to interact with other people performance in the written and practical examinations, Dennis Mitecki is the 11th state and 10th national in our society. In Tuttlingen, Lebenshilfe runs a workshop for people with disabilities, an assisted living winner trained by KARL STORZ in recent years. This year alone, a total of 54 apprentices and university facility, and a facility that provides support and care for people with severe disabilities. students successfully completed their training at KARL STORZ. This includes Florian Manger, the 2nd chamber winner and guild champion in the surgical instrument maker trade. Another winner, Leon Initially, KARL STORZ apprentices and university students attend a local information event followed by a Schmidt, was named guild champion in the precision mechanic trade. In recognition of their outstanding visit to the various departments of Lebenshilfe Tuttlingen. In the subsequent weeks, the apprentices and apprenticeship performance, Dennis Mitecki, Florian Manger and Leon Schmid were personally received students have the opportunity to complete a voluntary, one-week internship at Lebenshilfe. Internships and honored by Managing Director Karl-Christian Storz and Chair of the Supervisory Board Dr. h. c. mult. Sybill Storz. can be completed at the workshop, the assisted living facility, or at the care facility. At a final event, the interns then reflect on their experiences and impressions together with the Lebenshilfe employees, and more detailed information about the causes and types of disabilities is discussed. This project benefits both interns and people with disabilities because the personal collaboration and exchange reduces prejudice and makes integration a reality in everyday life. This year, 18 KARL STORZ apprentices and students completed an internship at Lebenshilfe. The KARL STORZ management is particularly committed to support people with disabilities and their integration into society. Therefore, we not only support the “Cooperation without handicaps” project but have been placing production orders with the Lebenshilfe workshop for years. The workshop employs people aged 18 to 65 with mental and multiple disabilities. The employees are supported occupationally and also receive personal development opportunities in the form of numerous accompanying programs, such as on numeracy and money, cooking and baking as well as through music therapy, etc. Young talent Dennis Mitecki was awarded 1st place in the national championship of the surgical instrument maker trade in 2019 (November 2019) In various areas of the Lebenshilfe association, KARL STORZ apprentices gain insights into the work and life of people with disabilities Dennis Mitecki, Dr. h. c. mult. Sybill Storz, Florian Manger, Leon Schmidt and Karl-Christian Storz (December 2019) 50 51 Internship year with technical focus In cooperation with the local Steinbeis vocational school, we support adolescents who have not found an apprenticeship position to help them get ready to enter the professional world. During the one-year program, participants attend the vocational school three days per week. On the remaining two days of the week, participants work at the KARL STORZ trainee workshop. The project’s practice orientation is intended to improve the readiness of participants to enter an apprenticeship program. KARL STORZ actively contributes to the support and development of these students. We aim to offer a regular apprenticeship to 19 program participants. Educational partnership with local schools Since 2009, KARL STORZ has been in a cooperation agreement with the Hermann-Hesse-Realschule (intermediate-level secondary school). In 2010, we added an agreement with the Wilhelmschule. Throughout the school year 2018/2019, we conducted joint events such as • Job internships & tours • Technology classes at the KARL STORZ trainee workshop • Applicant training, including a “real” job interview with staff from KARL STORZ Human Resources • In-house exhibition, where KARL STORZ trainees present their occupations to the students • Support of Girl’s Day and the Technolino project to offer girls and elementary students informal and age-appropriate insights into technical occupations KARL STORZ trainees with three students and the Director of the Leidse Instrumentenmakers School (October 2019) Exchange program with vocational school in the Netherlands In cooperation with the vocational school Leidse Instrumentmakers School (LIS) in the Netherlands, which specializes in precision mechanics and medical technology, KARL STORZ again conducted an exchange program for third-year apprentices in surgical instrument making this year. Unlike the dual education system in Germany, where vocational schools and companies collaboratively offer vocational training, separated into theory and practice, at LIS, both theory and practice are taught at the vocational school. Three KARL STORZ apprentices traveled to the Netherlands for two weeks, and in return, three LIS students will visit KARL STORZ and the Tuttlingen vocational school Ferdinand-von-Steinbeis in January 2020. All costs for the exchange are covered by KARL STORZ and LIS. The exchange program allows apprentices to familiarize themselves with the work environment of another culture that has a different vocational training system. Thanks to the cooperation with LIS, KARL STORZ can now for the first time offer a stay abroad for apprentices in the mechanical field. 52 53 IV.

In 2019 the pilot Communication Curriculum for managers was completed. 11 participants were part of the Curriculum which took place in 3 modules over 2 days. The program is designed primarily to foster the soft skills of managers and strengthen the exchange between the managers at KARL STORZ across the various departments as well as between the various leadership development programs. The learning groups that have been introduced are designed to anchor the learned topics in the company in a sustainable manner. Internal IT training & language courses In collaboration with Tuttlingen Volkshochschule (adult education center), KARL STORZ offers interested employees IT training on commonly used Microsoft Office programs as well as language classes in English, French, and Spanish. The training and instructional materials are paid for by KARL STORZ. 56 57 Global Compact Principles 7-9: Environment Switch from Xenon to LED light sources throughout the product range Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; undertake initiatives As of January 01, 2019, KARL STORZ completed the switch from Xenon to LED light sources throughout to promote greater environmental responsibility; and encourage the development and diffusion of the product range in nearly all markets, and the company will complete the switch worldwide in the coming environmentally friendly technologies. years. Switching from Xenon-based to LED light sources markedly reduces the lamps’ energy consumption. In addition, the lamps’ 60 times longer life eliminates regular lamp replacements. This reduces both resource The sustainable and responsible use of resources is particularly important to KARL STORZ, a globally active consumption and environmental impact, for example due to the elimination of mercury and lead, which are company with a long history, and its Managing Director Karl-Christian Storz. As a family company with regional roots, present at least in small amounts in Xenon lamps. KARL STORZ has been committed to environmental protection for decades, and the company strives to protect the environment for subsequent generations as well. We believe that environmental protection and economic success are not mutually exclusive. At KARL STORZ, environmental protection and resource conservation are important criteria in business decisions. Manufacturing high-quality, multi-use products and using durable materials achieves long product lifetimes and thereby conserves resources. When developing new products, we place particular value on durability. I. Environmental protection through innovative medical devices, advanced manufacturing methods and energy saving processing Additive manufacturing using selective laser melting (SLM) In conventional subtractive manufacturing methods such as milling and turning, the component geometry is produced by cutting material away from a solid block of material. In the process, most of the initial material ends up as shavings, and only a small percentage remains part of the workpiece. The shavings, which are contaminated with cooling lubricant, must then be recycled in a complex process. In additive manufacturing using selective laser melting (SLM), the metallic powder is melted only where material is actually needed in the workpiece. Final machining of the generated component is done only where extreme precision is required. This near-net-shape production significantly minimizes the mass of generated shavings. In 2019, KARL STORZ introduced selective laser melting (SLM) manufacturing technology at the Tuttlingen site. After qualification is complete, this machine will produce near-net-shape customer components. A compact all-in-one system: TELE PACK + from KARL STORZ with an integrated LED light source that ensures longlasting bright and uniform illumination Certification in accordance with ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems standard For the sites Dr.-Karl-Storz-Str. 34 (Tuttlingen) and Take-Off Gewerbepark 83 (Neuhausen), KARL STORZ has successfully introduced an environmental management system on the basis of ISO 14001:2015. The introduction of this standard ensures, among other things, that the environmental impact, such as emissions, and the resource consumption of our products and activities are considered and improved Beam melting process © Fraunhofer IPK where appropriate. Another objective of this standard is the continuous improvement of the company’s environmental performance. An audit, which was documented in a report, determined that the management system meets the requirements set out in the standard. The ISO 14001 certificate was granted in October 2019. 58 59 Waste separation concept KARL STORZ Group – Subsidiaries’ Initiatives As part of internal environmental and resource protection policies and the Commercial Waste Ordinance (Gewerbeabfallverordnung, GewAbfV), which requires separate collection and disposal of certain types of waste, Advanced Manufacturing KARL STORZ Waste Management introduced a new waste separation concept in 2014. Since then, the concept has been gradually expanded. In 2019, separate collection and disposal was implemented at all German KARL STORZ Traditional machining generates a significant amount of metal waste. Although this excess material sites. In the past, separate collection and disposal particularly applied to residual waste and confidential documents. can be recycled, the process is energy intensive and emits a large amount of CO2. New manufacturing According to the new disposal concept, each KARL STORZ employee is to properly dispose of his or her waste in techniques offer a cleaner alternative. Near-net or net-shape technology such as additive manufacturing the appropriate waste containers in accordance with internal policies. In addition to the various production wastes, and metal injection molding reduce the material waste significantly. KARL STORZ Imaging has begun the following wastes will be collected separately: using impact-extrusion technology to fabricate equipment housings, knobs, and other components. The process uses fewer materials and resources without sacrificing performance. KARL STORZ is working • Paper and cardboard to introduce these and similar technologies across all manufacturing sites to extend these benefits globally. • Residual waste • Plastics Streamlined Logistics • Wood KARL STORZ opened a new distribution center in Auburn, Massachusetts. The site consolidates operations that were previously performed at separate locations. Most of the floor space is devoted to • Electronic devices distribution and logistics, with additional room for conferencing and technology demonstration. Work • (Rechargeable) Batteries areas were designed in consultation with the manufacturing staff to optimize efficiency, safety, and comfort. Ergonomic workstations, conveyor systems, high-capacity carousels, and other efficiency • Metals enhancements minimize product turnaround time while maximizing throughput. The new facility is • Glass relatively close to a major metropolitan center – Boston – which can reduce driving time for both commuting employees and products in transit. It also increases the potential for attracting a diverse • Spray cans workforce. With room to expand, the facility will help drive the local economy and sustain a highly skilled workforce. For each of these waste items, appropriately labeled containers are found at collection points located at the workspaces, in the specialist departments, or in the respective buildings. Process efficiencies at the Auburn distribution center include an overhead tote conveyor, which keeps walkways clear and safe while preventing wasted effort 60 61 II. Reduction of paper use III.

KARL STORZ pursues the long-term goal of continuously reducing paper use by improving processes and thereby sustainably contributing to resource conservation. Since 2009, our average paper use has dropped from initially 6,100 sheets per employee to 2,351 sheets (-61.3%) in 2019. Compared to last year (2,791 sheets), this corresponds to a reduction of 15.8% per employee. Digital attendance tracking and leave system In March 2019, we established an HR Service Portal that allows employees at all German and Swiss KARL STORZ locations to create and edit leave requests and time events and to view their own time statements. In the past, leave requests for vacation or flexitime were first printed out, then manually signed by the respective supervisor, and finally forwarded to the HR department by in-house mail. Through the HR service portal, employees can now digitally submit their leave or home office requests. After the employee has submitted a request, the supervisor receives an email about their worklist containing applications to be approved. The digitization of the attendance tracking and leave system further reduces our internal paper use. This process improvement also eliminates the logistical process of mailing the application, thereby further reducing our CO2 footprint. In late 2008, we introduced a fuel card system at our Tuttlingen headquarters that allows us to analyze the fuel consumption of company cars. Thanks to its consistent use since 2012, many more cars could be analyzed than in 2011 – which is the primary reason for the significant increase in driven kilometers. Since 2013, the average fuel consumption per car has dropped, and in 2019, it reached the lowest average so far, at 6.46 liters per 100 kilometers. This equals a reduction of 1.7% compared to the previous year. CO2 emissions rose by 6% because of the increase in traveled kilometers. The 2019 analysis is based on a total of 231 vehicles (2018: 212 vehicles). 62 63 IV. KARL STORZ bicycle leasing program KARL STORZ employees for climate-friendly mobility From July 1st to the 21st, 2019, another round of the STADTRADELN (City Biking) climate alliance campaign was held: In the category of cities with less than 49,999 inhabitants, Tuttlingen this year took a surprising 1st place on the state and national level with 363,381 kilometers traveled. Added up, the kilometers biked by all Tuttlingen teams during the City Biking event were enough to travel nine times around the globe. The KARL STORZ Aktiv company sports group recruited a team of more than 100 active cyclists this year as well; in the 21 days of the event, they traveled a total of 23,419 km by bike. The team took 4th place in the Tuttlingen competition overall and 2nd place in the Companies category. “By participating in the campaign, we want to motivate as many employees as possible to use their bikes. The main goal is to have fun, to establish the bike more firmly as a mode of transport in everyday life, and to thereby make a small, but important, contribution to protecting the climate,” commented Nader Hassanzadeh, president of the KARL STORZ Aktiv company sports group. Cycling is popular and a good way to offset the typically sedentary office work. With the introduction of a company bicycle leasing program in June 2017, KARL STORZ offers employees an attractive mobility option that actively contributes to health, to reducing traffic, and to protecting the environment. For this purpose, KARL STORZ cooperates with a bicycle leasing company and thereby enables KARL STORZ employees to conveniently finance their favorite bicycle (regular or e-bike up to 25 km/h) through lease payments. Instead of paying directly at the store, for a term of 36 months, part of the monthly gross salary is withheld as a so-called salary conversion to pay the leasing rate to the bicycle leasing company. The salary conversion reduces taxable income and social security contributions. Only the monetary advantage (1% of the gross list price of the bicycle) remains tax relevant. In total, employees can save up to 30% compared to purchasing the bicycle in cash. Since the introduction of the program, 414 individual leasing contracts have been entered into.
