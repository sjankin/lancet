ScanCom Group is a leading player in the global market for outdoor furniture. To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way – the sustainable way”. However, we must admit our principles are under pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way, which will not let us change our focus on what we believe is the right long-term strategy. It is important to stress that our CSR strategy and business values are not a project that starts and ends, but an ongoing willingness to improve our sustainable business model. “Doing Business the Right Way” and focus on sustainability can go hand in hand with improved operational performances and profitability, as our 2018/19 results are showing. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in late 2014 when securing the “CSR Abroad Prize”, an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to continue our CSR strategy. 6 UN Global Compact: communication on progress SUSTAINABILITY FOR MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND AND KEY SUPPLIERS OPERATIONS Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom Compact are requirements for the improvement controls all materials and products in order to meet of CSR level in the supply chain.

INDEPENDENT SUPPLIER RECOGNITION Ikea, after 6 years of business cooperation, recognized ScanCom’s commitment from the top management and the entire organization towards CSR and HSE. Our transparency combined with our track record and the internal CSR and HSE control and monitoring systems in place to ensure compliance resulted in awarding ScanCom in August 2019 with the Iway Independent Supplier status. This confirms the trust in our commitment and abilities and will allow self-monitoring of performance and continuous improvement. HUMAN RIGHTS ScanCom International A/S is committed to influence the employees and the business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be reviewed in our website: http://www.scancom.net ScanCom used the BSCI and SMETA monitoring system to ensure that the contracted manufacturers, as a minimum, are in compliant with the basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labour conditions. Besides, for season 2018/19 ScanCom has verified the social compliance performance at 24 contract manufacturers and put in use for all 24 contract manufacturers who were registered and audited under the BSCI platform with acceptable rating. BSCI MONITORING OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ScanCom has continued to increase the collaboration and commitment from the existing contract manufacturers (CMs) and new CMs over the requirements from BSCI platform with acceptable rating from BSCI audits. Besides, ScanCom has also extended the support to the new business partners, who ScanCom is going to set the business relationship with, in conducting the gaps assessment at their facilities on their request and guiding them on remediation of the non-conformance areas to prepare for the BSCI audit. One partner was rated at D level, a re-audit will take place in December and we’re confident that this partner will achieve C rating or better once more. 10 UN Global Compact: communication on progress Contract Manufacturers SS 17/18 SS 18/19 Production site registered on BSCI audit platform 25 24 Total number of BSCI audits, initial and re-audit 25 24 Total number of ScanCom Code of Conduct audits 25 24 BSCI Compliance Rating SS 17/18 SS 18/19 A (Outstanding) 0/25 0/24 B (Good) 0/25 1/24 C (Acceptable) 25/25 22/24 D (Improvement neededt) 0/25 1/24 E (Non-Compliant) 0/25 0/24 SUPPLIER AUDITS ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR performance levels at the suppliers.

CHILD LABOR AND FORCED LABOR During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits at CMs together with customer audits, BSCI and SMETA audits. Again, for this season, ScanCom continues to report that there was no cases of child labour or forced labour happening at ScanCom and our business partners. Current control procedures prove sufficient to ensure no child nor forced labor enters the supply chain. LABOR ScanCom continuously committed to the support and protection of labour rights including abolition of child labor, elimination of forced labor, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination or harassment and abuse.

HC figures are average of season 18/19, 14 months from July 2018 till August 2020. SCVN OVERTIME Comparing a 14 month with a 12 month season as well as an increase in total headcount were the drivers of higher overtime in season 18/19 compared to season 17/18. Season 18/19 was compliant with local regulations of maximum 200 hours a year as well as the international standard of maximum 60 hours a week. Changes in the national health insurance regulations in Vietnam caused an increase in the number of sick days and hours compared to previous years which were compensated by OT hours. 12 UN Global Compact: communication on progress EMPLOYMENT BY CONTRACT TERMS.

ScanCom invests in incentive systems, education, skill building and subsequent allowance as well as childcare, transportation allowance and house rental allowance. Besides paying wages well above the minimum requirement the company also invests in the working conditions such as ergonomics, environment temperature, canteen, and bathroom facilities. 14 UN Global Compact: communication on progress Going beyond the legal requirements on working environment, ScanCom has installed an in-house air-cooling system in labor intensive areas to deal with the regional normal high temperatures. Season 18/19 saw a spike in labor turnover from 51% to 69%. A fast growing economy, driven by the industrial sector has increased labor competition in general and allowed migrated workers to find new suitable jobs close to their rural home towns in new established industrial clusters. -SCIN In terms of labor turnover for season 18/19, the employee turnover rate for SCIN was positive compared to season 17/18 from 7.8% to 5.33%. -SCBR The labour turnover of SCBR saw significant variation from the previous year due to high movement at the Rio Grande do Sul “Minas do Leão” site, which was adjusting its staffing Headcount Turnover by Category. 15 AGE DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES (FIGURES ARE ACTUALAUGUST 2019) Labour contract term Site Season Group Grand total 18-25 26-35 36-45 46-55 56-60 SCVN 2017-2018 Management 3 144 144 26 1 318 (Headcount in June 2018) Staff 55 138 31 4 4 232 Worker 698 1,329 710 176 11 2,924 Total Headcount 756 1,611 885 206 16 3,474 2018-2019 Management 16 142 184 34 3 379 (Headcount in August 2019) Staff 56 163 53 8 4 284 Worker 1,082 1,717 943 239 17 3,998 Total Headcount 1,154 2,022 1,180 281 24 4,661 SCIN 2017-2018 Management 0 0 16 10 0 26 (Headcount in June 2018) Staff 0 13 7 2 0 22 Worker 22 58 72 22 0 174 Total Headcount 22 71 95 34 0 222 2018-2019 Management 0 2 13 12 1 28 (Headcount in August 2019) Staff 0 11 7 2 0 20 Worker 16 38 73 24 0 151 Total Headcount 16 51 93 38 1 199 SCBR 2017-2018 Management 0 1 1 1 0 3 (Headcount in June 2018) Staff 4 7 1 1 0 13 Worker 5 21 20 4 0 50 Total Headcount 9 29 22 6 0 66 2018-2019 Management 0 1 1 1 0 3 (Headcount in August 2019) Staff 6 10 2 1 0 19 Worker 4 25 23 8 0 60 Total Headcount 10 36 26 10 0 82 The low median age of ScanCom’s employees reflects the age distribution in the population of the countries where manufacturing takes place.

Differences in the above figures are relating to different kind of effort, skills and responsibilities. -SCVN The legal minimum wage is annually adjusted in January, ScanCom has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level compared to this minimum. ScanCom applies principles for actual living costs and market competition rather than the minimum wage for remuneration strategy. In season 2018/2019, the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 29% higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continues the policy of an extra payment of 2.5% health, social and unemployment insurance monthly as the financial support to the workers. Most production jobs that require skills such as grinding, welding, painting, special machine operation (CNC, robot, etc.) are traditionally filled by male workers. This explains the current discrepancy in monthly wages between male and female workers. The hiring and education for such skill positions is made available to all workers without discrimination. -SCIN To increase efficiency of contract worker usage (minimize number of contract worker in certain months), SCIN increase 20.9% of overtime hours instead of hiring contract worker. SCIN pays contract workers at a rate of minimum wages level as decided by government and all permanent employees were at the (minimum 11.3%) higher level than regulation (minimum wages), depending on position and responsibility. -SCBR Paid wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. SCBR salaries were at least 28% above the national regulation, which is a positive factor in terms of the retention of staff. DISCRIMINATION ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. 17 HEALTH AND SAFETY OHSAS 18001 To build a strong culture to prevent accidents, incidents and work related illness is an important priority for all ScanCom subsidiaries and departments. Everyone should go home healthy from work and all management is focussed on protecting our workers’ health. For season 2018/2019, SCVN passed the annual OHSAS 18001:2007 audit for the occupational health and safety management system with the positive result. In relation to the OHSAS 18001 requirements, SCVN has now fully implemented standards associated with firefighting, safety regulations and customer requirements related to health and safety.

A large part is due to the increase in headcount and comparing 14 months to 12 months. Besides these statistical differences the higher labor turnover and inflow of new workers supporting the company’s growth – increased the number of new and in-experienced workers. This higher ratio of new workers has, despite the training, contributed to more incidents as well. During our 18/19 season the government adjusted the health insurance legislation allowing for more treatable cases at hospital and doctor offices. Additionally both the father and mother are allowed to take personal leave in case if a child sickness. These developments are good for the society overall but were cause to increased sick leave days. Going forward the management has decentralized the HSE function to the operational management away from the centralized CSR department. Aim is to enhance the ownership focus and priority of the shop floor management on HSE. Risk assessment, risk based internal audits, machine safety specification and compliance, improved high level of electrical standard implementation, and effective training and part of the focus and improvements. To mitigate the impact of new workers on labor accidents the training program will be updated going forward. Existing standard health and safety, Fire Safety, and evacuation training for all sites and shifts has been maintained properly. -SCIN SCIN provided training to all new employees in health and safety, including evacuation and fire drill. These activities were twice a year for employees. SCIN also provided general training about new regulation related to health and safety with the Labour Department Officer. For new workers, supervisors conducted the training on machinery safety and quality of product. SCIN also got inspection from Labour Department in connection with health and safety at the work place (production area). -SCBR SCBR recorded an increase in the sick leave days this increase in season 18/19 besides monitoring 14 months in season 18/19 and a growth in total headcount of over 30% the numbers were also increased due domestic accidents occurred outside the company working hours and premises. Despite the reduction in the number of accidents, the time of absence of the employee was longer in season 18/19. 19 ENVIRONMENT SCVN’s environmental management system was upgraded with the new requirements from new version of ISO 14001:2015. Observed annual re-audited with a good result. Besides, applied sustainability program has induced Green-Steps in eliminating hazardous materials, reducing production waste, saving energy, and complying with REACH in preventing pollution.

The average energy consumption per output unit has however been reduced following our energy saving focus. Increased sales of our Wood Plastic Composite materials has allowed for higher in-house recycling of wood and plastic waste, both PP from injection molding and PE from Petan Fiber production. In general, all parameters show positive results due to effective management for season 18-19 compared with season 17-18. 20 UN Global Compact: communication on progress -SCIN Electrical energy consumption 2018-2019 is 0.5% lower than 2017-2018. Water: water consumption is for employee toilet and watering plants purpose only but this year is higher due to period of year (from 12 to 14 months). Sawn timber consumption and industrial waste are lower compared to the previous season. -SCBR In the latter period, a SCBR deactivated its unit in the city of Minas do Leão/RS.
