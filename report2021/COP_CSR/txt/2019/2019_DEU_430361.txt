The pace of change is accelerating rapidly in our industries. Continental is leading the way in decisively shaping this change, and we are in the process of realigning the company as a result. Mobility is increasingly being characterized by sustainability, which is why clean air, safe driving and a “healthy” mobility ecosystem are central pillars of our strategy. Our compass of values is made up of four corporate values: Trust, Passion To Win, Freedom To Act and For One Another. They apply to all employees worldwide and form the basis of our Code of Conduct. They stand for reliability in open dialogs with our relevant stakeholders – including social partners, investors and customers. In all of these discussions, we are seeing the considerable importance of sustainability continue to grow. Our values are creating value – for our company and our stakeholders alike. We asked you about your focus topics and priorities to help us systematically improve what we do to create positive impact on society. More than 1,700 employees, customers, investors, suppliers and other stakeholders participated in our sustainability survey at the start of 2019. The responses we received told us that Continental is on the right track. One clear area in which we are performing strongly is safe mobility. At the same time, you are formulating a number of different expectations and areas where we have work to do. The results of the survey were discussed and evaluated by the Executive Board and our cross-divisional Sustainability Committee. They are also the starting point for the continued development of our sustainability strategy: Step by step, we will focus even more intensively on the topics of clean mobility and climate protection, and we will work on enhancing sustainability in our supply chains and a circular economy. We are using our strengths as a company to tackle these major challenges. We are going about our work of delivering premium quality and innovative solutions in a way that is highly profitable. Our more than 244,000 employees are working day in, day out to ensure Continental’s sustainable success. We are creating an inspiring environment to support them in their work. Key elements of this include promoting diversity, flexible forms of working, digital working and our values-based corporate culture. We are on an exciting journey! This Sustainability Report shows you where we are currently. We appreciate your interest in it. On behalf of the Executive Board and our team, I hope that you enjoy reading it. We encourage you to share any ideas you have in relation to our Sustainability Report.

In accordance with our corporate strategy, we implement the quality policy with a close connection to the local markets through our worldwide development centers and quality labs as well as quality officers and certified quality management systems at our locations. This decentralized implementation is coordinated and supported by the Global Quality Leadership Team, which comprises representatives of the central functions, divisions and countries. Standardized product life cycle processes, adapted to the needs of the various business fields, ensure systematic and high-quality product development across all stages – from innovation to the end of parts supply. These processes are continuously being developed and optimized. Results and performance indicators We already offer our customers a broad range of products that contribute to safe and clean mobility, for example the following solutions: ›› Virtual A-pillar: Forward blind spots are eliminated thanks to an integrated OLED display and the combination of head-movement tracking and live images of the exterior environment. ›› EcoContact 6: This high-tech summer tire for passenger cars delivers the highest standards of safety, precise handling, long tire life and low fuel consumption.

Fixed-term contracts and temporary employment are important tools for Continental to be able to react flexibly and quickly to the requirements of the ever more rapidly changing markets. The use of temporary employment makes an important contribution to improving competitiveness and thus to safeguarding jobs at our locations. We view temporary employment as an option for increasing flexibility, to cover peaks in demand for example. It enables us to adapt as required to large-scale fluctuations in order volumes.
