We disclosed the public commitment of having 100% of the national and international resale chain with social and environmental certification by 2021, ensuring the adoption of best practices widely legitimized. In 2018, we joined the Social & Labor Convergence Project (SLCP), connected to the SAC DEVELOPMENT (Sustainable Apparel Coalition) -which aims to monitor and develop the chain on issues such as respect for human rights, labor laws and occupational health and safety. In addition, we have improved the monitoring and control process by conducting audits in the international resale suppliers’ chain. We want to maximize our potential for a positive impact on the textile chain and, therefore, we work on initiatives and programs to support the development of resale suppliers in Brazil, presented below. IMPROVED PROCESS TO TRACE OUR PRODUCTS We started a pilot project to use Blockchain technology in the traceability of CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (PMC) the chain, which was applied in two resale suppliers to monitor the product path In 2018, for the sixth consecutive year of the program, the PMC focused on the development of strategic alignment actions in the production chain in real time, allowing us greater monitoring capacity with the national resale suppliers of jeans/twill, woven fabric and knit fabric. The initiatives provided an evolution in the operation regarding the principles of sustainability. We have the plan to expand the project of our partners, resulting in the improvement of the Supplier Global Development Index (IDGF). to 10 domestic suppliers. Based on 2016, when the IGDF was restated for current valuation indices, suppliers have grown by 12 percentage points in the ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE EVALUATION first year (2017).

In 2017, the satisfaction level of responding suppliers reached 88%. In its second year, the level reached 90% satisfaction. For the beginning of the program, in 2019, those identified with greater criticality were prioritized: suppliers of textile products, suppliers of products with raw materials of forest origin and transport companies. SUPPLIER COUNCIL Formed by a group of domestic resale suppliers that are strategic for our operations, the Council is an important forum In these categories, a pilot project will be carried out to validate the program, with the participation of ten suppliers, for sharing experiences and discussing themes of common interest, in quarterly meetings, with the goal of building an considering four phases: accreditation, remote audits, face-to-face audits and follow-up of action plans, as well as efficient, competitive and sustainable chain.

LEED is an internationally recognized green building certification • 18% less power consumption for shop lighting system that ensures buildings generate less waste and consume fewer resources during both construction and when in operation. • Estimated 15% less energy consumption at headquarters • Estimated 55% less water consumption at headquarters According to the project for the construction of one of the stores, the estimate is that using sustainable construction techniques the building will consume 45% less water and 18% less electric power for lighting than a regular building. This process resulted in LEED certification at the GOLD level, until 2018, of a store and our headquarters, as well as two stores under certification process, and also in the construction of an important legacy to perpetuate this less impacting model: Since December 2015, we have grouped all the learning in the construction of certified stores and created a Construction and Remodel Manual, which establishes for internal teams and suppliers the premises, concepts and criteria for building and remodeling stores in relation to: • Operation Safety • Energy Saving • Customer Satisfaction • Sustainability • Employee Satisfaction • Accessibility • Permissions and Legalizations Since 2016, 77 stores have been built and remodeled in line with the manual, with more sustainable standards. In 2018, the manual has been updated with new learning from recent years and additionally we have created a new store model option with a simpler structure and lower material consumption, such as 60% less plaster due to the layout in areas without sheathing. 20 1 8 A N N U A L R E P O R T LO J A S R E N N E R S .

In 2018, we started the development of the Ambiente Construído project, with the purpose of introducing the principles of circular economy in the construction of new stores, remodeling and the development of furniture. In this first year of work, we have developed two pilots: 1. Circular furniture: we created a prototype of shop furniture that considered the principles of circular economy since its conception and design, which ensured furniture modularity, which can be assembled in different ways for product exposure. With that in mind, it was possible to reduce the need to have different furniture models from 30 to only two models. In addition, it was built with 100% recyclable raw material turning the disposal expense at the end of the useful life in revenue from recycling sale as well as having zero use of toxic substances. 2. Store construction reduction: we carried out a pilot project to reduce the environmental impact from store construction, which considered the premises for reducing the consumption of raw materials, reducing waste generation, reducing repair and maintenance costs while increasing the use of recycled or reclaimed raw materials. The pilot was implemented at the street store in Florianópolis – SC, and recorded significant reductions in the consumption of floors, steels, concrete and plaster and, consequently, the waste generation, which also reduced the cost of the work. “The project has great relevance for sustainability, because it brings to the context of fashion retail, an integrated approach to sustainability from the store environment to In 2019 we hope to start the replicability phase of the practices and we will make a new round of the clothing product from the design and premises of the project, for the construction pilots to consolidate the models and learnings, in addition to defining the circularity guidelines and remodeling of stores, which optimize the consumption of materials, generating less for the built environment. waste and using materials with greater potential for recyclability, and therefore bringing an integral vision of sustainability to the fashion chain”.
