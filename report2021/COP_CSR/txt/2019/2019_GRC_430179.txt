At the end of the year the winner of each month is also a candidate for the Employee of the Year.

Monitoring the Quality of Sea Water During 2018, 950 physicochemical and 650 microbiological analyses were undertaken in the aquatic farming. The physicochemical analysis includes heavy metals, mercury, residue of pesticides, as well as nutrient salts and the microbiological analysis includes TVC (Total Viable Count), Total Coliforms, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Listeria, Fecal streptococci, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas, Fecal coliforms. The intensification of the analysis and the systematic monitoring of the farming parameters ensure the maintenance of the quality of the sea environment. Monitoring the Quality of the seabed In 2018, 198 chemical analysis of sediments were undertaken, as well as 101 samples of benthos for biological analysis and classification. Monitoring Liquid Waste Parameters Liquid waste is monitored with respect to the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), the chemical oxygen demand (COD), the total suspended solids (TSS), the total nitrogen and total phosphorus levels through laboratory analysis which are carried out in both internal and external accredited laboratories. The purpose of the analysis is to ensure that the liquid waste will not alter the physicochemical properties of the final recipient (sea, underground, drainage systems). In 2018, 900 analyses of waste waters were carried out. Recycling Programs The company actively participates in the Joint Recycling Programs that have been created at a nationwide level including smaller programs which the company also develops on its own. • In 2018, 35 tons of paper were gathered for recycling and were disposed of to accredited by the Ministry of Environment, subcontractors who have been granted a license for management of used paper. • Portable batteries which were delivered to the accredited bodies AFIS and SIDESIS reached 789 kg • Old electrical and electronic equipment in addition to fluorescent light bulbs are gathered and disposed of to the recycling organisations Recycling Devices SA and Photo cycling respectively.

In 2018, 529 tons of plastic were given for recycling. Management of Production By-products Total processing by-products are used in accordance with the European Regulations on management of fish by-products. The intestines and fish heads are sent to a fur farming breeder who uses these as raw materials to produce feed. The fish farming units’ by-products are incinerated either in the company’s veterinary furnace or in collaborating licensed premises. Communication actions The company places great emphasis on communication with interested parties such as with the Association of Hellenic Sea Culture, the Authorities, the Local Communities and the University community. The results of the monitoring programs on the quality of aquatic farming are communicated to the responsible authorities in a form of an analytical report. High level employees of the Group actively participate in conferences held by accredited University Academics, on the issue of the interaction of aquaculture and the environment. In addition, these employees are also members of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Association of Hellenic Sea Culture. Collaboration with Academic Institutions and Research Organizations Nireus participates in 13 different co-founded research projects both from national and European funds.

The main fields of research interest are feed efficiency, juvenile’s robustness, new species and new technologies for aquaculture activities. Collaboration with environmental NGO The impact of the aquaculture industry, which is growing rapidly in fish populations, marine ecosystems, water quality and society, can be significantly and measurably reduced when responsible practices are applied. The implementation of the pioneering program Aquaculture Improvement Plan , which was developed in collaboration with two important and trustworthy organizations, WWF and AB VASSILOPOULOS, continued in 2018. The production facilities of Aliveri, Fokida, Chios and Astakos were audited by TUV Austria Hellas, who recorded the course of implementation of the commitments aimed at further improving the management practices already in place.

Finally, our company, respecting once again its commitment to substantially contributing to environmental protection, is planning a voluntary action of coastal and beach cleaning for the upcoming year. The main objective of this action is to jointly communicate through these actions and via social media attraction and our corporate newspaper, a symbolic message of awareness for the preservation of the natural beauty of the Greek coasts, thus contributing not only to the protection of the natural and cultural wealth of Greece, but also to the creation of a sustainable future.
