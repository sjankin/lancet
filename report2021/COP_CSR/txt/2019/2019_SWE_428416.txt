2019-05-03 To our Stakeholders Dear All, We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the annual preparation and posting of a Communication on Progress (CoP) that comprises of a CEO statement of continued support for the UN Global Compact, a description of practical corporate actions with regard to the principles of the UN Global Compact, and a measurement of outcomes or expected outcomes. In this our second annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. Since we joined the UN Global Compact in February 2017, the ten principles have been integrated into our corporate steering documents, including our Management Platform, Sustainability policy and Code of Conduct. We are pleased to announce that our transition to a systematic and strategic Group-wide sustainability work and reporting is in line with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Annual Review & Sustainability Report for 2018 is disclosed herewith. We also commit to sharing this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication.
