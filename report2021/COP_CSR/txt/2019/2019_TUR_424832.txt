2017 Sustainability Report 1 Ten years ago, a ship has embarked on a voyage. The ship embarked with a mission of creating a better world and a more meaningful life with good causes on its compass. Hundreds of sailors came back from their expeditions with smiling faces and invaluable memories. Sailors of the Ocean discovered the joys of gratitude rather than regret. They discovered that one’s soul gets richer by giving rather than taking. They saw how a tiny rock thrown into the Ocean creates a ripple effect. Over the years more and more sailors joined to those few who had started this journey. They became hundreds so much so that they touched thousands of lives. There are 1001 ways of doing good. This year we ran 10 special volunteering projects to celebrate the 10th year of the Ocean Volunteers. Sign language, organic farming, animal adoption, introducing disadvantaged kids to drama and juggling… And with many more projects, we volunteered to our hearts’ content. There is so much way to go.

While reducing the water consumed in the rinsing baths in ERW Factory Completion Lines by about 30%, we managed to discharge less polluted water out to the water treatment facility thanks to the revision of the chemicals used in the rinsing baths in order to increase the cleaning effect of the baths on the manufactured pipes. We have aimed to save on both water and chemicals by making this discharged water reusable. Because the pre-rinsing baths were made of steel sheets, they corroded very rapidly due to low pH, which required us to replace the re-rinsing baths in all three facilities. + Economic: An additional cost of 43,154 US Dollars was accrued.
