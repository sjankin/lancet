It has become crucial to move beyond traditional ideas of philanthropy and to think beyond financial returns. At IBL, sustainability is an integral component of our overall business strategy: it drives our decision-making and fosters innovation by challenging us to develop socially and environmentally responsible products and services. Our end goal is to turn the tide on the major economic, environmental and social issues of our times, while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. Last year, we formalised a Group-level sustainability strategy that cascades down to our subsidiaries, operations and associated companies. We have made notable progress in embedding sustainability practices into our strategies, policies, culture and mindsets. IBL works actively to create a brighter future for everyone, and sustainable actionable changes form part and parcel of how IBL does business – by transforming existing systems and practices and by adopting new ones across the Group, wherever and whenever we do business. Each new business endeavour is now thought and designed with the input of our experts in sustainability from the very beginning. This is an example of what we have changed at our level. A special effort is thus made to integrate the relevant indicators from early stage to ensure our ambitions will translate into actions. Gunter Pauli has been helping IBL shape the evolving dialogue on sustainability. The creative minds of ZERI (Zero Emission Research and Initiatives) put forward the philosophy, and the Blue Economy puts them into actions. In our Group, we develop new solutions to create an economy based on local resources, responding to local needs with local added value. I think that we can all agree that this is a long-term priority, and that only together we will be able to witness tangible results. At IBL, we are eager to be part of this necessary change.

Covering the IBL Ltd Financial Year 2018-2019, this report gives some insights on IBL’s contribution to the SDGs and some way forward for the year to come. The fact that IBL Ltd is listed on the Stock Exchange of Mauritius Sustainability Index (SEMSI) since 2017 demonstrates our achievements in the areas of sustainability, good governance and transparent business practices. We recognise that sustainability reporting is an ongoing, evolving process that requires a group-wide effort. Moving forward, we intend to make measurable improvement in how we communicate our Group sustainability performance to our stakeholders. 4 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P Dear Partners, The Sustainable Development Goals are a call for worldwide action amongst everyone: governments, business and civil society. They call for concerted and collaborative actions towards global development and most importantly, purposeful business. They call for innovations, creative business models, new ways of collaborations. Sustainable Development Goals encourage industries to rethink their business model and find business solutions to some of the greatest challenges we are facing. IBL Ltd is committed to fully integrate sustainable practices into its core businesses. For our businesses to bring a significant contribution to global and local challenges, we need to reduce its negative impacts and, more importantly, create new opportunities and add value to what we do. Sustainability is at the heart of the Group strategy, and we are encouraging our subsidiaries and operations to do same. We are striving to deliver value for society through commercial products and services, while promoting inclusive growth. This year, our businesses have been working on their sustainability main challenges implementing a materiality matrix based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Awareness has also been raised amongst our stakeholders and employees. One example is the 1st edition of the AfrAsia Bank Sustainability Summit which was organised in October 2018 with the support of IBL Together. We have also materialised our partnership with the “Steve Jobs of the Sustainable Development”, Gunter Pauli who established the Zero Research Emission & Initiatives (ZERI). He helped us create new business opportunities by increasing positive impact on the environment, the society and the economy. Going forward, we will review, adapt, reinforce and align our strategy as per the needs of our stakeholders and the market, and consolidate the Group-wide materiality issues.

They also simultaneously have a positive impact on several areas: Economic development, Employment, The Blue Economy as a mindset shift Education, Resilience, Health and Environment. Some of these innovations represent major gamechangers in their respective industries, and for the country at large. We believe that continuous IBL Ltd finalised during the year an exclusive partnership in Mauritius with Gunter Pauli.

The aim of this partnership is to evolve from a core business based on a core competence to a portfolio of businesses that generate multiple benefits for the business, society and put nature back at the By its nature, Blue Economy is inclusive and seeks to respond to the needs of all. Therefore, heart of the decision. moving forward, IBL intends to establish partnerships with key stakeholders at a national level to explore solutions that benefit everyone equally. In addition, we are committed to supporting local IBL is committed to the Blue Economy principles, promoted by Gunter Pauli. Under his stewardship, entrepreneurs whose ventures are focused on tackling sustainability issues. These Blue Economy IBL began applying these principles into its operations. We are moving towards business models that initiatives, which are in line with IBL’s goal of reducing its energy consumption and carbon footprint introduce sustainable innovations resulting in benefits that go beyond profits.

Café LUX* outlets supply ground coffee residue for the cultivation of mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. The production in turn supplies TLC-managed resorts with locally sourced and good quality produce. 100 kg 70 g of coffee of tomatoes residue yields up to A mushroom farming which uses the sugar cane industry organic waste (bagasse) amongst others is another example of our ZERI business transformation promising projects with a close partnership with ALTEO, allowing an agricultural diversification of the sugar cane based industry.

Zermatt Summit: For 9 years now, the Zermatt Summit Foundation organises events related to its tagline “Humanizing Globalization”. Created in 2010 as a primary international platform to promote a constructive, action-oriented dialogue between the various actors of society, ranging from business to civil society, academy, religion, arts and politics. Designed for business leaders, Zermatt Summit programmes are catalysts to spark inspiration, share innovation and find new business development models that promote human dignity in our globalised world. Since the end of 2018, IBL Ltd is part of the Club 100 of Zermatt Summit. In September 2019, the Group has shared its experience with ZERI to the participants and the implementation of the Blue Economy Principles in a Small Developing Island. 19 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P Towards a Zero Waste Target: finding sustainable solutions to reduce our dependency to landfill Waste has been identified as one of IBL’s main Group-level environmental impacts, while some of them could be new value creation opportunities. As a diversified Group, we generate many kinds of waste for which we must find sustainable solutions. This year, we have started gathering data in order to identify the categories and amount of waste we produce. The Group Waste Management Policy established last year has enabled IBL to start reducing its dependency on landfill. Companies were asked to put appropriate measures in place to reduce their waste and environmental impact; protect workers from occupational safety and health risks related to the waste they generate; and make the most of opportunities to recover resources from waste through the systemic industrial ecology approach. The baseline is not yet constituted as the local waste management system in place doesn’t allow the private sector to monitor and manage properly their wastes. IBL, by being part of the “Circular Economy sub-committee” of Business Mauritius is working on it with other private sector partners. This committee aims to put forward some initiatives and recommend the local authorities. Our companies are largely involved into waste reduction.

It seeks to raise IBL employees’ awareness of topics including recycling, the Circular Economy and zero food waste initiatives. Organic markets are held once a week in order to support local organic farming entrepreneurs, and to increase awareness on health and sustainability issues. The committee has set up an awareness agenda for the year to come and it has already organised its first events such as the IBL Zer0 Waste Week on the occasion of the World Clean Up Day, and the harbour clean up during the IBL Green Week last June. The onboarding newcomers’ sessions now includes an e-module on sustainability that covers topics such as sustainable development basics, IBL’s commitments, the SDGs, and the circular economy. Being part of the Mauritian endemic forest restoration: an unmissable IBL commitment Since October 2018, IBL Ltd has adopted a hectare (10,000 m²) of Ebony Forest in Chamarel. In 2018-19, the site has been weeded and 974 endemic species were planted. The partnership allows the IBL team members to visit the protected area and be part of the solution by planting trees as well. This year, it was more than 100 team members who gave a hand to the project. 22 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P PUTTING People at the centre 23 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P As spelt out in our Code of Ethics, IBL is committed to respect the human rights of all THE STEPS WE TOOK THIS YEAR individuals potentially affected by its activities.

Driven by the Group’s core values and mission, IBL contributes to the development of society through various entities: 1 Due to a change in legislation in 2017. 2  FJL had an 18-month financial year running from January 2016 to June 2017 with a CSR income of Rs 65,646,186. • Fondation Joseph Lagesse (FJL), the main vehicle through which IBL delivers its CSR programmes, • Small Step Matters (SSM), a crowdfunding platform, • Les Cuisines Solidaires, a non-profit organisation that prepares and delivers daily meals to NGOs in the region of Curepipe, • Nou Zenfan Bois Marchand, the new entity for FJL’s early childhood educational programmes in Bois Marchand, • IBL’s CSR committees who carry out various local initiatives including Projets Sourire, and • IBL On The Move, IBL’s major fundraising sport event that channels participants’ registration fees to one selected beneficiary NGO. The CSR sector in Mauritius As explained in the last IBL Integrated Report, the CSR sector in Mauritius has suffered a major change in its practices and reduced leeway, with 50% of funds channelled to the Mauritius Revenue Authority (MRA) as a CSR tax1 . In this context, pursuing our CSR commitment is proving increasingly challenging. Since 1 January 2019, private companies have been subject to an additional 25% reduction in their CSR funds and are required to pay a total of 75% of their CSR funds to the MRA. Only 25% of CSR funds are now available to implement IBL’s own social programmes and initiatives, and support long-term partners NGOs and underserved communities. Companies can request to recover the additional 25% from the National Social Inclusion Foundation (ex-National CSR Foundation) to continue supporting programmes launched prior to 1 January 2019. This legal constraint deprives FJL and partner organisations from their main source of funding, namely CSR funds. As a result, in the last two years, FJL has faced a substantial loss of direct income from CSR funds, decreasing from Rs 65.6 million in CSR revenue for an 18-month financial year in 2016-172 to Rs 18.7 million in 2018-19. It is anticipated that FJL, as IBL’s main CSR vehicle and on-the-field nonprofit organisation, will have to review its strategy and approach, and reduce its scope of activities over the next two years. The impact is directly borne by beneficiaries: vulnerable communities, families and long-term partner NGOs (including Caritas, Kinouété or Terre de Paix) who were relying heavily on FJL’s support to implement their programmes. Despite the substantial amount of CSR funds collected by the MRA over the last two years, the National Social Inclusion Foundation’s annual General Call for Proposals is not a consistent source of funds for registered NGOs. FJL, which registered as a non28 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P Fondation Joseph Lagesse Four areas of intervention IMPROVING ENHANCING PROMOTING EMPOWERING ACCESS YOUTH’S SOCIAL JUSTICE & COMMUNITIES TO QUALITY DEVELOPMENT HUMAN DIGNITY EDUCATION Research and impact evaluation FJL considers evaluation and research to be vital components of its CSR programmes.

A logic model, indicating how each programme meets the community’s needs, was first established. A retrospective evaluation of the social housing project at Chemin Rail was then carried out, and a prospective evaluation on the educational programmes run at Bois Marchand is scheduled for later this year.

Furthermore, the new IBL Code of Business Ethics is in place since September 2018 and will be reviewed on a regular basis. The Code is founded on IBL’s Values and spells out the ethical behaviours which IBL deems essential including a clear statement that IBL shall not tolerate any form of corruption and bribery. To that effect, IBL has also approved an Anti-corruption policy to spell out its commitment to fight against corruption across its operations. The Code also provides guidance on how to raise ethical concerns and deal with ethical dilemmas (whistle blowing). IBL has been a member of Transparency Mauritius for many years now and also participates in meetings of the Public Private Platform Against Corruption (PPPAC), a brainstorming platform lead by the Mauritius Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Good governance A prerequisite to achieving IBL’s ambitions IBL’s Board of Directors is committed to enforcing robust governance practices across the Group. It firmly believes that good corporate governance enhances decision-making and investor trust, thereby creating sustainable value for shareholders and stakeholders and enabling transparent dialogue with them. The Board sets general strategies and policies and ensures they are implemented with support from highly experienced and professional senior governance officers. In addition, the Board has established three specialised sub-committees to provide it with advice and support: Corporate Governance Committee, Audit & Risk Committee, and Strategic Committee. Group anti-corruption policy In 2018 IBL’s Board of Directors approved an anti-corruption policy applicable to all employees and Directors. Reinforce IBL’s commitment to anti-corruption compliance; Set out IBL’s standards of conduct for the prevention of corruption; Define procedures to reduce IBL’s corruption risk; and Communicate and review the policy and its associated procedures on a regular basis. IBL’s Ethics Officer is devising a communication strategy to best promote the Code and policy, and raise awareness among IBL’s team members; and convey the importance of IBL’s fight against corruption and related ethical behaviours. 34 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P IBL’S NEXT STEPS IN sustainability 35 I B L S U STAI NAB I L I T Y R E P O RT FO R T H E F I NAN CIAL YE AR E N D E D J U N E 2019 M E SSAG E F RO M G RO U P CE O | ABO U T T H IS R E P O RT | I B L AT A G L AN CE | AD D I N G VALU E I N WHAT WE D O | P E O P L E AT T H E CE N T R E | O U R R E SP O NSI B I L I T Y | P RO M OT I N G E T H I CAL B U SI N E SS | N E X T ST E P 2019-2020 GOALS IBL has made major sustainable accomplishments over the last two years.
