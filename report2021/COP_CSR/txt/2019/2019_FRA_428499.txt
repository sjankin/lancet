All of these financial statements respect the principle of true and fair view. 2.1 Activity of Devoteam SA and its subsidiaries during the financial year 2.1.1 Highlights of the year In 2018, the Group continued to pursue its growth strategy and confirm its positioning as the go-to expert in Digital Transformation, with a high added value, notably on Cloud solutions and Artificial Intelligence (AI). On the combined strength of AI and other areas of expertise such as Digital Workplace and ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) in partnership with Google and ServiceNow, the Group seeks to offer its clients improved operational efficiency through the automation of simple tasks, and to help boost creation and innovation. This strategy is reinforced by the further development of strategic partnerships with Amazon AWS, Google GCP and Microsoft Azure which have enabled the Group to consolidate its reputation as an expert in digital transformation and the Cloud. Over the course of the year, the Group pressed ahead with its external growth strategy, notably acquiring the Alegri group in Germany, the Jayway group in Sweden, and the Bold group in Portugal, enhancing its Agile IT, Digital Workplace and Cloud Transformation offerings. Furthermore, the Group maintained a very solid financial base with consolidated equity of €187.6 million and €40.3 million in net cash at 31 December 2018, thus allowing it to continue its growth, particularly in the context of the ambitions of the Scale! plan. The company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 include the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), as well as the Group’s share of the results of associates and jointly controlled companies. The financial statements were approved by the Management board on 11 March 2019, and will be submitted to the General meeting for approval on 14 June 2019. 2.1.2 Activity and performance of Devoteam SA Revenue totalled €265.6 million in 2018, up 21.9% compared to 2017, in line with the growth rates recorded at Group level. Operating profit stood at €8.8 million, against €5.6 million the year before, due to growth in the business. Net income for 2018 amounted to €27.8 million, compared to €17.4 million in 2017. This comprises:  a slight decrease in net financial income to €13.2 million (vs. €13.9 million in 2017), mainly impacted by an increase in provisions for equity securities (-€9.0 million), an increase in dividends received Annual Financial Report 2018 5 (+€6.4 million) as well as credit losses on current accounts following the liquidation of subsidiaries in 2017 (+€1.2 million);  an exceptional profit of €6.4 million (versus -€1.3 million in 2017), mainly attributable to capital gains on disposals of equity securities (+€10.1 million), dispute-related expenses (-€3.0 million) and restructuring expenses (-€0.6 million). Further details are provided in Notes 4.5 and 4.6 to the separate financial statements. With regard to financial position:  the Company's equity stands at €182.5 million at 31 December 2018, against €161.8 million at 31 December 2017. The change comes mainly from the recognition of the profit for the year (+€27.8 million) and dividends distributed (-€7.2 million);  total borrowings (excluding total current account liabilities with subsidiaries) amount to €30.7 million and mainly correspond to the bond issue and related accrued interest in the amount of €30.4 million;  available cash (including marketable securities and excluding treasury shares) totalled €19.5 million versus €33.8 million a year earlier, down €14.3 million, mainly due to subsidiary acquisitions.

This change was offset by the impairment losses of -€6.0 million recognised for the Devoteam UK CGU and Alegri in Germany as well as the deconsolidation of the goodwill of Siticom GmbH for €0.5 million. Operating receivables have increased in line with the Group's Operating receivables 264.5 225.7 38.8 growth.

Non-controlling Non-controlling interests (see note 5.12 to the consolidated financial 12.0 11.2 0.8 interests statements).

Annual Financial Report 2018 8 *Cash and cash equivalents (excluding financial investments recognised as “Cash management assets”, net of €0.8 million in bank overdrafts) fell by €5.0 million during the period to €74.6 million. This change is due to:  positive cash flow from operating activities of €47.3 million resulting from a major boost to the Group's operating cash flows to €69.9 million at 31 December 2018 (vs. €53.3 million in 2017) and from a minor increase in WCR of -€9.6 million (vs. -€5.5 million in 2017) due to the strong growth in the Group's business. The days of sales outstanding (DSO) at the end of the year was 58 days, compared with 61 days a year earlier;  negative cash flow from investing activities of €45.6 million over the year (vs. -€36.1 million in 2017), mainly due to: disbursements related to subsidiary acquisitions (net of cash acquired) amounting to €46.3 million; disbursements related to the Group's operational investments amounting to €6.0 million; net inflow related to the disposal of subsidiaries for €7.8 million;  negative cash flow from financing activities of €6.9 million, which includes in particular: net inflow of €1.0 million linked to minority interest transactions; an increase in outstanding receivables sold for €3.4 million; the payment of dividends of €10.7 million, of which €7.2 million was paid to Group shareholders and €3.5 million to minority shareholders.

New standards and interpretations have come into force, such as those described in Note 2.1. to the financial statements. The inventory value of the equity securities and goodwill in the Devoteam SA separate financial statements is determined using the discounted future cash flow method. With regard to equity securities, this value is then adjusted for the cash and/or net debt of the companies in question.

At this time, Messrs Stanislas and Godefroy de Bentzmann (and their children), acting in concert, had not crossed any threshold and confirmed that they held, on 18 May 2018, 1,842,569 DEVOTEAM shares, representing 3,335,884 voting rights, i.e. 22.11% of the share capital and 31.75% of voting rights in the Company. Annual Financial Report 2018 15 2.4.3 Transactions performed in 2018 Transactions on own shares Over the course of the financial year, the Company did not carry out any transactions on the treasury shares. At 31 December 2018, the Company held 274,259 shares, i.e. 3.29% of the share capital, representing a purchase value of €2.5 million and a market value of €22.6 million. 2.4.4 Changes in market price The Devoteam share price rose 10.22% in 2018, compared to a 10.70% decrease for the CAC Technology Index and a 21.57% decrease for the CAC Mid & Small Index.

Capitalisation is calculated on the weighted average number of shares for the year. 2.5 Internal control and risk management 2.5.1 Internal control objectives The aims of the internal control procedures in place at the company are:  to oversee the completion and optimisation of transactions;  to check that the accounting, financial and management information communicated to the shareholders and to third parties (financial markets, banks, Devoteam corporate bodies, etc.) is reliable and accurately reflects the position and activity of Devoteam;  to ensure that management procedures and employee behaviours are in line with the guidelines applicable to the activities of Devoteam and set by its management, by applicable laws and regulations, and by the values, standards and internal regulations of the company;  to contribute to the protection of its assets and the detection of fraud. However, the internal control procedures in place do not constitute an absolute guarantee against the risks identified. Similarly, although subject to regular updates, risk mapping cannot protect the Group against unidentified risks. 2.5.2 General organisation, the main internal control parties and their role 2.5.2.1 The Steering Committee The Steering Committee has four members:  the Chief Operations Officer;  both members of the Management board;  the Executive Vice-Chairman of the Group. This Committee is responsible for the operational application of the strategy defined by the Supervisory Board. The Steering Committee reports to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on the key features of the internal control procedures, as well as the effectiveness thereof. 2.5.2.2 The Executive Committee The Executive Committee is currently composed of 12 members, including the Chairman and CEO of the Management board, the Group CFO, the COO, the Group Vice-Chairmen, as well as the representatives of the largest entities and countries of the France, Europe and Middle East regions. The Executive Committee establishes the internal control procedures, sets the rules applicable to the entire Group and defines the limitations of powers. Annual Financial Report 2018 16 These are communicated to the subsidiaries so that they may be incorporated within all local procedures. 2.5.2.3 The Group's Finance Department The Group CFO assists the Management board in the areas of accounting and finance. The Group CFO oversees a small team at the head office. This team handles accounting and consolidation, Group management control and internal audit functions:  the Group Accounts Department is responsible for preparing the consolidated financial statements, for defining the accounting principles applicable within the Group and the proper application thereof. It is also responsible for ensuring the Group's accounting principles comply with IFRS, and for monitoring accounting techniques, taxation and cash management at Group level;  the Group's management control and reporting team (Financial Planning & Analysis) oversee the process and are responsible for ensuring and implementing a smooth budgetary process;  the Internal Audit Department carries out assessments and provides recommendations on the Group's internal control procedures. Although hierarchically reporting to the Group CFO, it also reports to the Management board and the Audit Committee on its work. With regard to the relationship between the Group CFO and the regional and subsidiary Financial Directors, the Group has always favoured and encouraged a hierarchical relationship so as to maintain a certain degree of independence between the Financial Directors and the Executive boards of these subsidiaries. As such, all regional and subsidiary Financial Directors report directly to the Group CFO. In particular, the latter is responsible for ensuring that the finance-related resources in place (tools and human resources) are sufficient to meet the requirements and development of the Group. 2.5.2.4 The Group's Operations Department The Group COO assists the Management board in the steering of all commercial activity in France and internationally. He reports on the operational performance of the Group at Steering Committee meetings. The Operations Department is in charge of steering and evaluating the Group's performance. The local Finance Departments report functionally to the Operations Department on the performance of their businesses at business reviews. The Country Managers and operational entities report either directly or functionally to the Operations Department. 2.5.2.5 The operational entities Each operational entity is headed by a CEO (or country manager for foreign subsidiaries). The operational entities are grouped into a limited number of regions, each of which is led by an EVP or dedicated CEO with clear responsibilities. In particular they are in charge of implementing the decisions and strategy defined by the Group's Steering Committee and Executive Committee, as well as the organisation of internal control procedures in their own entities. In 2018, no organisational changes took place and entities are still divided into operational sectors: France, Northern Europe and Benelux, Central Europe, Iberia & Latam, Rest of the World, Corporate & Others, and Divested entities. These scopes are presented in note 3.19 to the consolidated financial statements. The entities presented in the Corporate & other region in section 3.19 operate independently or as venture capital and are managed separately. The management of this operational sector is based on financial indicators and is specially monitored by the Group Chief Financial Officer, who is a member of the Executive Committee. Each operational entity, depending on its size, may be structured into several business units, so as to facilitate the management thereof. 2.5.2.6 The Group's functional departments The Group's Human Resources Department has the following responsibilities:  to identify the needs and new expectations of employees and incorporate these into the new Group HR policy;  to coordinate the work carried out by regional and subsidiary HR Managers with the strategic objectives set by the Steering Committee;  to prepare and update the mapping of potential high flyers within the Group;  to initiate senior recruitments within the Group;  to monitor the compensation of the Corporate team, the EVPs and the Country Managers. Annual Financial Report 2018 17 The Management board, with the support of the Group Finance Department, is also responsible for researching opportunities for external growth and overseeing all financial communication. The Group's General Secretary is responsible for all Group legal matters, insurance and general services (including property portfolio management). The General Secretary plays an important role in the evaluation of risks and the solutions to be implemented. 2.5.2.7 The functional departments of the entities Depending on its size, each region and/or operational entity has its own cross-functional departments known as support services. Generally speaking, there are a number of support services that also play an important role in internal control:  the finance department and notably management control;  the human resources department (including recruitment, training and payroll functions);  marketing;  general services;  internal IT. 2.5.3 Brief description of internal control procedures 2.5.3.1 The internal control environment Generally speaking, the organisational structure of the Devoteam Group is decentralised for the operational entities, and centralised for the so-called support and functional entities, wherever possible. The Corporate teams are in charge of the steering and auditing of all Group entities. They are primarily composed of the following two bodies: the Operations Department and the Finance Department. The global strategy is defined at Steering Committee meetings and communicated throughout the Group via Executive Committee meetings. A transparent strategy, shared by all managers The Devoteam Group formally manages the implementation of the Group's strategy:  every two weeks, the aforementioned Steering Committee meets to set objectives, clarify strategic development priorities and redefine the boundaries in accordance with the current circumstances;  every month, the Executive Committee meets to share the decisions of the Steering Committee with the various operational entities and to manage the organisation. 2.5.3.2 Risk management related to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information The AMF (French financial market authority) has defined an internal control reference framework that French companies subject to the obligations provided for by the Financial Security Law are recommended to use and apply in their subsidiaries. The Devoteam Group refers to the reference framework for small and mediumsized companies. Major risks Risks related to the reliability of financial information that could mislead third parties about the position and performance of the company. Control activities  Accounting and financial organisation Each entity or operational region has its own Finance Department that records its financial data and a Management Control Department that performs controls of transactions and financial planning. The Group Finance Department has established permanent reporting procedures that enable it to monitor and steer the activity of each entity.  Performance management processes within the Devoteam Group Performance management is organised around three pillars:  definition of goals;  measurement of performance indicators (KPI): revenue, gross margin, operating margin, operating result, changes in headcount, resource utilisation rate, selling price, average cost of productive Annual Financial Report 2018 18 headcount, seniority pyramid, client outstandings and invoices to be prepared, contribution of strategic offers and partnerships, etc.;  review meetings and presentation to the Executive board. This structure is repeated for three types of deadlines (multi-year, annual, monthly) and at all levels of consolidation (by BU, country, region, etc.). A multi-year business plan process The Group's business plan is constructed by the Management Control Department, the Operations Department and the management of the subsidiaries. It is based on the operational levers (KPIs) of the Group's strategic plan and validated for each entity by one of the members of the Group Executive Committee and at the consolidated level by one of the members of the Management board. Each subsidiary provides information on its own business plan within the Group's reporting tool. These business plans are reviewed annually. The annual budgetary process A monthly budget is prepared each year by each operational entity (based on the first year of their business plan) and by the shared service centres (which provide support services for several operational entities). The main indicators are subject to comparative analyses by the Group's management in relation to the objectives initially set and are compared to previous financial years or similar units. The business plan and the budget are formalised in a document called the budget management cockpit. Monthly reporting process Each month, all of the operating entities prepare a monthly results report and a forecast update for the year. This is integrated into the Group's reporting tool and consolidated by the Group's Management Control Department. The monthly reporting is analysed and discussed with the entities at a monthly meeting (the business review). It is formalised in a document called the monthly management cockpit, which provides an analysis of the performance of each subsidiary in relation to targets so that past deviations from them can be understood, future ones anticipated and corrective action plans put in place.  Control process for ongoing projects Monitoring the stage of advancement of projects Each project has an appointed person in charge of monitoring the development and execution of the project. For fixed-rate projects, a project manager is systematically appointed and reports to his/her hierarchical manager on the stage of advancement of the project and the delivery thereof to the client. For cost reimbursement projects, a commercial engineer is usually in charge of monitoring the service provided by the consultant. Project quality control Every operational entity has a process for monitoring the quality of its projects, which usually consists of sending a questionnaire to a selection of clients to determine their satisfaction with the services provided. This process is generally the responsibility of each entity. Financial control of projects Each operational entity has its own Finance Director, and when required due to its size, one or more Management Controllers who are responsible for ensuring the financial monitoring of each project. The main controls concern fixed-rate projects. The Management Controller monitors the costs charged (mainly the time spent by consultants) against the initial budget. He then compares this ratio with the technical progress of the project and calculates what still needs to be done for it to reach completion, provided by the Project Manager. The invoicing status is another indicator that is monitored, particularly the amount outstanding and the reasons for this. Controlling the contractual aspects of the project Generally speaking, each business unit manager checks the client contracts and purchase orders received or due to be received. For projects requiring the drafting of more complex contracts, the Legal Department provides advice and recommendations for the Group's commitments vis-à-vis its clients and third parties. Annual Financial Report 2018 19  The accounts consolidation process in the Devoteam Group Accounts consolidation process This is carried out every quarter. The instructions, information to be provided and tasks to be carried out are automatically sent to each Group entity before the end of each quarter. The Group places particular emphasis on deadlines that require financial communication, especially those required by the Statutory Auditors (half-yearly and annual financial statements), and ensures that the reported accounts and those included in the audit scope have indeed been audited. Every legal entity closes their own accounts and sends its income statement and balance sheet to the Group Finance Department as part of the consolidation process. The monthly reports are systematically matched against the statutory financial statements provided by each entity. Any variations are investigated by the reporting unit or the Group's Consolidation Department. Accounting restatements, particularly those linked to differences in the way local accounting standards are treated compared to international financial standards, are checked by the Group's Consolidation Department. Process for the auditing of subsidiary financial statements The definitive individual financial statements of subsidiaries, once approved and audited, by local auditors where appropriate, are sent to the Group's Finance Department to be archived. They are reconciled with the accounts used to prepare the consolidated financial statements, and any variations must be explained.  Accounting and financial information systems Local accounting and financial information systems Each country has its own accounting and financial information system. However, the Group ensures that these systems meet professional standards so as to be able to produce both statutory financial statements (in compliance with local standards) and reporting (in compliance with Group standards). In France, the accounting and financial oversight of the projects are performed in the Oracle e-business suite application, the data of which is stored on Oracle servers in Germany. The reporting system The consolidation of statutory financial statements is performed using SAP BusinessObjects Financial Consolidation software, published by SAP, the market leader in reporting tools. The Group's Consolidation Department checks the consistency of the information received and the compliance thereof with the Group's accounting policies manual. Management reporting is also produced using the same software (since 2009), which enables rapid consolidation and more effective controls.  The Group's accounting guidelines An accounting policies manual describes the rules applicable within the Group. Each entity may have its own chart of accounts and specific accounting guidelines depending on its characteristics and local obligations. However, in the interests of consistency, the Group asks that all entities adopt the Group's chart of accounts wherever possible. Changes in accounting methods as well as specific options at year-end are subject to approval by the Executive board (or the Group CFO, by delegation of members of the Management board) and the Statutory Auditors (for half-yearly and annual financial reports).  Financial communication The Group's financial communication is the responsibility of the Management board, once it has been prepared by the Group's Finance Department. Every year, the schedule of deadlines is provided to the Group's Finance Department, which must ensure that this schedule is adhered to. Annual Financial Report 2018 20 Documents intended for third parties must be read and validated by the Executive board and/or members of the Group's Finance Department. The annual and half-yearly financial reports are checked by the Statutory Auditors and presented to the Supervisory Board before being shared with any third parties. 2.5.4 Risk factors The Management board has conducted a review of the risks that could have a significant adverse effect on its activity, financial position or performance (or its ability to achieve its targets) and considers that there are no significant risks other than those presented. In addition, the market and exchange rate risks as defined by IFRS 7 are presented in Note 8.1 to the consolidated financial statements.  Legal risks Risks related to liability action Devoteam conducts IT projects, many of which are crucial to its clients' businesses. Any service provided by Devoteam that does not meet its clients' expectations (data integrity, data confidentiality, poor workmanship, etc.) is liable to have a significant impact on the business of the client, which in turn could damage the reputation of Devoteam, increase the risk of litigation and/or payment delays, or even result in the need to completely re-design the project, leading to a loss in revenue. Risks related to fixed-price contracts Certain Devoteam services are invoiced on fixed-price contracts (fixed price and where applicable, fixed period of time), with an obligation to deliver. On these contracts, the margin, and hence the Group's earnings may be negatively impacted should there be a misjudgement in the amount of time required to complete the project, leading to:  increased costs being incurred with no compensation therefor;  potential delays that could result in financial penalties, depending on the consequences of these delays for the client. A specific internal control procedure for fixed-rate contracts enables these risks to be assessed throughout the life of a project. This procedure is described in section 2.5.3.2 of the Management board’s report on the Group's business and management. Risks related to illegal employment This type of risk mainly applies to technical assistance services. The risk relates to having this work carried out using the unlawful lending of personnel. This practice is illegal except under specific conditions relating to temporary employment. With this in mind, Devoteam pays careful attention to:  the content of all contracts it signs;  the monitoring process for employees providing this type of service (assignment order, activity report, etc.). Legal and arbitration proceedings As at the date hereof, aside from those described in Note 5.14 to the consolidated financial statements, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, including any proceedings of which the company is aware, that are currently pending or threatened and likely to have or which have had, over the past 12 months, a significant impact on the financial position or profitability of the Group.  Operational risks Risks related to the duration of client projects The majority of the Group's revenue is non-recurring. Consulting and systems integration services are provided over relatively short periods of time (three to six months on average) and may therefore be terminated by the client without any significant period of notice. As such, the activity and valuation of Devoteam are more sensitive to an economic downturn than those of certain competitors for whom the percentage of recurring and guaranteed revenue may be much higher. Risks related to the attrition of consultants Devoteam's production capacity relies heavily on the Group's employees. However, structurally speaking, Devoteam operates within an employment market where the supply of IT engineers is inferior to the demand. Annual Financial Report 2018 21 In this pressurised context, the Group is exposed to the risk of losing some of its production capacity and expertise. The average turnover rate for productive headcount amounted to 25.9% in 2018 compared to 26.9% in 2017. This indicator is constantly monitored so as to ensure that it stays within industry norms. It is, however, strongly linked to the economic climate and as such, an upturn in economic activity would lead to a boost in occupational mobility and, consequently, higher turnover rates. Risks related to the activity of consultants The optimisation of the resource utilisation rate is fiercely dependent on the level and performance of commercial activity. This rate relies on the Group's ability to adjust the size and profile of its teams in line with market demand. There is no guarantee that the Group will continue to maintain this rate in the future. The risk is that there may be a certain number of consultants without projects to work on and therefore incurring expenditure without any associated revenue. If the cost base remains unchanged, failure to generate revenue will have a significant impact on operating result. The resource utilisation rate, which measures the percentage of working hours (excluding paid holidays) of billable employees that were directly charged against services provided to a client, is broken down below: Utilisation rate of internal resources, excluding divestments Q1 2017 Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 2017 Q1 2018 Q2 2018 Q3 2018 Q4 2018 2018 83.1% 84.4% 85.4% 85.5% 84.6% 85.6% 84.4% 84.2% 82.7% 84.2% Risks related to pricing pressure The majority of Devoteam clients have implemented price schedules, depending on the services sold. These schedules are regularly reviewed and are subject to negotiation with the clients upon renewal of their master contracts. Consequently, Devoteam, as per the majority of players in the IT market, is subject to significant pricing pressure when a master contract reaches maturity. The duration of these contracts varies, but the average term is between 18 and 24 months, usually with the option to terminate early on contract anniversary dates. Risks related to salary inflation In an employment market where the supply of IT engineer positions exceeds the number of engineers, consultant salaries tend naturally to rise faster than price inflation. However, costs associated with salaries and payroll expenses, including social security expenses, represented 61.6% of the Group's consolidated revenue in 2018. Coupled with the aforementioned risk of pricing pressure, the result is a scissor effect, potentially leading to erosion of Devoteam's margin. Risks related to client dependency The concentration of the client portfolio has developed as follows over the past three years: As a % of revenue * 2016 2017 2018 Top client 4% 5% 5% Top 5 clients 17% 19% 19% Top 10 clients 27% 31% 31% * Non-accounting information. At Group level, the top client represents approximately 5% of consolidated revenue. However, at local level, the impact of just one client can represent a significant percentage and risk. Risk related to suppliers and sub-contractors In some circumstances, Devoteam may call upon sub-contractors with specific skills that Devoteam does not possess but which it requires to carry out services sold to clients. Subcontracting revenue represented approximately 13.0% of total revenue in 2018 (vs. 15.0% in 2017 restated following the application of IFRS 15 on revenue). In terms of volume, therefore, Devoteam is not exposed to any great risk. Nevertheless, Devoteam applies the same principle of monitoring its sub-contractors as it does to its own employees. Annual Financial Report 2018 22  Risks related to a takeover bid Generally speaking, hostile takeovers in the IT services industry are fairly rare insofar as the economic performance of service companies is highly dependent upon key executive and management staff. With regard to Devoteam, any takeover that could potentially change the Chairmanship of the Management board could induce certain key members to leave the organisation, particularly the country managers of foreign subsidiaries.  Risks related to the economic climate As a cyclical industry, the IT market is heavily reliant on the levels of investment and spending by the major economic players. In difficult conditions, clients tend to reduce their IT investment budget. Devoteam's activity is therefore strongly linked to the economic climate.  Risks related to competition The consulting and IT services market is relatively fragmented and does not require much in terms of capitalintensive investments, making it subject to fierce competition and increasing numbers of new competitors. Several of Devoteam's competitors have stronger financial, technical and commercial support, a larger client base, a longer history and greater market recognition.  Risks related to the departure of key personnel Given the nature of Devoteam's business, its success is dependent upon its ability to retain key personnel and management. The potential departure of these people from the Group could have a negative impact on the business, particularly if they decide to work for a competitor or start up their own rival business. Furthermore, if key individuals leave Devoteam, there is no guarantee that they will not disclose Group information or go on to use Group technologies or methods.  IT risks (related to the Group's internal IT structure) Devoteam considers that, by the very nature of its business, the risks related to its own IT system to be minimal. The Group prioritises the security of its internal communication networks which are protected by security rules and firewalls. A security policy has also been established. Systems and networks dedicated to specific projects or clients are also subject to enhanced, contractually defined, protection measures.  Risks related to international expansion and acquisitions Until 1999, Devoteam's development was focused on internal growth in France. Since then, it has expanded internationally, mainly through acquisitions. Today, the Group generates 50% of its revenue internationally and has set up a system of internal control procedures to monitor the activity of its foreign subsidiaries. This strategy may incur financial risks associated with cultural, operational and managerial differences between the Group and the acquired companies. These risks could materialise through a drop in performance by the acquired entities (reflected in the consolidated financial statements as impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill associated with these entities). Goodwill from these acquisitions, at the end of 2018, represented €129.9 million i.e. 26.0% of the total Group balance sheet (21.4% in 2017) and 74.0% (60.9% in 2017) of equity attributable to the Group. The Group therefore ensures that it regularly monitors these entities and impairment indicators including a significant drop in revenue, a decline in operating profitability and any other major events that could have a material impact on future cash flow. The valuation parameters and the way in which we test sensitivity to these parameters are set out in Note 5.1 to the financial statements. Annual Financial Report 2018 23  Country risks Devoteam has a stable presence in 18 countries. The majority of its revenue is generated in Europe, a relatively stable zone in terms of politics and economics. Outside of Europe, the Group generates approximately 6% of its revenue mainly in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. The political tensions experienced in some of these areas since early 2011 means that the Group is exposed to higher geopolitical risk. However, to date, the Group has not encountered any major problems in these areas but continues to carefully monitor local developments. Sending employees to countries in which the Group has no presence, and especially countries considered to be at risk , is subject to a strict approval process.  Environmental risks Although its exposure to environmental risks is very low, the Group presents its Corporate Social Responsibility Report in Part 5 of the financial report. ******** The draft resolutions submitted to you summarise the main points contained in this report. We hereby ask you to approve these resolutions and thank you for your trust and collaboration.

1.1 Company references Devoteam SA (the company), the parent company of the Group, founded in 1995, is a limited liability company (société anonyme) with share capital of 1,263,015 euros, governed by the provisions of French law. The company is registered in the Nanterre Trade and Companies Register under number 402 968 655; its registered office is located at 73 rue Anatole France – 92300 Levallois-Perret. Devoteam SA has been traded on Euronext Paris (ISIN FR 0000073793) since 28 October 1999 (Eurolist compartment B). 1.2 Overview of the business Devoteam, a European consulting and engineering group, is a major player in business consulting in the fields of innovative technologies and management. With 20 years of experience in innovative and disruptive technologies, the Group supports its clients through the digital transformation of their organisational structure and their businesses. 1.3 Significant events in 2018 In 2018, the Group continued to pursue its growth strategy and confirm its positioning as the go-to expert in Digital Transformation, with a high added value, notably on Cloud solutions and Artificial Intelligence (AI). On the combined strength of AI and other areas of expertise such as Digital Workplace and ITSM (Information Technology Service Management) in partnership with Google and ServiceNow, the Group seeks to offer its clients improved operational efficiency through the automation of simple tasks, and to help boost creation and innovation. This strategy is reinforced by the further development of strategic partnerships with Amazon AWS, Google GCP and Microsoft Azure which have enabled the Group to consolidate its reputation as an expert in digital transformation and the Cloud. Over the course of the year, the Group pressed ahead with its external growth strategy, notably acquiring the Alegri group in Germany, the Jayway group in Sweden, and the Bold group in Portugal, enhancing its Agile IT, Digital Workplace and Cloud Transformation offerings. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 include the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), as well as the Group’s share of the results of associates and jointly controlled companies. The financial statements were approved by the Management board on 11 March 2019, and will be submitted to the General meeting for approval on 14 June 2019. Annual Financial Report 2018 31 Note 2 – Consolidation principles and methods 2.1 Statement of compliance The financial statements were prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and published in the Official Journal of the European Union before 31 December 2018. They are available on the website of the European Commission (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accountingstandards-regulation-ec-no-1606-2002/law-details_en) and comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB. International accounting standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). The annual consolidated financial statements to 31 December 2018 prepared in compliance with the IFRS published by the IASB and adopted by the European Union are consistent with those of the previous year, with the exception of the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations applicable with effect from 1January 2018 having an impact on the Group and as detailed below: Application of IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” IFRS 15 sets out the new reference framework for revenue recognition from 1 January 2018. It introduces a five-step revenue recognition model based on the transfer of control of performance obligations identified in customer contracts. It replaces IAS 18 “Revenue” and IAS 11 “Construction contracts” and their interpretations. With regard to the analysis of its activities, the main impact identified in relation to IFRS 15 concerns the resale of third-party licences and SaaS (Software as a Service) platform access subscription rights as part of integration projects. Under the new standards, the Group is now considered to act as principal if it controls the goods or services before transferring them to customers. Otherwise, the Group acts as agent in the transaction. With the exception of the distinction between agent and principal , the application of IFRS 15 has had no material impact on the other services sold by the Group. The Group's accounting methods for the recognition of revenue are described in Note 3.12. The Group has adopted the retrospective method on a transitional basis, with the information presented for 2017 being restated accordingly. The retrospective application of the standard led to a reduction in the revenue presented, as detailed below. This reduction has had no impact on operating margin, net income, equity or cash flows. H1 2017 H2 2017 FY 2017 Adjustments Adjustments Adjustment In thousands of euros H1 2017 IFRS 15 H2 2017 IFRS 15 2017 IFRS 15 for for s for Revenue 256.5 (12.7) 243.8 283.9 (15.0) 268.9 540.4 (27.6) 512.7 Operating margin 25.4 25.4 28.5 28.5 54.0 54.0 Operating margin (%) 9.9% 0.5% 10.4% 10.0% 0.6% 10.6% 10.0% 0.5% 10.5% Application of IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” IFRS 9 replaced IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” with effect from 1 January 2018. Classification of financial assets: IFRS 9 defines a new approach to the classification and measurement of financial assets based on three categories: those measured at amortised cost, those measured at fair value through profit or loss, and those measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Annual Financial Report 2018 32 The new provisions have no significant impact on how the Group accounts for its trade receivables, loans and short-term investments. Impairment – financial assets and contract assets: IFRS 9 replaces the “losses incurred” model under IAS 39 with an “expected credit losses” model. Following analysis, the Group has concluded that the new model has no significant impact on the financial statements, by comparison with the IAS 39 model. Other new standards not yet applicable at 1 January 2018 The Group has not applied standards and interpretations not yet approved by the European Union at 31 December 2018. Similarly, the Group has not opted for the early application of standards and interpretations applicable to financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16: Leases This standard is applicable starting 1 January 2019 and replaces IAS 17 – Leases. In light of its activities, the main expected impacts relate to the recognition in the Group's balance sheet of intangible assets (user rights) and associated debts relating to property leases and other equipment used in the Group's operational activities. In addition, the nature of the expenses related to such leases will change from rent expenses to amortisation charges for right of use and financial interest on associated debts, which will have an impact on the Group's operating income. The Group is currently examining the expected impacts which will be presented in the publication of the 2019 half-yearly financial statements, but does not believe that the application of this standard will have a significant impact on the comprehension of its operational performance. Regarding the other standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved by the European Union and not mandatory at 1 January 2018, no significant impact is expected. 2.2 Basis of measurement and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in euros (the company’s functional currency), rounded to the nearest thousand. They are based on historical cost, except for the following:  derivative financial instruments measured at fair value;  financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss;  available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value;  contingent considerations arising from business combinations;  investment property measured at fair value;  liabilities arising from share-based payments settled using treasury shares measured at fair value;  net liabilities (assets) in respect of defined-benefit plans. The methods used to measure fair value are described in note 3.1. 2.3 Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the use of analyses based on measurements and assumptions bearing on the Group’s income, expenses, assets and liabilities. These measurements are based on the experience gained by the Group and other factors considered reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. Estimates have particular importance:  in determining the amount of intangible assets recognised as part of business combinations (notes 3.1, 5.2);  in recognising revenue on fixed-price contracts under the percentage-of-completion method (note 3.12);  in performing impairment tests of fixed assets, bearing in mind that testing of this nature involves the calculation of a recoverable amount derived from projected future cash flows, as well as growth and discount rate assumptions (notes 3.2, 5.1);  in measuring earn-outs (notes 3.2, 5.7);  in estimating provisions for litigation (notes 3.11, 5.14);  in calculating pension liabilities and other long-term benefits, which requires actuarial assumptions to be taken into account (notes 3.10, 5.15); Annual Financial Report 2018 33  in calculating deferred taxes, and notably when assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets (notes 3.18, 5.10, 6.7);  in measuring derivative financial instruments (note 3.7). The significant judgements made by management to apply the Group’s accounting policies in preparing the 2018 consolidated financial statements and the principal sources of uncertainty in the estimates did not differ significantly from those affecting the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. 2.4 Consolidation principles 2.4.1 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 on the basis of the following principles:  goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree), plus the amount recognised for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognised (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all of which are measured at the acquisition date. When the difference is negative, the resulting gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss;  the Group has the option of measuring any non-controlling interest (e.g. minority interests) held in the acquiree either on the basis of the NCI’s proportionate share of identifiable net assets of the acquiree or at fair value. This option is available on a case-by-case basis for each acquisition;  any adjustment in the purchase price is recognised at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes are recognised in “other operating income” or “other operating expenses”;  acquisition costs resulting from a business combination are recognised as incurred in “other operating expenses”. For business combinations achieved in stages, the previously held interest in the acquiree is remeasured at fair value as of the acquisition date, and any resulting gain or loss is recognised in “other operating income” or “other operating expenses”. 2.4.2 Acquisitions of and commitments to acquire non-controlling interests Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010 Commitments to acquire non-controlling interests are treated by the Group as anticipated acquisitions. Put options on non-controlling interests are accordingly recorded as “financial liabilities” at the date of the business combination at the present value of the best estimate of the purchase value resulting from the contract. On initial recognition, the Group records the difference between the carrying amount of noncontrolling interests and the present value of the put against goodwill. Subsequently, the effects of the changes in assumptions taken into account in this measurement have an impact on the liability offsetting goodwill, while the effects of accretion have an impact on net financial income or expense and the liability. However, changes in the percentage interest or newly issued puts in a subsidiary already controlled by the Group and the loss of control of a subsidiary occurring after 1 January 2010 are dealt with under the new provisions applicable below. Acquisitions after 1 January 2010 Acquisitions of non-controlling interests or the issuance of minority puts on non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners acting in this capacity. As a result, no goodwill is recognised. The difference between the price paid (including direct transaction costs) and the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction is recognised in shareholders’ equity. Subsequently, the effects of changes in assumptions taken into account in the measurement of the transaction price also have an impact on consolidated shareholders’ equity. Annual Financial Report 2018 34 2.4.3 Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into consideration insofar as such rights are material. The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the date control is obtained until the date control ceases. 2.4.4 Associates and joint ventures Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence in respect of financial and operating policy decisions, but not control. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of an entity’s voting rights. Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control by virtue of a contract under which strategic financial and operational decisions are subject to unanimous agreement. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method (“associates”), and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s interest includes the goodwill identified at the time of the acquisition, less accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements therefore include the Group’s share of the total comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures (after taking into account adjustments made to align accounting policies with those of the Group), from the date when significant influence or joint control is obtained until the date it ceases. If the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity interest, the carrying amount of investments consolidated under the equity method is reduced to zero (including any investment that is substantially part of the net investment), and the Group ceases to recognise its share of future losses unless the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to bear a portion of future losses or to make payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture. 2.4.5 Elimination of intra-Group transactions All transactions, with the exception of impairment losses, and reciprocal assets and liabilities between fully consolidated companies are eliminated. Gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated through equity-consolidated securities in proportion to the Group's interest in the company in question. Losses are eliminated in the same way as earnings, but only insofar as they are not indicative of an impairment loss. 2.4.6 Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies and transactions in foreign currency The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros as follows:  assets and liabilities (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition) are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date;  income statement items are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the respective transactions or, in practice, at a price that is close to that rate and which corresponds, except in the case of significant fluctuations, to the average over the year;  translation differences resulting from this conversion process are accumulated in equity, in the translation reserve. The Group does not operate in hyperinflationary economies. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currencies of the Group’s various entities using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the respective transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as of the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate on that date. Annual Financial Report 2018 35 Exchange differences on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the operating margin or in financial income or expense, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and measured at historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date on which fair value was determined. Note 3 – Accounting policies and methods The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. They have been applied in a uniform manner by all Group entities. 3.1 Fair value Certain of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the fair value of financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be measured. Fair values have been determined for measurement or disclosure purposes in accordance with the following methods (additional information on the assumptions used to determine fair value is provided in the notes to the relevant assets or liabilities in the financial statements):  intangible assets: the fair value of business relationships and backlogs acquired in a business combination is calculated using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method involves measuring the asset in question after deducting a reasonable return for other cash-generating assets derived from business relationships and backlogs. The fair value of technology (software) acquired in a business combination is calculated using the royalty method, which involves measuring the asset in question on the basis of the royalties that could be obtained if the asset were licensed;  investment property: the fair value of investment properties is based on valuations made by independent appraisers, and reflects the market price at which the investment property could be sold or exchanged between well-informed, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction. The Group determines fair value without deducting any prospective transaction costs on a sale or any other form of exit;  investment in equity and debt securities: financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale financial assets are determined by reference to the most recent bid price available as of the balance sheet date;  derivative instruments: call options on non-controlling interests are valued according to commonly used option valuation methods, taking into account the particular conditions of the options in question;  loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost. Due to the short-term nature of such assets, the carrying amount of trade and other receivables and cash is an estimate of fair value;  non-derivative financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Due to the short-term nature of such assets, the carrying amount of current bank borrowings, trade and other payables is an estimate of fair value;  the fair value of loans and borrowings is based on the value of future cash flows generated by the repayment of principal and interest, discounted at market interest rates as of the balance sheet date;  for finance leases, the market interest rate is determined by reference to similar leases;  share-based payment transactions: the fair value of stock options granted free of charge to employees is generally measured using standard option valuation models, such as Black-Scholes, Hull & White and Monte Carlo. 3.2. Business combinations and goodwill In a business combination, goodwill represents the fair value of the consideration transferred (including the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree), plus the amount recognised for any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net amount recognised (generally at fair value) for the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all of which are measured at the acquisition date. Annual Financial Report 2018 36 In the event of a takeover by successive purchases of securities of a subsidiary, goodwill is only recognised when control is obtained. Commitments in respect of additional payments or reductions in the purchase price contingent on financial performance (revenue, operating margin) are recognised at fair value as of the acquisition date. Changes (other than discounting effects) arising from facts and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and occurring within the allocation period are recorded against goodwill. Other changes are recognised in financial income or expense. Recognition and measurement Goodwill is treated as an intangible asset. Gains from bargain purchases are recognised immediately in profit or loss under “other operating income” after a review of the assets and liabilities identified and measured and the assessment of the cost of the combination. Goodwill is not amortised. It is tested for impairment at least once each year, and whenever events or changes in the internal or external environment indicate a risk of loss of value. In subsequent years, it is recorded at cost less accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together in cash-generating units (CGU), and goodwill is allocated to the various CGUs. CGUs are homogeneous groups of assets whose continued use generates cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows generated by other groups of assets. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use of a CGU is the present value of discounted future net cash flows, which are estimated on the basis of parameters resulting from the budgetary and forecasting process, extended over a five-year timeframe, using growth and profitability rates deemed reasonable. Discount and long-term growth rates, determined with reference to the industry in which the Group operates, are used to estimate the value of CGUs. When the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill and recognised in operating result under “other operating expenses”. Impairment losses on goodwill cannot subsequently be reversed. For the Group, CGUs generally correspond to a legal entity. However, when entities are operationally merged in terms of commercial offerings, when they share the same management and when their teams are interdependent and interchangeable, they are grouped together in a single CGU. Homogeneous groups of assets formed within the Group are:  the Scandinavia CGU, which covers Devoteam Consulting AS, (including HNCO International, HNCO Danmark AS and Forretningssystemer ApS, which were taken over by this company in 2017) Globicon and Devoteam Fornebu Consulting AS;  the Belux CGU covers Devoteam Belgium, Devoteam Luxembourg and Paradigmo acquired in 2018;  the Alegri CGU covers the four Alegri group companies acquired in 2018 and operating in Germany, Austria and Switzerland;  the Bold CGU covers the seven companies of Portuguese group Bold acquired in 2018;  the Jayway CGU covers the nine Jayway group companies acquired in 2018 and operating in Sweden, Denmark and the United States;  the Devoteam G Cloud CGU covers Devoteam G Cloud and MyG;  the German CGU covers the Devoteam Germany and Q-Partners Consulting und Management entities;  the Netherlands CGU covers Devoteam Nederland BV and the TMNS group companies;  the Tunisia CGU covers the two Tunisian companies; Annual Financial Report 2018 37 3.3 Tangible and intangible assets 3.3.1 Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill consist mainly of software acquired by the Group, recognised at purchase cost (external and internal) less accumulated amortisation and any loss of value, as well as business relationships, backlogs and technology capitalised pursuant to the acquisition method (IFRS 3 and IFRS 3R), measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life, usually between three and five years for software and business relationships. The backlog is generally amortised over the first year of consolidation within the Group, as regards orders covering less than 12 months. 3.3.2 Tangible assets Tangible assets are initially recognised at cost, which corresponds to the purchase price plus costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its place of operation and the purchase of the asset. It is not subject to value adjustments. Subsequently, tangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity, and when the cost can be measured reliably. All other expenses are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method taking as a basis the estimated useful lives of the assets, determined as follows: Asset category Duration Buildings 15 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Transportation equipment 2 to 4 years Office equipment 5 years IT equipment 3 to 5 years Office furniture 3 to 10 years Contracts and agreements signed by the Group are analysed to determine whether they are, or contain, lease contracts. Assets financed by finance leases, as defined by IAS 17 “Leases”, are initially recorded in assets and liabilities at amounts equal to the present value of minimum future payments, or at fair value if lower. The amount of the asset is subsequently reduced in the amount of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Such assets are depreciated using the methods and useful lives described above, unless there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the contract and if the term of the contract is less than the useful life. In this case, the term of the contract is used. 3.4 Investment property Investment properties are initially recognised at cost, which corresponds to the purchase price plus transaction costs. After initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value, reflecting market conditions as of the reporting date. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of investment property are recognised in the income statement in “other operating income and expenses” in the period when they occur. As they are measured at fair value, investment properties are not subject to impairment. Exceptionally, after initial recognition, if it is not possible to determine the fair value of an investment property in a reliable and constant manner, the property in question is measured using the cost model described in IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” until its exit. This scenario may occur when there are no or only a small number of comparable transactions in the investment property market, making the asset in question illiquid. Annual Financial Report 2018 38 3.5 Non-current financial assets Non-current financial assets mainly consist of guarantees related to premises rented by the Group for the purposes of its operations, as well as medium-term advances to non-consolidated subsidiaries. Upon initial recognition, these assets are measured at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost. 3.6 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity instruments and debt securities, trade receivables and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans, borrowings, and trade and other payables. Non-derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. 3.6.1 Trade and other receivables, trade and other payables These items are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost. The fair value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to be their face value given the short payment terms. Credit risk is assessed periodically, at each reporting date, on the basis of a case-by-case review of receivables; in an event leading to impairment loss (default or significantly overdue payment by a debtor), impairment is determined by comparing future cash flows, discounted at the appropriate historical rates, with the carrying amount. Impairment is recognised in the income statement; if a subsequent event later reduces the loss of value, the impairment is reversed through profit or loss. The new prospective impairment model based on expected credit losses, introduced by IFRS 9, has had no impact on the level of impairment of trade receivables calculated using the methodology described above. 3.6.2 Other current financial assets This item essentially contains the reserve fund related to the contract governing the assignment of trade receivables. 3.6.3 Cash management assets This item mainly contains investments at fair value through profit or loss, i.e. investments either held for trading or designated as such upon initial recognition. Financial assets are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss if the Group manages such investments and makes buying and selling decisions based on their fair value. On initial recognition, directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value, and any resulting change is recognised in financial income or expense. 3.6.4 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and short-term investments (three months maximum at origin), highly liquid, readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such items, classified as current assets, are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Fair value represents the net asset value at the closing date. The effect of changes in fair value is recorded in financial income or expense. Annual Financial Report 2018 39 Bank overdrafts repayable on demand, and which form part of the Group’s cash management, are a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows. 3.6.5 Loans and borrowings Borrowings mainly include:  debts resulting from the issue of unlisted bonds, whose characteristics are described in note 5.13;  debts resulting from the recognition of the value of property taken under finance leases and loans from credit institutions. Borrowings resulting from the treatment of property taken under finance leases are initially recognised as described in note 3.3.2 “tangible assets”, then at amortised cost;  short-term credit facilities such as revolving credit facilities (RCF). Draws on such facilities are subject to covenants and compliance with classic financial ratios for loans of this type. 3.6.6 Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities mainly include liabilities arising from commitments to buy out non-controlling interests, as well as residual earn-outs related to business combinations. 3.7 Derivative financial instruments The Group may use financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest or exchange rates. Its hedging instruments are traded with front-ranking banking counterparties. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. With the exception of the cases of hedging described below, changes in the fair value of derivatives, estimated based on market prices or values given by banking counterparties, are recognised through profit or loss. Derivatives may however be designated as hedging instruments in a fair value or cash flow hedge in accordance with the criteria defined in IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”. Hedge accounting is then applied as follows:  for fair value hedges, any gain or loss resulting from the remeasurement of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss;  for cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are broken down between the effective portion, recorded in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion, recognised immediately in profit or loss. Related gains and losses that were recognised directly in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. The effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated by prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests performed when the hedge is implemented and at each reporting date. When the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold or terminated, the Group continues to practise hedge accounting prospectively. Cumulative gains and losses that were recognised directly in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. 3.8 Capital Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments. Incidental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares or equity options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of tax. Annual Financial Report 2018 40 Treasury shares All treasury shares held by the Group are deducted from equity at their acquisition cost. Any gains (or losses) on the disposal of treasury shares directly increase (or decrease) equity net of tax. As such, any gains (or losses) on disposals do not affect net earnings for the year. 3.9 Share-based payments Stock options, free shares and performance shares are granted to certain employees of the Group. In accordance with IFRS 2 “share-based Payments”, options are measured at fair value as of their grant date. The Group typically uses the Black-Scholes, Hull & White or Monte Carlo models, depending on the characteristics of the plan in question. The resulting amount is recorded between operating margin and recurring operating profit, on a straight-line basis between the grant date and the end of the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in equity. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of rights for which it is considered that off-market conditions of service and performance will be met, so that the amount ultimately expensed is based on the actual number of rights fulfilling off-market conditions of service and performance as of the vesting date. For share-based payment entitlements carrying other conditions, the fair value at the grant date reflects such conditions, and differences between the estimate and the actual amount do not result in any subsequent adjustment. 3.10 Employee benefits 3.10.1 Defined-contribution pension and benefit plans Upon their retirement, Group employees receive, in addition to pension payments under local legislation, pension supplements and/or retirement bonuses. The Group offers these benefits through defined-contribution or defined-benefit plans. Under defined-contribution plans, the Group has no obligations other than the payment of premiums; the expense corresponding to premiums paid is reflected in the income statement. In accordance with IAS 19 “employee benefits”, the Group’s net obligation under defined-benefit plans is measured separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefits earned by employees in exchange for services rendered during the current period and previous periods. Pension and similar obligations are measured using the actuarial projected unit credit method. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to the recognition of an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted and subjected to probability analysis comprising the following main points:  a retirement date assumption;  a discount rate equal to the yield of blue chip bonds with a maturity profile similar to that of the Group’s commitments at the closing date;  an inflation rate;  assumptions relating to salary increases, mortality and staff turnover rates. Measurements of this nature are carried out annually, except when changes in assumptions require projections to be performed more frequently. Actuarial gains and losses are generated by changes in assumptions or adjustments for experience (difference between projected and actual) on commitments or on the plan’s financial assets. Adjustments of this nature are recognised directly in equity. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) for the period of the net liability (asset) in respect of defined-benefit plans by applying the discount rate used at the start of the year to assess the obligations in respect of net defined-benefit liabilities (assets) determined at the beginning of the year. The calculation then takes into account any change in the net defined-benefit liability (asset) resulting from the payment of contributions and benefits payment during the period. Annual Financial Report 2018 41 As a result, net interest on the net defined-benefit liability (asset) now comprises the following:  financial cost on the obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans;  financial income generated by plan assets;  interest on the effect of the asset ceiling. 3.10.2 Employment contract termination benefits Employment contract termination benefits are recognised as expenses when the Group is demonstrably committed, without the realistic possibility of withdrawing from its commitment, to a formal and detailed plan, either for layoffs before the normal retirement or offers encouraging voluntary departures in order to downsize. If full payment of compensation is not expected in the 12 months following the closing date, such obligations are discounted. 3.11 Provisions In accordance with IAS 37 “provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets”, a provision must be recognised when the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) resulting from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. If these conditions are not met, no provision is required. In the case of restructuring expenses, an obligation is only recognised when the restructuring has been the subject of a detailed plan and an expectation on the part of the people affected (the plan is announced or its implementation has begun). Provisions are not set aside to cover future operating expenses. The estimate of the amount recorded under provisions is the expense the company is likely to incur to fulfil the obligation. If a reliable estimate of the amount can be obtained, no provision is recorded; a note is in that case provided. Because of the uncertainties inherent to the risks borne, provisions are estimated on the basis of information available as of the valuation date. Provisions are discounted when the effect of the time value of money is significant. In a business combination, the acquirer recognises a contingent liability assumed at the acquisition date if it is a present obligation of the acquiree resulting from past events and whose fair value can be measured reliably. This is the case even if these current obligations were not recognised in the liabilities of the acquiree prior to the takeover, in accordance with IAS 37 “provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, because the outflow of resources was not deemed likely. After initial recognition and until its settlement, cancellation or expiry, a contingent liability is the greater of the amount that would be recognised in accordance with IAS 37 and the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative depreciation and amortisation recognised in accordance with IAS 18 “Revenue”. 3.12 Revenue recognition The Group has applied IFRS 15 since 1 January 2018. The impacts of this transition are described in Note 2.1. Revenue is calculated based on the compensation specified in a contract signed with a client and recognised upon the transfer of control of the good or service, i.e. either on a given date or continuously. Subcontracting services Subcontracting services are resource-based contracts invoiced according to time spent. Subcontracting revenue and expenses are recognised as and when the service is performed, assuming the client benefits immediately from the services provided by the Group. Services performed but not yet invoiced are recorded as contract assets (unbilled work). Services invoiced but not yet performed are recorded as contract liabilities (deferred income). Annual Financial Report 2018 42 Fixed-price services Fixed-price services are contracts based on deliverables and billing milestones according to which the Group undertakes to transfer to the client a series of goods or services based on a fixed price which may be adjusted according to the different criteria of each contract. Fixed-price contracts are generally recognised using the percentage of completion method as either the Group's service improves an asset over which the client obtains control as and when the service is performed, or the Group manufactures specifically for the client an asset with no alternative use and therefore has an irrevocable right to payment for the service provided to date in the event that the contract is terminated by the client. Stage of completion is determined by comparing the costs incurred at closing with the total expected costs over the term of the contract. The total costs of a contract, in particular those still to be incurred, are regularly monitored and estimated to determine whether the stage of completion of the contract and the level of margin to be recognised need to be revised. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is expensed immediately. The Group contractually acquires the right to invoice at contractual milestones or upon acceptance by the client of work carried out. If the difference between the cumulative revenue and invoices is positive, this is presented in contract assets. If it is negative, it is presented in contract liabilities. Resale activity Within the context of its integration projects, the Group may resell equipment, licences and other services acquired from third-party suppliers. In these cases, and when the asset or service is distinct from other services provided by the Group, analysis is required to determine whether the Group is acting as agent or principal in the transaction. The Group acts as principal if it has control of the goods or services prior to their transfer to the client. In this situation, the transaction is recorded on a gross basis in the income statement at the time of the transfer of control to the client. On the other hand, the Group acts as agent and the transaction is recorded on a net basis (the amount invoiced by the supplier is deducted from the revenue invoiced to the client) when the Group fulfils its performance obligation as agent. More specifically, the Group applies the following principles as part of its resale activity of perpetual licences or licences in SaaS mode:  in the case of a sale of third-party perpetual publisher licences representing a separate performance obligation, the Group decided that it did not obtain control of the licence prior to its transfer to the customer, since it was not authorised to make changes to that licence, and noted that in the majority of cases, the licence was transferred directly by the publisher to the customer. In this case, the Group acts as agent and only recognises the sales margin in revenue. Conversely, if the licence is an integral part of a complex integration solution overseen by the Group, the Group considers that it acts as principal for the entire project, including the licence;  in the case of the sale of a subscription to a software platform in “Cloud or SaaS” mode, as an integral part of an overall solution in which, for the term of the contract, the Group is responsible for operational performance on the customer’s behalf, the Group considers that it acts as principal for the entire solution. Otherwise, the Group acts as agent in the resale of access rights to the platform. Rental income from investment property or subletting income Rental income from investment properties or income from partial subletting of buildings occupied by the Group are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease or sublease. This revenue is recorded as a reduction of the costs relating to the buildings concerned. Breakdown of revenue The Group is structured by geographical areas and reports its revenue according to this axis for analysis of segment information. Revenue is mainly derived from consultancy and integration services broken down into seven major domains (Cybersecurity, Digital Workplace, Agile IT, Transformation Management, Customer Experience, Business Process Excellence and Data as a Service). Each of these domains is deployed in every region in which the Group operates. Currently, the Group monitors its volume of business by domain at the level of commercial commitment but does not yet have an accounting breakdown of this distribution. The majority of revenue is generated through subcontracting or fixed-price contracts, including sometimes the sale of licences or access rights. Annual Financial Report 2018 43 3.13 Operating leases and finance leases Lease payments under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Rent-free periods and discounts on rents granted by lessors are recognised over the term of the lease as a reduction of the related expenses. Minimum payments under finance leases are apportioned between the financial expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The financial expense is allocated to each period of the lease so as to allow the recognition of a constant interest rate over the term of the lease. IFRS 16 Leases will be applied with effect from 1 January 2019 (see Note 2.1). 3.14 Subsidies and grants As part of its regular operating management, and in the various countries where it operates, the Group is liable to sign agreements with governments or public bodies enabling it to obtain support in the form of public funding. In accordance with IAS 20, subsidies and grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the entity will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the funds will be received. When these conditions are met, subsidies and grants are recognised in the income statement net of the expenses to which they are linked. Moreover, certain tax incentives, mainly the French research tax credit (CIR) and the competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE), share certain of the characteristics of public subsidies insofar as the amount is receivable even in the absence of a tax payment, is not used in determining taxable income and is not confined to the tax liability. When these conditions are met, subsidies and grants are accounted for in accordance with IAS 20 and presented to the income statement net of the expenses to which they are linked. In the Group’s case, such expenses are mainly personnel costs. 3.15 Definition of recurring operating profit and operating margin Operating margin, the chief indicator of the Group’s business performance, is recurring operating profit (as defined below) before the impact of share-based compensation and the amortisation of assets recognised as part of business combinations, including business relationships acquired in business combinations. Recurring operating profit reflects activities undertaken by the company in the normal course of its business, as well as any related activities that are incidental to or consistent with normal activities. Recurring operating profit is net profit before taking into account:  other operating income and expenses, as defined below;  financial income and expense;  current and deferred taxes;  income from equity associates;  income from discontinued operations. 3.16 Other operating income and expenses Other operating income and expenses reflect unusual, abnormal and infrequent events or transactions of a material nature in relation to the consolidated performance, as advocated by recommendation ANC 201303 of 7 November 2013. Other income and expense mainly includes:  restructuring and/or downsizing expenses or provisions related to business combinations occurring between the acquisition date and the end of the year following the acquisition;  restructuring expenses, other than those referred to above, relating to plans approved by the Group’s management bodies and having been disclosed to the relevant third parties; Annual Financial Report 2018 44  severance payments to the Group’s senior management, namely: managers in charge of an operational entity (legal entity or an autonomous entity in terms of management and reporting within it) or a cross-cutting function;  gains or losses on the sale of securities of subsidiaries;  gains or losses on disposal of tangible and intangible assets, and impairment of non-financial assets;  profits on a bargain purchase as part of a business combination;  acquisition costs incurred as part of a business combination;  the revaluation at fair value of any non-controlling interests following the acquisition of the companies in question;  the revaluation at fair value of investment property;  the revaluation at fair value of assets held for sale under IFRS 5. 3.17 Financial income and expenses Financial income notably includes interest on investments, gains on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets, increases in the value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, foreign exchange gains and profits on hedging instruments recognised in profit or loss. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss as earned, using the effective interest rate method. Financial expense comprises interest payable on borrowings and finance leases, the reversal of provisions, the effect of accretion and/or changes in assumptions in relation to earn-outs payable on business combinations, foreign exchange losses, decreases in the fair value of financial assets through profit or loss, and losses on hedging instruments recognised in profit or loss. All expenses related to loans and finance leases are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method. Financial income and expense also includes net interest determined under defined-benefit plans (see Note 3.10.1). 3.18 Income taxes The tax expense included in the determination of income for the year is equal to the total amount of tax payable plus deferred tax. The tax expense is generally recognised in the income statement, with the exception of the portion of tax relating to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income. Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of taxable profit for the year. It is calculated based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted as of the reporting date, and is adjusted for adjustments to tax due for prior years. The Group recognises its deferred taxes using the liability method, which is an approach based on the balance sheet. This means that deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect reductions or increases in future tax liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities (excluding specific cases covered by IAS 12), as well as tax losses and credits carried forward. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by tax entity or tax group on the basis of tax rates applicable to the years in which any temporary differences are liable to be repaid or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and if the Group intends to settle current assets and tax liabilities based their net amount or to realise the assets and settle the tax liabilities simultaneously. Deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences and tax losses are recognised only insofar as the Group expects to generate future taxable income against which temporary differences and related tax losses can be offset. The Group estimates its future profits over a three-year timeframe. Deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date. They are cancelled if their realisation is no longer probable. Annual Financial Report 2018 45 Tax loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from a business combination are recognised in profit or loss unless they are estimated during the evaluation period, on the basis of information existing as of the acquisition date. Following the introduction of the territorial economic contribution (contribution économique territoriale – CET) applicable to French companies under the 2010 Budget, the Group opted to classify the contribution component of the corporate value-added contribution (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises – CVAE) of the CET as income tax under IAS 12 as of 31 December 2009. The Group considers that the CVAE satisfies the characteristics of income tax, as its calculation is based on a net amount of income and expenses, and its net amount is potentially different from net income, insofar as value added is the intermediate level of income systematically used, under French tax rules, to determine the amount due in respect of the CVAE. 3.19 Operating segments Under IFRS 8, operating segments must be based on internal reporting regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker. This decision maker is in charge of the allocation of resources and the evaluation of the operating segments' performance.

The key performance indicators set out below are used by the Group in its internal reporting and are identical to those applied at the 2017 reporting date (see note 3.19 to the 2017 financial statements):  first, operating margin is defined as recurring operating profit before the impact of share-based compensation and the amortisation of business relationships acquired in business combinations;  second, the group contribution is defined as the total revenue (internal and external) of an operating segment less the cost of internal subcontracting acquired from other Group entities. This indicator reflects the segment’s contribution to consolidated revenue from its own resources. The sum of group contributions of the operating segments is the Group’s consolidated revenue. 3.20 Earnings per share In accordance with IAS 33 “earnings per share”, earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. The average number of shares outstanding is calculated based on the various changes in share capital adjusted for treasury shares. Diluted earnings per share is the ratio between net income (attributable to equity holders of the parent) and the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted by the number of treasury shares, taking into account the dilutive effect generated by stock options and founders' warrants. Annual Financial Report 2018 48 3.21 Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets whose sale is approved during the period are shown on a separate line of the balance sheet, since the sale is considered highly probable and must be made within twelve months. Non-current assets (or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale) whose carrying amount will be recovered chiefly by means of a sale transaction rather than through continuing use are classified as assets held for sale. Immediately before classification as being held for sale, the assets (or components of a group of assets held for sale) are measured using the Group’s accounting policies. Subsequently, the assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are recorded at the lesser of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is initially allocated to goodwill and other assets in proportion to their carrying amount, with the exception of inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, assets generated by employee benefits and investment properties, which continue to be measured using the accounting principles applicable to them. Impairment losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities held for sale) as being held for sale and gains and losses on subsequent measurements are recognised in profit or loss. The gain recognised cannot exceed accumulated impairment losses. As a result of their classification as non-current assets held for sale, tangible or intangible assets cease to be amortised or depreciated.

The nature of the Group’s business results in the recognition of significant goodwill. In a business combination, the Group primarily acquires human capital. Acquisition accounting and evaluation period The allocation of the purchase price of Altius in 2018 resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards for an amount of €48 thousand. Annual Financial Report 2018 52 The allocation of the purchase prices of the other companies acquired in 2018 is being analysed and will be finalised in 2019. Comparable basis information The impact on the 2018 financial statements of entries into the scope of consolidation (acquisitions and purchases of interests) conducted in 2018 is presented below: In thousands of euros Transactions in 2018 Revenue 31,101 Current operating profit 2,234 Profit for the year (606) Total assets 26,789 Change in net working capital 7,935 As a result of internal restructuring in the Netherlands, the impact of entries into the scope of consolidation in 2017 on the 2018 financial statements is not identifiable. 4.2.2 Disposals and losses of control In September 2018, the Group finalised the sale of its entire equity interest (65.50%) in Shift by S’Team to the minority shareholders. At 31 December 2017, the Group presented this business under assets held for sale. This transaction generated a capital gain, net of sale-related costs, of €7,581 thousand. This entity was deconsolidated on 31 August 2018, having contributed €4.6 million to Group revenue over the 8 months of 2018 (€4.7 million over 12 months in 2017). At 31 December 2018, following an MBO transaction (Management Buy-Out), the Group lost control of its subsidiary Siticom Gmbh in Germany and now holds only a 35% stake in this business. This remaining equity interest has been measured at fair value and generated a profit of €731 thousand, recorded in the income statement under Share of profit of associates . Siticom Gmbh contributed €16.1 million to Group revenue. This entity will continue to be consolidated under the equity method from 1 January 2019. Impact of disposals and losses of control on the Group's financial position In thousands of euros Siticom GmbH Shift by S'Team Fixed Assets (855) (84) Trade and other receivables (5,420) (2,264) Cash and cash equivalents (3,901) (1,478) Current and non-current provisions Trade and other payables 9,001 1,437 Net assets and liabilities (1,175) (2,388) Consideration received in cash 9,170 Cash and cash equivalents (3,901) (1,478) Inflow net of cash and cash equivalents (3,901) 7,692 4.3 Assets held for sale At 31 December 2017, the Group was in advanced talks for the sale of its subsidiaries Shift by S’Team in France and Devoteam Morocco. The Group has therefore classified these two subsidiaries as assets held for sale. The transfer of control over Shift by S'Team was finalised on 4 September 2018 (see above). However, as a change to its initial strategy, on 28 August 2018, the Group decided to transfer only 49% of the share capital of Devoteam Morocco to a strategic local partner via a reserved capital increase. As the Group retained control of the entity, Devoteam Morocco was reintegrated into the scope of consolidation with effect from 1 September 2018.

Annual Financial Report 2018 54 Earn-out clause On 31 December 2018, the commitment recognised for the earn-out clauses was €7,079 thousand (versus €3,159 thousand at 31 December 2017) and related to New BIC, HNCO, Bold, Paradigmo, Devoteam G Cloud and Q-Partners GmbH. These earn-outs are based on the future performance of the acquired entities. Evaluation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs The method used for assessing the recoverable amount of the CGU is described in note 3.2. The key assumptions used in 2018 and 2017 to determine the recoverable amount are described below, broken down on the basis of the geographies in which the Group operates: Normative rate of return 2018 key assumptions Discount rate Long-term growth rate (1) France 7.6% 2% between 3% and 10% Other European countries 7.3% to 10.6% 2% between 1.75% and 9%(2) Middle East 8.2% to 13.5% 2.50% between 5% and 9% North Africa 10.8% to 11.9% 2.50% between 4% and 9% (1) Long-term operating margin. (2) With the exception of New BIC whose normative rate of return is 20%. Normative rate of return 2017 key assumptions Discount rate Long-term growth rate (1) France 7.70% 2% between 3% and 10% Other European countries 7.40% to 9.70% 2% between 7% and 9% Middle East 8.20% to 11.70% 2.50% between 6% and 9% North Africa 10.90% to 11.00% 2.50% between 4% and 9% (1) Long-term operating margin. The key assumptions were determined as follows:  discount rate: set by an independent firm on the basis of averages observed over the last ten years as regards the risk premium and over the last five years as regards the beta. The risk-free rate is the average of the last ten years of ten-year French government bonds;  the normative profitability of the CGUs used to calculate the terminal value was determined based on the Group’s historical data;  the long-term growth rate for the calculation of the terminal value is derived from OECD forecasts backed up by the average used by financial analysts in the industry. Sensitivity testing was performed on these key assumptions:  a 0.5-point increase in the discount rate would have negatively impacted results by €1,978 thousand;  a 0.5-point decrease in the growth rate to infinity would have negatively impacted results by €2,602 thousand;  a 0.5-point decrease in the normative rate of return would have negatively impacted results by €1,297 thousand. The projection of future cash flows is based on parameters resulting from the budgetary and forecasting process, extended over a five-year timeframe, using growth and profitability rates deemed reasonable and in line with management expectations. Sensitivity testing was performed on the parameters underpinning these projections:  a 1-point decrease in revenue growth would have had positively impacted results by €180 thousand, due to the positive impact on the future cash flows of a reduction in the change in WCR associated with slower growth;  a 1-point decrease in operating margin would have negatively impacted results by €1,945 thousand;  a combination of the two decreases above would have negatively impacted results by €1,724 thousand. Annual Financial Report 2018 55 Excluding the CGUs subject to impairment over the period, no CGUs had a recoverable amount close to their carrying amount at year-end 2018. 5.2 Intangible assets The main movements recorded in 2018 are as follows: Software and Other intangible In thousands of euros Total trademarks assets Gross value At 1 January 2018 6,611 9,159 15,770 Change in scope (1) 206 738 944 IFRS 5 reclassification 6 6 Acquisitions over the year 113 186 300 Disposals over the year (0) 0 0 Reclassification and scrapping (34) (879) (913) Foreign currency translation differences (13) (15) (28) At 31 December 2018 6,884 9,195 16,079 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 1 January 2018 (6,301) (6,957) (13,258) Change in scope (151) (615) (766) IFRS 5 reclassification (4) (4) Net additions (225) (909) (1,134) Reductions 0 0 0 Reclassification and scrapping 31 879 910 Foreign currency translation differences 13 15 28 At 31 December 2018 (6,633) (7,591) (14,224) Net value at 31 December 2018 251 1,605 1,855 Of which net value of finance leases at 31 December 2018 (1) Corresponds to the entry into the scope of consolidation of Bold, New BIC, Paradigmo, Alegri and Progis.

Annual Financial Report 2018 57 5.4 Non-current financial assets In thousands of euros 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Loans, guarantees and other receivables 2,360 2,131 Other financial assets 3,690 803 Total 6,050 2,934 Non-current financial assets mainly comprise security deposits. Other non-current financial assets consist mainly of cash advances to associates. The increase in this item is predominantly linked to the reclassification of the €1.9 million loan to Siticom Gmbh following the loss of control of this entity (see Note 4.2.2). 5.5 Investments in associates In thousands of euros 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Investments in associates 5,206 3,508 The change is essentially the result of the reclassification of the Group's equity interest in Siticom GmbH in Germany at 31 December 2018 (see Note 4.2.2). The financial information below relates to investments in associates: Keivox (Spain), Siticom Gmbh (Germany), DFSJ (Belgium), Between Staffing Group B.V.

The reclassification was performed in the net carrying amount, as the Group was not able to reliably determine the fair value of the complex, in large part due to the lack of comparable transactions for similar properties in the area. Annual Financial Report 2018 58 Thus, the building complex will be carried at amortised cost until its exit. The complex consists of an office building with total floor space of 4,122 square metres and an 894-squaremetre data centre. It is depreciated on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years. The table below summarises the carrying amounts of the complex: In thousands of euros 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Gross value 5,955 5,955 Accumulated depreciation (5,043) (4,585) Net carrying amount 914 1,370 The building complex generated subletting income in the amount of €529 thousand and operating expenses in the amount of €676 thousand. 5.7 Other non-current assets and liabilities Assets 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 In thousands of euros Other 299 254 Total 299 254 Other non-current assets consist primarily of non-current prepaid expenses recognised by Devoteam Belgium.

Other receivables The decrease in other current receivables is due to the receipt of the deferred portion of the sale price of Between for €2,338 thousand and the reclassification of a portion of the long-term receivable relating to the sale of Bengs in other non-current assets for €1,125 thousand. Prepaid expenses The change in prepaid expenses is consistent with growth in the Group’s business.

Tax and social security liabilities Tax and social security liabilities increased by €20,013 thousand. This was partly attributable to the Group's organic growth (€12,934 thousand) and partly due to changes in the scope (€7,079 thousand). Other current liabilities Other current liabilities amount to €15,558 thousand and break down as follows:  advance payments from customers and customer credit notes to be prepared for €8,390 thousand (versus €6,949 thousand at the end of 2017), mainly for the French entities for €6,430 thousand and for Devoteam Denmark for €1,521 thousand;  current liabilities in respect of earn-outs and put options on non-controlling interests in a total amount of €6,250 thousand (compared with €2,483 thousand in 2017) relating to acquisitions;  the current portion of contingent considerations in the amount of €169 thousand;  dividends payable to minority shareholders for €103 thousand. Contract liabilities The increase in deferred income is consistent with growth in the Group’s business. Annual Financial Report 2018 60 5.9 Other current financial assets and net cash Other current financial assets This item mainly includes a security deposit in the context of the disposal of receivables contract for €1,800 thousand (compared to €1,655 thousand at the end of 2017) and short-term loans and guarantees for €447 thousand (compared to €111 thousand at the end of 2017). Net cash Cash in the statement of cash flows consists of cash and cash equivalents (short-term investments and cash), net of bank overdrafts. Net cash includes cash, as defined above, as well as cash management assets (assets presented separately in the statement of financial position due to their characteristics), less shortand long-term financial liabilities.

The bonds were initially subscribed by two investors by virtue of contracts including default covenants, the criteria of which are assessed at the balance sheet date. The table below presents the ratios set out in the bond contracts: Required covenant Date R1 Ratio (consolidated net debt / consolidated EBITDA) < 2.5 Until 17/07/2021 R2 Ratio (consolidated net debt / consolidated equity) <1 Until 17/07/2021 Consolidated net debt is the portion of current and non-current liabilities among “borrowings and financial liabilities” less the amount of “cash and cash equivalents” or other financial investments useable or transferable in a period of less than 30 days, as such items are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Consolidated equity is the amount of “equity attributable to owners of the parent” plus “non-controlling interests”, as such items are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Consolidated EBITDA is the Group’s “recurring operating profit” before deducting “net allowances to and reversals of depreciation, amortisation and provisions”.

(2) Mainly includes reclassifications of current/non-current provisions for restructuring and employee disputes. (3) Corresponds to the reclassification of Devoteam Morocco within the scope of consolidation (see Note 4.3). Current provisions and non-current (excluding pension commitments) Current and non-current provisions amounted to €8,729 thousand (versus €8,341 thousand in 2017) and break down as follows: Annual Financial Report 2018 67  Restructuring provisions in the amount of €1,090 thousand (compared with €2,213 thousand at 31 December 2017), split between Germany (€749 thousand), Morocco (€114 thousand), Spain (€96 thousand), France (€71 thousand) and Switzerland (€60 thousand). The change over the year was attributable chiefly to: o an increase in provisions for restructuring, mainly in Germany (€290 thousand) and Switzerland (€59 thousand), o the reversal of provisions for restructuring in Germany (€1,128 thousand), Spain (€287 thousand) and France (€44 thousand);  Provisions for employee disputes for €980 thousand (compared to €1,110 thousand at 31 December 2016), mostly recognised in France;  Provisions for liabilities and charges for €6,659 thousand (compared to €5,018 thousand at 31 December 2017). The change over the year predominantly reflects an increase in provisions relating to the dispute with minority shareholders in Poland (€1,516 thousand). Contingent liabilities  In January 2013, the Group was accused by an industry player of unfair competition. The initial amount of the claim was €9.55 million. More than one year later and on several occasions since then, the opposing party produced an independent expert report in support of its claims and significantly increased its initial demands. While disputing the very basis of the accusation, the Group had the report analysed by another expert appointed by it, who concluded that the private report produced by the other party contained methodological and factual errors that totally call into question the valuation of the alleged damage. In December 2016, the Commercial Court of Paris, while holding that it could note the existence of acts of unfair competition on the part of the Group, did not determine the amount of the damage and appointed its own court-appointed expert, who was tasked with giving an opinion on the amount of the alleged damage. The Group has appealed this judgement. In early March 2018, the court-appointed expert delivered his final report, which concluded that there was damage of €10.1 million. After consulting with its counsel, the Group believes that it has solid legal and technical arguments to refute the existence of acts of unfair competition and challenge the serious and numerous errors in the report by the court-appointed expert. In December 2018, following discussions with the opposing party and without changing the basis for its initial position, the Group agreed to sign a settlement agreement to definitively and irrevocably resolve the dispute, through the payment by the Group of a fixed sum of €3 million. The various procedures associated with this dispute have now been closed.  When it acquired Wola Info (now Devoteam Poland) in 2010, Devoteam S.A. granted a put option on 38.4% of the remaining capital. Wola’s actual net position – and the company’s overall condition in general – was deliberately concealed by the sellers. Devoteam SA took them to court, refusing to recognise the put option which had been exercised in the meantime. In May 2018, a Polish court ordered Devoteam S.A. to pay €1.5 million for the put option, in addition to penalties for delay and court fees for a total amount of €4.2 million. Devoteam S.A. immediately appealed the judgment. In agreement with its counsel, Devoteam S.A. believes it has a solid case, particularly regarding the disproportionate nature of the penalties for delay compared with the principal amount. At 31 December 2018, the Devoteam Group therefore recognised, in addition to the exercise price of the option classified in liabilities since 2010, the amount of €1.5 million in respect of statutory interest and procedural costs which could be due in the event that it loses the appeal. Annual Financial Report 2018 68 5.15 Pension liabilities Group employees in certain countries receive retirement benefits paid in a lump sum on retirement. The main countries in this respect are France, Austria and Germany. The corresponding expense is included in the profit for the year, except for actuarial gains and losses, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.

These are performance obligations that form part of a contract of which the original expected duration is less than one year and those completed on the basis of the actual consumption of services giving rise to invoicing (subcontracting contracts). Revenue not yet recognised assigned to performance obligations not yet fulfilled, as presented below, therefore concerns only fixed-price contracts and sales of subscriptions in SaaS mode not yet transferred to the client. Its value at 31 December 2018 was at least €41,002 thousand. Major customers No customer accounts for more than 5% of the Group’s revenue. 6.3 Personnel expenses and share-based payments As at 31 December 2018, 6,000 stock options, 20,500 warrants to purchase existing redeemable shares (BAAER) and 193,800 free shares were outstanding, and all in the money.

It also takes into account the effect of the French competitiveness employment tax credit (CICE) in the amount of €3,554 thousand at 31 December 2018, compared with €3,237 thousand at 31 December 2017, and the research tax credit (CIR) in the amount of €3,343 thousand at 31 December 2018, compared with €3,179 thousand at 31 December 2017. 6.4 Other purchases and external charges In the year ended 31 December 2018, other purchases and external expenses break down as follows: In thousands of euros 2018 2017 restated* 2017 presented Subcontracting (105,723) (90,668) (111,722) Lease and rent payments (16,976) (13,576) (13,576) Business travel and receptions (14,968) (10,655) (10,655) Other purchases (28,348) (22,110) (22,110) TOTAL (166,016) (137,010) (158,063) (1) Restated following the application of IFRS 15 (see Note 2.1). 6.5 Other operating income and expenses The main components of other operating expenses and income are as follows: Other operating expenses Other operating income 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in thousands of euros) in thousands of euros Income from the reversal Restructuring expenses (1,564) (3,076) of unused provisions for restructuring Net value of fixed assets Net value of fixed assets sold (114) (40) 27 4 sold Net loss on disposals of Net gain on disposal of (536) 7,581 932 subsidiaries subsidiaries Impairment of goodwill (6,427) (2,783) Impairment of other assets (501) Gains on acquisitions 165 Acquisition cost (817) (223) of securities Other expenses (4,704) (1,620) Other income 19 113 Total (13,625) (8,779) Total 7,626 1,213 Annual Financial Report 2018 76 At 31 December 2018, restructuring expenses and income related mainly to the adjustment of resources and the costs of downsizing, particularly in France (€706 thousand) and Belgium (€343 thousand). Net gain on disposal of subsidiaries corresponds to the sale of Shift by S’Team. Impairment of goodwill relates to the impairment of the Alegri CGU in Germany (€1,983 thousand) and the Devoteam UK entity (€3,977 thousand) (see Note 5.1), as well as a loss related to the adjustment to fair value of the Morocco CGU assets (€467 thousand).

Interest on the bond issued in July 2015 remained stable at €1,026 thousand.

Note 7 – Statement of cash flows The Group uses the indirect method for the presentation of its statement of cash flows. Bank overdrafts repayable on demand, and which form part of the Group’s cash management process, are a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows. The main changes in the Group’s cash over the year are described below. 7.1 Cash flow from operating activities Operating cash flows Operating cash flows, representing operating cash flows before changes in working capital and taxes paid, improved significantly to €69.9 million in 2018, compared with €53.3 million a year earlier as a result of the improvement in the Group’s operating profitability. Change in net working capital The change in WCR represents -€9.6 million, compared to -€5.5 million in 2017. This decrease is principally due to the strong growth in the Group's business. The days of sales outstanding (DSO) at the end of the year was 58 days, compared with 61 days a year earlier. Taxes paid Despite the improvement in the Group's results, taxes paid remained stable at €13.0 million, compared to €13.6 million in 2017, as a result of the gradual decrease in tax rates, especially in France and Belgium. Annual Financial Report 2018 79 7.2 Cash flow from investing activities Acquisitions and disposals of fixed assets The increase in this item corresponds to the operating investments carried out by the Group, mainly on fittings for new premises and the purchase of IT equipment. Acquisitions and sale of financial assets This item mainly represents movements in bank term deposits with initial maturity of more than three months and loans to entities not fully consolidated by the Group. Proceed of subsidiaries, net of cash divested This item mainly corresponds to the proceeds from the disposal of Shift by S’Team, net of cash transferred (see Note 4.2). Acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired This item mainly corresponds to the disbursements, net of available cash, relating to the acquisitions of the Alegri group in Germany, the Jayway group in Sweden and the Bold group in Portugal, as well as the entities Paradigmo in Belgium and New BIC in Spain (see Note 4.2). It also includes the payment of earnouts or contingent considerations on previous acquisitions. 7.3 Cash flow from financing activities Acquisition of non-controlling interests The disbursement of €1.3 million corresponds to the buyout of non-controlling interests in the Group. Change in factored receivables (net of security deposit) During the year, the Group increased the end-of-period amount outstanding with the factor by €3.4 million. Interests paid Interest paid amounted to €1.7 million. It mainly includes interest related to the bond, disbursed annually in arrears, and commissions related to the factoring contract. Dividends paid The amount of dividends paid was €10.7 million, of which €7.2 million was paid to Group shareholders and €3.5 million to minority shareholders. Transactions on own shares Net cash related to these transactions includes the proceeds from the sale of treasury shares or stock options exercised by employees in a net amount of €0.7 million. 7.4 Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash The impact of changes in foreign exchanges rates on cash or cash equivalents held in foreign currencies is as follows: In thousands of euros 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Norway 0 (426) Switzerland 20 (10) United Kingdom (11) (10) Middle East 321 (993) Turkey (101) (63) Other (26) (131) Total 203 (1,633) Annual Financial Report 2018 80 Note 8 – Information on financial risk management 8.1 Financial risk management policy The Group is exposed to credit, liquidity and market risk due to its use of financial instruments. This note discloses information about the Group’s exposure to these risks and the way in which the Group monitors and manages such risks. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to fulfil its obligations. The main sources of credit risk identified by the Group are trade receivables and investments of surplus cash. Trade receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk reflects above all the individual characteristics of the various customers with which the Group trades. The Group’s customer portfolio consists mainly of international key accounts with significant financial resources. No major customer represents more than 5% of the Group’s annual revenue, and the five biggest customers together account for approximately 20% of consolidated revenue, meaning that concentration risk is extremely limited. The Finance Departments of the various Group entities manage customer credit risk directly. The Group’s Finance Department nevertheless performs regular reviews of trade receivables due when examining the monthly results. Every significant delay in payment is monitored, and an action plan is initiated if necessary. Credit studies are performed when new business relationships are formed, taking into account the size of the new customer. The Group assesses its credit risk at each closing date. This assessment is based on an individual analysis of each receivable at risk of non-recovery, and a provision is recorded in the amount of the best estimate of the probable loss that will be incurred by the Group. In addition, following the entry into force of IFRS 9, the Group ensures that expected credit losses on trade receivables remain insignificant. Since 2014, the Group has adopted the principle of routine provisioning, save in exceptional circumstances duly justified and documented, of all receivables outstanding for more than 360 days. However, and owing to the quality of its customer portfolio, the Group has not seen a significant increase in bad debts. Investments of surplus cash The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by limiting its investments to bank deposits with a capital guarantee and regular money market funds issued by leading banking counterparties, as well as capitalisation contracts with a capital guarantee issued by leading insurers. The liquidity of these investments was not in question at 31 December 2018. Given the quality of the counterparties, the Group does not expect any of its counterparties to fail to fulfil its obligations. Sureties and guarantees given The Group only stands as guarantor for its subsidiaries. However, in the normal course of business, the Group may be required to provide guarantees in favour of its business partners (mainly customers and suppliers), either directly or through banks. The main sureties and guarantees given are described in note 9.3. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group failing to meet its financial obligations. The Group’s approach to managing this risk is to ensure that it at all times has sufficient funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Finance Department has established a prospective cash flow monitoring system (monthly and annual) for each Group operating entity, which gives it sufficient visibility to manage its liquidity risk. Annual Financial Report 2018 81 The Group has conducted a specific review of its liquidity risk, and considers itself able to meet its future payments. At the closing date, the Group did not represent a liquidity risk, since its cash net of bank overdrafts, including cash management assets, amounted to €75.0 million, exceeding its €34.7 million in financial liabilities. In addition, the Group has senior confirmed revolving credit facilities (RCFs) with leading banking counterparties in the amount of €30 million for a period of three years, expiring at the end of 2018. These facilities were renewed between March and April 2019 for a five-year period. Their total amount was increased to €105 million. Draws on such facilities are subject to covenants and compliance with classic financial ratios for loans of this type. Required covenant Achieved G Ratio (net debt/equity) <1 (0.2) L Ratio (net debt/EBITDA) < 2.5 (0.5) At year-end, the Group had not drawn down any sums on these credit facilities, and the covenants had all been met. Lastly, the factoring agreement established in 2013 was still in effect at the closing date. The maximum authorised drawdown line is €33 million, of which €18.7 million was used at 31 December 2018. Market risk Market risk is the risk of market price change in certain parameters, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and share prices, potentially impacting the Group’s results and equity. Currency risk The Group’s business is mainly conducted in the euro area (79.6% of revenue in 2018). Bearing that in mind, the individual markets of each of the Group’s entities are predominantly local, which means that revenue and expenses are for the most part denominated in the same currency. The Group is therefore not exposed to significant currency risk, and does not use currency hedging instruments. The main currencies other than the euro (EUR) are the Danish krone (DKK), Norwegian krone (NOK), UAE dirham (AED) and pound sterling (GBP), each representing between 2.2% and 5.6% of consolidated sales. Loans and borrowings are almost exclusively denominated in euros, and as such do not present any currency risk. As regards other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure remains insignificant, and conducts foreign exchange purchases/sales at the spot price as necessary to cover its commitments. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is managed by the Group’s Finance Department in connection with its main bank counterparties. The Group’s policy is to hedge against an increase in its future repayments. To this end, it is liable to use financial derivative instruments contracted with leading banks. At 31 December 2018, most of the Group’s financial debt was at fixed rates, and no hedging instruments were in place. Risk on own shares The Group holds 3.29% of its own shares. The main purpose of these shares is to finance external growth and to cover incentives offered to employees in the form of stock options, BCE, BAAER and free performance share allocations. The Group’s results are not sensitive to changes in the share price, since such variations are charged against equity. Decisions to buy or sell treasury shares are made by the Management board on a case-by-case basis. Annual Financial Report 2018 82 Capital management Employee shareholders Devoteam has consistently sought to promote employee shareholdings, notably though stock option plans and employer contributions to the Devoteam company savings plan. At 31 December 2018, employees, former employees and directors of subsidiaries held 2.75% of the share capital (i.e. 229,099 shares). Share buybacks The Group has established a share buyback programme that enables it to:  hold and subsequently use these shares to pay for acquisitions;  grant shares to employees and directors under the terms and conditions provided by law.

SCI 73 rue Anatole France In July 2005, the Group signed a subletting agreement for a new building with SCI 73 rue Anatole France. It plans to relocate its registered office to these premises. As SCI 73 rue Anatole France and the Group have a number of directors in common, the Group appointed two independent appraisers to ensure that the transaction was carried out on an arm’s length basis. The agreement took effect from 1 May 2008, the effective date of occupancy. In November 2008 and June 2012, the Group signed two new subletting agreements with SCI 73 rue Anatole France for premises located at 113 rue Anatole France in Levallois and at 1 rue Galvani in Massy respectively, previously occupied under a lease between the Group and another owner. The terms of the new agreements are identical to those of the leases signed with the previous owners. In November 2017, the Group signed a new sub-lease agreement with SCI 73 rue Anatole France for premises located at 43 boulevard Barbès. The above subletting agreements do not carry any off-balance sheet commitments. 9.3 Off-balance sheet commitments 9.3.1 Guarantees given The main sureties, endorsements and guarantees given by the Group at 31 December 2018 are described below: In thousands of euros 31 December 2018 31 December 2017 Commitments given related to the implementation of customer 4,227 2,879 contracts Commitments given related to the guarantee of trade payables Commitments given related to the guarantee of payment of 160 commercial leases Other commitments given 160 Total 4,387 3,039 Annual Financial Report 2018 89 9.3.2 Operating leases Minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: In thousands of euros Less than one year One to five years More than five years 31 December 2018 10,447 25,789 8,751 31 December 2017 8,256 11,403 19 Operating leases commit the Group to the payment of future minimum rents. The calculation of these future payments has been adjusted in line with the information presented for 2017 and has not been restated. In order to align with IFRS 16, the Group has used a minimum 9-year term for its property leases in France, without taking into account, as it did before, the possibility of early cancellation every three years. The future minimum payments stated on 31 December 2018 are a good indication of the total lease liabilities (excl. discount effect) that will be recognised upon the implementation of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019. Moreover, in its capacity as lessor, the Group receives minimum lease payments, which break down as follows: In thousands of euros Less than one year One to five years More than five years Minimum lease payments 509 1,501 For 2018, subletting income amounted to €483 thousand (compared to €514 thousand in 2017) and rental expense to €16,976 thousand (compared to €13,576 thousand in 2017). 9.4 Statutory Auditors' fees The table below presents the detailed amounts of Statutory Auditors' fees paid for the 2018 and 2017 financial years: 2018 2017 In thousands of euros Grant Grant KPMG % % NSK % Total KPMG % % NSK % Total Thornton Thornton Certification and half-yearly limited review of separate and consolidated financial statements Issuer 135 45% 120 35% 0 0% 255 92 33% 93 37% 0 0% 185 Fully consolidated 164 55% 184 53% 70 100% 418 159 57% 129 51% 79 100% 367 subsidiaries Services other than certification of financial statements Issuer 0 0% 9 3% 0 0% 9 27 10% 30 12% 0 0% 57 Fully consolidated 0 0% 35 10% 0 0% 35 0 0% 0 0% 0 0% 0 subsidiaries Total 299 100% 348 100% 70 100% 717 278 100% 252 100% 79 100% 609 Note 10 – Subsequent events None. Annual Financial Report 2018 90 3.7 Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 December 2018 To the General meeting of Shareholders of Devoteam S.A., Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Devoteam SA for the year ended 31 December 2018. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The opinion expressed above is consistent with the content of our report to the Audit Committee. Basis of opinion Auditing framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under these standards are set out in the Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors in the auditing of the consolidated financial statements section of this report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in accordance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January 2018 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditor. Observation Without qualifying the opinion expressed above, we draw your attention to the following point stated in Note 2 Consolidation principles and methods in the notes to the consolidated financial statements which describes the effects of the mandatory application at 1 January 2018 of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Justification of assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatements which, in our professional judgment, were the most important for the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Annual Financial Report 2018 91 Valuation of goodwill (Notes 3.2 and 5.1 to the consolidated financial statements) Risk identified As part of its development, the Group conducts external growth transactions and is required to recognise goodwill as an asset in its financial statements. Goodwill is the difference between the purchase price and the net carrying amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. It is allocated to the various cash-generating units (CGUs). As indicated in Note 3.2 Business combinations and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment in order to ensure that its net carrying amount, which is recognised as assets in the amount of €129,886 thousand at 31 December 2018, is not greater than its recoverable amount. However, any unfavourable change in the activities to which goodwill has been allocated due to internal or external factors that may be related to the economic and financial environment of the markets in which the Group operates may significantly affect the recoverable amount of the goodwill and require recognition of impairment. Such a development would result in a reappraisal of the relevance of all of the assumptions used for the determination of recoverable amounts as well as the reasonableness and consistency of the calculation parameters used. The terms of the impairment test used and the details of the assumptions retained are described in Notes 3.2 and 5.1 to the consolidated financial statements. The recoverable amount was determined by reference to the value in use calculated from the present value of the cash flows of each cashgenerating unit. We considered the valuation of goodwill to be a key audit matter, given the weight of these assets in the consolidated balance sheet, the importance of the judgments of the management in the determination of the assumptions retained, in particular regarding cash flow forecasts, discount rates, long-term growth rates and normative profitability, as well as the sensitivity of the assessment of their recoverable value to those assumptions. Response given We reviewed the work relating to the impairment tests carried out by the Group and the conclusions that emerged from them. Our work consisted mainly of:  reviewing and evaluating the process implemented by Management to estimate the recoverable value of goodwill;  assessing, in accordance with applicable accounting standards, the manner in which the Group allocated goodwill to CGUs during the acquisitions made during the year and the grouping level of the CGUs selected for goodwill impairment tests;  assessing the reasonableness of the valuation of the recoverable amount of the CGUs identified for the goodwill impairment tests. This analysis consisted of: interviews with management, a comparison of the cash flow projections resulting from the budget and forecasting process for the years 2019 to 2022 with the projections used in the impairment test for the previous year, a comparison of the 2018 results projections used in the previous year's impairment test with actual results to assess their reliability, an assessment of the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the projections in the light of our knowledge of the economic environment in which the Group operates, and an assessment, with the support of our valuation experts, of the reasonableness of the financial parameters used in the impairment tests, the model used to determine value in use and the method used to determine the discounting and long-term growth rates; Annual Financial Report 2018 92  analysing the sensitivity of impairment tests to changes in assumptions used in the business plans and financial parameters applied. Recognition of revenue from fixed-price service contracts and first application of IFRS 15 for the resale of third-party publisher licences and subscriptions to software platforms in Cloud or SaaS mode (Note 2 Consolidation principles and methods and Note 3.12 to the consolidated financial statements) Risk identified The Devoteam Group operates in the professional IT services and innovative technology consultancy market. It provides services through subcontracting or fixed-price contracts. These may include other services, including in particular the resale of perpetual third-party publishing licences and subscription access to software platforms in Cloud or SaaS mode as part of comprehensive solutions. As stated in Note 3.12 to the consolidated financial statements, the recognition of revenue and associated costs varies according to the type of service provided:  for fixed-price services, revenue is generally recognised using the percentage of completion method, as either the Group's service improves an asset of which the client obtains control as and when the service is performed, or the Group manufactures specifically for the client an asset with no alternative use and therefore has an irrevocable right to payment for the service provided to date in the event that the contract is terminated by the client. Stage of completion is determined by comparing the costs incurred at closing with the total expected costs over the term of the contract;  the total costs of a contract, in particular those still to be incurred, are regularly monitored and estimated to determine whether the stage of completion of the contract and the level of margin to be recognised need to be revised;  for the resale of third-party licences and access rights to platforms in Cloud or SaaS mode: in the case of a sale of third-party perpetual publisher licences representing a separate performance obligation, the Group decided that it obtains control of the licence prior to its transfer to the customer, since it was not authorised to make changes to that licence, and noted that in the majority of cases, the licence was transferred directly by the publisher to the customer. The Group acts as an agent and recognises only the net sales margin in revenue. Conversely, if the licence forms an integral part of a complex integration solution managed by the Group, the Group considers that it acts as principal for the entire project, including the licence, in the case of the sale of a subscription to a software platform in “Cloud or SaaS” mode, as an integral part of an overall solution in which, for the term of the contract, the Group is responsible for operational performance on the customer’s behalf, the Group considers that it acts as principal for the entire solution. Otherwise, the Group acts as agent in the resale of access rights to the platform. We considered the recognition of revenue from fixed-price service contracts to be a key audit matter because the estimated costs for those contracts are based on operational assumptions and their estimation has a direct impact on the level of revenue and margin recognised in the financial statements. We also considered the recognition of sales of third-party licences and subscription access to platforms in Cloud or SaaS mode as a key focus of the audit, in the context of the first application of the new IFRS 15 on recognition of revenue. Response given We reviewed the internal control systems relating to the recognition of fixed-price contracts and licence resale contracts. We tested the effectiveness of the key controls put in place by the management controllers, in particular those relating to the allocation of costs. Annual Financial Report 2018 93 For a selection of contracts based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, we performed the following audit procedures:  for the fixed-price contracts: we reconciled the financial data (revenue, invoicing, costs and work in progress) included in the monitoring sheet for the contract prepared monthly by management control, with the accounting, on the basis of interviews with the management controllers and/or operational managers, we assessed the remaining costs to be incurred and the stage of completion of the contract that they have determined and on which the accounting of the revenue figure and the recognition of the margin is based;  for sales of third-party licences and subscriptions to platforms in Cloud or SaaS mode: we reviewed the criteria used by the group for the recognition of these sales against the provisions of the new IFRS 15, we reviewed the processes for identifying these types of sales within the Group, we tested, using sampling techniques, the proper application of the criteria used for the accounting of these sales. We also verified the appropriateness of the information provided in the appendices to the consolidated financial statements. Specific verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group’s information given in the management report of the Management board. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is included in the Group’s management report [or in the Group’s information given in the management report], it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and this information must be reported by an independent third party. Information resulting from other legal and regulatory requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as statutory auditors of Devoteam S.A. by the General meeting of 26 July 1999 for KPMG and 20 June 2014 for Grant Thornton. As of 31 December 2018, KPMG S.A. was in the second year of its mission without interruption and Grant Thornton in the fifth year. Moreover, KPMG SA and KPMG Audit IS, members of the KPMG network; and previously Statutory Auditors of the entity from 1999 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2016, respectively. Responsibilities of the management and corporate governance officers with respect to the consolidated financial statements It is the responsibility of management to prepare consolidated financial statements that present a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and to implement the internal controls that it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the ability of the company to continue as a going concern, to present in those financial statements, as appropriate, the necessary information relating to the continuity of operations and apply the going concern accounting policy unless it is planning to wind up the company or cease operations. Annual Financial Report 2018 94 The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems and, as applicable, the internal audit with respect to procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Management board. Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors with respect to the auditing of the consolidated financial statements Audit objective and process It is our responsibility to prepare a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole do not contain any material misstatements. Reasonable assurance corresponds to a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with the standards of professional practice can consistently detect any significant anomalies. Anomalies may arise from fraud or error and are considered significant where it can reasonably be expected that they, taken individually or cumulatively, may influence the economic decisions that readers of the statements take based thereon. As specified by Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our mission to certify the financial statements does not constitute a guarantee of the viability or quality of the management of your company. In the context of an audit conducted in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, Statutory Auditors exercise their professional judgment throughout the audit. Moreover:  they identify and assess the risks that the consolidated financial statements contain material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, define and implement audit procedures to address those risks, and collect items they consider sufficient and appropriate for the formation of their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for a material misstatement resulting from an error, as the fraud may involve collusion, falsification, voluntary omissions, misrepresentation or circumventing of internal controls;  they review the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls;  they assess the appropriateness of the accounting methods used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the information concerning them provided in the consolidated financial statements;  they assess the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern accounting policy and, depending on the evidence gathered, the existence or non-existence of significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may call into question the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the information gathered up to the date of its report, but it should be noted that subsequent circumstances or events could jeopardise the continuity of operations. If they conclude that there is significant uncertainty, they draw the attention of readers of their report to the information provided in the consolidated financial statements about such uncertainty or, if the information is not provided or is irrelevant, they formulate a qualified certification or a refusal to certify;  they assess the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether the consolidated financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events such that they give a true and fair view of them;  concerning the financial information of the persons or entities included in the scope of consolidation, they collect the information that they deem sufficient and appropriate to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. They are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the opinion expressed on the financial statements. Annual Financial Report 2018 95 Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee that outlines the scope of the audit work and the programme implemented, as well as the conclusions arising from our work. We also disclose, where appropriate, the significant weaknesses in the internal controls that we identified with respect to the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information. Among the elements disclosed in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of material misstatement that we consider to have been the most important for the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year, and which therefore constitute the key points of the audit that it is our responsibility to describe in this report.

Note 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, RULES AND METHODS 2.1 General principles applied The accounting policies have been applied in accordance with the prudence principle and in compliance with the underlying assumptions of going concern, consistency of accounting methods, and independence of financial years, and with general rules on the preparation and presentation of annual financial statements in France. The method used in the valuation of accounting items is that of historical cost. Assets whose value is calculated in reference to midand long-term outlooks, in particular, intangible assets and equity securities in particular, have been valued on the basis of parameters set in accordance with the budgetary and forecasting process. The discount rate was set by an independent firm on the basis of averages observed over the last ten years as regards the risk premium and over the last five years as regards the beta. The risk-free rate is the average of the last ten years of ten-year French government bonds. 2.2 Fixed assets 2.2.1 Intangible assets The gross value of intangible assets is essentially determined by the value of goodwill arising on mergers between Devoteam SA and the following companies:  Devoteam SI and Dataverse in June 2001;  Apogée Communications in July 2005. Since 2005, goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested for impairment. At each year-end, the net book value is compared to the value in use, so as to ensure that the value of the goodwill remains higher than or equal to its book value. Where appropriate, a provision for impairment is made. Since 1 January 2016, in accordance with the entry into force of ANC regulation No. 2015-06, past impairment is no longer reversed. Annual Financial Report 2018 99 The value in use of goodwill is calculated using the discounted future cash flow method. This method is applied on the basis of parameters resulting from the budgetary and forecasting process, extended over a five-year timeframe, using growth and profitability rates deemed reasonable. Discounted and long-term growth rates over the period beyond five years, determined with reference to the industry in which the Group operates and on historical data, are applied to the valuations of all entities that generate their own cash flow. This value is then weighted by one or more discount coefficient in accordance with the specifics of each of the funds. The values of the main parameters used are: a discounted future cash flow rate of 7.6%; a long-term growth rate of 2%; a standard rate of return of 8%. 2.2.2 Tangible assets Tangible assets are recorded at their cost price, which corresponds to their purchase price (cost of acquisition plus ancillary costs) as well as costs directly incurred to ensure the establishment and operation of the asset. The depreciation periods used correspond to the estimated useful life of the assets within the company and are determined in accordance with the following: Asset category Duration Method Fixtures and fittings 10 years Straight line Office equipment 3 to 5 years Straight line IT equipment 3 years Straight line Transportation equipment 2 to 4 years Straight line Office furniture 3 to 10 years Straight line 2.3 Financial assets 2.3.1 Equity securities The value in use of equity securities is calculated either based on the share held in the net assets (mainly for non-controlling interests), or using the discounted future cash flow method, adjusted to reflect the cash and/or net debt of the companies in question. The latter is applied on the basis of parameters resulting from the budgetary and forecasting process, extended over a five-year timeframe, using growth and profitability rates deemed reasonable. Discounted and long-term growth rates over the period beyond five years, determined with reference to the industry in which the Group operates and on historical data, are applied to the valuations of all entities that generate their own cash flow. The values of the main parameters used for the discounted future cash flow method are: a discount rate of between 7.30% and 13.50% depending on the geographical area; a long-term growth rate of 2% (2.50% for emerging markets); a normative rate of return of between 3% and 10% according to the activity of each entity. Any negative difference recorded against the subscription value is the subject of a provision for impairment. In the case of certain acquisitions, incremental earn-outs are scheduled for the following financial years in accordance with the performance of the companies in question. At year-end, the earn-outs amounted to €3,453 thousand and related to the acquisition of Devoteam G Cloud for €443 thousand, the Herbert Nathan & Co (HNCO) group for €1,930 thousand and the Bold group for €1,080 thousand. 2.3.2 Treasury shares Treasury shares purchased under a buyback scheme for which the earmarking targets are unknown are recorded as fixed securities. At year-end, the inventory value is determined using the average market price over the previous month. A provision for impairment is recorded when the inventory value is below the purchase value. Annual Financial Report 2018 100 2.4 Receivables and payables Receivables and payables are recorded at their par value after taking into account, where applicable, any translation differences for foreign currency balances at the closing rate. 2.5 Doubtful receivables The credit risk is periodically assessed based on a case-by-case analysis of receivables and a provision is made for any potential losses on non-recoverable debt. 2.6 Marketable securities The gross value is made up of the purchase price excluding ancillary costs. When the inventory value is below the gross value, a provision for impairment is made for the difference. For treasury shares purchased and earmarked for employees, a provision for impairment is recognised when the average market price over the last month of the year is below the average purchase price of shares bought by the company. In accordance with CRC Regulation No. 2008-15 of 4 December 2008 and CNC Notice 2008-17 of 6 November 2008, the shares allocated to a stock purchase option plan are valued at their entry cost and are no longer subject to impairment based on their market value, due to the commitment to allocate them to employees. As counterparty, a liability is recognised when the obligation to distribute shares to employees is likely or certain to result in an outflow of resources without consideration of at least equal value. 2.7 Provisions In accordance with CRC Regulation No. 2000-06, the major liabilities and charges identified at the closing date of the financial statements is subject to a provision when the company has, at year-end, an obligation towards a third party which is likely or certain to result in an outflow of resources in favour of this third party, without consideration of at least equal value. 2.8 Loans and borrowings On 17 July 2015, the Group issued an unlisted Euro Private Placement ( Euro PP ) bond in a nominal amount of €30 million bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per year, for an initial term of six years maturing on 17 July 2021. The bonds were initially subscribed by two investors by virtue of contracts including default covenants, the criteria of which are assessed at the balance sheet date. The table below presents the ratios set out in the bond contracts: Required covenant Date R1 Ratio (consolidated net debt / consolidated EBITDA) < 2.5 Until 17/07/2021 R2 Ratio (consolidated net debt / consolidated equity) <1 Until 17/07/2021 Consolidated net debt is the portion of current and non-current liabilities among “borrowings and financial liabilities” less the amount of “cash and cash equivalents” or other financial investments useable or transferable in a period of less than 30 days, as such items are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Consolidated equity is the amount of “equity attributable to owners of the parent” plus “non-controlling interests”, as such items are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Consolidated EBITDA is the Group’s “recurring operating profit” before deducting “net allowances to and reversals of depreciation, amortisation and provisions”. Annual Financial Report 2018 101 The features of this bond are as follows: 17 July 2015 bond Number of bonds issued 300 Par value/Issue price (€) 100,000 Issue price (€) 100,000 Total amount of the issue in par value, July 2015 (€) 30,000,000 Initial interest rate 3.25% * Number of bonds redeemed during the year Number of bonds still outstanding at 31 December 2018 300 Expected date of redemption 17/07/2021 * A step-up coupon mechanism is applied if R1 is greater than 1: if 1 > R1 < 2: the rate will be 3.5%; if 2 > R1 < 2.5: the rate will be 4%. Furthermore, the company has a number of revolving credit facilities (RCF) with leading banks, amounting to €30 million over a period of three years, due to mature in 2018. These facilities were renewed between March and April 2019 for a five-year period. Their total amount was increased to €105 million. Draws on such facilities are subject to covenants and compliance with classic financial ratios for loans of this type. Required covenant Achieved G Ratio (net debt/equity) <1 (0.2) L Ratio (net debt/EBITDA) < 2.5 (0.5) As of the year-end, the Group had not drawn down any sums on these credit facilities, and the covenants were all met. 2.9 Pension commitments The amount of commitments in terms of pensions, supplementary pensions, compensation, allowances for retirement and other similar benefits for members of staff and corporate officers are valued at each year-end in accordance with Article 22 of the Syntec Collective Agreement and IAS 19 Employee Benefits , as reiterated in CNC Notice No. 2003-R-01. Within the framework of defined-benefit schemes, pension and retirement commitments are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to the recognition of an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final obligation. The final obligation is then discounted and subjected to probability analysis. These calculations comprise the following main points:  an assumed voluntary retirement age of 67 years for executive staff and 62 years for nonexecutive staff;  a financial discount rate of 1.50%;  an inflation rate of 1.50%;  assumptions relating to salary increases, mortality and staff turnover rates. At 31 December 2018, pension commitments were valued at €2,587 thousand. 2.10 Revenue Income from work undertaken on a cost reimbursement basis is recorded as and when the work is completed. Services not yet invoiced are recorded as unbilled work. Services invoiced but not yet performed are recorded as deferred revenue. Fixed-price contracts that span more than one financial year are accounted for using the percentage of completion method. Stage of completion is determined by comparing the costs incurred at closing with the total expected costs over the term of the contract. The total costs of a contract, in particular those still to be incurred, are regularly monitored and estimated to determine whether the stage of completion of the contract and the level of margin to be recognised need to be revised. Annual Financial Report 2018 102 When the amount of foreseeable costs incurred for the completion of a contract is likely to result in a loss on completion, a provision for liability is made in the estimated amount of the loss at year-end. No loss on completion has been recorded to date. 2.11 Personnel expenses Following the entry into force of the tax credit for competitiveness and employment (CICE crédit d’impôt compétitivité emploi) on 1 January 2013 and in accordance with the position of the French Accounting Standards Authority of 28 February 2013, the company recognises CICE as a credit to a dedicated sub-account of account 64 Personnel expenses . This tax credit may be applied against the corporate income taxes owed by the company or refunded after a period of three years. 2.12 Employee profit-sharing An agreement to delegate the administrative and financial management of the employee savings plan has been entered into with AXA. 2.13 Extraordinary income Extraordinary income is generated as a result of unusual events or transactions either separate from the business or not considered likely to occur frequently or regularly. In accordance with French National Accounting Council (CNC) Notice No. 2000-D of 21 December 2000, in the event of a failed acquisition transaction, the costs incurred shall be fully and directly recorded as extraordinary expenses.

Contingent liabilities  In January 2013, the Group was accused by an industry player of unfair competition. The initial amount of the claim was €9.55 million. More than one year later and on several occasions since then, the opposing party produced an independent expert report in support of its claims and significantly increased its initial demands. While disputing the very basis of the accusation, the Group had the report analysed by another expert appointed by it, who concluded that the private report produced by the other party contained methodological and factual errors that totally call into question the valuation of the alleged damage. Annual Financial Report 2018 108 In December 2016, the Commercial Court of Paris, while holding that it could note the existence of acts of unfair competition on the part of the Group, did not determine the amount of the damage and appointed its own court-appointed expert, who was tasked with giving an opinion on the amount of the alleged damage. The Group has appealed this judgement. In early March 2018, the courtappointed expert delivered his final report, which concluded that there was damage of €10.1 million. After consulting with its counsel, the Group believes that it has solid legal and technical arguments to refute the existence of acts of unfair competition and challenge the serious and numerous errors in the report by the court-appointed expert. In December 2018, following discussions with the opposing party and without changing the basis for its initial position, the Group agreed to sign a settlement agreement to definitively and irrevocably resolve the dispute, through the payment by the Group of a fixed sum of €3 million, of which €1.5 million to be borne by Devoteam SA. The various procedures associated with this dispute have now been closed.  When it acquired Wola Info (now Devoteam Poland) in 2010, Devoteam S.A. granted a put option on 38.4% of the remaining capital. Wola’s actual net position – and the company’s overall condition in general – was deliberately concealed by the sellers. Devoteam SA took them to court, refusing to recognise the put option which had been exercised in the meantime. In May 2018, a Polish court ordered Devoteam S.A. to pay €1.5 million for the put option, in addition to penalties for delay and court fees for a total amount of €4.2 million. Devoteam S.A. immediately appealed the judgment. In agreement with its counsel, Devoteam S.A. believes it has a solid case, particularly regarding the disproportionate nature of the penalties for delay compared with the principal amount. At 31 December 2018, Devoteam SA therefore recognised, in addition to the exercise price of the option classified in liabilities since 2010, the amount of €1.5 million in respect of statutory interest and procedural costs which could be due in the event that it loses the appeal. 3.5 Accrued expenses In thousands of euros 2018 Supplier invoices not yet issued 6,475 Credit notes to be prepared 4,915 Personnel accrued expenses 9,875 Social security bodies accrued expenses 8,001 State accrued expenses 846 Interest accrued on bonds 446 Interest accrued on other loans 2 Interest accrued on misc. borrowings 6 Total 30,566 3.6 Accrued income In thousands of euros 2018 Client invoices to be issued 16,133 Total 16,133 Annual Financial Report 2018 109 3.7 Marketable securities 3.7.1 Treasury shares Treasury shares were bought and earmarked for allocation to employees as part of the free share and share purchase option plan.

The new scheme means that every employee has the right, throughout their career, to 20 hours training per year, up to 120 hours, then 12 hours per year up to a maximum of 150 hours. Rights acquired under DIF to 31 December 2014, but not yet used, may be used under the new CPF until 31 December 2020. NOTE 7 EVENTS SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END None. Annual Financial Report 2018 116 4.4 Statutory Auditors' report on the annual financial statements Year ended 31 December 2018 To the General meeting of Shareholders of Devoteam S.A., Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General meeting, we have audited the Devoteam S.A. annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018, as attached to this report. In our opinion, the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, the financial position of the company and the results of its operations for the year ended, in accordance with French accounting principles. The opinion expressed above is consistent with the content of our report to the Audit Committee. Basis of opinion Auditing framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under these standards are set out in the Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors in the auditing of the annual financial statements section of this report. Independence We carried out our audit mission in accordance with the independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 January 2018 to the date of our report, and in particular we did not provide services prohibited by Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the Code of Ethics for the profession of Statutory Auditor. Justification of assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatements which, in our professional judgment, were the most important for the audit of the annual financial statements for the year, as well as the responses we provided to such risks. The assessments thus made fall within the context of the audit of the annual financial statements taken as a whole and the formation of our opinion expressed above. We do not express an opinion on items in these annual financial statements taken individually. Valuation of equity securities (Paragraphs 2.3.1 and 3.2 of the notes to the annual financial statements) Risk identified At 31 December 2018, the equity securities are recognised in the Devoteam S.A. statutory balance sheet for a net amount of €166,652 thousand. Equity securities are recognised at their acquisition date at acquisition cost and may be impaired on the basis of their value in use. Annual Financial Report 2018 117 As stated in Note 2.3.1 Equity securities , a provision for impairment is established when the carrying amount of equity securities is greater than their value in use. This value in use is estimated by Management, either using the discounted future cash flow method adjusted for net debt, or based on the share of net position. The estimate of the value in use requires the exercise of judgment by Management in its choice of the items to be considered, which may correspond, where appropriate, to historical items or to projected items. At the closing date, Management ensures that the carrying amount of equity securities does not exceed their value in use. However, any unfavourable change in the activities related to these investments due to internal or external factors that may be related to the economic and financial environment of the markets in which Devoteam SA operates may significantly affect the value in use of the equity securities and require the recognition of a provision for impairment. Such a development involves a reappraisal of the relevance of all of the assumptions used for the determination of values in use as well as the reasonableness and consistency of the calculation parameters used. We consider the valuation of equity securities to be a key audit matter given the significant amount of equity securities in the financial statements and their sensitivity to the assumptions made by management. Our response Our approach consisted of:  reviewing and evaluating the process implemented by Management to estimate value in use;  for the equity securities for which the value in use is calculated using the discounted cash flow method, adjusted to reflect the cash and/or net debt of the companies in question, assessing the reasonableness of the valuation of the value in use, notably through: interviews with management, a comparison of the cash flow projections resulting from the budgetary and forecasting process for the years 2019 to 2022 with the projections used in the impairment test for the previous year, a comparison of the 2018 results projections used in the previous year's impairment test with actual results to assess their reliability, an assessment of the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the projections in the light of our knowledge of the economic environment in which the Group operates; and, an assessment, with the support of our valuation experts, of the reasonableness of the financial parameters used, the model used to determine value in use and the method used to determine the discounting and long-term growth rates;  for the equity securities for which the value in use is calculated using the share of net position: assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method used, assessing the documentation underlying the valuation of the value in use. Recognition of revenue for fixed-price contracts (Paragraphs 2.10 of the notes to the annual financial statements) Risk identified The Devoteam Group operates in the professional IT services and innovative technology consultancy market. It provides services through subcontracting or fixed-price contracts. For fixed-price services, revenue is recognized as the service is rendered according to the stage of completion, which is determined by comparing the costs incurred at closing with the total expected costs over the duration of the contract. Annual Financial Report 2018 118 The total costs of a contract, in particular those still to be incurred, are regularly monitored and estimated to determine whether the stage of completion of the contract and the level of margin to be recognised need to be revised. We considered the recognition of revenue from fixed-price service contracts to be a key audit matter because the estimated costs for those contracts are based on operational assumptions and their estimation has a direct impact on the level of revenue and margin recognised in the annual financial statements. Our response We reviewed the internal control systems related to the recognition of fixed-price contracts. We tested the effectiveness of the key controls put in place by the management controllers, in particular those relating to the allocation of costs. For a selection of contracts based on quantitative and qualitative criteria, we performed the following due diligence:  we reconciled the financial data (revenue, invoicing, costs and work in progress) included in the monitoring sheet for the contract prepared monthly by management control, with the accounting;  on the basis of interviews with the management controllers and/or operational managers, we assessed the remaining costs to be incurred and the stage of completion of the contract that they have determined and on which the accounting of the revenue figure and the recognition of the margin is based. Specific verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations. Information provided in the management report and in the other documents addressed to the Shareholders with respect to the financial position and the annual financial statements We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Management board and in the other documents addressed to the Shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. We attest to the fair presentation and the consistency with the annual financial statements of the information relating to payment periods mentioned in Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code. Report on corporate governance We attest that the report of the Supervisory Board on corporate governance contains the information required by Articles L. 225-37-3 and L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from companies controlling your company or controlled by it. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. Other information In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the Shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report. Annual Financial Report 2018 119 Information resulting from other legal and regulatory requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed statutory auditors of Devoteam SA by the General meeting of 26 July 1999 for KPMG and 20 June 2014 for Grant Thornton. As of 31 December 2018, KPMG S.A. was in the second year of its mission without interruption and Grant Thornton in the fifth year. Moreover, KPMG SA and KPMG Audit IS are members of the KPMG network and were previously Statutory Auditors of the entity from 1999 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2016, respectively. Responsibilities of the management and corporate governance officers with respect to the annual financial statements It is the responsibility of management to prepare annual financial statements that present a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles and to put in place the internal controls that it deems necessary for the preparation of annual financial statements that are free of material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error. In the preparation of the annual financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the ability of the company to continue as a going concern, to present in those financial statements, as appropriate, the necessary information relating to the continuity of operations and apply the going concern accounting policy unless it is planning to wind up the company or cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process and monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems and, as applicable, the internal audit with respect to procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information. These annual financial statements have been approved by the Management Board. Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors with respect to the auditing of the annual financial statements Audit objective and process It is our responsibility to prepare a report on the annual financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance that the annual financial statements taken as a whole do not contain any material misstatements. Reasonable assurance corresponds to a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with the standards of professional practice can consistently detect any significant anomalies. Anomalies may arise from fraud or error and are considered significant where it can reasonably be expected that they, taken individually or cumulatively, may influence the economic decisions that readers of the statements take based thereon. As specified by Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our mission to certify the financial statements does not constitute a guarantee of the viability or quality of the management of your company. In the context of an audit conducted in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, Statutory Auditors exercise their professional judgment throughout the audit. Moreover:  they identify and assess the risks that the annual financial statements contain material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error, define and implement audit procedures to address those risks, and collect items they consider sufficient and appropriate for the formation of their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than for a material misstatement resulting from an error, as the fraud may involve collusion, falsification, voluntary omissions, misrepresentation or circumventing of internal controls; Annual Financial Report 2018 120  they review the internal controls relevant to the audit in order to define appropriate audit procedures in the circumstances, not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls;  they assess the appropriateness of the accounting methods used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as the information concerning them provided in the annual financial statements;  they assess the appropriateness of management's application of the going concern accounting policy and, depending on the evidence gathered, the existence or non-existence of significant uncertainties related to events or circumstances that may call into question the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the information gathered up to the date of its report, but it should be noted that subsequent circumstances or events could jeopardise the continuity of operations. If they conclude that there is significant uncertainty, they draw the attention of readers of their report to the information provided in the annual financial statements about such uncertainty or, if the information is not provided or is irrelevant, they formulate a qualified certification or a refusal to certify;  they assess the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and assess whether the annual financial statements reflect the underlying transactions and events such that they give a true and fair view of them. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee that outlines the scope of the audit work and the programme implemented, as well as the conclusions arising from our work. We also disclose, where appropriate, the significant weaknesses in the internal controls that we identified with respect to the procedures relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information. Among the elements disclosed in the report to the Audit Committee are the risks of material misstatement that we consider to have been the most important for the audit of the annual financial statements for the year, and which therefore constitute the key points of the audit that it is our responsibility to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration mentioned in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537-2014 confirming our independence, within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as laid down in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the Code of Ethics for the profession of Statutory Auditor. As appropriate, we discuss the risks to our independence and the safeguards applied with the Audit Committee.

Established in 1995, the Group is run by a Management board with two members: Stanislas de Bentzmann, Chairman, and Godefroy de Bentzmann, CEO, the founders of Devoteam. The Group also has a number of supervisory bodies: a Supervisory Board chaired by Michel Bon, former Chairman of Orange (France Telecom) and Carrefour; an Audit Committee in charge of overseeing all matters relating to the preparation and audit of financial information; a Compensation Committee in charge of the compensation policy applicable to the executive staff. This committee also serves as a Nominations Committee when required to do so; a Strategy Committee in charge of shortand medium-term strategic decisions. 5.1.1 Message from the General Secretary There is an inescapable focus today on sustainable development and CSR in particular at our level not just for large companies, but for society as a whole. Ignoring this could put the future of our company in jeopardy, not to mention that of upcoming generations, making redundant all of the digitisation work we are currently carrying out. Devoteam is therefore actively committed to a more sustainable policy . 5.1.2 Our values In 2005, to mark its 10th anniversary, Devoteam organised a seminar for all of its staff around the world with a view to identifying the Group’s values. The Devoteam Charter can be found below. Annual Financial Report 2018 122 Annual Financial Report 2018 123 5.1.3 Corporate governance In January 2017, a Sustainable Development Committee was set up to implement an ambitious CSR policy based on four pillars: environment; employee-related; business ethics; responsible purchasing. The committee meets once a month to monitor the progress of projects implemented for each of the four pillars. In addition, the CSR Officer meets with the people responsible for each pillar twice a month so that CSR initiatives can be carried out in these specific areas. 5.1.4 Awards, accreditation and certification Since its inception, the Group has received several awards in recognition of its commitments to good governance. Most Attractive Employer (Universum) is a ranking based on a questionnaire sent out to more than 40,000 students and professionals, which identifies the 130 most attractive companies for engineers. This ranking allows us to gauge our reputation and attractiveness and observe how these change over time. It is crucial that Devoteam measures its attractiveness in a market where talent is increasingly in demand. Happy Trainees is a label awarded on the basis of a questionnaire sent to our trainees. This highlights both the quality of the courses we offer and the quality of support given to our trainees. For the 20172018 school year, we received a recommendation rate of 87%. Annual Financial Report 2018 124 Diversity Charter: a commitment by the Group to promote diversity and outline its plan to tackle discrimination. It is essential that we affirm our commitment to accepting other people. Respect, and by extension respect for differences, is one of Devoteam’s core values. Our employees need to feel free to be themselves and to feel accepted in spite of their differences. As a signatory to the Global Compact, we are committed to upholding the 10 principles laid down by the United Nations in 1999. These principles are wholly suited to the business and the CSR context. As a signatory to the Global Compact, we frame our CSR policy around these guiding principles. In 2018, Devoteam was listed as one of the 20 “Most attractive employers” in France by Glassdoor, all industries combined. Glassdoor is an online platform where current and former employees of businesses can anonymously rate their working environment. Ecovadis CSR Rating: Devoteam was awarded the Silver label in November 2018, proof of its commitment to corporate social responsibility. Devoteam hopes to continue these CSR efforts to reach Gold level. Devoteam SA (GROUP) is among the top 12% of companies rated by EcoVadis in the computer programming, consulting and related activities business sector. Annual Financial Report 2018 125 Gaia Rating: the Gaia Rating result has once again played testament to Devoteam's ambitious CSR policy. Devoteam's CSR score on this non-financial questionnaire has increased by 18%, climbing to 67th place. 5.1.5 Business model and NFPS Devoteam's business model is set out in section 2.1 Activity of Devoteam SA and its subsidiaries during the financial year .

This collaborative work enabled us to identify the main non-financial risks affecting our financial performance and to what degree. Attendees at these meetings also established the priority level of each of these risks. Having identified the main risks linked to Devoteam's activity, the various stakeholders added their policies for the mitigation of these non-financial risks. Lastly, to properly monitor these risks, the stakeholders then added their own key performance indicators to track the policies put in place. Annual Financial Report 2018 126 5.2 Employee-related 5.2.1 Employment 5.2.1.1 Total headcount At 31 December 2018, the Devoteam Group employed 6,975 people, compared to 5,195 people at 31 December 2017. The data presented below relates to 6,573 employees (i.e. 94.24% of total employees). Excluded from the scope: Devoteam Management Consulting Belgium, Paradigmo SA/NV (Belgium), Devoteam Denmark, D2SI, MyFowo (France), DiamondbyBold Lda, Neos Lda, Precise Lda, NauOn SA (Portugal), representing 402 employees. 5.2.1.2 Breakdown of headcount by gender, age and geographical area At 31 December 2018, 74% of employees were men and 26% were women, compared with 76% and 24% respectively in 2017. This majority share of male employees reflects the fact that a large proportion of our new recruits come from engineering schools, traditionally attended by more males than females. As the principal activity of Devoteam is digital transformation consulting, the vast majority of our employees work directly with our clients at their premises (mainly key accounts). These represent approximately 75% of our workforce. The remaining 25% work at our premises. The breakdown by age bracket is below. 31-Dec-18 31-Dec-17 Variation as a Breakdown Breakdown Variation by Age category Number of Number of percentage as a as a number employees employees (2017percentage percentage 2018) 18 24 486 7% 365 7% 122 33% 25 34 3,257 50% 2,338 47% 917 39% 35 44 1,673 25% 1,266 25% 407 32% 45 54 867 14% 760 15% 107 14% > 55 290 4% 251 5% 39 16% Total 6,573 100% 4,980 100% 1,593 The breakdown by geographical area reflects the fact that the Group has several sites in France and is present in 18 countries in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Mexico, as shown below: 31-Dec-18 31-Dec-17 Variation as a Breakdown Breakdown Variation Geographical area Number of Number of percentage as a as a by number employees employees (2017percentage percentage 2018) France 3,073 47% 2,562 51% 511 20% Europe 2,943 45% 1,945 39% 998 51% Rest of the world * 557 8% 473 9% 84 18% Total 6,573 100% 4,980 100% 1,593 * Mainly North Africa, Mexico and Persian Gulf countries 5.2.1.3 Working arrangements 31-Dec-18 31-Dec-17 Variation as Variation a Recruitments Breakdown Breakdown by percentage Number of Number of as a as a number (2017employees employees percentage percentage 2018) Open-ended contract 2,564 88% 1,776 98% 788 44% Fixed-term contract 350 12% 34 2% 316 929% Total 2,914 100% 1,810 100% 1,104 5.2.2 Training and career management Annual Financial Report 2018 127 5.2.2.1 Training Since its creation, Devoteam has invested heavily in a comprehensive skills and knowledge management system, organised around three main areas: a training plan dedicated to external training; Devoteam Academy, a structure dedicated to the internal training designed and provided by our experts. As a business in the digital industry, Devoteam offers consulting services on innovative technologies to support its clients through their digital transformation. This industry requires employees to develop their skills and keep them up to date through training, so as to be able to address the issues facing our clients. Devoteam SA has therefore developed an ambitious training policy and sets aside more than 2.3% of its gross payroll each year for training. This policy is based on certified technical training, a hallmark of quality in our industry, and on behavioural training, vital to meeting the needs of our clients and building strong relationships with them. Staff training is a key lever of the business strategy, making a significant contribution towards achieving ambitious goals. It also helps us to attract new talent year after year. To this end, Devoteam created the Knowledge Up Program in 2018; a 3-year initiative to attract young graduates, offering them visibility over their professional future and the chance to develop their skills with a career path involving certifiable and behavioural training.  Devoteam Academy Devoteam Academy is central to our skills management project and to the company’s strategy. It is a space in which discussion and healthy competition are encouraged. We believe that this in turn creates cohesion between employees. Devoteam University can improve the overall performance of the Group through: the development and promotion of internal training; the growth of collective and individual skills in line with the changes in our business lines; the creation of standardised, consistent training programs that are tailored to our industry; the encouragement of sharing and learning. Devoteam University is also an opportunity for employees to share their knowledge. In accordance with our objectives over the past three years, in 2018, Devoteam SA extended its training programme. 38% of training this year was provided in-house, representing almost 7,000 training hours. Devoteam strongly believes in the importance of the role of local managers and has created a training plan comprised of a variety of training modules: management basics; managing in compliance with employment law; Devoteam tools to support them in their role. In 2018, Devoteam SA launched a Learning Management System, My Devoteam Academy (MDA) which offers all consultants access to the training courses linked to Devoteam's positioning and strategy and therefore oriented towards SMACS (Social, Mobility, Analytics, Cloud, Security). My Devoteam Academy users can also apply for online training and monitor management approval through real-time processes and explore new learning methods. This portal offers: digital training: e-learning, MOOC; classroom/blended training: staff can access a brochure presenting classroom and blended training (classroom training and other forms of distance learning), including certification. Training requires management approval if it takes place during working hours; training assessments; an evaluation process comprising feedback from the student at the end of the training; feedback from the manager within 3-6 months of the training to assess the new knowledge/skills learned and the practical application thereof; feedback from the trainer on the homogeneity of his/her group and the in-house training conditions. Annual Financial Report 2018 128 Lastly, with regard to this training scheme, Devoteam can introduce positioning and/or skills acquisition tests, for instance to determine whether prerequisites have been met for the training selected and to ensure the members of each group are at a similar level to each other. My Devoteam Academy opened in France to confirm and standardise our best practices and to establish a strong, communal space for sharing knowledge and experiences. For this Academy, Devoteam has obtained quality certification which guarantees the quality of the courses provided and makes them eligible for funding from accredited training fund bodies. Since October 2018, Devoteam has had VeriSelect certification (from Bureau Veritas).  Devoteam Research and Innovation (DRI) Created in 2012, Devoteam Research and Innovation (DRI) is responsible for supporting the definition of innovative and high added value solutions in line with the Group's strategy. Its work is underpinned by the desire to support our clients in the digital transformation battle. In 2018, in coordination with the Devoteam experts and using feedback from our clients, we launched a number of themes based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a particular focus on HR and the handling of complex IT requests as well as graph-based usages. DRI continued its work to improve our clients' infrastructures, and in particular their access to hybrid cloud and Move2Cloud solutions, and container performance. Lastly, DRI has also been working hard on security and risk management tools, complemented by transformation solutions and agility in particular. A breakdown of these activities is shown in the following graph: Breakdown of R&D work by domain 2018 Transformation Management 14,23% Agile IT 42,21% Security 23,47% DWP Customer 7,81% business DaaS excellence 8,84% 3,45% 5.2.2.2 Career management Employee satisfaction survey: This was introduced by Devoteam in 2013 to measure the level of employee satisfaction. The surveys are completed each month following the submission of activity reports for all Devoteam SA employees. Staff are asked three questions: 1. How would you generally describe your links with Devoteam? 2. How would you describe your relationship with Devoteam management? 3. How would you describe your project environment? A score of 1 to 4 is given (4 being the highest) 1: dissatisfied 2: moderately satisfied Annual Financial Report 2018 129 3: satisfied 4: extremely satisfied Comments may also be added, although this is not compulsory. In addition, employees can ask to be excluded from satisfaction surveys. The responses to questions 1 and 2 are emailed to Human Resources Business Partners (HRBP), line manager and their line manager’s superior. Any dissatisfaction triggers a corrective action plan by HRBP and/or the Manager through a call, email or face-to-face discussion. Each month, HRBP processes the responses to compile statistics based on curve models for the scores for each question, noting the overall trends: by entity; by sector; by seniority. Employees are not obliged to respond to the questionnaire sent. If an employee does not wish to complete the questionnaire, they are excused from this monthly process. Lastly, a presentation with satisfaction/dissatisfaction graphs is sent to all managers, department heads, HRBP (Human Resources Business Partners) and the Executive Board for a constructive follow-up to the project. 5.2.3 Working conditions 5.2.3.1 Work/life balance  Teleworking agreement As part of the extension of the teleworking agreement at Devoteam SA signed in 2017 between Devoteam and the CFDT, CFE-CGC and UNSA unions, an extension amendment was signed in 2018 for a period of two years. Since teleworking involves a new type of working arrangement offering staff more flexibility, it can help to balance the employee’s work and private life. In principal, Devoteam allows its employees to work from home twice a week. Teleworking days must be agreed between the employee and their manager.  Right to disconnect The French Labour Code gives everyone the right to disconnect and have proper daily and weekly rest periods. Since talks with the unions collapsed on this subject, Devoteam SA Management introduced a charter on the right to disconnect. Among other things, this reminds people of the right to disconnect from work. Managers must lead by example, although employees also play an important role and should take steps to enforce their right to disconnect. The charter also calls for proper rest periods and holiday, and stresses the importance of reasonable use of information and communication technologies. Monitoring of rest periods is also carried out by way of a form which employees must complete weekly to confirm that they have taken proper periods of rest. If an employee states that he/she has not taken proper rest periods, a meeting is immediately organised to understand why he or she has not been able to do so and to take the necessary steps to ensure that this does not happen again. The Department has also developed a personalised e-learning module on the right to disconnect, covering the principles set out in the charter, accessible to all, such that all employees are aware of and understand this concept of the right to disconnect and how to properly use digital tools. Annual Financial Report 2018 130  Donating paid leave As part of the implementation in 2017 of the scheme allowing staff to donate paid leave to colleagues with seriously ill children for one year, this scheme was extended in 2018 by a company-wide agreement signed between Devoteam SA and the CFDT, CFE-CGC and UNSA unions. This agreement, signed for one year, extended the scheme which allows staff to donate paid leave to colleagues caring for a child of less than 20 years of age suffering from an illness, disability or victim of a particularly serious accident requiring a sustained presence and intensive care, and extends it to help employees in a co-habiting relationship with someone suffering from a severe loss of independence or with a disability. In accordance with the procedure set out by this agreement, these employees can benefit from days of paid leave donated by their colleagues. With regard to requests for donations of paid leave to care for a seriously ill child, the agreement signed in 2018 states that Devoteam SA will also participate in the donation, granting to the employee half of the required number of paid authorised days of leave stated in his or her request.  Local management: Career Manager In early 2018, Devoteam decided to reinforce its local management to better support its employees. As its employees are based at a variety of client premises, developing and maintaining relationships is our priority. Beyond this, their role is to support the consultants along their career path by helping define their goals and skills development plans. This manager role was assigned to experienced consultants with natural management ability or skills. Devoteam has introduced a training programme that comprises a number of different training modules: management basics; managing in compliance with employment law; Devoteam tools to support them in their role. 5.2.3.2 Occupational health and safety  Psychosocial risk prevention policy To help prevent psychosocial risks, we have introduced an HR proximity policy to enable us to identify more easily and swiftly any potential difficulties faced by our employees. Human Resources staff and managers regularly visit client premises to meet with our consultants working there. Furthermore, the consultants are asked to complete a monthly Consultant Satisfaction Survey which looks at their satisfaction in a number of areas: the atmosphere on the project on which they are working; their relationship with their manager; their overall relationship with Devoteam. They can also add comments to any of their answers. Depending on the scores given and/or comments made, the Head of Human Resources and their manager may be alerted, who can then meet with the employee and establish an action plan if necessary. This process also helps to highlight any potential difficulties. Furthermore, all managers are trained by an external expert in the management of psychosocial risks (PSR). The aim of this training is to: inform them about what constitutes a PSR; inform them about what can cause PSR; equip them with the skills to identify and manage a PSR situation (steps to be taken/refer the employee to the most appropriate person depending on the type of PSR). Annual Financial Report 2018 131 Lastly, Devoteam also has an alert procedure in place for when a colleague is suffering or suspected to be suffering from PSR. This procedure is described in a memorandum available on our intranet. It is also regularly distributed to employees. The memorandum contains a definition of PSR and a list of people to be contacted should employees experience any symptoms or suspect that a colleague is at risk. The contact details for members of the health and safety committee and company doctors are available on notice boards and the Hive intranet.  Stress-reducing measures We have put in place stress-reducing measures with regular reminders of guidelines for behaviour in open-plan offices, so as to ensure a calm working environment. A number of initiatives are also taken to help enable employees to protect against stress, including raising awareness among management on how to prevent PSR. In addition, we have published an alert procedure for employees who are experiencing symptoms or who suspect that a colleague is at risk. This is also published on our Workplace intranet. Lastly, we are currently updating our single risk assessment form (mandatory document listing the various risks facing employees, appended hereto) and are preparing the annual prevention plan to improve working conditions in light of incidents that have occurred and the areas identified for improvement.  Sports membership Keen to promote well-being at work, Devoteam SA has entered into a partnership with a company to offer employees (and two named beneficiaries each) access to a nationwide network of gyms in France. This scheme, which requires no commitment from employees and offers very low rates compared to the usual cost of gym membership, is proving popular among staff; registration numbers are growing every month. 5.2.3.3 Accidents at work and absenteeism During 2018, the Group recorded 1,100 days of absence in France (compared with 24 accidents and 659 days of absence in 2017). The absenteeism rate is 3.68% for France (including maternity and paternity leave). 5.2.4 Combating discrimination and diversity policy Since its creation in 1995, Devoteam has prohibited the application of discriminatory criteria in the recruitment of employees, particularly criteria related to origin, gender, lifestyle, sexual orientation, actual or presumed ethnicity, nationality or race, political opinions, trade union or mutualist activities, religious beliefs, physical appearance, name, health, disability, pregnancy, age, marital status or genetic characteristics. The Devoteam Charter reflects the Group's desire to act in this way, namely to represent diversity in the workforce of all its subsidiaries. It encourages the implementation of a human resources management policy that focuses on the support and recognition of individual skills. Through this, the company wants to promote cohesion and social equality.  Disability policy Group agreement: As part of its corporate responsibility initiative, Devoteam and the majority of the trade unions signed their third agreement on 29 January on the employment and retention within the workforce of people with disabilities. This follows the agreement signed with Agefiph covering the periods between May 2009 and May 2011 and the agreements covering the periods 2012-2014 and 2015-2017. This three-year agreement (2018-2020) has four objectives: to encourage the further recruitment of employees with disabilities; to develop actions to retain in the workforce employees with disabilities; to develop the use of adapted companies (EA) and assistance centres helping disabled people into work (ESAT) to arrange subcontracting with the protected sector; Annual Financial Report 2018 132 to raise awareness among staff and management through communication and training campaigns. The main purpose of the disability policy is to: educate and inform employees on disability; support initiatives suggested by disabled workers; coordinate all measures to promote the recruitment and retention within the workforce of people with disabilities; become a principal contact for other parties that deal with disability (Cap emploi, occupational health services, ergonomists, etc.). As such, over each agreement period Devoteam recruits around 20 workers with disabilities and retains them in employment (via adjustments to equipment, rotas, working hours, transfers with relocation assistance, etc.). With regard to the difficulty in recruiting disabled workers at the required levels at Devoteam, every year the Group offers support to job seekers looking to improve their skills, particularly through funding training, through the organisation Many Rivers (disabled persons' training centre in Paris) in the following areas: job seeking techniques and strategies; office skills; english; interpersonal communication. Each year since the agreement was signed in 2009, Devoteam has been actively involved in the annual Disability Week, when it promotes various activities to employees at its premises, including for example: workshops including the Day-to-day independence workshop: presentation by and discussion with a consultant on objects and technical assistance available to disabled people to increase their everyday (personal and professional) independence, a Working with cancer workshop and Talking about invisible disabilities? , where employees learn to become aware of the difficulties associated with invisible disabilities such as short-term memory loss, muscle weakness, visual impairment, dyslexia, physical pain, mental suffering, deafness, diabetes, musculo-skeletal disorders, depression, anxiety, cancer, epilepsy, etc., and discuss with consultants their experiences of and thoughts on the consequences of such disabilities; all Group employees could also take part in the “DevoHandiQuiz” and “DevoHandiMovies” competitions, designed to raise awareness among the teams (at both our premises and client premises in Ile-deFrance and other regions) of these concepts; Disability awareness through inclusive companies: during European Disability Employment Week, Devoteam organised awareness-raising actions with actors in the technology and disability sector, who took part in the Handitech Awards for inclusive companies; to dispel stereotypical ideas about disability and encourage the integration of disabled people, Devoteam holds annual training for all HR managers on the recruitment and employment of disabled people. Digital accessibility of our recruitment and communication channels As part of its Disability policy, in 2017 Devoteam decided to make its French website and careers site accessible to people suffering from visual, cognitive and mobility disabilities. The aim is to link digital transformation with disability by making Devoteam’s main digital channels accessible. In seeking to create shared value, the Group wishes to indirectly tackle “the exclusion of disabled people online”.  Women at Devoteam The provisions of Law No. 2018-771 of 5 September 2018 on the freedom to choose one's professional future requires that all companies evaluate the pay gap between men and women and publish the results. Initially, this covers companies with more than 1,000 employees who must meet this requirement by 1 March 2019. Companies whose workforce is between 250 and 1,000 employees must publish their results by 1 September 2019 and those employing between 50 and 250 people have until 1 March 2020. Annual Financial Report 2018 133 So that each company can carry out this evaluation, a Gender Equality Index has been created by the Government and is applicable to all companies. Based on five indicators (gender pay gap, wage increase gap, promotion gap, percentage of employees receiving raises after maternity leave and number of employees of each gender among the company's top 10 highest-paid employees), this index gives companies a score out of a total of 100 points. This score enables companies to identify where there is room for improvement and the areas on which they can focus to ensure professional equality. In accordance with the provisions of this Law, Devoteam SA calculated its Gender Equality Index and obtained a score of 74 points out of 100 for 2018. Excellent scores were obtained on the first three indicators (gender pay gap, wage increase gap, promotion gap), but the index highlighted that we need to focus on our efforts on the last two indicators (percentage of employees receiving raises after maternity leave and number of employees of each gender among the company's top 10 highest-paid employees). Measures will be taken to improve our overall score next year. Conscious of gender disparity in the digital sector (male/female breakdown in our target schools: 74% men, 26% women – source: Devoteam), Devoteam is keen to spotlight women working in the industry to promote gender equality. With this in mind, Devoteam is launching Devoteam au féminin [Women at Devoteam] events to promote digital careers within all of its entities. The event held on 8 March 2018 invited people to think about The journey of women in the IT world and The transition between school and the corporate world for young female graduates in the sector . Promotion of and compliance with the provisions of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization 5.2.4.1 Means of communication and expression for employees The Group has always encouraged communication between employees, so as to inspire the sharing of knowledge. This year, a new in-house collaborative platform, “Hive”, was made available to Group employees. This platform, a veritable tool for internal communication, is somewhere that all employees can express themselves, add comments, and share knowledge or information on projects; it is the linchpin of collaborative work at Devoteam. In addition, Devoteam has introduced an internal social network called Workplace by Facebook , which enables employees to share news and experiences and to plan events just as they can on the Facebook social network. However, this network is only for in-house employees. In addition, the Group regularly organises festive and social events that offer Group employees the chance to spend time together and develop bonds. Some are aimed more at consultants (six-monthly kick-off, afterwork events, etc.), while others cater for head office staff (plenary meetings, garden party, etc. ). However, we make sure that all categories of employee can take part regularly in these internal events. Our main goal is for employees to embrace Devoteam’s values and to develop a sense of belonging to the company. 5.2.4.2 Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining The Group endeavours to respect and promote collective bargaining between employers and staff representative bodies, as well as freedom of association. In addition, Devoteam is a signatory to the Global Compact and is thus committed to respecting the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. 5.2.4.3 Abolition of forced labour and child labour It goes without saying that, in light of the type of business carried out by the Group, there is no forced or compulsory labour, nor any child labour. The Group, both in France and internationally, complies with domestic laws and international conventions. Annual Financial Report 2018 134 Employees enter into contracts following a clear recruitment process during which the two parties decide, of their own accord, to work together. This agreement is formalised by the signing of an employment contract that sets out the rights and obligations of both parties. The Group does not employ any children, either in France or in any of its subsidiaries. As a signatory to the Global Compact, we are committed to eliminating all forms of forced or compulsory labour. 5.2.5 Employee-related KPIs – reporting scope INDICATORS UNIT 2018 2017 Headcount Reported headcount at 31/12 Actual headcount 6,573 4,980 % women 26 24 Breakdown of the workforce by gender % men 74 76 % of employees under 25 7 7 % of employees between 25 and 35 50 47 Breakdown of the workforce by age group % of employees between 35 and 45 25 25 % of employees over 45 18 21 Recruitments and departures Total number of hires Number of hires 3,017 1,724 Hires on permanent contracts Number of hires 2,564 1,561 Hires on fixed-term contracts Number of hires 350 131 Total number of departures Number of departures 1,752 1,193 Resignation Number of departures 1,213 743 Redundancy Number of departures 248 113 End of fixed-term contract Number of departures 80 64 Retirement Number of departures 3 4 Death Number of departures 4 1 Other Number of departures 204 268 Management Adaptation of workstations for people with Number 8 8 disabilities (3) Employment rate of people with disabilities (3) % 2 2 Training (2) Training expenditure as a % of payroll % 3 3 (1) Total number of training hours hours 140,048 96,402 Percentage of people trained during the year % of women trained 68 72 by gender (2) % of men trained 63 73 Internal events (2) Internal and external events Number 140 125 (1) Scope: Devoteam SA, Devoteam G Cloud, Axance, Belgium, Netherlands (excluding TMNS), Austria, Germany, Siticom GmbH, Middle East.

(3) Devoteam SA, Devoteam Consulting, S’Team, Siticom, Technologies et Operations, Devoteam G Cloud. 5.2.6 Action plan and targets The company’s employee-related policy depends very much on new regulations and changes in employment law. Devoteam wants to focus this year on the monitoring and development of new KPIs which have been identified, so as to find ways of improving in the coming years. Annual Financial Report 2018 135 Devoteam plans to develop a Group-wide Human Resources Information Systems tool (SIRH) to support the integration and skills development of employees, as well as to ensure operational effectiveness. To meet this commitment and introduce the best solution between now and 2020, Devoteam has created a dedicated internal project team. Devoteam plans to bring back Knowledge Communities in 2019. The Knowledge Communities were set up 16 years ago to improve business performance and the day-today work and skills of employees. Now present in 17 countries, these 17 Communities bring together consultants and focus on skills related to Devoteam’s offerings, such as the Cloud, IT Service Excellence, Digital and Mobility, IT Transformation, and Cybersecurity. Devoteam will continue to develop its digital training programme to support international clients and encourage joint projects with other Group companies by improving employees' English-language skills. Devoteam has plans to roll-out its LMS (Learning Machine System) abroad, especially in Germany, the Middle East, Spain and Luxembourg. Devoteam will also continue to encourage staff to work on projects aimed at creating innovative new solutions, whether in association with Devoteam or not. To that end, Devoteam wants to set up an ideas platform in 2019 to develop these internal projects. Furthermore, Devoteam is looking to introduce a comic strip and a Hand’E-Passport e-learning module covering 10 topics including the benefit of disabled worker status , disability-friendly managers and learning difficulties. This tool will help raise awareness of disability-related issues among all staff and managers. Lastly, a training plan on HR CSR issues will be launched in 2019 for the people concerned at Devoteam. Devoteam Technology is planning to launch an e-learning module on Diversity in 2019 with a view to raising maximum awareness of this issue among its employees. Furthermore, a module will be specifically created for managers and another for recruitment. 5.3 Environment Due to the nature of the Group’s business, it does not present any significant direct risks to the environment and biodiversity. The policies, measures and KPIs listed below cover the French scope. However, the Group has long-standing initiatives in place to raise awareness of environmental issues among its staff. As such, Devoteam carried out a full review of its carbon footprint in France in 2018, so as to have a detailed overview of its emissions and prepare a comprehensive action plan to reduce its environmental impact. Below is the Devoteam carbon footprint assessment carried out in 2018, which covers emissions for 2017. Annual Financial Report 2018 136 5.3.1 Carbon footprint assessment 2016/2017 Carbon footprint assessment for France in 2017: 3,809 tCO2 (2,910 en 2016) or 1.42 tCO2e (1.39 en 2016) per employee in France 5.3.1.1 Note on methodology The results of the carbon footprint assessment shown above are for France in 2017. The methodology consisted of taking all the data from the 2017 financial report, which includes a regulatory CSR section. All the other data were integrated with the help of the purchasing, accounting and general services departments. A questionnaire on commuting was also sent out to all employees to learn more about the carbon impact of staff travel. More than 900 staff responded, out of a total of 2,333. We used this sample to obtain the above results. To this we added the environmental impact of our vehicle fleet; this figure was consolidated by our fleet manager. France accounts for 46% of the workforce and 50% of the revenue of the Devoteam Group. We want to extend the scope of the carbon calculation in future years to raise staff awareness of their impact on the environment and to respond locally to a global issue. 5.3.2 Waste As part of its waste management policy, Devoteam is working with Elise, an adapted company (a company where at least 80% of the workforce consists of people with disabilities), to recycle our waste. Choosing this supplier thus has a twofold impact: (indirectly) promoting the employment of people with disabilities, and recycling and monitoring our waste-related impacts. We have therefore undertaken to introduce waste sorting in all offices in France. In addition, our employees have benefited from an awareness-raising campaign by the Elise manager on selective waste sorting. This training was filmed, with the manager’s permission, by our internal communication department. It will be posted on our intranet so that all our employees can view it ahead of the roll-out of Elise recycling bins at our premises throughout France.  WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) We have signed an agreement with the adapted company ATF Gaia to recycle our waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). We want to broaden and develop this agreement to have a positive impact Annual Financial Report 2018 137 on society by supporting the employment of people with disabilities and reducing our negative environmental impacts by recycling complex waste.  Paper In 2018, Devoteam consumed 4,658 kg of paper, 8% less than in 2017. Conscious of the impact of this on the environment, the Group regularly organises awareness-raising campaigns to remind employees of the following best practices: Devoteam's commitments: use only PEFC/Eco-label paper (this guarantees that the wood used has come from forests managed so as to avoid any negative economic, social or environmental impact) ensure optimum printer settings, use environmentally friendly printing companies; Advice to employees: use double-sided printing and print multiple pages on one sheet wherever possible, do not automatically print documents (e.g. emails).  Waste reporting As such, in 2018, the amount of waste recycled was: Category Quantity of recycled waste CO2e of avoided emissions Cans 153 kg 4,055 kg Plastic bottles/cups 496 kg 5,439 kg Paper/cardboard 3,048 kg 915 kg Source: Elise in France Food waste: Not applicable 5.3.3 Energy The Group's activity does not involve the use of water or electricity beyond normal use in buildings occupied for its activity. Consequently, the Group does not have any specific process for monitoring its consumption. Similarly, its consumption of raw materials is also very limited. Nevertheless, in accordance with best practice, the Group is committed to limiting its water and electricity consumption. The Group also introduced various measures three years ago to reduce its energy consumption in France: all buildings in France have been partially fitted with LED lighting; all lighting in buildings (offices and communal areas) is connected to a central switch on each floor and a timer to ensure all lights are turned off at night and at weekends; an energy audit of the buildings in France was carried out and did not reveal any significant anomalies. These actions enabled us to reduce our consumption in 2018 to 865,018 kWh (on a like-for-like basis), representing a 4% decrease year-on-year. As the majority of our employees work at our clients' premises (BtoB), our energy consumption is based only on available data. Lastly, Devoteam took the decision to change energy supplier and move to 100% certified green energy in March 2018. Annual Financial Report 2018 138 5.3.4 Travel As part of their work, certain Group employees use a company car and the management of this fleet of cars is closely monitored on a permanent basis. In France, the average CO2 emissions of vehicles in the Group's fleet of company cars at 31 December 2018, was 104g/km (compared to 102g/km in 2017). This is below the threshold for a penalty to be incurred (131g/km) but above the threshold at which a bonus is paid (90g/km). For a total of approximately 4.2 million km driven (3.8 million in 2017), CO2emissions amounted to approximately 438 tonnes of CO2 in 2018 (387 tonnes in 2017). In accordance with its best practice commitments, the Group recommends that employees reduce their most polluting travel. Business travel by air of employees of the Group’s French scope represented just over 3.2 million km (compared with 2.5 million in 2017), equal to approximately 582 tonnes of CO 2 emitted in 2018 (against 461 tonnes in 2017). Lastly, for the Group's French scope, CO2 emissions linked to rail travel in 2018 totalled 9 tonnes for 1.6 million km travelled. 5.3.5 Equipment Conscious of the environmental impact of our purchases and the use of products purchased, Devoteam is keen to reduce the environmental impact of its supply chain and in the use of its equipment. Devoteam Trends: use low-consumption options where possible (energy saving bulbs, LCD screens, energy efficient copiers, etc.); use of chips with the lowest TDP (Thermal Design Power, which denotes power consumption) with comparable performance; all our equipment (telephones, computers, etc.) is set up for teleconferencing; the Group's IT department ensures that it repairs all computers and mobile phones to prolong their useful life and to reduce the environmental impact of electronic equipment. Advice to employees: use a mug or paper cups for drinks; avoid waste; put forward any suggestions to the CSR Officer and General Services. 5.3.6 Biodiversity  Beehives Mindful of environmental issues and biodiversity in particular, Devoteam is seeking to address these fundamental issues by installing beehives on the roofs of its head office buildings. Bees have been on the endangered species list since 2016. Yet they play a vital role in pollination, which allows plants to reproduce. Without bees, the survival of all these plants is under threat, and ultimately so is our biodiversity. Devoteam has set up four beehives on its roofs to raise staff awareness on this subject. Each year, the honey produced is given to employees.  Environmental KPIs INDICATORS UNIT 2018 2017 Consumption of natural resources Quantity of paper consumed per employee kg/employee 13.8 17.4 Total quantity of paper consumed kg 4,658 5,025 % of recycled or certified paper % 100 100 Total energy consumption kWh 1,009,423 899,070 Annual Financial Report 2018 139 Business travel Kilograms of CO2 equivalent linked to the distance kg CO2e 582,000 461,000 travelled on business by air Average CO2 emissions per km travelled by the g CO2/km 5.3 5.1 company’s vehicle fleet Kilograms of CO2 equivalent linked to the distance kg CO2e 438,000 387,000 covered by company cars Waste Total quantity of WEEE removed by an external kg 1,299 0 provider % of areas covered by selective waste sorting % 90 90 5.3.7 Action plan and targets  Travel Employee travel (commuting and business travel) generate the most emissions at Devoteam, as evidenced by our carbon footprint analysis. An action plan has therefore been compiled to reduce the impact of travel: eco-driving training: Devoteam has committed to reducing its carbon emissions linked to its fleet of vehicles by 5-10% before the end of 2019. In 2018, these emissions equalled 1.69 tCO2e per driver; with regard to the company’s fleet, Devoteam is committed to ensuring that at least 10% of the fleet is hybrid or electric by the end of 2020; in addition, Devoteam will encourage employees to use remote video-conferencing to reduce the environmental impact of business travel; lastly, Devoteam is keen to promote forms of soft transport such as cycling. Devoteam is committed to drafting a company-wide agreement by the end of 2019 to pay a mileage allowance to employees who cycle on work-related journeys.  Energy Lastly, insulation work will be completed by the end of 2020 to reduce the environmental impact of our buildings.  Waste Since February 2017, Devoteam has rolled out recycling bins to 90% of its premises by area, in association with recycling firm Elise. In addition to recycling plastic bottles and cups, glass and metal cans, we want to recycle at least half of the paper used by Devoteam in France by mid-2019, with a target of 90% by the end of 2020. 5.4 Business ethics Actions linked to Devoteam’s business ethics strategy are implemented at Group level and apply to all entities, including those abroad. 5.4.1 Ethics and compliance 5.4.1.1 Ethics The Devoteam Charter outlined above is the benchmark for all employees joining the company. The charter represents Devoteam’s corporate culture and expresses the company’s ethics and values. Devoteam is listed on the Paris stock exchange and operates in more than 18 countries: we follow and apply all laws and regulations in force locally in each of our French and foreign entities. The purpose of the Devoteam Group’s business ethics policy is to actively tackle: corruption; Annual Financial Report 2018 140 anti-competitive practices; non-compliance; conflicts of interest; fraud; money laundering; data security; responsible communication. To comply with these new regulations, Devoteam has developed charters for its employees as a way of formally endorsing these principles. Below are the main charters reflecting our commitments:  IT Charter This charter sets out the conditions for the use of and access to the Devoteam information systems. The purpose of this charter is to ensure the optimal and secure use of information system resources, within overall constraints imposed by the sharing of our infrastructures and the sensitive nature of our work. It also serves as a reminder to users of the rules for the use of IT resources as part of their professional work at Devoteam, by specifying their rights and obligations. This charter is attached to and forms an integral part of the Devoteam rules of procedure.  Devoteam Code of Conduct This charter sets out the rules on ethical conduct for employees. This charter has been signed by all Group managers: eight ethical principles of the Devoteam Group: strict respect for the law, regulations and tax obligations; respect for human rights and environment; no bribery and corruption; non-interference in political affairs; no action against Devoteam interests; no unfair competition, be active in preventing fraud; approved and declared related party transactions; anti-money laundering policies. three associated ethical rules: business performed with our shared ethical principles; code of Conduct communicated and approved; sanctions to be applied for non-respect.  Ethics Charter The Devoteam Group Supervisory Board decided at the meeting held on 28 February 2011 to adopt a charter and rules of procedure setting out the duties and obligations of its members and the general guidelines for its operation in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions. The purpose of the charter is to set out the duties and obligations of the members of the Supervisory Board and any other persons attending the meetings thereof. It comprises 11 articles: Article 1. Administration and corporate interest Article 2. Compliance with laws and the Articles of Association Article 3. Independence Article 4. Freedom of expression Article 5. Conflicts of interest Article 6. Loyalty and good faith Article 7. Confidentiality Article 8. Insider trading Article 9. Attendance Article 10. Transparency and due diligence Article 11. Civil responsibility of Members of the Board 5.4.1.2 Devoteam Compliance Program The Devoteam Group has established a strict ethical compliance program as a follow-up to the Group’s ethical rules. The Internal Audit department, which reports to Devoteam’s Supervisory Board, is responsible for compliance. Annual Financial Report 2018 141 It is responsible for the compliance process and the continuous improvement thereof.  Devoteam Code of Conduct (ethical rules and principles): This ethics charter has been signed by all Group managers. The signed documents are kept centrally by the audit and internal control team.  Internal Representation Letter This is a formal commitment by managers of Group entities to ensure that the financial statements and various activities comply with laws and regulations as well as with the business and ethical directives of the Group. In 2018, the Group continued to implement the Sapin II law. Devoteam’s compliance and business ethics activities are being improved by the addition of various complementary aspects, and this legislation allows us to strengthen our systems and further secure our operations.  Data protection In 2018, Devoteam enhanced its ethical commitment and focused its attention on data protection, adopting a data protection policy which it published on 25 May 2018. This document sets out the Devoteam Group's GDPR governance in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2016/279. A data protection officer (DPO) was appointed and is systematically involved in the early stages of all Group projects to identify and manage any GDPR issues. The DPO is also the main point of contact for third parties in the context of client audits and with the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) to answer any queries and cooperate in the event of an audit. Furthermore, every entity has appointed their own GDPR contact who is responsible for compliance and guaranteeing that the entity's obligations under the Regulation are implemented throughout the Group (i.e. keeping a register of processes and responses to requests to exercise personal rights). Moreover, the Devoteam Group has enhanced its ability to alert, manage and remedy any personal data breaches through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures taking into account existing knowledge, the nature, scope, context and consequences of the incident, as well as any risk to the rights and freedom of individuals, so as to guarantee an acceptable level of security. In this respect, a process of cooperation between the DSI and legal teams and the DPO means that the Group is able to notify any violation no later than 72 hours of it becoming aware of such an incident. Lastly, because data security is a major concern for the Group, Devoteam has an IT systems security team represented by the IT Systems Security Officer who is tasked with ensuring security standards, dealing with and coordinating the various security audits of Devoteam's clients and partners, and defining and maintaining the Devoteam Group Security Policy and implementing it through operational procedures and documentation. An overview of GDPR compliance at Devoteam: accounting documents and procedures certified with CNIL's GOVERNANCE LABEL; a register of processes as Controller; register of processes as Subcontractor; a process to manage the rights of individuals; a process to manage data-related incidents and breaches; employee GDPR awareness-raising; contractual management of data transfers within the Group or with commercial partners; establishment of a compliance governance structure with the various Group entities; compliance of internal projects and developments from conception ( privacy by design project management). Annual Financial Report 2018 142  Preventing conflicts of interest All Group CEOs, COOs, CFOs and its entire management team sign an annual declaration of relatedparty transactions (any transaction between Devoteam and a third party related to a Devoteam employee). Action plan and targets  Anti-corruption training plan In a bid to comply with the Sapin II law, we are committed to training our managers in corruption risks by the end of 2019. The goal is to train staff in roles where the risk of corruption is greatest. By developing this training programme, we hope to beef up our governance with a “tone at the top” approach. The training programme will also strengthen our ethical and anti-corruption standards.  Drafting a new IT charter In 2019, the Devoteam Group plans to introduce a new IT charter which will include new regulations and associated targets.  Anti-Corruption Charter An Anti-Corruption Charter was drafted and approved by the Devoteam Group management team. It will be distributed to all staff in France and at foreign subsidiaries, during 2019. In France, in accordance with the provisions of the Sapin II law, the Charter will be appended to the rules of procedure and approved by the staff representative bodies. It is due to come into force in April 2019. 5.5 Responsible purchasing The vast majority of our purchases are made in France, so the actions and policies decided on apply to France. 5.5.1 Supplier relations Devoteam has identified two purchasing categories: productive purchases: purchases of services that enable Devoteam to progress client projects; non-productive purchases: purchases enabling the company to function internally (e.g. electricity, promotional merchandise, events). In line with this responsible approach and as part of the Scale! 2020 project (target revenue of €1 billion in 2020), we have opted for the early application of the regulations pertaining to our supplier relations (with immediate effect). 5.5.2 Management of social and environmental risks  Drafting of a Responsible Purchasing Charter Devoteam has a Responsible Purchasing Charter for its suppliers and subcontractors. This charter sets out Devoteam's values and CSR commitments, as well as what is expected of suppliers, i.e. compliance with: the founding principles of CSR (OECD, ILO, etc.); the legal, social and environmental standards of the country in which the business operates. This Charter is a means to control and audit its supply chain.

The assessment will begin in the first half of 2019; supplier audit: after the risk mapping, Devoteam will audit companies on site to check the accuracy of the data submitted via the questionnaire. This audit plan will commence in 2019; supplier action plan: keen to improve the quality of its supplier relations, Devoteam will work closely with them to develop an action plan to mitigate the risks associated with its supply chain. Devoteam will ensure that these action plans are in place by the end of 2019; responsible purchasing catalogue: Devoteam will compile a catalogue of socially and environmentally responsible purchases by the end of 2019. It is committed to developing this in subsequent years. 5.6 Societal The scope for the “Societal” component is France. 5.6.1 Devoteam Foundation The Devoteam Foundation was created in 2007. Its purpose is to offer its support to all humanitarian, charitable and community projects in the fields of IT, solidarity and health. As such, it promotes non-profit projects in the public interest carried out by company employees in association with non-profit organisations or NGOs. For 2018, the foundation had a budget of €76,000 which enabled it to support 35 charitable projects in which Devoteam employees were involved. During 2018, we explored the role that the foundation could have in promoting the Devoteam values. As part of the #TechforPeople initiative, we have developed a new strategy to be implemented in 2019. It involves offering all Devoteam staff different levels of solidarity commitment through not-for-profit projects; providing help and support to assist them in their digital transformation. This initiative will go live during the first quarter of 2019.  Cravate Solidaire In December 2018, for the second consecutive year, Devoteam launched a campaign with Cravate Solidaire. This association collects professional attire for men and women and distributes it to those without the means to purchase such clothing, thus supporting and enabling their access to employment. Annual Financial Report 2018 144 Expert volunteers (image coaches and recruiters) work with the recipients on preparing for job interviews. The communication and CSR teams placed boxes at the head office in Levallois-Perret to collect as much clothing as possible. At the end of the campaign, 63 kg of clothing had been collected, enabling around 31 people to receive donations. 5.6.2 Corporate philanthropy 5.6.2.1 Sponsoring the digital transformation In 2016, Devoteam Consulting set up a skills-based sponsorship programme entitled Give & Share . Under this programme, the company's consultants volunteer their time, in between contracts, to support and assist players in the social and solidarity economy with digital transformation matters. Through a new partnership with KOEO, a skills-based sponsorship platform, Devoteam Consulting has boosted its CSR policy and its ability to respond to challenges such as the management of its social impact through its contribution to community projects, employee commitment and well-being, and the creation of new synergies with community players. Four missions were carried out in 2018 with the SOS Group (merging the IT systems of two associations), Espérance Banlieues (digital audit), ADIE (training plan development) and KODIKO (updating the business plan) for a total of 450 person-days since the initiative launched, thanks to the help of 24 volunteer employees. 5.6.3 School relations  An innovative project that helps to improve the lives of disabled people Devoteam, support for innovative student projects: Devogame Devoteam organised a competition in which over 500 teams from all across Europe (France, Germany, Serbia, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) took part. In teams of between two and five students, participants laid the foundations for a project addressing a disability-related issue: How can Big Data, AI or the IoT contribute to improving the lives of disabled people? . The finalists presented their projects in TEDx format on 14 December in front of a jury comprising Stanislas de Bentzmann, Chairman and co-founder of Devoteam, Anthony Priestman, EMEA Partner Business Development Manager Cloud at Red Hat, Osama Ghoul, Executive Vice President of the Devoteam Group and Managing Partner of Devoteam Middle East, and Leslie Marel, Chair of Biomarel which develops medical devices to help disabled people communicate and regain independence. The CrocoSmart project proposed the creation of a smart watch which uses artificial intelligence to help deaf and hearing-impaired people in their daily tasks and to overcome everyday obstacles. In addition, Devoteam has partnered various student initiatives such as: 24 Hours of innovation on disability at EPF: In this event, fourth-year students at the EPF Engineering School take part in a 24-hour Innovation Challenge on the theme of disability. In teams, they worked on five themes non-stop for 24 hours to come up with innovative and creative solutions to the challenges that were put to them by people with disabilities; Solidarity trip with Planète Urgence and EFREI: Devoteam funded the solidarity trip of Eric Behart, a student at EFREI, who went to Benin for two weeks to give introductory computer courses in the north of the country, to help combat the digital divide. This trip was organised by Planète Urgence; Campus Connexion: Devoteam supports eight students identified as Campus Connexions who have taken on the role of Group ambassadors at their school. They are also supported by a HR coach and a member of the Management Committee who help them develop their skills and employability. In addition, they are given the chance to experience life at Devoteam through meetings and participating in discussions. This way, a relationship is created between Devoteam employees and young graduates. Annual Financial Report 2018 145  Télécom SudParis GATE projects As part of their first year of study, in groups of five to 10 people, students can complete a GATE project (Working as a Team Learning and Management). There are five categories: Campus, Citizenship, Humanitarian, School Promotion, Science and Technology. In 2018, Devoteam supported six projects: Medical'INT (Humanitarian): Devoteam tutored the team to help collect medical and physiotherapy equipment for a hospital in Romania; Prométh'INT (Citizenship): Devoteam welcomed high school students from Drancy and held workshops to introduce them to the world of employment; Comput'INT (Humanitarian): Devoteam donated 100 computers to be redistributed to Tunisian schools; ECOLomb'INT (Humanitarian): won the Devoteam Consulting IT for All competition. This project seeks to build relationships between farmers and tourists to promote ecotourism; Recrut'INT (School promotion): interview with the head of recruitment at Devoteam to learn more about what recruiters are looking for and how to better prepare students for job interviews. Devoteam also supports schools through academic chairs. Over the course of the year, the Group organised 250 events to support educational institutions and to advise students on their options for the future, offering for instance mock interviews, CV workshops, feedback, ongoing relationships and testimonials from graduates. 5.6.4 From CSR to shared value creation Mindful of CSR issues and sustainable development in general, Devoteam wants to be proactive in tackling social issues. Through its business model, Devoteam seeks to address global issues and create value. 5.6.4.1 Fighting corruption and managing environmental and social risks in the supply chain To this end, Devoteam offers innovative business models via RVR Parad, a Group subsidiary. RVR Parad, a Devoteam Group software publisher, offers integrated solutions for risk management, control & compliance, auditing and business continuity. In 2017, RVR Parad decided to launch a study to adapt its software to the different regulations in force, including the Sapin II Law and duty of care, by asking experts to help establish the necessary guidelines. To recap: Sapin II law: The law on transparency, anti-corruption and economic modernisation (“Sapin II”) is intended to bring French legislation into line with the best European and international anti-corruption standards, thus contributing France’s positive image on the world stage. The bill was adopted by Parliament on 8 November 2016 and ratified by the Constitutional Council on 8 December 2016. Duty of vigilance: The duty of vigilance is an obligation imposed on companies to prevent the social, environmental and governance risks associated with their operations. However, it may also extend to the activities of their subsidiaries and business partners (subcontractors and suppliers). Following the adoption of these regulations, the Devoteam Group decided to adapt its risk management tool for the purposes of CSR. The CRM tool developed by RVR Parad addresses the key stages of these laws, namely: optimisation of governance; self-assessment; risk mapping and management; internal control; audit planning and follow-up; reporting and whistle-blowing; implementation of action plans to mitigate risks. Annual Financial Report 2018 146 The aim is to be able to respond directly to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 16, Target 16.5: Substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms ) and one of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact: “Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery”. 5.6.4.2 Data protection In late 2017, Devoteam SA’s Risk and Security business unit implemented a solution designed to address data protection issues, and more specifically the GDPR. To recap: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new European regulation that will enter into force on 25 May 2018. The new law has various objectives: to give individuals more rights; To make the actors that handle data more accountable; to lend credibility to the regulation. The Data Privacy solution is part of Devoteam’s wider portfolio of cybersecurity products (both in France and the rest of Europe). Specifically, it forms part of the Data Protection value proposition, providing comprehensive support on legal and regulatory matters, economic intelligence and the protection of our clients’ strategic information. By making their cybersecurity strategy an integral part of their digital transformation plan, our clients can meet compliance requirements and achieve their cost reduction targets. In 2018, the Data Privacy service represented 9% of total Devoteam Group revenue. Devoteam has vast experience in protecting personal data and offers the following services: services tailored to the GDPR compliance needs of organisations, such as a full upgrade based on a maturity study and the implementation of a comprehensive action plan or targeted support for the DPO to reach the standard required under the GDPR; one-off specialised services, such as data protection impact assessments (DPIA) specific services, such as the external DPO function. Devoteam’s Data Privacy team, led by the Group’s Data Protection Officer (DPO), offers clients the benefit of its expertise gained from various projects. Its consultants have undertaken specific data protection training, including for instance a Masters in the management and protection of personal data from the Institut Supérieur d’Electronique in Paris; a Masters in digital law from the Université Paris 1 Panthéon – Sorbonne; and data protection occupations certification from CNAM. They have all of the skills and knowledge required to meet the data protection needs of Devoteam's clients. According to the World Economic Forum, two of the five biggest risks in 2018 in terms of likelihood are the risks of cyber fraud and cyberattacks. Two of the ten biggest risks in terms of impact are cyberattacks and the failure of infrastructure containing critical data. Devoteam therefore offers a solution to businesses looking to mitigate this risk. Annual Financial Report 2018 147 5.6.5 KPIs of the regional, economic and social impact of the company’s business The Group has decentralised regional agencies in France and in other key countries in which it operates, so as to stay close to its clients. It therefore tries to recruit local staff and restrict the amount of travel required for its activities.

Annual Financial Report 2018 155 6.1 Organisation and duties of the management and supervisory bodies In 2003, AFEP and MEDEF published recommendations on the principles of corporate governance, which were later updated in 2007 and 2008. These recommendations were combined by AFEP and MEDEF in December 2008 to create the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, to which the Devoteam Group refers. The AFEP-MEDEF Code was revised in full in November 2016, and more recently in June 2018. The recommendations are taken into account in the organisation of the Devoteam Group's governance. Any points of non-compliance are presented and any deviations from the Code are explained in accordance with the comply or explain principle. 6.1.1 The Supervisory Board 6.1.1.1 Composition Members of the Supervisory Board are elected by the General meeting for four-year terms.

This new Charter outlines the various objectives of the Board’s diversity policy on the appointment and re-election of directors. It defines and explains the various criteria that can apply. The Board has confirmed the qualification and experience criteria. However, the use of criteria such as age or gender is also explained. Scope of the Diversity Charter of the Supervisory Board This charter concerns the operation of the Board.

Implementation of the Diversity Charter of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board of Devoteam SA did not re-elect or appoint any new members in 2018. However, the Board complies with the various statutory diversity requirements, including the percentage of women on the Board. The principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Code are also upheld.

The attendance rate of directors was 89% for the year (one absence for Ms Kniazeff, one absence for Mr Montagne, one absence for Ms de Maulde during 2018 as a whole). Over the course of these four meetings, the main work carried out by the Board was as follows: the Chairman's report on the Audit and Compensation Committees, and on the internal control procedures; reading and assessment of the Management board's report on the running of the company and the separate and consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2017; the 2018 budget; presentation of 1st quarter 2018 results; renewal of authorisations related to securities, guarantees and warranties; information on the consultations with the Devoteam SA Works Council; reading and assessment of the Management board's report on the financial statements for the 1st half of 2018 and the Audit Committee's report on the half-yearly financial statements; reading and assessment of the Management board's report on the financial statements for the 3rd quarter of 2018; Miscellaneous matters, including discussions about the purchase of companies as part of the Group's external growth strategy, the confirmation of annual targets to be disclosed to the market, and the schedule of meetings for 2018. 6.1.1.5 Self-assessment of the Supervisory Board The AFEP-MEDEF Code provides for an annual self-assessment of the Board. A self-assessment form is made available to the directors. These assessments are an annual opportunity to evaluate the work carried out by the Board and the organisation thereof. The questions are based around four main themes: organisation of meetings; independence of directors; Annual Financial Report 2018 158 information presented to members of the Board; transparency and comprehensiveness of discussions. At the end of 2018, the self-assessment report was sent to members of the Supervisory Board so that they could consider any improvements to be made to the functioning of the non-executive body. 6.1.1.6 The duties of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board The duties of the Supervisory Board are set out in Article 15.4 of the Articles of Association (version of 27 February 2017). The role of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is to conduct the Board meetings. He is in charge of convening and planning the Board meetings. He keeps in regular contact with the Management board so as to stay immediately abreast of any recurring or, in particular, exceptional events that may call for an Extraordinary Meeting of the Supervisory Board. 6.1.1.7 Committees of the Board: Audit Committee Since its creation, the Supervisory Board has followed the principles of good governance, with an Audit Committee in place since 12 September 2001. The members of this Committee are appointed by the Supervisory Board. In accordance with European Directive 2006/43/EC and specifically the transposition thereof into French law with Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code, the Supervisory Board has tasked the Audit Committee with oversight of all issues related to the preparation and auditing of accounting and financial information. The Audit Committee regularly reports to the Supervisory Board on the performance of its duties and promptly informs it of any difficulties encountered. This Committee had two members in 2018: Michel Bon, Chairman of the Supervisory Board (100% attendance for the year); Carole Desport (100% attendance for the year). Georges Vialle is no longer a member of the Audit Committee, given that he resigned from his position as director at the start of the 2018 financial year. He still sits on this committee as an observer. All members of the Audit Committee have specialist financial or accounting expertise. Over the course of 2018, Michel Bon loss his independent status as a member of the Supervisory Board. In accordance with AMF regulations, the Chairman of the Accounts Committee cannot be a nonindependent member. The situation was brought to the attention of the committee, and a resolution will be made during the first quarter 2019 to comply with the AMF. This Committee met twice in 2018. The attendance rate was 100%. At its meetings, the Audit Committee primarily heard the Group's Finance Department, the Group's Statutory Auditors and the Internal Audit Department in relation to the following:  Annual and half-yearly financial statements review of the financial statements for the 2017 financial year and the 1st half of 2018; review of the Statutory Auditors' reports and any recommendations carried out; assessment of the main assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements and in particular the calculation of goodwill impairment tests ; full audit of the recognition of tax loss carry-forwards; review of capital gains and losses resulting from various disposals during the year.  Internal audit review of the Chairman's report on internal control procedures; work carried out in 2018-2018 and the 2019 audit plan; internal control review and in particular a review of the IT audit and recommendations for the 2019 financial year; review of customer risk and historical debts.  Oversight of the Statutory Auditors review of the coverage by Group subsidiary of the statutory audit of the annual financial statements; audit of the recognition of Devoteam revenue in accordance with IFRS 15; prior analysis of the process to be implemented by Devoteam upon application of IFRS 16. Annual Financial Report 2018 159 6.1.1.8 Committees of the Board: Compensation Committee  Operating method of the Committee In 2018, this Committee had two members: Vincent Montagne, Chairman of the Committee (100% attendance for the year); Michel Bon, Chairman of the Supervisory Board (100% attendance for the year). The Committee is comprised of one independent director and one non-independent director, and is therefore compliant with the AFEP-MEDEF Code which recommends that the committee is made up of a majority of independent directors. It prepares the Supervisory Board’s review of the compensation of corporate officers. It also serves as a Nominations Committee when a new director is required. The compensation policy proposed by the Committee is based on five principles recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code: comprehensiveness: the determination of compensation must be comprehensive. All components of the compensation must be taken into account in the overall assessment of compensation; balance between the components of compensation: each component of compensation must be justified and must be in the corporate interest; the compensation must be comparable with that offered by other similar-sized companies in the same industry; consistency: the compensation of the executive corporate officers must be consistent with that of other company executives and employees; clear rules: the rules must be simple, sustainable and transparent. The performance criteria used must correspond to the company's objectives, must be of a high standard, explicit and wherever possible, sustainable. This Committee met twice in 2018. The attendance rate was 100%. At its two meetings, the Compensation Committee primarily examined and proposed: determination of the variable compensation payable to the members of the Management board in respect of the 2018 financial year; determination of the allocation criteria for the variable compensation payable to the members of the Management board in respect of the 2018 financial year; proposal for the fixed compensation of the members of the Management board for 2019; proposal for variable compensation in 2019; compensation of directors.  Compensation of directors The members of the Devoteam Supervisory Board receive directors' fees in accordance with their responsibility within the Board and on its various committees.  Compensation of corporate officers Corporate officers receive compensation of which the details are presented below. In addition, on 11 March 2008, based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the same date, the Supervisory Board reviewed the position of each of the members of the Management board in relation to the provisions of the law of 21 August 2007 in favour of labour, employment and purchasing power (known as the “TEPA” law). The Supervisory Board noted that, insofar as no member of the Management board is entitled to the payment of any compensation of any kind whatsoever in relation to the termination of his or her duties as a corporate officer of the Devoteam Group, the provisions of this law are not applicable to it. The Supervisory Board has applied the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations since 2008. Furthermore, the Board refers to the provisions presented in the updated AFEP-MEDEF Code of November 2015, which further sets out the procedures for the compensation of corporate officers. The Supervisory Board considers that these recommendations form part of the company's corporate governance policy. Consequently, in application of the law of 3 July 2008 transposing European Directive 2006/46/EC of 14 June 2006, the AFEP-MEDEF Code as amended is that to which the company refers for the preparation of the report provided for in Articles L. 225-37 and L. 225-68 of the French Commercial Code with effect from the 2008 financial year. A shareholders' consultation was held at the Combined General meeting of 18 May 2018 on the individual compensation of executive corporate officers. The Devoteam Group applied the “Say on Pay” principle Annual Financial Report 2018 160 presented in the updated AFEP-MEDEF recommendations published in June 2013 and in the Sapin II law, which entered into force on 1 June 2016 and which ratifies the principle. 6.1.1.9 Committees of the Board: Strategy Committee The Group's Strategy Committee reports to the Supervisory Board. This committee was composed of five members in 2018, following the resignation of one member during the year: Carole Desport; Elisabeth de Maulde; Michel Bon; Valérie Kniazeff; Yves de Talhouët. It was chaired by Yves de Talhouët. Meetings are held in the presence of corporate officers. They are an opportunity to discuss the shortand medium-term strategies and strategic direction of the Group for the coming years. This committee met once on 29 June 2018. All members were present at this meeting. At this committee meeting, the Management board presented the major changes expected over the next five years in terms of market developments and competition, as well as the way in which the portfolio of SMACS-related offers could evolve, particularly in favour of Artificial Intelligence data. The committee discussed the impact that these changes could have on Devoteam's strategy.

It has not changed since the 2011 financial year. It was approved by the General meeting of 18 May 2018 under the 8th and 9th resolutions. In 2018, the members of the Management board received performance-related variable compensation based on an annual target of €275,000. The maximum payment is capped at 135% of the target variable compensation in the event of overperformance. There is no minimum payment. To recap, the type and weighting of each indicator comprising the 2018 variable compensation of the members of the Management board are as follows:  70% on achieving quantitative targets based on two criteria: two-thirds subject to the achievement of a specific operating margin, one-third subject to the achievement of Group organic growth;  30% on achieving qualitative targets based on three criteria: Innovation and the launch of new products and services; The completion of at least one key acquisition in a strategic country; Accelerated development of speed boats in France and abroad. A speed boat is a new entity that offers a promising or potentially promising product or service, outside of the Group's current range of activities in a given country, which receives accelerated development assistance from one or more dedicated managers with a view to reaching a critical size within three to five years. The achievement of the criteria and the resulting annual variable compensation were approved by the Supervisory Board at its meeting on 11 March 2019. It amounted to €370,000 or 135% of the fixed compensation. Annual Financial Report 2018 164 Weighting Payment Quantitative targets 70% 150% Qualitative targets 30% 100% Payment as a % of target variable compensation 100% 135% With regard to the 2018 financial year, the achievement rate of the quantitative portion was 150% and of the qualitative portion was 100%, representing total variable compensation of €370,000. The target variable compensation of Mr de Laage was €35,000, based on the following criteria: 30% subject to the achievement of a specific group clean EBIT; 70% subject to the achievement of qualitative targets. With regard to the 2017 financial year, the achievement rate of the quantitative portion was 115% and of the qualitative portion was 120%, representing total variable compensation of €40,250. The level of achievement of each of the objectives is precisely defined, however, due to its confidential nature the Group does not share this information. 6.2.1.2 Calculation by the Supervisory Board of the compensation of members of the Management board Compensation of members of the Management board for 2019 The Supervisory Board met on 11 March 2019 and, on a proposal from the Compensation Committee, decided that each member of the Management board would be entitled to: annual fixed compensation (including overseas allowance) of €275,000 gross, unchanged from the previous year; variable compensation equivalent to 100% of the fixed compensation, based on the achievement of targets and which may be increased to a maximum of 135% if the targets are exceeded. The variable compensation is based on specific objectives whose definition and weighting is determined each year by the Supervisory Board on a proposal from the Compensation Committee. With regard to the variable compensation for 2019, 70% is based on the achievement of quantitative objectives and 30% on the achievement of qualitative objectives. The quantitative objectives are two-thirds based on the achievement of a target operating margin and one-third on organic revenue growth. The qualitative targets are based on three criteria, each representing one-third, and are focused on the implementation and expansion of the Eagle programme in new acquisitions, the sharing of knowledge and experience throughout the Group, and the development of a scheme to encourage the participation of the Group's senior contributors in the future of the company. Due to the confidential nature of this information, the Group does not share the achievement rates of quantitative targets.
