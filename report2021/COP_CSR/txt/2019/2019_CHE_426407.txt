We are moving from a trading and logistical Webcor to an industrial and brand-building Webcor. Yet, despite the transformation, we remain true to our core values and purpose. Our values are the timeless principles that guide our decisions and actions, while our purpose is to provide superior products and enhance our consumers, people and communities’ quality of life. This also applies to our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility, for which we have set ambitious new targets to be achieved by 2025. These targets ensure a better and more assertive integration of sustainability into our business activities to help solve today’s major challenges, primarily in the fields of nutrition, education and water scarcity. In this report, we provide details on how we go about creating positive impact and working to minimize our negative impact on our community. We continue to focus on our three pillars: Our People, Our Community and Our Environment. We also remain committed to advancing the sustainable development global goals. In 2018, we advanced in multiple areas, with a specific focus on Goal 2 (Zero Hunger), Goal 3 (Wellbeing), Goal 4 (Quality Education), and Goal 6 (Access to Water & Purification). And in achieving our sustainable goals, we strive to create value to our business and our communities. As we come to celebrate our 40th anniversary, we look back with pride to all the things we have accomplished together and look forward to a brighter future, where we continue to empower countless people, businesses and communities.

After the drought that struck the Namibe Province in 2014/2015, water scarcity became a severe problem for many people in the area, locking its inhabitants in the cycle of poverty. The nearest river is distant, and as a result women and girls had to trek hours to fetch a bucket of water for their families. Very often, time spent between the river and the village deprives the girls from going to school. On November 19th, 2018, we launched a project to provide access to water for about 4,000 people in the rural village of Lucira. Through a partnership with the local government and over a period of 18 months, we built water pipes that spread over a distance of 80 kilometers, providing the 4,000 villagers with direct access to water. Access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation is essential for human health, environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. Water is Life. 40 2018 WEBCOR CSR REPORT WATER PROJECT LUCIRA WE PROVIDED ACCESS TO WATER FOR MORE THAN 4000 PEOPLE IN ANGOLA Our work on “Lucira Water Project” aims to contribute to SDG 6 Clean Water & Sanitation 2018 WEBCOR CSR REPORT 41 INVESTING IN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES WE FURTHER COMMIT TO MANAGING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH DEVELOPING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES AND PURCHASING ENERGY EFFICIENT APPLIANCES. 2018 BENEFITS • Moving systems to Cloud reduces hardware and energy IT SOLUTIONS usage • Online modern office reduces paper and ink usage • Conferencing hardware reduces travel • New Support Center System reduces paper and travel IMPLEMENTED IT SOLUTIONS IN 2018 • Research & Testing Cloud Services for select applications and users TARGET 2019 • Research & Testing Online Modern Workplace, to increase • Move to the next phase of the “Business process autocollaboration mation” / ERP program, which leads us to be less paper• Enhanced Conferencing Speakers, to increase conformity and based, resulting in less hours to complete business clarity processes and consuming less energy. • Setup Skype for Business, to increase conformity and clarity • Consolidating systems, to reduce hardware and energy • New Support Center System usage. • Security Program • More Cloud usage, reducing paper, energy, and hardware consumption. 42 2018 WEBCOR CSR REPORT ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES TAKING ACTION TO MITIGATE THE RESULTS OF OUR ACTUAL NEGATIVE IMPACT.
