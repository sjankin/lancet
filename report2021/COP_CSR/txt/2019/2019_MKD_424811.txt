What makes our pleasure even greater is that this happened on the eve of the twentieth anniversary since TITAN entered our company. USJE has not only been a long-standing producer of proven and high-quality cement, but we have also striven to build and nurture partnerships, always providing values and talent development for the community and surroundings where we operate. Although the country’s political situation has stabilized, our total domestic cement consumption is estimated to have shrunk by about 5% compared to last year. This was mainly due to a decline in residential and commercial construction. USJE fared better than the market trend and ended the year with a moderate decrease of 3.7%. Even though USJE’s domestic cement revenues fell by 5%, its increased export revenues resulted in increasing its total revenues by 2.6%. Along with implementing initiatives to drive growth, to restore profitability and to take operating excellence to a higher level, we continue to focus on the long-term sustainability of our business. We recognize climate change as one of the highest global priorities and we have made a long-term action plan to reduce CO2 emissions additionally. Following the European trends, in 2017, USJE started producing a new type of cement, which resulted in reduced specific gross CO2 compared to 2016. 6 Annual Sustainability Report 2017 As regards health and safety, numerous technical improvements have enhanced overall safety in the plant. Furthermore, this year USJE marked the World Health & Safety Day and the European Health & Safety Week. Health and safety remain steadily among our top priorities. We have successfully launched targeted campaigns addressing two of our major causes of accidents, namely Lockout-tag out and Slips Trips & Falls. Following the TITAN Group, we remain focused on our people as the driving force of our Company. To our employees, the Titan Leadership Platform has been a base for revised performance and development process that aims to enhance meritocracy and facilitate constructive feedback for personal development. Our active engagement with all our stakeholders nurtures the sustainability of our business as we follow the principles of transparency, open dialogue and collaboration. In 2017, we continued to support the European Pact for Youth in an effort to increase youth employability. By aligning our company priorities to the UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, we seek to strengthen our collaboration with all stakeholders within the UN Global Compact, focusing on human rights, anti-bribery and anticorruption and the environment.

Quality education, safety and environment, employment Company performance Support of youth employability Building upon the outcomes of its participation to the European Pact for Youth, in 2017, TITAN Group introduced a Quality Internships Guide that provides practical guidance on the design and implementation of internships and apprentices programs, emphasizing Strategic review providing quality training, and addressing the need to cover skills gaps. In 2017 USJE continued with the internship program aimed at attracting ambitious young people, who wish to learn and acquire practical knowledge in real working environment. During the year 42 interns were part of the USJE internship program. In 2017, more than 140 students from the Faculty of Technology, University American College Skopje and the Secondary Chemistry School had the opportunity to visit our plant and to be introduced to our process of production, quality control aspects, community commitment and H&S efforts we put in our performance. Aiming to raise the level of education of the young people in the country, Cementarnica USJE strategically supports education, and for twelve consecutive years has awarded 3 scholarships for postgraduate studies.

Biodiversity and land management Our operations are heavily dependent on the use of natural resources. Comprehensive environmental impact assessments and rehabilitation plans cover all aspects of development, operation, as well as decommissioning of quarries. Both traditional and novel methods for reforestation are employed for quarry rehabilitation. All activities for quarry rehabilitation, and biodiversity management of sites are in line with the 4 Guidelines on Quarry Rehabilitation , and Biodiversity 5 Management Plan (BMP) Guidance . We employ our best efforts to abate all kinds of impacts on the environment. In line with these efforts is the development of Studies for Rehabilitation of Quarries owned by the Company, produced by the Faculty of Forestry Skopje, as well as a Plan for Green Belt along the Plant’s perimeter. To ensure quality implementation of these plans, we engaged a professional company and part of the plant area has been transformed into a nursery producing planting material necessary for realization of the targets set in the Studies. Within this project, a total of 18,179 plants were planted in 2017. On final benches of the marl quarry 7,120 trees were planted, 589 cypress trees were planted at the limestone quarry in Govrlevo, 9,550 trees planted Continuing with the CSR practices, our company in the Ljubos quarry, and 920 plants (trees, flowers donated to the neighbors and local communities more and bushes) were planted at the factory green areas. than 180 trees that were planted in public green areas. 4) Guidelines on Quarry Rehabilitation, 2011.
