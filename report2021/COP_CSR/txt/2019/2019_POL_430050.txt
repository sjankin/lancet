DECLARATIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD ....................................................................... 92 3 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 1. LETTER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE MANAGEMENT BOARD GRI 102-14 Dear Stakeholders, I am pleased to present to you another Annual Report of Grupa Kęty S.A. and the whole Capital Group. The financial and operational information included therein and the described events clearly indicate that 2018 was another year of rapid development of the Company and the Capital Group. The key business segments reported growth of sales in volumes and value, which contributed to an increase in consolidated sales revenues. These amounted to PLN 2.99 billion and were higher by 13.3% compared to the previous year. We have also generated a significant growth of consolidated net profit to PLN 268.5 million (+13.5%). Record sales in all of the three business segments, record investments and high dividend paid out to the shareholders confirm that Grupa Kęty entered another, higher level of operation and development. Moreover, the growth of the particular profit or loss items, both as regards revenues and profits, clearly reflect that Grupa Kęty has made a quantum leap on its way to effective accomplishment of the ‘Strategy 2020’ objectives, with the level of fulfilment of the particular targets set out in the Strategy reaching approximately 90%. What is more, based on the financial and operating results projection, the Company expects that at the end of 2019 the targets will be fulfilled in more than 95%. Availing of the favourable economic situation globally, the companies of the Capital Group have concentrated in 2018 on further organic development and improvement of their strong position on the domestic and international markets in all three segments: Extruded Products, Aluminium Systems and Flexible Packaging. The demand for the offered products which persisted throughout the year, on the part of both the existing and new customers, resulted in sales volume increase and inclusion of the growing costs in the prices of the offered products. That, in consequence, contributed to the maintenance of good operating margins. The improvement in figures was also supported by the investment projects carried in the previous periods, which again confirms the validity of the development strategy assumed by the Management Board for the whole Capital Group and its effective implementation. 2018 was also a hectic period in the performance of investment projects in all segments of operation, the value of which was the highest in the history of Grupa Kęty and amounted to PLN 230 million. The largest projects include those carried out by the Flexible Packaging Segment. That refers mainly to the project carried out at the Special Economic Zone in Oświęcim, worth PLN 110 million and consisting in the construction of a complete plant furnished with a propylene packaging production line, identical to the project carried out by the Segment in the previous years, which enabled production capacity increase with regard to manufacturing and refining plastic films. The project complies with the development strategy of that business segment, which assumes diversification of the sources of income in the coming years and extension of the value-added chain. The projects carried out by the Extruded Products Segment covered mainly the installation of two new presses, one of 28 MN for the production of aluminium profiles from soft alloys and another one of 36 MN for the production of aluminium profiles from hard alloys. The project will contribute to the increase in the Segment output of extruded products by roughly 8,000 tonnes in 2019. Worth 4 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 emphasising is also the launch of aluminium components production for automotive industry in a newly completed hall of the Advanced Aluminium Products Plant in Kęty. The investments completed in 2018 will result in a considerable extension of the production potential of that Segment, currently operating 13 extrusion presses in Kęty, Tychy, and in Borodianka near Kiev, Ukraine. The constantly growing market requirements for the Aluminium Systems Segment, mainly in the area of quality of the production and logistic services offered to customers, somehow force the Capital Group to incur capital expenditure related to innovative solutions in that Segment. That resulted in the commencement of warehouse and production space extension in 2018 for the second state-of-the-art vertical paint shop line to be commissioned in 2019. The growing activeness of the Group Segment on Western European and US markets, which are characterised with higher requirements in quality standards, has also affected the decision on commencing the construction of a modern Research and Innovation Centre, planned to be open in the second half of 2019. After commissioning, the Centre will provide specialised research, tests and certification services related to the offered products in compliance with the rigorous requirements of those markets. Worth mentioning is the fact that it is going to be the first accredited laboratory of an aluminium systems manufacturer in Poland and the second such laboratory in Europe. Dear Stakeholders, I’m convinced that an effectively implemented investment plan during the term of validity of the current ‘Strategy 2020’, whose value is estimated at approximately PLN 1.35 billion, will make a strong foundation for further development of the Capital Group in Poland and become a supporting factor of its bold foreign expansion in the coming years. Owing to the coming end of validity of the ‘Strategy 2020’, the Management Board has decided that work on the strategy for the years 2020–2025 will be preceded by a strategic options review process, covering, among other things, the assessment and analysis of the activities, market conditions and competitive position in order to arrive at more effective utilisation of assets. At the same time I wish to ensure that we have always tried to carry out our investment projects with future generations in mind. We have focused on the company economic development, its people and local communities, caring for environmental aspects and ensuring environmental protection. We are proud to present in this Annual Report our non-financial information, which, for the fourth time already, enriches this document demonstrating the social and environmental dimension of our business. Each year, we have tried to develop our competences as well as to improve and expand the scope of information presented for all the Polish companies of our business segments. As a large company in the region, we assume full responsibility for our actions in the social and environmental area. Therefore, in this report, we focused on these aspects trying to present them in a reliable and transparent manner. Yours faithfully, Dariusz Mańko President of the Management Board 5 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 2.

Each segment has in its structures all the services necessary to carry out business in the area of both production and trade. Only a part of specialised functions have been concentrated in competence centres providing services to all of the Capital Group segments. These include in particular: bookkeeping, IT services, organisation of financing, supervision of the acquisition processes, supervision of the risk management policy, internal audit, coordination of processes related to corporate social responsibility and sustainable development.

Except for the above listed companies, Grupa Kęty S.A., through its subsidiary Aluprof System USA, Inc. holds 45.5% of shares in Aluprof USA, LLC, of the initial value of USD 100.1 thousand. Aluprof USA LLC is involved in the distribution of aluminium systems on the US market. This investment was financed from the Company own funds. Apart from the shares in the aforementioned associate, the Group has no other significant investments in securities, financial instruments, intangible assets and real property. 12 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 3.2 Business segments description GRI 102-2; GRI 102-4; GRI 102-6; GRI 102-7; GRI 102-9; GRI 204-1,103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Procurement Practices’ 3.2.1 Supply chain characteristics Primary aluminium, aluminium scrap as well as semi-finished products based on aluminium (sheet aluminium and aluminium tape as well as ingots made from aluminium and its alloys) are the basic raw materials used by the Group. In the production of flexible packaging, the Group also uses various types of films and plastics granulates (polyethylene, polypropylene), printing paper, paints, adhesives and binders. The list of basic raw materials is supplemented with accessories for the production of aluminium systems and semi-finished steel products. Due to the necessity of maintaining high quality of production, the purchasing policy of the Group is based on cooperation with selected suppliers who guarantee the proper standards. At the same time, diversification of suppliers has been assumed in order to secure supplies and maintain their competitiveness. Being aware of its impact on the environment, the Company has been trying, in the first place, to use the services of local or national suppliers. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the industry, it is possible only to a very limited extent (aluminium scrap, paints, lacquers, thinners, and some accessories for systems production). In 2018, approximately 30% of purchases of raw materials and other materials were made at Polish suppliers, 63% of deliveries originated from other European countries and roughly 7% from the suppliers on other continents. 3.2.2 Extruded Products Segment Grupa Kęty S.A. and the Extruded Products Segment built on its basis are considered to be one of Poland’s largest manufacturers of extruded products with about 30% market share. The estimated market share in the European market is ca. 2.5%, which places the Segment at the bottom of the top ten largest players list. The production potential of the companies of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Group includes 13 extrusion presses with the total production capacity of ca. 85 thousand tonnes, in three locations: Kęty, Tychy and Borodianka near Kiev, Ukraine, and two profile prefabrication plants in Kęty and Slovenska Bistrica. The majority of presses complete with run-outs are state-of-the-art machines of renowned European manufacturers. With such potential, Grupa Kęty may each year increase the sales of aluminium profiles and components to the fastest-growing industries such as automotive, rail and air transport. Market situation, sales, customers In 2018 the segment generated record sales – PLN 1,270 million – which represented 12% growth compared to the preceding year. The exports reached PLN 582 million which also resulted in 12% increase y/y. Similarly as in 2017, the economic situation in Europe was favourable to the manufacturers of aluminium products, and even the commotion of the second quarter (customs duties on aluminium and semi-products imposed by the USA and the threat of sanctions to be imposed by the US government on the main European supplier – Rusal) did not slow down the demand for the products. In such circumstances, all of the Segment companies utilised practically in 100% the possessed production capacity, and in some cases they were forced to limit the scope of cooperation with their customers owing to insufficient production capacity. The situation affected the activeness and results of the plant in Ukraine, which in 2018 recorded growth of the internal market and extended the processing services for Poland. For three years Alupol LCC has been providing production services to Grupa Kęty based on the so called ‘processing agreement’. Such relationship, 13 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 particularly in the situation of increased demand, is favourable to both companies. Within the agreement Grupa Kęty transferred to Ukraine some of the orders from the overloaded presses in Kęty. That resulted in practically complete utilisation of the production capacity of Alupol LLC’s press and exceeding the 2018 budget assumptions. Invariably, the major recipient of Alupol LLC aluminium profiles is the construction business, but the number of new customers from the local market has been growing in Borodianka along with the number of profiles manufactured for them. The Aluminium Kety EMMI company was incorporated in the Segment in 2016. Inclusion of a plant providing advanced profiles machining and surface treatment in the organisational structure of the EPS puts the Segment at a completely different position on the market. The business activity of EMMI complies with the EPS strategy of building a strong brand sought for by the manufacturers of speciality aluminium products. On the other hand, two years ago EMMI gained not only a new owner but mainly a partner ensuring the company development by way of financial and subject-matter support. The synergy has been beneficial to both companies. EMMI turnover under the control of Grupa Kęty has been gradually increasing, with 2016 sales amounting to EUR 25 million, nearly EUR 25 million in 2017 and EUR 30 million last year. EMMI customers include mainly white-goods (refrigerators, washing machines and similar products) manufacturers and furniture-making companies. However, last year the company attracted an established automotive recipient and entered with them in a contract for several-year deliveries of exposed car body parts. In 2018 EMMI commenced preparations to the implementation of IATF and AEOC standards planned to be finished in 2019. 3.2.3 Aluminium Systems Segment Aluprof S.A. is perceived as an epitome of a modern and fast-growing company. It is estimated that as many as 7 out of 10 modern buildings being built in Poland incorporate façade systems supplied by Aluprof. It means that there is no architect, developer or contractor today who would not know the Aluprof brand and its high quality. The reputation earned over the years make investors and architects reach for advanced aluminium systems by Aluprof in many projects. Comprehensive cooperation with all market participants results in mutual benefits, while investors obtain unique, functional and cutting-edge designs. The efforts of Aluprof, which apart from its four plants in Poland has ten divisions in Europe and the USA, focus on the export market. It is the area where communication with architects and decision-makers in the construction business as well as business partners has been intensified and extended. In that, Aluprof relies fully on in-house competencies: ‘The essence of our competencies is our extensive expertise in manufacturing aluminium systems, independent and flexible production and tailored solutions’. Market situation, sales, customers In 2018, the consolidated revenue of the Segment reached PLN 1,292 million, which means they were higher by 14% than the sales in the preceding year. Such a high increase was mainly contributed by the domestic market customers, who generated 19% growth of sales revenue. Export sales increased by ‘only’ 7%, whereas the growth on European markets was 17%, and the sales on the US market dropped by approximately 40%. Currently, export sales account for 37% of the ASS total revenue. The double-digit sales growth rate was possible due to consistent efforts on the particular markets, a growing number of customers satisfied with the collaboration, gradual expansion of the product range both as regards architectural systems and roller-shutter systems, as well as offering finished products tailored to meet individual customer requirements on the respective markets.

Company and the Capital Group in 2018 GRI 201-1; GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Economic Performance’ 5.3 Management Board comments on the financial statements The basic objective of the ‘Strategy 2020’ is to ensure steady increase in shareholder value. One of the main conditions for achieving that goal is sustainable development resulting in systematic growth of generated profits and cash. In the opinion of the Management Board, the activities and the results accomplished in 2018 fully comply with the objectives. The companies of the Capital group recorded a number of achievements in the market, production finance and non-finance (ESG) areas. Sales revenue grew to PLN 2.99 billion (+13.3%), out of which 46% sales were made to our customers on international markets. Thanks to high utilisation of production capacity (over 95%), approximately 12% growth in the profit on operating activities was achieved (PLN 337.7 million), despite the maintained growing labour costs trend. The pressure on the remuneration increase which is to continue in the coming years is perceived by the Management Board as one of the main challenges. Taking into account the result on financing activities, which is mostly affected by credit costs and valuation of receivables and liabilities in foreign currencies, the consolidated net profit attributable to owners of the parent amounted to PLN 268.2 million, representing 13% growth compared to the previous year value. As estimated by the Management Board, the financing structure of the Capital Group balance sheet is safe. Despite continued development and major investments (capital expenditure equalled PLN 231 million), combined with the payment of dividend, equity still represents roughly 50% of the balancesheet total. As the main companies of the Group are mostly production enterprises continuously investing in their development, property, plant and equipment represent a significant item of assets. As at the balance-sheet date they accounted for 48% of total assets (similarly as in the preceding year). The value of current assets as at the balance-sheet date amounted to PLN 1,205.1 million and accounted for approximately 42% of total assets (no change compared to previous year figures). Cash flows thanks to which the Group companies are able to continue their development represent one of the major parameters from the point of view of the Management Board. Within the 12 months of 2018, generated cash flows amounted to PLN 293.1 million, i.e. ca. 6% more than in the previous year. The value was generated despite the 13% growth of sales revenue, which confirms the efficient management of working capital. This also means that cash flows are safe and stable, enabling financing of development projects. As intended by the Management Board, further development is to be financed essentially from internal sources (cash from operating activities) and interest-bearing debt. Summing up, the Management Board positively assesses the generated financial results in all material respects. Considering the current potential of the Capital Group and the planned programme of investments in further development, as well as optimistic projections as to the economic growth in Poland and on a global scale, the Management Board upholds its expectations regarding the economic values provided for in the ‘Strategy 2020’ to be achieved. 30 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 5.4 Loans and contingent liabilities TERM STRUCTURE OF LOANS AND FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES 31.12.2018 31.12.2017 Maturity date (audited) (audited) Short-term 654,274 490,065 From 1 to 2 years 68,372 21,916 From 2 to 5 years 152,410 157,458 Total 875,056 669,439 LONG-TERM LOANS (PLN ‘000) Borrower Lender Loan currency Security 31.12.2018 Grupa Kęty S.A.

ANNUAL PROJECTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY STRATEGY OBJECTIVES The basic objective of the ‘Strategy 2020’ is to ensure steady increase in shareholder value, through: sustainable development resulting in systematic growth of generated profits and cash; consequent dividend policy; creation of potential for further development in the future periods; maintenance of high corporate governance standards. OPERATIONAL OBJECTIVES AND MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS On the basis of the adopted assumptions concerning the prices of raw materials and foreign exchange rates, the particular segments forecast the following sales revenue in 2020: Extruded Products Segment – PLN 1,458 million, Aluminium Systems Segment – PLN 1,420 million, Flexible Packaging Segment – PLN 750 million. Taking the above into consideration, the consolidated sales revenue of the Capital Group in 2020 should amount to PLN 3,357 million, operating profit to PLN 360 million, EBITDA to PLN 514 million and consolidated net profit to PLN 263 million PLN. The above forecasts have been prepared on the basis of the following macroeconomic assumptions: average aluminium price (3M) – 1,800 USD/tonne, average USD exchange rate − 4.05 PLN/USD, average EUR exchange rate − 4.30 PLN/EUR, 34 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 EUR/USD relation − 1.06, GDP growth in Poland – 3.4%. INVESTMENT PLAN The Management Board assumes that, in the period covered by this strategy (taking into account the expenses incurred to date from the beginning of the strategy implementation, i.e. from 2015), the capital expenditure will amount to ca. PLN 1,354 million, of which: Extruded Products Segment – PLN 585 million, Aluminium Systems Segment – PLN 356 million, Flexible Packaging Segment – PLN 367 million. The forecast does not comprise any possible additional expenditure on acquisitions, which means that the effects of acquisitions have not been included in the sales and results forecast. DIVIDEND POLICY The dividend policy adopted by the Supervisory Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. provides for the payment of dividend amounting to 60%–100% of consolidated net profit of Grupa Kęty S.A. during the implementation period of the ‘Strategy 2020’. The Management Board has assumed that the payment of dividend during the implementation period of the ‘Strategy 2020’ will amount to the average of 80% of Grupa Kęty S.A. consolidated net profit. When determining the recommended dividend, the Management Board will take into account, among other things: the Capital Group net debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio calculated as at the last balance-sheet date of the previous financial year with the maximum level of 2.0; time shifts applicable to the dividends receivable from the subsidiaries, which affect the maximum level of the recommended dividend; the value of potential and feasible acquisitions; the value of actual capital expenditure to be incurred in the year of dividend payment. POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS The projections for 2020 do not take into account any effects of potential acquisition projects. Nevertheless, the Management Board takes into account two directions of potential acquisitions within the existing segments and the establishment of a new segment: within the Extruded Products Segment – the projects may be related to the development of the existing competences or acquisition of new ones in the area of profiles processing and the production of components based on aluminium profiles. The potential projects may be related to entities with sales revenue of up to EUR 50 million; within the Aluminium Systems Segment – the projects may refer to geographic or product-related development on new markets. The potential projects may be related to entities with sales revenue of up to EUR 20 million; a new segment with the potential enabling the generation of sales revenue in 2020 at the minimum level of PLN 200 million. UNCERTAINTY RISK AND FREQUENCY OF THE STRATEGY ACCOMPLISHMENT EVALUATION The strategy objectives, including future revenue and profits projection, have been established on the basis of a number of assumptions, expectations and forecasts and are, therefore, subject to uncertainty risk and may change due to both external and internal factors. The Company will assess 35 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 the possibility of the ‘Strategy 2020’ implementation and make any possible adjustments on an annual basis.

INVESTMENT AND R&D PROJECTS 7.1 Investment projects For the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group, investment projects have been drivers of technical and technological development and thus have become an asset in the form of competitive advantage over other manufacturers operating on the aluminium processing market and the flexible packaging production market. Since 2000, the Company has spent ca. PLN 2.2 billion on investment projects in the Group. In line with its development strategy, in 2019–2020 the Company plans to spend ca. PLN 500 million on investment projects, which means that within 20-year span approximately PLN 2.7 billion will have been invested. Capital expenditure of the Grupa KĘTY S.A. Capital Group on the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets as well as shares and interests in the acquired companies in the period of 12 months of 2018 and of 2017 was as follows: (PLN million) 2018 2017 Total expenditure: 231.0 190.0 including Grupa Kęty S.A. 124.6 88.9 The largest investment projects in 2018 included: EXTRUDED PRODUCTS SEGMENT A front-loading, short-stroke 28 MN press to extrude soft alloys. Ingots (a semi-product used in the extrusion process) will be heated using an innovative and environmentally friendly Step5 gas-fuelled heater with very low gas consumption level. The run-out of the 28MN press will be ‘double-length’, which will ensure perfect cooling of profiles to ambient temperature (longer cooling line). It will ensure the same properties along the entire length of profiles, which is particularly important in the case of bent profiles. The run-out will feature an innovative solution with two saws to cut the ready profiles at lower speed, but without slowing down the extrusion process, thus, avoiding the bending of the tips of the profiles towards the saw disk. The production line is highly automated. A speciality 36 MN indirect press for hard alloys extrusion, i.e. mainly 7XXX and 2XXX series alloys. Thanks to the technical solutions applied in the press, it will extrude the longest ingots among all the presses at Grupa Kęty with the length of up to 1,800 mm. The press is to be used mainly to extrude high-quality rods with a significantly reduced coarse-crystalline edge and model structure. FLEXIBLE PACKAGING SEGMENT The main investment project of the Segment is the extension of the BOPP film production plant for another hall and the second production line. As a result, the production capacity will be doubled, which will contribute to output increase to roughly 60,000 tonnes a year. In 2018 the shell of the production hall was completed and fit-out work commenced, including the production line installation. 37 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 ALUMINIUM SYSTEMS SEGMENT Aluprof S.A. (the leading company of the Segment) has been perceived an epitome of a fast growing company in the domain of modern architectural solutions. Therefore, the Company has been mainly investing in the development of its products and streamlining of the customer service process. An example of such project may be the construction of the Research and Innovation Centre of the area of 10,000 m2, to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2019. The project value is about PLN 50 million, including PLN 10 million financed from a subsidy. The Centre will employ as many as 60 people, including the personnel of the research and development department. In the period of 12 months after the balance-sheet date, the Group intends to spend PLN 284 million on investment projects. 7.2 Research and development projects The Capital Group strategy in the area of its products and services consists in offering high quality products, which are often designed for individual orders and tailored to customers needs. Therefore, the priority is to invest in people and state-of-the-art technology, which is translated into attracting a growing customer base both in Poland and abroad. The R&D activities, innovation and the continuous improvement of the machinery are factors which drive the success of the organisation and the development of its core business segments, based on a dialogue with the existing and potential customers. Meeting the expectations of the market, the Aluminium Systems Segment has been systematically developing new products and modernising the existing solutions. In 2018 particular attention should be paid to the development and practical implementation of glazed aluminium curtain walls with complicated spatial structure, dedicated to a prestigious high-rise building in Warsaw. The satisfaction of very high tightness and thermal requirements was confirmed by tests carried out in accordance with European and US standards. Several new products were developed and sold on a regular basis, including indoor sliding windows, panel doors and a system of glass barriers to be mounted on the outside of windows, not only aluminium ones. In addition, the Company started to distribute an innovative fire-rated external windows system, which, in addition to the fire resistance, is also characterised by high thermal performance. The products meet the latest European requirements. In order to support the expansion of the Segment abroad, new versions of several window and door systems as well as façade systems were developed for the selected markets in Western Europe and the USA. Apart from the development of the Segment core products, new types of system accessories were introduced. They include new window and door hardware systems, with some speciality solutions. As regards fire protection, a new system of fire doors with thermal insulation intended mainly for outdoor use has been developed and tested. Combined with the previously introduced fire-resistant windows, they will become one fire-rated window and door system with high thermal resistance. A curtain wall system with window blocks fixed in glazing such as to create the effect of a ‘floating window’ was designed and implemented in a building in the Czech Republic. Moreover, a concept of ventilated façades was developed, enabling the application of various materials for external coating. An innovative system of mullion-and-transom curtain wall fixing, withstanding the load of glazing up to 1,000 kg, was developed, patented and tested. Curtain walls dedicated to selected buildings on the American market have been designed, tested in the USA, and put into production. Some of the existing products have been modernised, including the overlay façade for either steel or aluminium subframe, selected depending on the destination of the building and the external load. Among the 38 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 documents permitting products trading, the European ETA applicable to the sale of one of the fixed fire-rated partition wall in the EU was obtained, as well as a Polish document for roofing material, also with fire rating. Apart from the marketing of new systems and modernisation of the existing ones, tests for CE marking have been carried out as well as individual building tests. Grupa Kęty S.A., with its Extruded Products Segment, is a leading supplier for the industries where particular accuracy and innovativeness of products is required. Therefore, the Company is at the cutting edge of the industries searching for precision and product innovation, i.e. the automotive industry or transport, where in 2018 the Company recorded the most substantial sales increases. Attracting customers from such industries makes it possible for Grupa Kęty to constantly and efficiently expand export sales as well as to develop and improve its products. That is supported by the utmost utilisation of the Company technical facilities, like the in-house Research and Development Centre (RDC), which ensures further upgrading and diversification of the offered products for improvement of their competitiveness on the markets the Company currently delivers to or future ones. The scale of the RDC activities may be demonstrated by ca. 10-20 thousand tests carried out in 2018 for the purpose of current production and the pending R&D projects. The following works are worth particular attention: continuous extension of sections assortment intended for crumple zone control and bodywork structures in the automotive industry, fulfilling high requirements of the established manufacturers in that industry, which comprises both launching the manufacturing of new products fulfilling the requirements of the implemented material classes, as well as developing manufacturing technologies for products in higher material classes, or product certification at the subsequent OEM recipients; launch of sections production for the automotive industry, fulfilling higher-than-standard requirements with regard to the furnishing of the 35 MN press with latest generation system for the extruded products water cooling at the run-out; production processes optimisation, consisting in laboratory testing of new parameters (e.g. thermal treatment), which results in the improvement of production performance and reduces energy consumption by the process. The works are performed in cooperation with renowned scientific and research institutions, such as the Light Metals Institute in Skawina or the AGH University of Science and Technology in Kraków. Moreover, cooperation with regard to advisory services and exchange of experience has been started with Hydro Aluminium – one of the world leaders on the aluminium market. The engineering advancement and extension of the Flexible Packaging Segment portfolio with new and innovative products improves the Segment position among the major European manufacturers of packaging. That is possible owing to a long-term process of making organic investments and, consequently, increasing the production capacity, production costs optimisation and implementation of new technical solutions. Due to ongoing cooperation with customers, the segment is able to carry out projects that aim at developing optimal parameters of laminates guaranteeing food security. As a result of those efforts, many unique solutions were created characterised by competitive prices and high quality parameters. Alupol Packaging has been promoting ecological laminates, fit for recycling, with low basis weight incorporating high-barrier HBF9TM and BOPP films. The HBF9TM films are produced by way of blowmoulding of multilayer plastic films, thanks to which products of complicated structures and specific barrier properties may be obtained. Based on the possibility of using high-barrier plastic raw materials and combining them with polyolefins in the production process, films characterised with low permeability of gases, moisture and fragrances as well as very good sealing, mechanical and optical 39 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 properties are obtained. Laminates produced with the application of such films can be used in packaging refrigerated food and in the process of thinning laminates used to pack products with extended shelf life. Due to the specific properties of the films manufactured by the Company, the 3-, 4and 5-layer laminates available on the market, containing aluminium, plastic and paper, can be replaced with 2and 3-layer laminates with a lower basis weight. Thus, the technology is less materialconsuming than the one applied so far. In addition, lower basis weight of laminates results in a reduced quantity of packaging introduced on the market and significantly contributes to environmental protection. Further, Alupol Packaging has implemented engineering processes consisting in the refinement of laminates using various matt and structural lacquers that produce specific effects on the surface of packaging. Alupol Films, launched in 2016, has been manufacturing a wide range of BOPP polypropylene films. Within two years, the company developed and implemented technologies for the production of a variety of BOPP films, including transparent, white, matte and metallised ones with various properties. To meet the market demand, films with various friction factors, low seal temperature and excellent optical properties have been developed. In connection with Alupol Films fast development, a decision was made in 2017 on the construction of a new plant in Oświęcim. Currently the construction project is highly advanced. Commissioning of the plant will result in another major growth of production capacity in the Flexible Packaging Segment. 8. FACTORS IMPORTANT FOR THE CAPITAL GROUP DEVELOPMENT 8.1 External factors GRI 102-15; GRI 102-4; GRI 102-6 Taking into account the materiality of the impact of the remaining companies of the Capital Group on the picture of the financial standing of Grupa Kęty S.A. as well as the risks to which the Company is exposed, if not stated otherwise, the presented factors apply to the whole Capital Group of Grupa Kęty S.A. MARKET ECONOMIC CONDITIONS The companies of the Capital Group are exposed to trends fluctuations occurring both in the Polish economy, which is the recipient of roughly 54% of the sales, and in the economies of other European countries, which receive about 44% of the Group total sales. The remaining 2% are the products sold on other markets, including the USA. Particularly important for sales development is the situation on the German, Czech, Hungarian, British, Dutch, Italian and Slovenian markets, which receive 68% of export sales and, to a lesser extent that on the Slovakian, Austrian, Belgian, Ukrainian, and US markets. Sales analysis by industries shows a high concentration of the Group sales in the construction industry (approximately 58% consolidated sales by value), which means that all of the factors affecting the economic situation in that industry (availability of loans, level of investments) on the domestic market and major export markets have a significant effect on the sales generated by the Group. 40 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 Geografic structure of exports Struktura branżowa sprzedaży Other 16% Wholeselers Germany 21% 6% Other 4% Transport and Netherlands automotive 8% Italy 5% 8% Austria 3% USA 4% Food 20% Belgium 3% Construction UK 11% Household and interior Slovakia 3% equipment, design Hyngary 6% eletrotechn. 58% Ukraine 3% Czech equipment, Slovenia 7% machinery Republic 10% 4% Source: Company own materials. RAW MATERIALS AVAILABILITY Primary aluminium, aluminium scrap as well as semi-finished products based on aluminium (sheet aluminium and aluminium tape as well as ingots made from aluminium and its alloys) are the basic raw materials used by the Group. In aggregate, they account for ca. 50% of all purchased raw materials and production materials. In the production of flexible packaging, the Group also uses various types of films and plastics granulates (polyethylene, polypropylene), printing paper, paints, adhesives and binders, which jointly represent 20% of all purchased raw and other materials. The list of basic materials is supplemented with accessories for the production of aluminium systems, with 10% share. Due to the necessity of maintaining high quality of production, the purchasing policy of the Group is based on cooperation with selected suppliers who guarantee the proper standards. At the same time, diversification of suppliers has been assumed in order to secure supplies and maintain their competitiveness. CUSTOMS POLICY Since May 2007, the customs duties on aluminium imported from the former USSR states – the main source of the raw material for the Company – has been reduced from 6% to 3%. The continuation of such activities, i.e. reduction to 0% in further years, may positively affect the Company financial results. In turn, the return to previous rates (6%) will negatively affect the financial results. The customs policy of the specific countries in relation to the products offered by the Capital Group or its customers may affect sales indirectly. Imposing by the USA of import duties on passenger cars imported from the EU is an example of such a risk. Owing to the fact that the Group companies have so far been a minor player on that market with a small share in sales structure, the current situation has no significant impact on our business. Considering the growing scale of the Group operations in the domain of manufacturing elements for the automotive industry, such events may have a greater impact on the generated sales and profits in the future. EXCHANGE RATES As estimated by the Company, in the period covered with this report, approximately 45% of the Capital Group sales were generated in PLN, whereas 50% was sales denominated in EUR, 2% in USD and the remaining 3% in GPB, UHR, DEK and CZK. As regards expenses, ca. 48% of costs were incurred in PLN, 30% in EUR, 20% in USD, and about 2% in other currencies (GBP, UHR and DEK). Taking the above into account, EUR/PLN and USD/PLN exchange rates will have a significant impact on the Company results, as they will influence both exports profitability and competitiveness on the Polish market as compared to imported goods. The companies of the Capital Group take measures to mitigate FX risk by entering into currency forward transactions or maintaining a part of their debt in foreign currencies. 41 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 COMPETITION Since the 1990s, a steady increase in competition has been observed due to the attractiveness of the Polish market and the vicinity of the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Competing companies take ongoing measures aimed at the expansion of their production capacities or their product offer. As estimated by the Management Board, the main competitors in the particular business areas are as follows: Extruded Products Segment Sapa, Yawal oraz Final (grupa Yawal), Eurometal, Cortizo, Kaye Aluminium, Extral Aluminium, Aliplast, Albatros Aluminium Systems Segment Sapa Building System, Schuco, Ponzio, Yawal, Aliplast, Blyweert, Heroal, Alukon, Reynaers, Flexible Packaging Segment Amcor, Constantia Packaging, Mondi Packaging, Amerplast, Fuji Seal Polska, Schur Flexibles Poland, Wipak, Flexpol, Poligal Source: Company own materials. ACCESS TO THE SOURCES OF FINANCE The companies of the Capital Group have systematically invested cash in further technical and engineering development based on third-party finance. Furthermore, due to the standards applicable on the market, the Company partially finances its customers by granting trade credits. It means that even if cash is generated from operating activities the restrictions in access to third-party finance in the form of bank loans may have a significant impact on the Company development opportunities. It may also affect the amount of dividend paid by Grupa Kęty S.A. The level of interest rates will directly affect the costs of finance disclosed by the particular Group companies and, consequently, the net profit generated by them. POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION IN UKRAINE The Capital Group has two companies in Ukraine: Alupol Ukraina LLC – a production company, and Aluprof System LLC – a trading company. The unstable political and economic situation in Ukraine results in the exposure of the said assets to the risk, which exceeds the usual economic risk. The Management Board has been analysing the situation of Ukrainian subsidiaries on a constant basis. Any possible future write-downs related to the deteriorating economic situation or potential military actions in Ukraine may affect the results in the years to come. 8.2 Internal factors GRI 102-15 INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALES NETWORK The operation of the Group on a highly competitive market calls for constant meeting of the requirements imposed by the competitors and the customers. Those requirements can only be met through technological development, introduction of new products, increasing potential, and development of the distribution and sales network. The Company is aware of those requirements, therefore it has been systematically implementing its strategic plan, which ensures the Company development in all key areas, so as to guarantee high competitive level with respect to the other players on the market. STAFF COMPETENCE LEVELS AND HEADCOUNT STRUCTURE ENSURING THAT THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE FAST-GROWING MARKET ARE MET The Group success partially depends on the work of the management staff and their ability to retain and motivate highly qualified employees. The loss of services provided by such qualified and 42 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 experienced people may bring a significant adverse impact on the functioning of the Group. Therefore, the Capital Group has been continuously fine-tuning its HR policy to market changes in order to attract and retain valuable employees whose work and efforts directly translate into the Group success. ABILITY TO FINANCE CURRENT OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENT PROJECTS The continuous development of the Group depends on preservation of its stable financial standing (high operating profitability and large cash flows generated from operating activities). Therefore, the Management Board pays a lot of attention to continuous improvement of production processes and logistics, which should result in high effectiveness of activities and be subsequently reflected in profits. The appropriate FX risk management is also an important factor for the accomplishment of stable results. The risk results from the Company high exposure to foreign currencies as regards both purchase and sale. 9. NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT 9.1 Corporate Social Responsibility GRI 102-12; GRI 102-13; GRI 102-14; GRI 102-26 We declare that within the Company operations we have made and will continue to make efforts to ensure the creation of a better society, retaining balance and protecting the environment. We believe that the long-term success of Grupa Kęty S.A. depends on its cooperation with a broadlydefined group of stakeholders. We place particular emphasis on activities beneficial to the Company employees and their families as well as local communities. We operate in line with the adopted Code of Ethics and corporate governance principles, whereas partnership is the basic value we believe in. We are aware that we impact the environment in a direct and indirect way, therefore we operate such as to reduce that influence to minimum. MISSION VISION VALUES For the future... ‘A world-class company in the Our values comprise moral ‘ensuring employee areas of its operation’ standards, business ethics and development, effective use of culture, innovative solutions natural resources, safety, and social responsibility, environmental protection, reflecting the way the Grupa long-term economic value’ Kęty S.A. Capital Group operates 43 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 The Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group, via its Sustainable Development and Corporate Social Responsibility Steering Committee, has been consistently following the directions of development set out in its CSR Policy for many years now. The members of the Committee (the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. and the CSR Director) guarantee conscious policy and strategy in the area of sustainable development. The decisions made have been cohesive and compatible with the set-out directions and care for the future of further generations. In 2018, among other things, the Committee made a decision on the engagement of the Company, its employees and their families in a sustainable development campaign entitled ‘Letters to the Earth’, which has been described in more detail in the chapter devoted to environmental responsibility. The ‘OrangeBook’ strategic processes management system implemented at the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group is a platform for the management and control of all areas. Such documents as the Code of Ethics and the policies in the areas of HR, corporate social responsibility, environmental protection and respect for human rights form integral parts of the ‘OrangeBook’. In 2018, the organisation invested in the internal development of Corporate Social Responsibility processes, carrying out three CSR audits at the main business segments of the Group. At the same time, it continued the cooperation established in 2017 within the educational campaign named the ‘Responsible Business Week’, one of the biggest events in Poland promoting and educating in the areas of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and Corporate Social Responsibility. As a participant of the conference, the Company shared its good practices in relational marketing. Similarly, during the international conference organised by the University of Bielsko-Biała, the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group held lectures for the Visegrád Group representatives and shared its experiences in Corporate Social Responsibility. Following the principles of the Code of Ethics, we have been inspired by international standards and guidelines in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility. We are signatories to We apply the guidelines of The Company is listed on 9.2 Stakeholders GRI 102-40; GRI 102-42; GRI 102-43; GRI 102-44 In 2018 the organisation continued its dialogue and cooperation with a defined group of stakeholders. As compared to the previous year, there was no change in the leading stakeholders defined by the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group, who include the employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and supervisory authorities, i.e. the groups that exert the greatest impact on the business value of our organisation.

Capital Group maintains high standards of communication. For years now, the Company has been perceived by market participants as a recognised brand and a credible partner. The Company’s social activities are reported on external portals such as www.grupakety.com/odpowiedzialny_biznes; www.dziecipodbeskidzia.pl; and on the Facebook page 45 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 of the ‘Grupa Kęty for the Children of the Podbeskidzie Region’ Foundation. Ongoing communication with the employees is maintained through meetings, the Intranet, newsletters and notice boards. Already in the business model of the organisation one can see that the entire process is a dialogue initially conducted and consulted with external circles and later – in production and logistics processes – within the organisation, so that it can be consulted again outside at the stage of the final product. The dialogue is simply the day-to-day life of the organisation – everyday work, business and teambuilding meetings, telephone calls. We inform the broad group of stakeholders about our business plans, development plans for our organisation and our impact on local communities and the environment. The Company supports and participates in local initiatives together with other companies and the local community, creating the future of the region. The Entrepreneurship Council of Kęty, established in the District of Kęty and headed by Vice-CEO of Grupa Kęty S.A., is an example of such activities. Each year, the reporting process is consulted on an ongoing basis with the selected groups of stakeholders (including employees and representatives of local communities). 9.3 Professionalism and Ethics GRI 102-16, GRI 102-17, GRI 103-2, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Labour Practices Grievance Mechanisms’ and ‘Human Rights Grievance Mechanisms’, GRI 205-2, GRI 415-1, GC Principles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10 The supreme document of the company regulating the ethical aspects and comprising a presentation of moral standards followed by our organisation and our employees is the Code of Ethics accompanied by detailed subject-matter policies, including: Anti-bribery Policy, Conflict of Interest Prevention Policy, Dignity at Work Policy, and Diversity Policy, which jointly create a platform of guidelines and operating standards, as well as the supreme values of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group. An integral part of the Code of Ethics is the Anti-bribery Policy, which clearly presents our approach to the subject of corruption. In 2018 there was no training provided in corruption prevention due to the fact that the plan of such training has been prepared and approved for the year 2019. Our objective is to get 100% of employees acquainted with the Code of Ethics and the Anti-bribery Policy. The ethical processes monitoring structure remained virtually unchanged as compared to 2017. In 2018, Business Ethics Committees operated within the main business segments (appointed by Grupa Kęty S.A., Aluprof S.A., Alupol Packaging S.A.) as well as the Business Ethics Ombudsman at the Capital Group Level, making it the total of 15 people. The Business Ethics Ombudsman’s major role is to ensure compliance with the standards and values provided for in the Code of Ethics, treated by the GRUPA KĘTY S.A. Capital Group as the guiding principles of its business. The main tasks of the Business Ethics Ombudsman are as follows: • receiving official reports on violations of the Code of Ethics from employees and business partners (the reports may be submitted through a number of channels, for example to the Business Ethics Ombudsman personally, or in the form of a letter or e-mail sent to a special email address – all these channels are listed in the Code of Ethics); • participation in the development of ethical systems at the GRUPA KĘTY S.A. Capital Group: • participation in information and educational campaigns to popularise the Code of Ethics and the Company’s organisational culture. 46 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 The work of Business Ethics Ombudsman at the GRUPA KĘTY S.A. Capital Group as well as participation in the work of the Business Ethics Committees are functions performed free of charge for the sake of the employees. The Code of Ethics provides for the methods of reporting official violations and behaviours doubtful with regard to ethics. The Company does not operate any separate helplines or hotlines. In 2018 the Business Ethics Ombudsman received two reports on the Code of Ethics violations with regard to dignity at work. One of the reports, upon preliminary consideration by the Business Ethics Ombudsman, was returned – in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Ethics – to the internal path within the organisation, which has not been properly utilised in the opinion of the Ombudsman. The other case was directed for consideration to the respective Business Ethics Committee. Following the procedure, the Committee has not confirmed the fact of any violation. No reports on violation of human rights or anti-bribery policy were filed. The Code of Ethics also clearly defines and governs the organisation’s approach to the participation in public life, namely: ‘We maintain transparent relations with local government officials and representatives of the political stage, free from corruption and improper pressures’. In 2018, the Company did not make any donations to political parties. 9.4 The Company and its employees GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Employment’ HR POLICY The HR Policy of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group reflects the elements of the Mission, Vision and Company Values. IT concentrates on partner relations based on mutual respect and on the assumption that an organisation develops based on the individual development of its employees. On the way to business success there are highly set goals, on the one hand, and elements emphasising that people are the most important asset of the Company, on the other hand. Within the management-by-objectives system, shortand long-term planning processes are defined. The system provides tools for assigning tasks in relationship to the Company strategy and the needs of its organisational units, which are formulated based on the SMART concept. Moreover, the system supports managerial staff during the process of monitoring the achievement and settlement of objectives. Periodical assessment refers to employee performance, and based on the prepared summaries, individual development programmes are designed and incentive systems modified. Apart from performing their daily duties, employees may present their ideas through suggestion systems. The subjects such reported contribute to improving safety, streamlining and improving the effectiveness of work, defining standards and better utilisation of the employees’ knowledge and skills. We appreciate the contribution of every employee in the maintenance of the company on high market level and, therefore, we provide remuneration adequate to the scope of duties and responsibilities, expertise and results achieved, which is competitive compared to the market. Every year we carry out a payroll review based on market reports in that regard. 47 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 We also offer Employee Pension Schemes and a health-care programme with the possibility of extending the latter to the members of the closest family. Additionally, there is a variety of fringe benefits assigned within the Social Fund. GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Non-discrimination’; GRI 405-1, GRI 405-2, GRI 406-1; GRI 103 –1,2,3 as regards ‘Diversity and Equal Opportunity’ DIVERSITY POLICY – ENSURING EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES The companies of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group have a long tradition and employ people who are in service for long years, sometimes bound with the company since the beginning of their professional career. Such capital of knowledge and skills within the organisation represents a measurable value, whereas such employment structure contributes to an exceptional organisational culture. Managing teams, within which there are more differences between the co-workers than common elements, requires strong focus on relationship management. The role of the people responsible for human resources is mainly to ensure working conditions which support development and give the employees the feeling of safety, understood not only in physical context but also as mental comfort. System solutions are needed and in that regard the Diversity Policy may be enumerated. One of the assumptions of the Policy is to transform diversity into business development, because the individual traits of the employees contribute to creative solutions. The basic element is to prevent any forms of employees or contractors discrimination because of their sex, age, disability, health, race, nationality, ethnic origin, religion, denomination, atheism, political views, trade union affiliation, psycho-sexual orientation, gender identity, family status, lifestyle, the form, scope and basis of employment, other types of cooperation or other discriminatory grounds. In practice, Ethics Committees have been operating at the companies with the aim to clarify the reported cases of the Code of Ethics violation. The companies fulfil their tasks related to propagating tolerance, preventing discrimination, as well as adjustment of workplaces and conditions of work to the particular needs of the employees. This is performed by way of training provision, introducing flexible forms of work, but also through payroll review, granting awards or benefits, and assessment of the criteria forming basis for granting the same. Also analysed have been positions on the level of the companies management boards and senior management (directors), so as to determine the powers of the individual persons holding these positions, taking into account their age and gender. by gender by age group by length of service at the Group executives, including up to 40 over 50 up to over women men 41–50 years 11–20 years management years years 10 years 20 years board EPS 14 2 12 2 12 0 3 9 2 FPS 10 0 10 6 3 1 8 2 0 ASS 20 2 18 3 11 6 12 3 5 The average remuneration of women as compared to the average remuneration of men in the majority of occupational groups is lower by ca. 15% on average. 2017 2018 EPS executive officer No women in that position No women in that position EPS director 80% 84% EPS manager No women in that position 67% 48 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 EPS specialist 79% 81% EPS foreman No women in that position No women in that position EPS production area, worker 85% 83% FPS executive officer No women in that position No women in that position FPS director No women in that position No women in that position FPS manager 92% 102% FPS specialist 88% 96% FPS foreman No women in that position No women in that position FPS production area, worker 102% 93% ASS executive officer 90% 82% ASS director No women in that position No women in that position ASS manager 98% 82% ASS specialist 83% 89% ASS foreman 94% 78% ASS production area, worker 92% 82% There have not been prepared at the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group any programmes to ensure equal share of women and men in the management and supervisory boards. The Management Board Members have been appointed by the Supervisory Board, whereas apart from the President, the other Management Board Members have been appointed at the request of the President. The Supervisory Board Members have been appointed by the General Meeting from among the candidates proposed by the Company shareholders. To the best knowledge of the Company Management Board, the appointment of the Management and Supervisory Board Members has been based on their subject-matter knowledge, competencies and experience, and has not been discriminating in any manner with regard to gender, type of education or age. In 2018 there were two cases of the Code of Ethics violation reported at the Capital Group, particularly with regard to dignity at work. Both cases referred to the Extruded Products Segment, which have been described in Chapter 9.3 ‘Professionalism and Ethics’. GRI 102-8 At the end of December 2018, the headcount (based on employment contracts) at the business segments included in the report, i.e. the Extruded Products Segment, the Aluminium Systems Segment and the Flexible Packaging Segment, was 4,382 people. It represented 6% growth compared to 2017. In December 2018, 26% of all employees were women. 75% of employees worked under employment contracts for an unspecified period of time. Headcount by gender, age, type of position or employment contract is presented in the following tables. 49 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 Headcount by type of position specific other trial period fixed-term permanent mandate temporary 2017 women men contracts contracts contracts task contracts civil-law employees contracts contracts management EPS 2 27 0 1 28 0 0 0 0 staff administrative EPS 104 167 1 16 254 4 26 0 0 staff blue-collar EPS 202 909 8 228 875 0 0 0 0 workers EPS Total 308 1,103 9 245 1,157 4 26 0 0 management FPS 6 30 0 2 34 0 0 0 0 staff administrative FPS 48 64 6 18 88 0 0 0 0 staff blue-collar FPS 69 565 24 145 465 0 0 0 0 workers FPS Total 123 659 30 165 587 0 0 0 0 management ASS 11 35 0 0 46 0 0 1 0 staff administrative ASS 237 297 17 158 359 0 5 0 0 staff blue-collar ASS 326 1,036 51 520 791 0 7 0 65 workers ASS Total 574 1,368 68 678 1,196 0 12 1 65 specific other civiltrial period fixed-term permanent mandate temporary 2018 women men contracts contracts contracts task contracts law employees contracts contracts management EPS 6 28 0 0 34 0 0 0 0 staff administrative EPS 107 171 4 22 252 0 0 2 0 staff blue-collar EPS 240 945 51 223 911 0 0 1 0 workers EPS Total 353 1,144 55 245 1,197 0 0 3 0 management FPS 8 29 0 2 35 0 0 0 0 staff administrative FPS 52 69 5 23 93 0 0 0 0 staff blue-collar FPS 71 568 26 99 514 0 0 0 0 workers FPS Total 131 666 31 124 642 0 0 0 0 management ASS 13 51 0 3 55 0 0 2 2 staff administrative ASS 278 304 19 146 423 0 0 53 0 staff blue-collar ASS 368 1,074 81 404 957 0 0 134 0 workers ASS Total 659 1,429 100 553 1,435 0 0 189 2 Headcount by gender 2017 2018 trial fixedspecific other trial fixedspecific other employee mandate mandate period term permanen task civil-law period term permanen task civil-law s by contract contract contract contract t contracts contract contract contract contract t contracts contract contract gender s s s s s s s s s s EPS women 3 46 259 1 7 0 15 79 259 0 0 1 EPS men 6 199 898 3 19 0 40 166 938 0 0 2 EPS Total 9 245 1,157 4 26 0 55 245 1,197 0 0 3 FPS women 3 29 91 0 0 0 9 24 98 0 0 0 FPS men 27 136 496 0 0 0 22 100 544 0 0 0 50 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 FPS Total 30 165 587 0 0 0 31 124 642 0 0 0 AS women 15 249 310 0 2 13 41 214 404 0 0 37 S AS men 53 429 886 0 10 52 59 339 1,031 0 0 152 S ASS Total 68 678 1,196 0 12 65 100 553 1,435 0 0 189 Headcount by age 2017 2018 blue-collar administrative blue-collar administrative age group men women men women workers staff workers staff EPS up to 30 years 248 44 258 34 246 53 266 33 EPS 30–50 years 628 181 608 201 668 223 670 221 EPS over 50 years 227 83 244 66 230 77 249 58 FPS up to 30 years 158 20 152 26 147 19 136 30 FPS 30–50 years 436 65 392 109 441 82 409 114 FPS over 50 years 65 38 90 13 78 30 94 14 ASS up to 30 years 424 151 444 131 430 177 449 158 ASS 30–50 years 691 352 659 384 738 405 722 421 ASS over 50 years 253 71 259 65 261 77 271 67 58% of employees were aged between 30 and 50.

Extruded Products Segment a Company Collective Bargaining Agreement has been signed, which applies to 100% employees of the company, i.e. 33% of the workforce of all the companies subject to non-financial reporting. The Agreement is a form of cooperation between the employer and trade unions, which represent the employees' interests. GRI 402-1 Pursuant to the Trade Unions Act, the employer informs trade unions about any matters falling within their powers, in accordance with the deadlines laid down in the Act. Amendments to work regulations, remuneration regulations or the employee benefits fund enter into force in accordance with Polish law, i.e. after 2 weeks of employees notification, for example by displaying announcements on notice boards. The EPS has in place ‘the agreement on informing and consulting the employees’, as concluded by Grupa Kęty S.A. and the Workers Council of that company. On the basis of the agreement, every 6 months the Management Board provides employees with information about: the company activities and economic standing, as well as the expected changes in that area; the headcount status, structure and the planned changes in that regard, as well as measures taken to maintain the level of employment at the company; the activities that may cause significant changes in the work organisation or in the basis for employment at the company. GRI 404-1, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Training and Education’ DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANISATION’S INTELLECTUAL POTENTIAL Generation of the projected results by the organisation requires reacting to the changing conditions. For that to be possible, employees should be able to analyse, draw conclusions, and react to the originating needs. Moreover, the knowledge of new technologies and the ability to use them are essential. One of the elements affecting employee development is training, which contributes to maintaining the competitive advantage on the market, on the one hand, and enables the improvement of individual capital, on the other hand. Both of the elements are considered in development planning, which significantly strengthens the assumed effect. In 2018, 51% of all employees participated in training courses. In order to achieve progress, feedback regarding the results obtained is needed. Employees receive such feedback within their daily duties, whereas once a year, during the assessment meetings, the superior and the employee sum up the results and a thorough analysis accompanies that process. On that basis, we develop plans for another year. 52 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 Numbers of trained employees by gender 2017 2018 training training hours per training training hours per gender training hours training hours participants employee participants employee EPS women 139 2,708 8.8 165 1,815 5.1 EPS men 1,227 23,896 21.7 814 12,335 10.8 EPS Total 1,366 26,604 18.9 979 14,150 9.5 FPS women 325 1,753 14.3 125 2,462 18.8 FPS men 1,591 6,721 10.2 633 6,915 10.4 FPS Total 1,916 8,473 10.8 758 9,377 11.8 ASS women 245 1,400 2.4 277 2,044 1.0 ASS men 639 6,034 4.4 880 6,133 2.9 ASS Total 884 7,434 3.8 1,157 8,177 3.9 GRI 403-9, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Occupational Health and Safety’ OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY Health and safety of the employees are the focus of all the Company activities. Every year some accidents occur, however, actions have been taken to limit their number to the minimum. At the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group the ‘Safe Work’ programme has been implemented. It concentrates not only on the actions required by law, but mainly on raising the awareness of how the behaviour of one person affects the safety of other co-workers. There are provided additional training courses in OHS and fire safety, in reference to the specifics of operation of the respective company. Suggestions systems are also used to implement the programme objectives. The systems, being an additional source of information about the potential risks at work, encourage the employees to share their knowledge and enable them to suggest improvements. Thanks to the reporting system, the results of the undertaken measures and potential risks may be analysed on a current basis. The companies have appointed teams of OHS specialists responsible for monitoring the work environment. In addition, the managers of the particular organisational units appoint teams under their leadership composed of the Corporate OHS Officer, Employee Representative, Shift Foreman and other specialists, as appropriate, who: identify hazards that the employees and contract workers as well as visitors and other people in the workplace may face in a particular job or in a given area of the Company; identify the sources of hazards and possible effects of such hazards; estimate the occupational risk; suggest preventative measures aimed at reducing or eradicating occupational risks. As a result of such measures, the occupational risk for a given job is assessed. All of the Company employees are subject to the activities of teams responsible for safety at work. Despite various preventive measures, the Group did not manage to eliminate the entire risk of accidents at work. In 2018 the total of 49 employees were injured at the reported segments (two more than in the preceding year). Approximately 20% of accidents affected women and 80% – men.

The idea of educating through sport – The Company cares highly for investing in the employees’ health by proposing them a range of sports events, which are described in more detail in the chapter entitled ‘Community involvement’, and by proposing to the employees such market tools as Multisport cards or free-of-charge vaccination. Medical insurance – All of the Polish companies of the Capital Group offer their employees a special additional medical insurance programme under the name ‘Opieka medyczna S’, in cooperation with the PZU Życie S.A. insurance company and the PWS Konstanta insurance broker. Nearly 2,700 people have joined the programme, which accounts for over 60% of all employees in Poland. The insurance is co-financed by the employer in roughly 70% on the average, depending on the package selected by employees. The programme has been implemented as a part of the Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, which states that employees’ health and safety are the guiding values of the Company. 54 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 9.5 Community involvement GRI 413-1, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Local Communities’ For many years now, the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group has been consistently fulfilling the commitments under its Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. Social activities of the organisation are closely related to the designated directions of commitment and they are the consequence of the ongoing dialogue with local communities. The three most important areas in which the company uses its efforts and resources are as follows: • the activities of the ‘Grupa Kęty for the Children of the Podbeskidzie Region’ Foundation; • the idea of educating through sport; • social and voluntary programmes. Acting for the public benefit, the Grupa Kęty S.A. has been financially supporting numerous institutions and charities since its very beginnings. It has participated in organising cultural events and created conditions for practising sports by children and youths. The GRUPA KĘTY FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PODBESKIDZIE REGION Foundation has been continuing the voluntary and charity activities. The name of the Foundation refers directly to the founder company but also to the major objectives the Foundation aims to achieve. ‘To ensure a better start’ has been the motto and the guiding principle for the GRUPA KĘTY FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PODBESKIDZIE REGION Foundation from the start. The Foundation’s objective is to take care of children from children’s homes and special educational establishments, for example by helping them to get education, expertise and qualifications, which, in consequence, will give them a better start in their independent adult lives. The idea behind the activities of the Foundation is to gradually abandon state-run children’s homes and propagate the concept of foster families. The Foundation supports: • nearly 300 children from 9 children’s homes actively cooperating with the Foundation, • in 5 Districts: Bielsko, Oświęcim, Pszczyna, Cieszyn and Żywiec, In 2018, PLN 380,000 was allocated to statutory objectives. The Foundation has 2 transitional-living flats. More information at: www.dziecipodbeskidzia.pl. THE IDEA OF EDUCATING THROUGH SPORT The challenge of the 21st century is to stir young people to spend their leisure time in an active way. Sports means discipline, fair play, principles, and consequence – all values we care for in business. Sports also means a perfect tool for cooperation and employee engagement. For many years now, the Grupa Kęty Capital Group has been investing in and developing ‘the idea of educating through sport’. Caring for the health of the future generations, the Group has officially adopted the following objectives in its Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. In 2018 the sports portfolio of the Company included the following disciplines: • skiing, • cycling, • running, • beach volleyball, • football. The Company spent PLN 179,000 for that purpose. Apart from the local communities the events were actively attended by the employees of the GRUPA KĘTY S.A. Capital Group and their families as well as 55 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 the children under the charge of the ‘Grupa Kęty for the Children of the Podbeskidzie Region’ Foundation. SOCIAL AND VOLUNTARY PROGRAMMES Voluntary work is an important element of the corporate culture of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group. It integrates the employees around valuable initiatives and encourages them to undertake joint charitable activities. ‘For many years now, we have consistently followed our designated path. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, respecting, promoting and developing the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact, to which we are a signatory, or other CSR standards and processes determine the framework and horizons of our actions. In 2018: • as many as 36 projects were carried out within the programme, • whereas the engagement of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group amounted to PLN 40,000, • with nearly 2,000 direct beneficiaries. 9.6 The Group for the World ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS MANAGEMENT The report includes the total of 12 environmental indicators covered by the GRI standard. The process of defining the reporting areas comprised the prioritisation of environmental aspects identified within the framework of the management system based on the ISO 140001:2015 standard implemented at the Group companies. That register covers all elements of the activities of the Capital Group companies, including goods and services which can interact with the environment. The analysis of the importance of a given aspect to stakeholders and of its environmental impact was the basis for priority assignment. As a result, the following GRI indicators were selected: 103-2, 103-3, 301-1, 301-2, 302-1, 303-2, 303-3, 305-1, 305-7, 306-1, 306-2, 307-1, as they best refer to the activities of the Group and its impact on the environment. These indicators are associated with the environmental areas and components that the particular companies of the Capital Group can influence to a great extent, i.e. air, water, effluents, waste, materials, fuels and energy consumption or compliance with the legal regulations. PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE GRI 102-11 The Capital Group is committed to ensure and maintain a high level of safety of its processes. The Group companies strive to minimise the environmental risks. It is achieved by monitoring material environmental aspects under the ISO14001:2015 standard and by proper maintenance of infrastructure based on predictive and preventive measures as well as the programme of internal audits. The Group companies constantly monitor and assess environmental risks, taking measures referred to in the operational control procedures for processes which are material. In addition, they take preventative measures or measures aimed at eliminating the potential hazards.

When analysing the environmental impact of the Capital Group companies, we pay particular attention to air emissions of gases and dust, especially of carbon dioxide, as air emissions are sources of direct environmental impact. Total greenhouse gas emissions are low due to the nature of in-house processes and thermal efficiency of devices. The Capital Group companies are not subject to the EU Emissions Trading System. Greenhouse gases emitted by the systems at the EPS, the ASS and the FPS include CO2 and HFCs. The emitted carbon dioxide originates from the combustion of natural gas in boilers, radiators, thermal oxidisers, heaters and industrial furnaces, whereas the emitted HFCs – from the release of refrigerant by the air-conditioning devices.

The measurements taken as part of the monitoring process prove compliance with the standards specified in permits and licences. Total emissions by the companies of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group are well below limits. Apart from carbon dioxide, the EPS emits sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, dust and small amounts of inorganic compounds to air. The source of emission is the process of natural gas combustion and chemical treatment of aluminium elements. The main pollutants emitted by the ASS include sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, dust, sulphuric acid, hydrogen chloride, fluorine, inorganic acids and aliphatic hydrocarbons. The sources of gases and dust emission include the process of natural gas combustion as well as the processes of chemical treatment and machining of metals. In addition, the FPS companies emit VOCs and ozone to air. The sources of emission include the process of packaging printing and lamination as well as natural gas combustion in boilers and thermal oxidisers used in VOCs emission reduction.

GRI 301-1, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Materials’ Materials consumption Below reported is the total weight of basic materials used in the production processes within the reporting period. In each of our businesses, we focus on the effective consumption of raw materials and compliance with the binding standards. We take actions aimed at cooperation with those suppliers who are guided by the sustainable development idea. As regards our products, we apply a product life cycle approach, focusing on the search for new ecological applications. In that area, we conduct our own research and collaborate with scientific centres and institutions. Due to the specific nature of the Group production segments, the list of raw and other materials consumed is very diverse. Major raw materials used by the EPS in the production of aluminium elements include aluminium, alloy components, and aluminium scrap. From them, the Segment manufactures aluminium ingots, which are the input material for the sections extrusion process. The remelting process uses aluminium scrap originating from the plant and purchased from the market. The materials supplied to the plant are checked for contaminants. In this year’s report the total quantity of scrap used has been presented, which means the scrap purchased from the market as well as the scrap from own production and that of the subsidiaries. The characteristic materials used in the ASS production processes include: aluminium, steel, zinc alloy, chemical products for the treatment of aluminium and zinc electroplating of components, glass, separators, plastic pellets and powder coatings. These materials are used by the plants to manufacture window and door systems, façade systems, roller shutter profiles and boxes, roller-shutters, gates and accessories for PVC, wood and aluminium joinery. The main raw materials used by the FPS include: granulated plastic (PP, PE, PA, EVOH, etc.), aluminium foils, paper, plastic films (OPP, PET, PE, PVC, PA, EVOH, etc.), paints, lacquers, adhesives and solvents. These materials are used to manufacture multi-layer plastic films, including high-barrier films, singleand multi-layer flexible laminates, including printed or coated ones. Prior to their purchase raw materials are approved for compliance with the requirements of the Food Law. Raw materials are checked in compliance with the requirements of the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards, to ensure safety of the manufacturing processes and to reduce emissions to the minimum. The Group companies have their own facilities and systems to conduct tests and checks.

There is a high share of secondary raw materials in the final production. The EPS recycles aluminium waste produced at the Capital Group facilities and also obtains and processes waste from the market. The waste is applied as component material in the production of new elements extruded from aluminium and aluminium alloys. The plant selectively collects the particular grades of alloys and, as a result, it does not apply any fluxing agents that are harmful to the environment in the remelting process. The Company acquires both post-consumer aluminium waste (originating from end users) and pre-consumer aluminium waste (waste from manufacturing processes). This process is subject to strict requirements regarding the quality of the purchased scrap. As a result, there is no contaminated aluminium in the remelting process and no hazardous substances which could pose a risk to the environment are emitted to air. By recovering aluminium, the plant saves a lot of the energy needed to produce primary aluminium from bauxite ores, as the smelting process is highly energy-consuming. The recycling of aluminium also helps to reduce air and water pollution.

Capital Group, energy efficiency of the production systems is a priority. In order to ensure energy efficiency, the Company has implemented a special system of technical and organisational solutions in accordance with the ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 standards. The consumption of energy is subject to planning and monitoring. The business units of the Company must report their actual energy consumption, and – when planned volumes are exceeded – the growth cause analysis is carried out. Consumption monitoring involves measurements at utilities supply and distribution points. The readings form basis for the costs allocation to the particular sources of their origin. Utilities consumption is measured using a special computer system which ensures real-time control of all utilities-processing devices. Data concerning their operation are transmitted to the central management point, which ensures immediate response to or correction of any deviations. In addition, as part of the ISO 14001:2015 system, the Group has implemented the utilities saving programme and performs energy efficiency audits. Electricity is used, for example, to power production and auxiliary devices and also to illuminate halls and rooms. The energy from the combustion of natural gas is used mainly in heat treatment processes at production lines, e.g. in aluminium remelting, extrusion and drawing, anodising and powder coating processes, and to heat rooms. Moreover, we support ‘Green Building’ by developing the so called ‘green products data sheets’ for the purposes of LEED and 59 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 BREEAM certification. The data sheets for the EPS profiles and the ASS systems comprise information essential for the LEED and BREEAM certification processes.

Capital Group, only Grupa Kęty S.A. withdraws water from its own water intakes, i.e. from a well and from ground drainage at the plant. The well is a source of drinking water for the plant and for the employee amenities. In addition, the water is used for fire safety purposes. Water for the production processes originates mainly from ground drainage at the plant and is collected by way of a drainage system. Water resources are used pursuant to the permit required under the Water Law and the integrated permit. Analyses of the impact of water withdrawal on the environment confirm that the respective activities do not significantly affect the availability of water resources or functioning of protected areas. The quantity of water withdrawn is kept well below the prescribed limits. The ASS and the FPS do not have their own water intakes. Water is purchased from third-party suppliers on the basis of appropriate agreements. Water at the ASS is used for employee amenities and for production purposes in the process of chemical treatment of aluminium profiles prior to powder coating. At the FPS, due to the nature of its production process, water is used mainly for employee amenities and fire safety purposes. Only at Alupol Films, first reported in 2017, water is also used at the chemical treatment of printing cylinders line and in the PP film production system.

The aim is to increase to the maximum the percentage of recycled water in the total volume of water used in production processes, and to reduce the use of the environment. The effect is achieved by applying closed-circuit cooling within the thermal processes related to aluminium melting and processing. A closed-circuit system allows for substantial savings in terms of water consumption. Only small quantity of dirty water is periodically discharged and substituted with clean water in order to prevent the accumulation of suspended solids and oil-derivative substances. Cooling water is discharged to the central wastewater treatment plant. 60 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 Volume of water recycled and reused Company Closed-circuit system Unit 2017 2018 Quantity of water in a EPS m3 thousands 3,079 3,078 closed-circuit system GRI 306-1, GRI 103-1,2,3 as regards ‘Effluents and Waste’ Among all the Group companies, only Grupa Kęty S.A. (EPS) discharges treated industrial effluent directly to the environment. After in-house treatment, wastewater is discharged to the Soła River. Wastewater from the chemical treatment of aluminium elements is first neutralised in pre-treatment systems designed specifically for that purpose. The Company possesses permits required under the Water Law and limits are fully observed. Impact reduction was possible due to the installation of separate wastewater neutralisation stations within those systems in which wastewater is produced, installation of meters at wastewater discharge points and application of a number of technical and organisational solutions that ensure the appropriate quality of produced wastewater, such as a multistage washing process, microprocessor-based control of reagents dosing, bath recovery equipment, mutual neutralisation of acidic and alkaline wastewater or reuse of leachate in the neutralisation process. At the ASS, wastewater is discharged directly to the environment by ROMB S.A. The other companies discharge wastewater to the sewage systems of third-party companies, after pre-treatment at in-house neutralisation stations. At ROMB S.A., wastewater from the electroplating shop and from the processes of steel and aluminium elements cleaning is discharged, after treatment, to the Głomia River. At ALUPROF S.A. plants in Bielsko-Biała and Opole, industrial effluent, after pre-treatment at in house neutralisation stations is discharged to the sewage systems of third-party companies, whereas at the Goleszów plant, it is discharged to a retention basin and afterwards collected by a specialised company with a proper licence. The companies hold permits required under the Water Law and ensure an adequate level of purity. Wastewater quality is monitored and the limits provided for in the permits are adhered to. In addition, the plants have signed appropriate agreements with sewage companies to collect wastewater. Likewise, the FPS companies discharge wastewater to sewage systems of third-party companies. Industrial effluent from the electroplating processes, after treatment at the in-house neutralisation station, is discharged to the sewage system on the basis of agreements and water permits possessed.

Waste is collected selectively. Waste storage areas are separated from the ground, and waste is kept in special hermetic containers. The Company keeps quantitative 61 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 and qualitative waste records. An advanced computer system is used to monitor waste management. Waste which is not managed in-house is handed over to companies with the required licences. Waste management processes are monitored within the implemented environmental management system, in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. Aluminium scrap and melting loss are typical waste produced by the EPS. Aluminium waste is a valuable material for the production of aluminium profiles. For that reason, the Group recycles it and, as a result, aluminium scrap is transformed into direct input material. The Company manages 100% of aluminium waste produced at the plant, and also collects and processes waste from the market. The main waste produced by the ASS includes waste from aluminium processing, sludge from sewage treatment plants and waste coating powders. Characteristic waste produced during the packaging manufacturing at the FPS includes waste in the form of multi-material laminates, paper, plastics, waste paints, lacquers and adhesives.

The results of audits performed in 2018 by the Environmental Protection Inspectorate and by independent auditors from accredited supervision units as part of the ISO 14001 system confirmed the compliance. We have been constantly improving the management of environmental protection, thus achieving growingly better results. The main companies within each of the production segments possess certified Integrated Management Systems, including environmental systems in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard. Moreover, there is an efficient integrated system based on the ISO 9001 and OHSAS 18001 standards. The environment quality measurements and analyses carried out by the companies are an additional confirmation of compliance with the standards. For the emission of pollutants to the environment, the plants pay regularly and timely any charges required by law and file reports to the respective offices. In 2018, none of the companies paid any fines for non-compliance with the environmental laws and 62 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 regulations. Higher fees on water withdrawal by the EPS in 2018 result from a change in the system of charging the same (update of the ‘Water Law’ Act).

The sources of data for the financial evaluation of environmental activities are as follows: expenditure on eco-investment projects, costs of the maintenance and operation of protection devices, costs of waste disposal and emission purification, legally required environmental charges. The accounting is a tool facilitating the decision-making process in the area of environmental activities, investment projects and organisational measures. The investment priority is to regularly upgrade the machinery and improve the environmental management system, which goes beyond the legal requirements. Moreover, measures have been implemented to reduce the quantity of water withdrawn and wastewater discharged. As a result of the ‘employee suggestions’ programme, the Group has implemented a number of projects to improve the utilities consumption efficiency or reduce emissions. As part of the environmental management system, the Company has recognised a special provision in the budget which facilitates the effective implementation of the ‘Environmental Programme’, being a schedule of environmental measures for a given year.

Capital Group received any stakeholder grievances concerning the use of the environment. Environmental audit authorities and local residents did not have any complaints, which confirms that the plants impact is under control. The open information policy implemented by the Company, including the publication of annual environmental reports, helped to increase the stakeholders’ awareness of the nature and extent of the Company impact on the environment.

Capital Group has been carrying out consistent educational campaigns to promote ecological behaviour. As a signatory of the UN Global Compact, we have been trying to approach the environmental protection goals, and particularly Goal 8, in a reliable manner. Undertaking initiatives to promote environmental responsibility In 2018 the Company continued its previous initiatives, including: • ‘Let’s Clean the Beskids’ – the action engaged the total of 768 people, including 550 children and youths. From the mountain tracks leading to Magurka, Babia Góra and Klimczok over 8,670 litres of waste was collected; • ‘Bike HELPS’ – over 50 million km; limitation of CO2 emission by 12.7 thousand tonnes; 30 bikes awarded; • ‘A Top to Get a Wheelchair’ – 640 kg only in 2018, and over 4 tonnes since the beginning of the initiative. A new initiative in which the Company engaged in 2018 was the sustainable development project under the name ‘Letters to the Earth’. That extensive educational campaign carried out among children and youths consists in their writing letters to the adults, in which the young people present their ideas on how to protect the environment of the Planet Earth. The project is nationwide – in 2018 over 150,000 people from 300 towns and villages participated. In this initiative, the Company engaged the children of the employees and the children supported by the ‘Grupa Kęty for the Children of the Podbeskidzie Region’ Foundation in creating our First Book of Letters to the Earth. The project accommodated a series of ecological workshops and symbolic trees planting. Another new initiative in 2018 was the ‘Sowing the Sun’ project. Within the project we have sown and planted sunflowers around Poland. At the inauguration event, the children from the Bielsko-Biała schools planted the sunflower seedlings they had raised in recycled plant pots. The leitmotif of the project is a sunflower – the sunniest flower of all. The initiative promotes simple ecological activities, focused in particular on assistance to bees and birds. The establishment of ecological fruit and vegetable gardens has also been promoted. The project of nationwide scope was actively attended by the employees of the Grupa Kęty S.A. Capital Group and the children supported by the ‘Grupa Kęty for the Children of the Podbeskidzie Region’ Foundation. The chief organiser was the ARKA Ecological Foundation. 64 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 9.7 About the Report GRI 102,26, GRI 102-10, GRI 102-46, GRI 102-47, GRI 103-1, GRI 102-48, GRI 102-49, GRI 102-50, GRI 102-51, GRI 102-52, GRI 102-53, GRI 102 54, GRI 102-55 This statement has been prepared already for the fourth time.

The members of the 5-person Management Board and the 6-person Supervisory Board are only men.

Internal control and risk management systems in the process of financial statements preparation The Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. is responsible for the development and implementation of appropriate, effective and efficient internal control and risk management systems in relation to the process of preparing financial statements. The Financial Division, supervised by the Member of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. acting as the Financial Director, is responsible for the preparation of financial statements, interim financial reporting and provision of management information. The Supervisory Board supervises the operation of the internal control system, evaluating its relevance, effectiveness and efficiency via the Audit Committee and the Internal Audit Department, whose objective is to systematically and orderly review and evaluate the functioning of risk management, internal control and corporate governance processes. The internal audit function has been built on the basis of the International Standards of Internal Audit Professional Practice published by the Institute of Internal Auditors. As at the end of 2018, three people were employed at the Internal Audit Department. The financial statements are prepared directly by Dekret Centrum Rachunkowe sp. z o.o., a whollyowned subsidiary of Grupa Kęty S.A. Dekret employs accounting specialists whose knowledge is supported with the required certificates and education as well as experience needed to prepare the statements in an appropriate way. Grupa Kęty S.A. adopted the Accounting Policy conforming to the International Financial Reporting Standards, the chart of accounts and reporting databases, having regard for the format and detailed nature of the financial figures presented in financial statements. 87 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 The aim of the internal control system within the process of preparing financial statements is to ensure accurate, complete and correct accounting for all business transactions in a given period. The system is based on the division of duties, the approval of transactions and data on multiple levels, and verification of correctness of the obtained information. Additionally, in accordance with the binding legal regulations, the Company has its financial statements audited (annual statements) or reviewed (semi-annual statements) by an independent statutory auditor. The statutory auditor is selected by the Supervisory Board from among the established audit firms, based on the Audit Committee recommendations. Within the audit work, the statutory auditor provides an independent assessment of the fairness and correctness of separate and consolidated financial statements and takes into account the efficiency of the internal control and risk management systems. The process of preparing financial statements comprises control mechanisms of technical nature (numerical and logical control formulas) and substantive nature (the analysis of control reports outcomes). The following risks have been identified in the process of preparing financial statements: erroneous input data; faulty data presentation; application of erroneous estimates; missing IT systems integration. The risks are mitigated by: • maintenance of a uniform system of data mapping from the source systems to financial statements, which ensures the proper presentation of data; • periodical reviews conducted by internal specialists, with the main purpose to confront their knowledge with the financial figures and detect any possible improper presentations of data and erroneous input data; • making estimates based on the best knowledge of the Management Board, including also with the assistance of independent advisers (e.g. licence actuaries or property appraisers), if needed; • auditing the annual separate and consolidated financial statements as well as reviewing the semi-annual separate and consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Capital Group by an independent auditor, for the purpose of detecting major irregularities, including omissions in the process of financial reporting; • use of an integrated in-house IT system (ensuring complete data integration), which is subject to control in accordance with the Company security procedures binding for that system; • application of uniform principles in the reporting process of the Capital Group companies, and compliance with the uniform chart of accounts binding at the Group. Observance of the respective laws and regulations (compliance-related tasks) The organisational structures of Grupa Kęty S.A. enable the coordination of measures aimed at ensuring compliance with the respective laws and regulations, both at the business segments and at the Capital Group level. The structures comprise departments at the Head Office of Grupa Kęty S.A. responsible for separate areas, the corresponding structures at the subsidiaries, the Group procedures system called OrangeBook as well as the defined competencies and responsibilities of departments. The OrangeBook – being an established system of guidelines – enables the Capital Group companies to take advantage of the common knowledge and apply a proper approach to any matters related to legal requirements and conducting business. 88 Report of the Management Board of Grupa Kęty S.A. on the operations of the Company and the Capital Group in 2018 13.
