Integrated Report 2019 NGK SPARK PLUG CO., LTD. Integrated Report 2019 04 About NGK SPARK PLUG Stories for Value Creation Information Our History Over the course of its history, NGK SPARK PLUG has made progress by consistently taking on the challenge of solving social issues. Its roots can be traced to Morimura Gumi, which was founded by Ichizaemon Morimura and his brother in 1876. “On-time delivery of quality products at affordable prices”—inheriting this commitment to quality from Morimura Gumi as our corporate DNA, we are continuously working to meet the challenge of creating new value. Ceramica e Velas de Ignicao NGK do Brasil 1959 1949 Overseas business expansion Exports increased as Japan entered the high economic growth period. In Started the production of NTK response, we established in Brazil, our first overseas base, Ceramica e Technical Ceramics Velas de Ignicao NGK do Brasil in 1959 and proactively expanded our business overseas ahead of competitors to build a strong overseas After the post-war confusion had settled down and the production of network. plugs was stabilized, we began applying ceramics to develop technologies and products for the diversification of our business. This marked the birth of the NTK brand. We gradually expanded our product range to include industrial and environmental products in addition to 1876 1936 ceramic products. Hydrogen leak detection sensor Founding of Morimura Gumi Founding of NGK SPARK PLUG Morimura Gumi was founded by two brothers, Ichizaemon and Toyo NGK SPARK PLUG was established by spinning off NGK Insulators’ Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) Morimura, who embraced the challenge of foreign trade, being Spark Plug Division. The production of spark plugs was started at the determined to reclaim the wealth that was then flowing out of the country. Their honest and passionate attitude was highly appreciated overseas, initiative of Magoemon Ezoe, the first president of the spinoff, who had decided to produce plugs using ceramics, a specialty item of Japan. 2016 helping them substantially develop their trading business, which they The company has gone on to become the top manufacturer of spark Put hydrogen leak detection sensors on sale launched independently without support from the government. plugs in the world. Oxygen sensors for automobiles For the solution of environmental and energy issues, we accelerated the Temperature sensors for automobiles development of high-performance plugs and sensors and our efforts for a 1982 hydrogen energy-based society. The automobile industry began 1937 developing fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and in response we developed hydrogen leak detection sensors and put them on sale in 2016. Started the production of oxygen sensors We are also engaged in the development of SOFCs and R&D in the Started the production of NGK Spark Plugs for automobiles medical field. We are thus taking on the challenge of applying the ceramics technologies, which comprise our core We began developing spark plugs when the number of domestically technologies, to all In Japan in the 1960s, alongside the full-scale motorization of society, produced automobiles was just 49. In 1930 we put NG Spark Plugs on possible fields. 2018 environmental pollution such as air pollution became a social issue. In sale as the first spark plug produced in Japan, and began producing NGK response, the exhaust gas regulations were made stricter, and we began Net sales of 425 billion yen Spark Plugs in 1937, thereby making Ezoe’s dream of “supplying developing various sensors to help ensure compliance with the domestically produced plugs to Japan’s promising automobile industry” a regulations, including exhaust gas sensors, such as zirconia oxygen reality. sensors and wide-range oxygen sensors.

Integrated Report 2019 NGK SPARK PLUG CO., LTD. Integrated Report 2019 16 Risks and Opportunities About NGK SPARK PLUG Stories for Value Creation Information The markets surrounding NGK SPARK PLUG are entering a transitional phase, and our businesses are directly facing significant changes. We aim to identify shortto medium-term, and long-term risks and opportunities, and maximize profit in existing businesses, while also turning risks into chances and boldly embarking on the challenge of creating new businesses that look to the future. Measures Time horizon assumed for risks/opportunities Demand for automobiles is expected to increase on a shortto medium-term basis. Accordingly, we are further enhancing the automotive Business issues Risks and opportunities Short-term Medium-term Long-term components business. We will continue making profit through drastic process management for higher productivity and by building infrastructures for more efficient supply chain management and boosting our overseas production rate to mitigate the impact of FX fluctuations. We will also improve our profitability by taking advantage of our superiority in technological development. Moreover, we will Decline in the number of make maximum use of our global sales network to promote the sales and distribution of automotive components other than spark plugs. internal combustion engine We will thereby enhance the business while striving to develop new businesses, such as fuel cell and medical businesses, to achieve net vehicles Risk sales of 30 billion yen in FY2020. By closely monitoring the trends of each country and each automaker, we will make carefully considered decisions about our future Peaking of demand for measures. A shift to high-performance and high value-added products is progressing on a shortto medium-term basis, and we will focus automobiles in developed on the development and sales of such products to meet the demand, while conducting examinations on our production areas and sales countries Risk strategies with a stronger focus on profitability. As the trend toward engine downsizing advances, the number of cylinders and spark plugs per vehicle will decline. On the other hand, as conditions Downsizing of engines within engines become increasingly restricted, spark plugs are required that have a high level of added value in terms of ignitability, voltage resistance, etc., but there are a limited number of companies that can develop such spark plugs. We view this as an opportunity and aim to further Opportunity Risk increase profits by responding to the “increasing use of spark plugs with advanced functionality.” Environmental regulations are becoming stricter in Europe and other countries. In response, we are developing and offering a range of automotive sensors, including those to monitor rises in engine temperature and exhaust gas-related sensors. In developed countries we will increase market External environment Stricter environmental share and promote a shift to high value-added products by using our technological capabilities, while in developing countries we will make steady regulations Opportunity profits by taking advantage of the demand for sensors, which is expanding driven by the enhancement of environmental regulations, such as an increase in the number of sensors to be installed per vehicle. Decarbonized society Expanding demand for At present, we are working to expand our market share mainly in China and India and are implementing sales strategies tailored to each Climate change region. In China we are favorably increasing the sales of high value-added products as well as low-priced spark plugs, which we released automobiles in emerging Technological into the local market at the end of 2017. We will continue to enhance the local sales network by establishing a network of distributors in Reform of the automobile industry economies Opportunity inland regional cities and by building relationships with local manufacturers. innovation Aging society with a decreasing birthrate We are promoting the fuel cell business as a growth business and aim to become an integrated supplier and manufacturer of SOFC (solid International situation Advent of a hydrogen energyoxide fuel cell) stacks.
