For this reason, Krones has for years been working In order to substantially reduce both specific energy consumption and greenhard to find ways to steadily reduce resource consumption and optimise matehouse gas emissions, Krones AG has set itself a CO2 reduction target. We aim to rials use. cut direct and indirect energy-related CO2 emissions per €1 million in revenue We continue to focus our efforts on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our by 30% to 40% by 2020, from a 2010 baseline. The Executive Board adopted a production operations. We will report on our concept and current status in this corresponding action plan alongside the CO2 reduction target. Besides the measection. We examine the topics “Energy and media conservation in production sures laid out within the action plan, we are conducting a number of additional operations” and “Making optimum use of production materials” at the qualitainitiatives and projects to optimise energy and consumption in specific intive level. Key information and numbers are provided in the Additional informastances. tion for this section, on page 17. The reduction target applies only to Krones AG, for several reasons. First, the parent company still accounts for the lion’s share of value creation within the group – and thus also generates the majority of emissions. Second, due to the heterogeneous nature of the companies belonging to the Krones Group and the very different local and regional circumstances under which they operate, environmental strategy has thus far been decentralised. 1. Organisation Our carbon reduction target and action plan have been adopted by the Executive Board. The relevant departments are responsible for their implementation. The measures are coordinated and monitored by designated team members within the framework of our overarching energy management efforts. The CSR Team reports on them regularly to the CEO. Our annual non-financial report and reporting through various sustainability ratings ensure transparency for our shareholders and other stakeholders. 1 | To our stakeholders 2 | Environmental 3 | Employee-related 4 | Social matters 5 | Respect for 6 | Compliance 7 | Customer 8 | Innovation matters matters human rights satisfaction Relating to production 2 | 14 2.

Krones signed the Diversity Charter back in 2010, thus clearly expressing the company’s sense of responsibility for promoting diversity within the group. Until now, however, these efforts have been limited in scope. We are still a number of steps away from accomplishing our goal of establishing a comprehensive management concept. Because diversity is itself a vague term and thus allows for different inter­ pretations, we held workshops in 2018 to consider what concrete definition of diversity should serve as the basis for Krones’ concept. We then explored which areas our diversity management would focus on. We have now completed the groundwork for building this concept. We intend to finalise the concept in 2019 and present concrete actions and goals in our 2019 Non-financial Report. For the sake of transparency, we provide some current numbers on the topic of diversity that are currently being managed by way of several targeted actions. 1 | To our stakeholders 2 | Environmental 3 | Employee-related 4 | Social matters 5 | Respect for 6 | Compliance 7 | Customer 8 | Innovation matters matters human rights satisfaction Diversity 3 | 34 Diversity – Additional information Attachment KRONES Group – Age structure 2018* KRONES Group – Gender ratio 2018* KRONES AG – Gender ratio 2018** 30–50: 8,694 Men: 12,808 Men: 7,953 Under 30: 2,740 Women: 2,414 Women: 1,347 Over 50: 3,788 * A few smaller subsidiaries have not yet provided concrete numbers for these figures. **Employees covered by and exempt from collective agreements As a result, the figures listed here may differ from the number of group employees listed on page 30.

Because we do business globally, we consider protecting human rights imperative, an obligation that every single member of our group must fulfil. To ensure Respect for that this requirement is met across our entire value chain, we have integrated it Corporate Social Responsibility human rights into our Code of Conduct and our Supplier Code. We base our human rights due diligence primarily on the following guidance: UN Global Compact Human Resources and Social Affairs International Labour Organization (ILO) Base Code of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) OECD Guidelines Respecting human rights is a responsibility that applies across all departments at Krones.

Results In our customer satisfaction analysis for 2018, we received a total of 353 completed feedback surveys from customers. That is a response rate of 11.7%. The survey results are continually incorporated into our efforts to optimise our processes and products in Krones’ PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle. Thus, the customer satisfaction analysis benefits not only our sales organisation but also the entire company. Because of the correlation to our group strategy, order intake serves as an overarching indicator for measuring and assessing customer satisfaction. When we reach our growth targets, we demonstrate that our customers trust us to be their supplier and want us to help them shape their futures.
