Our 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report (pages 68-76) provides a transparent and comprehensive review of the most significant stakeholder issues facing our operations and projects. Significant developments since that report include: Paracatu, Brazil Quilombolas As previously reported, in 2013 and 2014, the federal Brazilian courts ruled in favour of the Company in lawsuits filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor (“FPA”) alleging that Kinross’ land purchases impact the human rights of the Quilombola communities in the mine area. The FPA appealed the court’s decisions but the appeal was denied. The decision in support of Kinross became final in early 2018. Kinross continues to engage with the Sa ~o Domingos Quilombola community, implementing various joint social and cultural investment programs. At the same time, it continues to seek support from authorities to be able to implement additional programs with two other communities. Trespassers Kinross has continued to apply an approach consistent with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights in all aspects of its security operations in response to recurring incidents involving trespassers entering industrial areas to attempt to steal gold from flotation tailings. These efforts successfully reduced the number of trespassing events in 2018 to zero. Given community concerns about the overall crime situation in the city, Kinross is also working with local stakeholders to implement programs focused on teaching life skills to youth. Community Health Despite the comprehensive scientific research and independent evidence confirming that the Company’s mining activities do not increase the overall human health risk related to arsenic, some individuals continue to make allegations to the contrary. Five of eleven lawsuits filed against the Company by residents of the village of Santa Rita were denied and the Company continues to work on resolution of the remaining cases. The Company has finished a comprehensive regional study of water quality with results showing a correlation between poor water quality and old “garimpeiro” (artisanal miner) workings. Detailed information, including copies of studies and links to scientific references, is available at http://arsenio.kinross.com.br/en/. Maricunga, Chile Maricunga Wetlands In response to a sanction by the Chile environmental enforcement agency (SMA), the Company placed the mine into care and maintenance at the end of July 2016. In October 2018, the Supreme Court of Chile upheld the ruling by the environmental tribunal and dismissed the Company’s appeal. In 2016, the Chile State Defense counsel filed lawsuits against Maricunga for alleged damage to two wetlands, Valle Ancho and Pantanillo. In November 2018 the Environmental Tribunal ruled for Maricunga on Pantanillo and against on Valle Ancho. Maricunga has appealed the latter ruling to the Supreme Court. At this time, the mine remains in care and maintenance, as residual rinsing and management of heap drain down is occurring. 8 KINROSS 2018 Corporate Responsibility Supplement Key Stakeholder Issues Maricunga, Chile Diesel spill, easements and the Colla community of Rio Jorquera Following a diesel spill in May 2017 at Maricunga’s Rancho del Gallo camp, the Colla community of Rio Jorquera filed a lawsuit with the public prosecutor which is ongoing. In November 2018, members of the Colla community of Rio Jorquera blocked access to Maricunga’s Rancho del Gallo camp; the Company evacuated the camp and filed an injunction to regain access. The Court of Appeal in Copiapó and the Supreme Court of Chile ruled in favour of the Company. While the environmental agency determined that no environmental harm had been caused by the spill, the Company has been prevented from completing the clean-up on community lands due to lack of agreement from the community leadership. Legal action filed by the Company in 2018 against the community leadership for failure to implement its obligations under a 2013 easement agreement is ongoing. Kettle River-Buckhorn, U.S.A. Water Quality An Administrative Order issued in July 2016 has been stayed, most recently on January 30th, 2018, while other associated court decisions are pending. Further details are available in the 2018 Annual Information Form (page 89). Sunnyside Gold Corporation, Silverton, Colorado Remediation Sunnyside Gold Corporation (SGC) was formed and acquired the Sunnyside Mine, near Silverton, Colorado, in 1985 and mined it from 1986 until 1991 using modern techniques and under the modern era of environmental regulation. SGC closed the Mine in accordance with the law, its permits and a court-approved Consent Decree. SGC’s five years of responsible mining and subsequent successful reclamation improved water quality in the area, and SGC became a Kinross subsidiary in 2003. However, in 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) caused a spill at a nearby property that was never owned or operated by SGC. This in turn resulted in the EPA listing the entire area on the National Priorities List pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and multiple legal actions by third parties. For additional detail, see the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report (page 74) and the 2018 Annual Information Form (pages 86-87). Tasiast, Mauritania Illegal Mining In 2016, there was a significant movement of people onto Kinross concessions looking for gold; since then the level of illegal mining activity has fluctuated, decreasing in 2018. Although this has not directly impacted mine operations, there have been a number of injuries and other incidents among these artisanal miners due to unsafe working practices, and extensive environmental impacts. Kinross’ ambulance, paramedics, and Emergency Response Teams have been deployed on many occasions to provide support as requested by local authorities. In order to prevent trespass onto the active industrial site, Kinross’ security works under established protocols with the Mauritanian police force in a manner consistent with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and Kinross’ Human Rights Adherence and Verification Program. 9 Kinross Corporate Responsibility 2018 Supplement KINROSS 2018 Corporate Responsibility Supplement KINROSS

All figures are reported from continuing operations unless otherwise noted. 2. All figures are reported based on Kinross’ percent of ownership (Chirano 90% and Round Mountain 50% for years 2014-2015). 3. Figures shown are rounded and therefore may not add up. 4. Following a review of 2017 site data pertaining to water, waste and land use, the data for 2017 and some metrics for previous years have been restated. 5. Frequency rates in all safety data are 200,000 hours worked and represent the data for both employees and contractors. 6. Kinross maintained its record of zero Tier 1 process-related safety events in 2018. 7. Kinross also received a fine of $274,000 in 2018 for a 2012 sanction regarding irregularities at the Rancho de Gallo camp, Maricunga. The 2016 regulatory action pertains to Kinross’ closed operation at La Coipa. 8. Scope 3 emissions for 2018 were 137,919 tonnes and include diesel fuel used by contractors. 9. Due to the remote locations of our operations, most sites do not use municipal water. The figures shown reflect municipal water consumption for drinking and cooking in the commissary at Paracatu. 10. The methodology consists of total water withdrawn less discharges and changes in on-site water storage. 11. Water recycled percentage is the water recycled as a percentage of the sum of the water consumed plus recycled. 12. Excludes the diesel fuel consumed by contractors. 13. Non-mineral recycled wastes includes oil that is burned on Kinross sites for heating. It also includes tires that are sent off site to be recycled. 14. Total land disturbed at the beginning of 2016 increased due to the acquisition of Bald Mountain and a correction to 2015 data at Paracatu. 15. The increase in the total land disturbed at closed sites in 2018 includes land at Kettle River-Buckhorn following planned closure of that mine in 2017. 16. Previously closed sites, DeLamar and Mineral Hill, were divested in 2017, reducing the total land disturbed at the end of 2017. 17. Net changes in water storage are attributable to excess water supply at site. 18. The volume of waste rock mined for 2018 is related to stripping activities relating to the Fort Knox Gilmore project. 19. The volume of waste rock for 2018 is related to stripping activities relating to Round Mountain Phase W. 20. The increase in total water withdrawn at Bald Mountain is attributed to new heap leach pads leading to an increase in surface requiring water application and higher volumes of stacked ore year over year. 21. In response to drought conditions in 2016 and 2017, Paracatu has increased the extraction of groundwater through the addition of new wells and reduced its reliance on stream flow capture. 22. Water consumed per tonne of ore processed is based upon 54,141,000 tonnes of primary ore processed and does not include the reprocessing of 1,661,000 tonnes of tailings from the Eustaquio tailings facility. 23. Mining activities were suspended in Q3 2016. 24. The area of land protected has been restated for all reporting years. 25. Figures for 2018 represent employees at Kupol and Dvoinoye. Prior years include all employees in Russia. 26. All of the ore from Kupol and Dvoinoye is processed at Kupol, therefore, data for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for both mines are reported together. 27. Represents water extracted from underground operations. 28. Following changes in water management at Kupol, water is discharged to water treatment plant. 29. Ore from Dvoinoye is processed at Kupol, as a result water consumed data is reported for both sites together. 30. Ore from Dvoinoye is processed at Kupol, as a result significant material use data is reported for both sites together. 31. Attributable based on Kinross’ 90% ownership. 32. For Tasiast groundwater withdrawal, please refer to Salt/Brackish category. 33. Tasiast total land disturbance was adjusted in 2016 based on aerial survey. 22 Contact Information General Publications Kinross Gold Corporation To obtain copies of Kinross’ publications, 25 York Street, 17th Floor please visit our corporate website at Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5J 2V5 Kinross.com, or contact us by email Website: Kinross.com at info@kinross.com or call Telephone: 416-365-5123 1-866-561-3636. @KinrossGold Toll-free: 1-866-561-3636 Email: info@kinross.com Corporate Responsibility Report Kinross publishes its corporate Investor Relations responsibility performance data Tom Elliott, Senior Vice-President, annually and a comprehensive Global Investor Relations and Reporting Initiative report every two Corporate Development years.
