Yours sincerely, Mr.Yan Naing Myo CEO N-STAR CO.,LTD. N-STAR Company Limited N-STAR CO.,LTD was founded in July 2005, in order to making the growth of Retail Business in the Country , our stakeholders , employees and to support the society with our newest technologies. The Company has two main tasks • To support our clients, customers with excellent service who are not getting full service in retail business in the countryside. And to develop the business sector in the region. • To help and support our employee, young people, our members to meet their current challenges and the challenges of the future with fair competition, new technology, services and other essential things to be successful in their business and lives. Our approach to the 10 principles We still support the UN Global Compact 10 principles this year. In August 2015 N-STAR CO.,LTD become a member of UN Global Compact program. At that point we could define three major stakeholders, which could guide the direction of our CSR policy where we wanted to make a difference within the natural context of our business. These are: • People (employees and members) • Society (locally) • Society (globally) In this connection we decided to implement our initiatives in two stages. The first stage would thus concentrate on implementing initiatives within the Secretariat to ensure that all members of staffs understood UN basic principles and ensure the willingness to implement sustainable solutions throughout the organization. The second stage would hereafter be directed at initiatives outside the secretariat, first towards our members, and later toward society, locally and finally globally. To make sure that all initiatives were employee borne, we set up a CSR committee, which became responsible for choosing and implementing the internal initiatives within stage one. And here are some activities of our CSR program for our Society in 20182019. We also contributed to some Orphanages and some philanthropic organization. And also we are still donating a building at our local temple. We also delivered some of our best employee for educational trip to Vietnam at 2018. Also we are planning to support our best performance employee to integrate into our Board Of Organization in Company Limited. Hope we’ll provide our success in next year COP. 1.
