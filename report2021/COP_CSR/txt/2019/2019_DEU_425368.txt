The company has grown in size, in revenues and in number of employees. Furthermore, DFGE now officially has an office in the United Kingdom. From an external standpoint, 2018 was also an active year for sustainability reporting. The CDP Climate Change questionnaire underwent a huge revision. In spring 2018, the final version of a new Occupational Health & Safety norm, the ISO 45.001, was published. A new project was launched in autumn 2018 to align sustainability frameworks better and to reduce reporting burdens for companies. Furthermore, the pressure for companies to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities is still increasing and trends like digitalization or SDG reporting have gotten more dynamic. DFGE considers such movements very positive, as they show strong signals that various players are striving for a more sustainable world. DFGE wants to keep supporting these trends. Therefore, we are working on solutions related to digital aspects like artificial intelligence or regarding the SDG integration into a companies’ strategy. Besides that, we provided competent solutions for our customers regarding their CDP or EcoVadis efforts and supported other clients in their fulfillment of several CSR standards and measures based on our Sustainability Intelligence approach. In this sense, we have always aligned and partnered with international recognized organizations. For example, we are still partner of the CDP, and are currently the only EcoVadis consulting partner in the German-speaking region. We strongly want to support our customers in being more sustainable, by setting a sustainability strategy and targets, taking part in external standards, implementing actions such as emissions reduction initiatives, and measuring and reporting related metrics in a proper way. We actively promote sustainable topics to our customers, including UNGC. As a sustainability solutions provider, it is important for us to apply such principles ourselves and show our stakeholders that we commit to them. We strongly believe in sustainability standards and frameworks; this is why we commit to the UNGC and are happy to report our activities and improvement in this Communication on Progress. We hope that you will find valuable information in this report. Greifenberg/Munich, January 2019 Dr.-Ing. Thomas Fleissner, CEO/Managing Director DFGE – Institute for Energy, Ecology and Economy 2 Human Rights 2.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 1 Principle 2 Businesses should support and respect the protection make sure that they are not complicit in human right of internationally proclaimed human rights; and abuses. Definition: Human rights refer to “civil and political rights, such as the right to life, equality before the law and freedom of expression; economic, social and cultural rights, such as the rights to work, social security and education, or collective rights, such as the rights to development and self-determination, are indivisible, interrelated and interdependent”1. In the context of work, they can relate to have safe working conditions, to be entitled to some rest, to be compensated, … Other labor human rights are treated in the third part of this document. Risk for DFGE: According to the Maplecroft Human Rights Risk Index 20162 the risks regarding human rights abuses are identified as low in Germany and the United Kingdom. Statement: “As a service provider company, our workforce is our greatest asset. We intend to provide a nice workplace where employees can thrive  DFGE promotes a healthy and safe workplace  DFGE provides its employees with decent working conditions with proper working hours and compensation  DFGE has at heart to focus on the development of its employee through career management  DFGE acknowledges the right to social dialogue and collective bargaining. Social dialogue is considered as all types of negotiation, consultation or exchange of information between or among representatives of governments, employers and workers, on matters of common interest relating to economic and social concerns. (ISO 26 000).” 1 Source: United Nations OHCHR 2 Source: Maplecroft Human Rights Risk Index 2016 – Q4 DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 4 of 17 2.2 Description of actions We comply with the German laws related to these topics and implement actions. As for 2017, in 2018 we implemented the following actions: 2.2.1 Health and safety  Clear and communicated rules in case of accidents  Employees habilitated to extinguish fires  Employees able to provide first aid support  Provision of ergonomic chairs  Provision of low blue light screens and adjustable screens  Yearly training on Health and Safety New action:  Updated training on first aid and fire-fighting (as part of the Health & Safety training) 2.2.2 Working conditions  Work-life balance measures (home office, flexible working hours …)  Lunch time: financed by the company, opportunity for a get-together  Free coffee, tea and water supply provided by the company  Innovation day, a time slot where employees suggest innovations for the company  During summertime, outdoor facilities  For every purchase in common online shops a small share (usually up to 5% of the price) is donated to the non-beneficial association Tierparkfreunde Hellabrunn e. V. New actions:  Head office in Greifenberg has been enlarged. This has generated new working places and secures now more space for the employees  ‘Ramadama’ event where the whole team collected waste around the head office in Greifenberg. For the event, a competition (comparison of collected waste amount and a quiz) between two teams has taken place. Both teams received a prize for their engagement (see section below: measurement of outcomes) 2.3 Measurement of outcomes  0 work accidents in 2018  0 harassment cases in 2018  DFGE donated 500€ to human rights supporting organizations3. Both teams that participated in the waste competition mentioned above received 250€ each for donation purposes. 3 DFGE donated the “SOS-Kinderdorf Ammersee-Lech”: https://www.sos-kinderdorf.de/kinderdorf-ammerseelech and the refugee initiative “Über den Tellerrand” from Munich: https://ueberdentellerrand.org/muenchen DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 5 of 17 3 Labor 3.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 3 Principle 4 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory lathe effective recognition of the right to collective bargainbor; ing; Principle 5 Principle 6 the effective abolition of child labor; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Definition: In the UNGC principles, labor refers to the right to collective bargaining, as well as the prohibition of forced labor and child labor and the principle of non-discrimination. Level of risk: As for 2017, in 2018, even if these risks are not likely to manifest for DFGE due to location, size and sector, DFGE commits to prevent any form of forced and child labor, recognizes the right to collective bargaining and wants to prevent any form of discrimination in hiring, promoting, training, paying or dismissing employees. Statement: As far as DFGE is concerned, the following principles apply:  Discrimination, e.g. any distinction, exclusion or preference that has the effect of nullifying equality of treatment or opportunity based on illegitimate grounds (like gender, marital status etc.), is prohibited. DFGE promotes diversity and equal opportunities.  Violation of fundamental human rights is prohibited  Any form of violence and harassment is forbidden. Workplace violence is defined by the ILO as homicide, assault, threats, mobbing and bullying on the job as forms of violence at work DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 6 of 17 3.2 Description of actions The following measures were still implemented  Compliance with law  Collective bargaining: due to our small size, mechanism of yearly assessment interviews and quarterly discussion. In any case of conflict that cannot be solved, we can resort to the company’s legal consultant.  Child and forced labor: only hired employees above 18, clear working contracts establishing working conditions and following widely used templates  Discrimination: Regarding payroll, same practice as last year, negotiated beforehand based on experience  Telephone job interviews to focus on expertise and objective criteria  Providing trainee positions for university graduates  More home office and web-based meetings to optimize the resources and ensure a healthy worklife balance New actions:  Employees Handbook: documentation of administrative processes, e. g. travel expenses, working times and home office schemes as well as formalization of safety guidelines, security concepts and training procedures in one central document which has been made available to all employees in order to standardize all practices and speed up the onboarding process  IT security concept: central documentation of all IT related aspects like system availability, software and data integrity and security guidelines regarding data manipulation, etc. This secures GDPR4 conformity and is available for all employees  New operating system: during DFGE’s strategy day 2018, restructuring measures have been discussed. In this context, every employee knows the company goals and future journey. Besides, due to the growing number of employees and customers, DFGE is now building different teams with dedicated focus such as marketing, sales, quality and product management, research and development, etc. These teams have various accountabilities and roles, and should foster more efficiency in the future, in order to address new trends and to support more customers. 4 https://eugdpr.org/ DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 7 of 17 3.3 Measurement of outcomes We are happy to announce that our targets were reached:  No breach of labor right is to be reported. In addition:  No full-time employee left the company.  We have doubled (+117%) our total number of FTEs in 2018 compared to 2017  In 2017 and 2018, we employed three working students and one trainee. One of working student became the new trainee, while the current trainee became full-time employee, showing our will to build strong relationships over time, and another became full-time employee, while the third student left for a sabatical.  We employed two doctoral candidates in 2018 compared to no employed doctoral candidate in 2017 DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 8 of 17 4 Environment 4.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 7 Principle 8 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental environmental challenges; responsibility; and Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Definition: According to the UNGC, environmental challenges refer to climate change, water, energy, biodiversity and agriculture. Corporate efforts should focus on meeting environmental responsibilities, valuing natural capital, and better understanding the linkages between resources. Level of risk: Being a service company, DFGE’s environment-related risk can be considered moderate. Nevertheless, there is a certain impact and responsibility which DFGE will assume, e.g. in the areas of procurement, resource consumption or employee commuting. Statement: DFGE commits to lower its resource consumption, to reduce the company-wide carbon footprint and to forgo all practices which have a negative environmental impact through the release of harmful substances. Furthermore, DFGE commits to actively promote UNGC principles to its customers, and to explicitly procure products whose environmental impact is certified to be low. DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 9 of 17 4.2 Description of actions The following procedures and actions were again applied throughout 2018  Waste sorting  Compensation of emissions from heating oil  Collaboration with the local supermarket to avoid single-use plastic  Car sharing organized and further developed by employees, enhanced home working possibilities  Extension of multi-pole sockets which should be switched off during the night  Updated process description for employees regarding the reduction of energy and resource consumption and regarding environment-friendly commuting / traveling  Paperless office  Remote controlled heating system for office rooms  Use of water carbonators instead of plastic bottles New actions:  Wherever possible, mostly renewable materials like wood have been used for the enlarging of the head office  Purchasing of a new coffee machine in order to reduce waste caused by coffee capsules  Above named ‘Ramadama’ (in Bavarian “we clean”) event in an environmental context: the whole DFGE team collected waste to clean the landscape and nature around the local authority Greifenberg  Internal presentation events related to UN World Days, like the Water Day5 and Earth Day6, to show latest scientific results, to raise awareness and to give general information about current sustainability topics. The same is valid for blog contributions in 2018 with topics like food waste7, sustainable gastronomy day8. 5 https://dfge.de/worldwaterday/ 6 https://dfge.de/earth-day-2018/ 7 https://dfge.de/food-waste-reduce-it/ 8 https://dfge.de/sustainable-gastronomy-day/ DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 10 of 17 4.3 Measurement of outcomes  No reported incidents of violation against any legal obligations in the environmental field  DFGE’s total carbon footprint increased by approx. 12% in the calendar year 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increasing number of business travels, the hiring of more people and the new working relationships with existing employees  More than two thirds of the carbon footprint are covered by indirect upstream and downstream emissions (Scope 3). The Scope 3 emissions increased significantly compared to the previous year due to the hiring of more people and the increasing number of business travels. Therefore, especially the emissions of the positions ‘Employee Commuting’ and ‘Business Travels’ increased. Nevertheless, through our car sharing scheme several hundreds of kilogram CO2e could be save, in particular with regard to the ‘Employee Commuting’ aspect  30% of DFGE’s total carbon footprint can be categorized as direct emissions (Scope 1) which are decreased compared to the previous year due to less driven kilometers of a company owned car  The rest of DFGE’s carbon footprint is covered by indirect emissions from use of energy that can be considered low as it covers only 2% (see fig. 4-1). The emissions regarding this position remained mainly the same due to the regional energy supplier which provides 100% green electricity from renewable sources. Only the upstream and downstream emissions caused by construction, maintenance and end-of-life of renewable energy sources (in prior wind and hydro power) are considered in our calculation  The increase in emissions is not as high as the increase in revenues or employees, showing a decoupling between CO2 emissions and operational activities, due to our various actions explained in the above chapter. Scope 1 Direct Energy 30% Scope 2 Purchased 2% Energy 69% Scope 3 Company & Supply Chain Activities Fig 4-1: DFGE’s CO2e emissions categorized in Scopes according to the GHG protocol9 9 https://ghgprotocol.org/ DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 11 of 17 5 Anti-corruption 5.1 Principles, assessment and objectives Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Definition: Anti-corruption is “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain”10. It can take many forms: moneylaundering, fraud, conflict of interest, … It can also be linked to fair competition. Risk: Quite low. According to Transparency International Corruption Perception Index, Germany scores 81, ranks 12 on 180 countries, and the UK scores 82, ranks 8 on 180 countries11, meaning that the corruption risk is low in Germany as well as in the UK. However, we identify some risks from tendering and linked to our carbon footprint activities.  According to the European commission, when dealing with German public procurement, companies can face “collusive biding, conflicts of interest in the evaluation of bids, the involvement of bidders in the design of specifications, unclear selection or evaluation criteria, and tailor-made specifications for particular companies12”. This can be extended to private sector also.  In the field of climate protection, or more precisely in the field of emission permits there have been reported incidents of tax fraud as well as other irregularities. DFGE never was nor is involved in the trade with emission permits, green electricity or similar products. Statement: DFGE commits to prohibit and prevent embezzlement, money-laundering, fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, extortion among others. DFGE commits to comply with competition framework. DFGE complies with all applicable laws in this sense. 10 Source: Transparency International 11 Source: https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017 12 Source: European Commission, Feb. 2014 (http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/germany/public-procurement.aspx) DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 12 of 17 5.2 Description of actions Under the umbrella term Sustainability Intelligence, we support companies in their CSR reporting efforts like UNGC, EcoVadis, GRI, CDP, SBT, Carbon Footprint calculations13, etc. For these activities, we only use true and reliable data provided by our customers. As part of our projects, we support our customers within the data collection phase with plausibility checks and general tips. Furthermore, we follow guidelines provided by several CSR initiatives (e. g. GHG protocol, UNGC guidelines and requirements) and use scientific approaches for our daily work. In this context, our intention is to prevent ‘Greenwashing’ and ‘Bluewashing’ activities and to avoid running in any corruption related issues. Regular Dedicated measures to prevent corruption:  Compliance with law  Implementation of accountability principles following the German (tax) law via a tax attorney  Update of our science-based methodology that prevents false carbon certificates  Extensive IT policies, with dedicated server control, company phones, designated access roles, in order to protect the data, especially reinforced in the context of the GDPR  Update of IT policies on a regular basis  Training on data protection  Set up of more stringent processes New actions:  Formalization of some core processes and sub-ordinated processes. That secures transparent, clear and stringent procedures which prevents the whole team running in any corruption related issues  Employees Handbook that also addresses anti-corruption aspects, e. g. disciplinary procedures, Code of Conduct references, rules related to expenses, etc.  IT security concept to underline, support and intensify above named IT policies in a centralized document 5.3 Measurement of outcomes As a result, our methods and actions were compliant with the above-mentioned regulations and recommendations. We are happy to report that there were 0 breaches declared in 2018. 13 For further information regarding CSR reporting and our support: https://dfge.de/sustainability-intelligence/ DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 13 of 17 6 Summary 2018 and Targets for 2019 6.1 Summary of reached targets 2018 Target Achievement 0 breaches 0 breaches 0 accidents Human Rights 0 accidents 1 additional customer endorsing 2 additional customers endorsing UNGC UNGC 0 breaches 0 breaches Labor 1 additional customer endorsing 2 additional customers endorsing UNGC UNGC 0 breaches 0 breaches Environment 1 additional customer endorsing 2 additional customers endorsing UNGC UNGC 0 breaches 0 breaches Anti-corruption 1 additional customer endorsing 2 additional customers endorsing UNGC UNGC Regular policy reviews are implemented and core Overall Act sustainably whenever possible processes are further formalized DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 14 of 17 6.2 Targets for 2019 To show further support to the United Nations, we align our targets on the Sustainable Development Goals, the 2030 Sustainability Agenda of the United Nations.

This year we have increased the number of customers by 16% compared to 2017. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to push the sustainability agenda further, and we hope to push it further in 2019! Promoting sustainability management Regarding sustainability management, we publish regular blog entries on CSR-relevant questions, which help companies to gain knowledge about the various topics. In 2018, several articles presented the UNGC and the SDGs. In addition, we kept the offer of free webinars addressing several topics in the field of sustainability. In prior, we provided webinars in cooperation with partners like CDP, EcoVadis and the WEC. Furthermore, we offered free white papers and guidebooks. We published our first ‘White Paper Automotive’ that brings important sustainability aspects in relation with the automotive sector. In addition, we have updated our CSR Handbook15 that covers relevant CSR standards and topics in general. This secures a nice overview and guideline for companies which are interested in setting up or improving their sustainability management. Supporting the Paris Agreement In 2018, we had the opportunity to support three companies regarding Science-Based Targets. Science-Based targets is a methodology enabling companies to set targets which align on the current scientific scenarios. They are in line with the Paris Agreement, which commits to keep the global warming up to a maximum of 2°C compared to the pre-industrial era. We hope that in the future, we will increasingly help companies develop such targets. In this context, the latest IPCC report has put further emphasis on curbing climate change to 1.5°C16. Addressing TCFD recommendations In October 2018, we offered a free joint webinar with our partner WEC (World Environment Center) to address TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) aspects and recommendations. Within the webinar, several speaking slots secured a broad insight into this topic. The young framework TCFD has become17 an important player in relation to climate-related disclosures like climate risks and opportunities and their influence on a companies’ financial performance. Furthermore, TCFD recommendations have been included into the CDP questionnaire 2018. Therefore, it was very important for us to address this topic in our last year’s free joint webinar together with the WEC. 15 See our publications page: https://dfge.de/en/publications/ 16 See also our blog post: https://dfge.de/ipcc-bericht-zum-15-grad-ziel-was-heisst-das-fuer-unternehmen/ 17 More information: Website TCFD, CDSB, GRI, WEC DFGE UNGC COP 2019 – CY18 ©DFGE, Jan-19 Page 16 of 17 Munich/Germany, January 2019 Founded in 1999 as a spin-off of the technical University of Munich, the DFGE – Institute for Energy, Ecology and Economy provides consulting services in the field of sustainability.
