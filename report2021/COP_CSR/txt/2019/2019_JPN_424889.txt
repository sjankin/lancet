While such films appear to be a single layer, they actually comprise multiple layers that are laminated together. The multilayer structure makes it possible to impart critical performance features, including transparency, electroconductivity, antireflectivity and brightness in the case of films for optical applications and heat resistance as well as oxygen-barrier properties and moisture resistance in the case of films for food packaging applications. Film layers are generally laminated using adhesives. However, in situations where the surface attributes of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film discourage adhesion, an adhesive primer (aqueous polyurethane surface modifier; also called an anchor coat or an adhesion promoter) is applied prior to the laminating adhesive. While less than 0.1 micron (1/10,000 millimeter) thick, DIC‚Äôs new primers ensure a powerful bond between the PET film substrate and coating layer, thereby playing a key role in enhancing the properties of DIC‚Äôs HYDRAN resin adhesive primers for films high-performance films.

The company develops and supplies a broad range of products that address diverse social imperatives. Social Imperative Brands today are under a lot of pressure to be environment-friendly. Studies have shown that consumers want more sustainable packaging and global retailers have made it clear that they prefer to work with brands that integrate environment-friendly practices in their packaging. Recognizing these trends, brands are taking dedicated steps to vet and study the environmental practices implemented by their suppliers and partners. In fact, some brands in the fast/quick food service industry have gone so far as to push forward initiatives that focus on using all-natural packaging. This has led to a push for greener inks with a higher level of bio-renewable content. A bio-renewable ink can be derived from tree, plant, insect and/or animal materials, according to the U.S.-based National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers (NAPIM). These can include resins, gums, oils, waxes, solvents, and other polymer building blocks. Brand owners want these bio-renewable inks to maintain the same quality and performance requirements of a non-renewable ink, keep to a cost that is competitive with non-renewable inks and comply with the standards outlined by the brand and a variety of regulations, including California‚Äôs Proposition 65 and the European Union‚Äôs Toy Safety Directive, among others. Sun Chemical has responded to the industry challenges by rolling out a line of inks that meet environment-friendly, Sun Chemical‚Äôs bio-renewable and biodegradable standards that the industry, brand owners, retailers and consumers are looking for. Response Formulated with significantly higher levels of bio-renewable resin content compared to other previous market offerings from Sun Chemical, the new SunVisto ¬Æ AquaGreen water-based inks deliver the required critical performance attributes needed across a range of paper packaging applications. The inks can be blendable using varnishes and standard water-based pigment dispersions, and do not compromise end-use or on-press performance. They also offer RXWVWDQGLQJSULQW¬øGHOLW\DQGLQNUHVROXELOLW\RQSUHVVTXLFNVHWWLQJIRULQOLQHFRQYHUWLQJDQG high levels of resistance properties to rub, abrasion, water and grease. Sun Chemical‚Äôs R&D and compliance teams from Europe, North America and South America spent a year and a half replacing chemicals with natural products to ultimately provide an ink solution that was comparable in cost, delivered the required performance attributes and met all the standards and regulatory compliance requirements. VOICE Sun Chemical is fulÔ¨Ålling its responsibilities to ensure sustainable business practices. Sun Chemical is a recognized leader in compliance and R&D, with a strong commitment to sustainable practices. Those attributes were why a customer in North America approached us with a project to see if we could create a series of natural bio-renewable inks that would meet the sustainability needs and standards of major fast/quick food service brands. It was a major undertaking with a lot of testing and trial runs. It was inspiring to see our team‚Äôs determination to find the right raw materials needed to accomplish the goals and requirements of our Vice President, Marketing customer and global regulations.

Board members also report on the results of audits conducted, as well as attend important meetings, including those of the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee and the Sustainability Committee, meet with representative directors on a periodic basis to exchange information and opinions, and collect business reports from directors, executive officers and employees. In addition, DIC has established an Office of Corporate Auditors, to which it assigns dedicated personnel to assist the corporate auditors in their duties.

With the rising frequency of terrorism, uprisings, kidnappings and other such incidents in various locations, the Group is reinforcing safety measures designed to help employees evade danger. These include taking steps to advance awareness among related individuals and reinforce the corporate headquarters‚Äô ability to respond effectively in an emergency situation by establishing an emergency contact network, providing risk information to overseas bases, distributing safety handbooks, providing safety training to employees prior to taking up new overseas posts or embarking on overseas business trips, and conducting drills based on hypothetical scenarios set forth in crisis management manuals.

Two-thirds of the Group‚Äôs employees are located at, and 60% of its consolidated net sales are generated by, bases outside of Japan. DIC recognizes that ensuring subsidiaries share the same values and vision‚Äîdespite differences in culture, systems and customs‚Äî and maximizing management resources, while at the same time complying with local laws, regulations and rules, is critical to sustainable growth for the Group. It goes almost without saying that in the event of a transgression, an incident of noncompliance or an unforeseen contingency at an overseas DIC Group base, there is a risk that the DIC brand image could be negatively affected, causing damage to the Group as a whole. DIC has thus positioned the management of this risk as a crucial challenge requiring immediate and ongoing initiatives and will continue to promote efforts to strengthen its framework for supporting risk-avoidance worldwide.

The adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 further accelerated the efforts of developed economies to curb their CO 2 emissions. Efforts of particular note include the creation of preferential tax systems and subsidies with the aim of supporting efforts to make use of energy from renewable sources, encouraging companies to diversify energy sources by moving away from fossil fuels (thereby reducing carbon) and avoiding the risk of resource depletion. Indonesia has become the first country in Asia to sell green bonds to raise funds for investments in global warming countermeasures and environmental projects.

Accordingly, finding effective ways to conserve and manage water resources is a crucial global challenge. The DIC Group withdraws fresh water (tap water and industrial water) for use in production processes and air conditioning and for drinking, among others. The Group also discharges wastewater‚Äîafter purifying it in line with internal standards that exceed official standards in the countries and territories where it has operations‚Äîinto rivers and other fresh water bodies. In Japan, the Central Research Laboratories, in Chiba Prefecture, recovers purified wastewater (graywater) and reuses it on-site in research, as a result of which it currently discharges no wastewater. The Group also promotes the recycling and reuse of water to reduce its impact on water resources. In fiscal year 2017, the Group continued to promote efforts to improve production processes, share information and centralize data on fresh water withdrawn, water used and wastewater discharged. Fresh water withdrawn by the global DIC Group in the period edged down 0.5% from the fiscal year 2016 level, to 41,308,000 m3, comprising withdrawals by the Group in Japan (including the parent company) of 32,327,000 m3, up 5.9%, and by Group companies overseas of 8,981,000 m3, down 18.5%. Wastewater discharged by the global DIC Group in fiscal year 2017 rose 3.3%, to 38,822,000 m3. Effective from fiscal year 2017, the Group adopted the GRI‚Äôs guideline for collecting data on water withdrawn* and used its water risk assessment tool to analyze initial water risk at 38 sites worldwide, which account for 75.0% of its global production. With the aim of enhancing its ability to manage water resources, the Group also commenced a review of the status of water recycling efforts. Looking ahead, the Group will continue working to enhance initiatives designed to help protect and ensure the effective use of precious water resources.

Basic Approach to Human Resources Management With the aim of being an organization that empowers all employees to reach their full potential, the DIC Group is committed to respecting human rights and eliminating all forms of discrimination and to creating a work environment that embraces diversity. The Group also strives to support a healthy work‚Äìlife balance for each employee and create a work environment conducive to job satisfaction, as well as to foster local human resources in markets around the world, which it recognizes as essential to ensuring sustainable corporate growth under its current medium-term management plan. | Respect for Human Rights The DIC Group actively supports global codes governing human rights*1, in line with which it is currently formulating the DIC Group Human Rights Policy, and promotes related initiatives. The DIC Group Code of Business Conduct, which outlines standards that DIC Group employees are expected to observe, lays down provisions prohibiting human rights violations and requiring respect for diversity, two philosophies that are the foundation of the Group‚Äôs corporate activities. DIC Group employees are obliged to understand and provide written pledges to abide by the Code.

Basic Approach to Sustainable Procurement Having recognized the increasing importance of addressing global issues related to human rights, climate change and water risk, among others, as social imperatives, the DIC Group promotes socially responsible procurement practices. To ensure its extended supply chain functions in a socially responsible manner, the DIC Group established the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, based on which it also formulated purchasing management regulations, in 2008 and the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, which clarify issues it expects suppliers to address, in 2009. Using the policy and guidelines, the Group promotes CSR procurement across its supply chain by ensuring that all suppliers implement improvements and initiatives necessary to ensure the sustainability of Group procurement.

DIC Report 2018 125 Sustainable Procurement | Encouraging CSR Procurement Based on the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, and incorporating requirements contained in guidebooks put out by external organizations including the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), DIC formulated the DIC Group CSR Procurement Guidelines, a series of requirements pertaining to ESG-related imperatives, including the management of chemical substances in and reduction of the environmental impact of raw materials, as well as respect for human rights across its entire supply chain. With the aim of compelling suppliers to observe these guidelines, the DIC Group conducts assessments and on-site inquiries in accordance with the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook. (Version 2 of the guidebook was published in July 2013.) In addition to obliging suppliers to ensure the stringent management of chemical substances through the DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines, the Group entreats suppliers to develop and release products that have less of an impact on the environment and promote green procurement themselves, as well as to lower the environmental impact of materials they procure, and of the packaging, transport, production and engineering thereof, by trimming resources and energy used in, decreasing the weight and expending the useful life span of, and reducing CO2 emissions from such materials. Such measures have proven effective in strengthening the Group‚Äôs relations with suppliers. | The DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines In line with the DIC Group Universal Purchasing Policy, DIC formulated the DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines, which prohibit the procurement of materials containing hazardous substances in seven categories*1. The guidelines mandate the submission of a DIC Raw Materials Survey, an SDS and a chemSHERPA*2, as well as a DIC Group Green Procurement Guidelines Survey, when purchasing raw materials, thereby creating a system for eliminating VXEVWDQFHVRIFRQFHUQ6XEPLVVLRQRID&RQ√ÄLFW0LQHUDOV6XUYH\LVDOVRUHTXLUHG *1  6XEVWDQFHVWKHSURGXFWLRQRIZKLFKLVSURKLELWHGDVRXWOLQHGLQ$UWLFOHRI-DSDQ¬∂V,QGXVWULDO+HDOWKDQG6DIHW\$FW  6XEVWDQFHVGHVLJQDWHGDVFODVVVSHFL¬øHGFKHPLFDOVXEVWDQFHV in Japan‚Äôs Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc.; (3) Substances designated for monitoring under Japan‚Äôs Act on the Evaluation of Chemical Substances and Regulation of Their Manufacture, etc.; (4) Chemical substances the production of which is already prohibited, as detailed in Japan‚Äôs Act on the Protection of the Ozone Layer 7KURXJKWKH&RQWURORI6SHFL¬øHG6XEVWDQFHVDQG2WKHU0HDVXUHV R]RQHGHSOHWLQJVXEVWDQFHVOLVWHGLQWKH0RQWUHDO3URWRFRO   6SHFL¬øHGSDUWLFXODWHVGHQRWHGLQ-DSDQ¬∂V$LU3ROOXWLRQ &RQWURO$FW  6SHFL¬øHGSRLVRQRXVVXEVWDQFHVLQGLFDWHGLQ-DSDQ¬∂V3RLVRQRXVDQG'HOHWHULRXV6XEVWDQFHV&RQWURO$FWDQG  6SHFL¬øHGVXEVWDQFHVGHWDLOHGLQWKH6WRFNKROP&RQYHQWLRQRQ Persistent Organic Pollutants. *2 FKHP6+(53$LVDVFKHPHGHVLJQHGWRIDFLOLWDWHWKHDFFXUDWHDQGHI¬øFLHQWVKDULQJRILQIRUPDWLRQRQFKHPLFDOVXEVWDQFHVLQSURGXFWVDFURVVWKHHQWLUHVXSSO\FKDLQ',&EHJDQXVLQJ FKHP6+(53$LQODWH¬øVFDO\HDU | Supplier Self-Evaluations In accordance with version 2* of the DIC Group Supply-chain CSR Deployment Guidebook, the DIC Group asks suppliers to complete questionnaires, which it uses to ascertain the status of suppliers‚Äô CSR procurement practices.

While the starting point of these efforts is listening to the voices of its customers‚Äîan approach known as ‚Äúcustomer-in‚Äù‚Äîthe Group also takes a ‚Äúmarket-in‚Äù approach, paying heed to the importance of anticipating social imperatives. | Promoting Businesses that Anticipate Social Imperatives One of the central strategies of the DIC Group‚Äôs current medium-term management plan, DIC108, is to create next-generation businesses. The Group is responding to this challenge through the cultivation of business models that address social imperatives. For example, one of the principal objectives behind efforts to expedite the widespread adoption of renewable energy is to address increasingly crucial issues such as global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels. However, this depends on, among others, installing largecapacity storage batteries to resolve issues related to the generation of surplus electric power. The DIC Group conducts tireless research aimed at addressing such challenges and is developing innovative materials and systems for storage batteries and sensors that will yield concrete, viable solutions, thereby contributing to sustainability. The Group also continues to promote business activities with roots in the needs of society with the aim of further evolving its business models. | Examples of Optimized Business Models that Respond to Social Imperatives 1 Near Infrared‚ÄìBased Food Contaminant Detection System that Will Improve Food Safety DIC is currently developing a near infrared‚Äìbased food contaminant detection system in collaboration with Mitsui Kinzoku Instrumentations Technology Corporation. The system combines dyes that emit infrared for plastics and a device that detects near infrared and is thus expected to be able to identify plastic contaminants, which has traditionally been considered difficult. Thanks to near infrared‚Äôs safety‚Äîit has minimal impact on human health‚Äîand the ease with which it penetrates matter, the potential for application in the detection of contaminants in food products is seen as being high.

In addition to helping children realize that studying science is useful in everyday life, the lab aligned with regular curriculum units, meaning that the school‚Äôs burden for preparation was minimal. From the perspective of career education, the value of these science labs is enhanced by the fact that they are conducted by a well-known company with close ties to our community.

discharge of industrial waste and number of occupational accidents (including number of accidents leading to workdays lost). DIC Report 2018 147 Third-Party Opinion Regarding DIC Report 2018 Once again this year, I had the honor of reviewing the DIC Report. In this year‚Äôs report, I was particularly impressed with president and CEO Kaoru Ino‚Äôs comment that the DIC Group would endeavor to address increasingly varied and compelling social imperatives and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. He explained that in order to do so the Group would cultivate new businesses, in addition to printing inks, pigments and compounds, in which it has the potential to earn global market-leading positions. Counselor, The Japan Research Institute, Limited A true blue-chip organization, the DIC Group boasts leading global market Eiichiro Adachi shares in a number of areas, including approximately 30% for printing inks, 20% for organic pigments and 27% for PPS compounds. It is also a chemicals In his current capacity, Eiichiro Adachi manufacturer that uses petroleum-derived raw materials in many of its products conducts industry research and assesses corporate per formance from and has energy-intensive production processes. With the capacity of our planet the perspective of social responsibility. and society increasingly strained, we are seeing changes in the nature of efforts He also provides financial institutions with corporate information for socially to shift to more environment-friendly energy sources and promote material responsible investing (SRI). A member of recycling under the banner of ‚Äúsustainability.‚Äù Going forward, the Group‚Äôs the Market Evolution and Corporations in the 21st Century working group organized cogency in aligning its corporate values‚Äîwhich emphasize making life colorful, by the Keizai Doyukai (Japan Association drawing on its expertise and comprehensive strengths to offer solutions, and of Corporate Executives), Mr. Adachi bringing innovation to society through its core compounding technologies‚Äî was involved in the preparation of The 15th Corporate White Paper on ‚ÄúMarket to such changes while continuing to give full play to its capabilities will come Evolution‚Äù and CSR Management: under scrutiny. Toward Building Integrity and Creating Shareholder Value. From March 2005 to The effectiveness of the DIC Group‚Äôs efforts to combat climate change and May 2009, he also served as a national disclose related information is underscored by the high marks it has received in expert for Japan to the ISO 26000 working the CDP‚Äôs climate change assessment program, with the global NGO awarding group. Mr. Adachi is also known as the author of Environmental Management: A it a leadership-level score of Afor two consecutive years. I look forward to Beginner‚Äôs Guide and An Illustrated Guide seeing the Group further enhance its sustainability efforts with the need to to Environmental Issues for Companies (published in Japanese). ensure sustainability for the planet and society. One item that particularly caught my attention in this year‚Äôs report was Sun Chemical‚Äôs participation in the Responsible Mica Initiative. In 2018, the DIC Group formulated a draft human rights policy, but it is important to understand that effective human rights due diligence does not end with the creation of a policy. For example, it is crucial to take steps to prevent the use of child labor across the supply chain and to implement remedial measures if issues are discovered. The fact that the natural minerals used as raw materials for pigments are a key source of funds for armed groups has long been noted, as has the fact that the inappropriate disposal of electric and electronic equipment is a cause of severe health issues in developing countries. It is my hope that the Group will make use of the OECD Due Diligence Guide for Responsible Business Conduct, published in May 2018, and other such references to step up its efforts to identify and mitigate human rights‚Äìrelated risks and evaluate its performance. The Message from the President at the beginning of this year‚Äôs report contains the following statement: ‚Äú‚Ä¶in fiscal year 2018, we are promoting This third-party opinion reflects my view of the sustainability initiatives and information extensive debate and discussion to determine critical changes needed to fulfill disclosure of the DIC Group, as understood our mission, based on which we will formulate strategies from a mediumto from reading this report, from my perspective as an individual who provides corporate long-term perspective.‚Äù In next year‚Äôs report, I look forward to reading about information to financial institutions to assist incorporation of both the processes employed in such debate and discussion SRI. It is not intended as a comment on and the results thereof into initiatives implemented in line with the themes of whether or not the information herein has been measured and calculated accurately to ‚Äúbusiness models that respond to social imperatives‚Äù and ‚Äúnew technology conform to commonly accepted standards development and value creation.‚Äù for the preparation of environmental or other reports or a judgment on whether the report covers relevant important matters in full.

Operating While economic conditions worldwide recovered gradually in fiscal year 2017, ended December 31, 2017, Results economic uncertainty, fluctuations in the financial and capital markets and the direction of oil prices, among others, continued to warrant caution. Moderate recovery persisted in the economies of North America and Europe. A revival was seen in Asia. Japan‚Äôs economy also continued to rally steadily. In this environment, consolidated net sales increased 5.1%, to ¬•789.4 billion, reflecting multiple factors, including firm shipments. Operating income advanced 4.2%, to ¬•56.5 billion, as increased sales of high-valueadded products and the progress of cost reductions offset the impact of rising raw materials prices, among others. Ordinary income rose 2.1%, to ¬•57.0 billion, with contributing factors including higher operating income and an improved financial position. Net income attributable to owners of the parent climbed 11.0%, to ¬•38.6 billion, owing to a decrease in extraordinary loss and other factors.

Accordingly, the aggregates of regional net sales and operating income figures for the Printing Inks segment differ from the figures presented in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Printing Inks Japan Sales of packaging inks benefited from firm shipments. Nonetheless, overall sales in Japan decreased, reflecting factors such as diminished demand for publishing inks and news inks. Operating income fell sharply, owing to the aforementioned sales results and other factors. The Americas and Europe Although demand for publishing inks and news inks waned, sales in North America were flat, with causes including higher shipments of packaging inks. In Europe, sales edged up, as firm shipments of publishing inks and packaging inks countered falling demand for news inks. Sales in Central and South America rose, buoyed by robust shipments of packaging inks. As a result, overall sales in the Americas and Europe increased. Operating income advanced, bolstered by the aforementioned sales results and rationalization measures, among others. 3 Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis Asia and Oceania While shipments of packaging inks were solid, sales in the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) decreased, hindered by factors such as flagging demand for publishing inks and news inks. In Southeast Asia, sales were pushed up by higher shipments of publishing inks and packaging inks. Sales in Oceania fell, with causes including fading demand for news inks. Sales in India increased, bolstered by brisk shipments of publishing inks and packaging inks. For these and other reasons, overall sales in Asia and Oceania rose. Operating income declined, regardless of the aforementioned sales results, a consequence of rising raw materials prices and other factors.

The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which DIC Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is incorporated. Note 2: Summary of Consolidated financial statements Significant Under the control or influence concept, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to Accounting exercise control over operations are fully consolidated and those companies over which the Company has the Policies ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its significant subsidiaries: Sun Chemical Group Co√∂peratief U.A., DIC (China) Co., Ltd., DIC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, SEIKO PMC CORPORATION, DIC INVESTMENTS JAPAN, LLC., DIC Graphics Corporation and 138 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (144 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) is eliminated. Investments in 26 affiliates in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (23 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016) are accounted for by the equity method. Accounting period of consolidated subsidiaries The closing date of the consolidated subsidiaries is the same as the consolidated closing date. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, certificates of deposit and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have insignificant risk of changes in value. Investment securities Investment securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management‚Äôs intent, into available-forsale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of net assets. Available-for-sale securities whose fair values are not readily available are carried at cost. The cost of securities sold is calculated by the moving-average method. Allowance for doubtful accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is provided based on historical experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of collectability of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. Allowance for doubtful accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is provided based on an estimate of collectability of receivables. Inventories Inventories are principally stated at cost, cost being determined by the FIFO method, which evaluates the amount of the inventories shown in the balance sheet by writing them down based on their decrease in profitability. Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Significant renewals and additions are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, and minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. Depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings) of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. Besides, depreciation of facilities 12 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016, is also calculated by the straight-line method. Other property, plant and equipment are calculated by the declining-balance method. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. The range of useful lives is principally from 8 to 50 years for buildings and structures and from 3 to 11 years for machinery, equipment and vehicles. Intangible assets (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and are amortized by the straight-line method. Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a reasonable period not exceeding 20 years. Leased assets For the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, leased assets related to finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the lease periods used as their useful lives and no residual value. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries account for lease transactions in accordance with either the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (‚ÄúU.S. GAAP‚Äù) or IFRS. Retirement and pension plans The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries account for net defined benefit asset/liability for employees‚Äô and executive officers‚Äô retirement benefits. Pension assets are deducted from retirement benefit obligations and the net amount is recognized based on the estimated amount of payment as of the balance sheet date. In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the Company applies a method of attributing expected retirement benefits to each period on a benefit formula basis. The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gain and loss in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (15 to 16 years). Past service costs are amortized in the accounting periods when they accrue. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries are accounted for in accordance with either U.S. GAAP or IFRS. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized in the succeeding year primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (9 to 28 years). Past service costs are amortized over 3 to 25 years. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized past service costs are recorded in ‚ÄúRemeasurements of defined benefit plans‚Äù in net assets after adjusting income tax effect. Asset retirement obligations The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the discounted cash flows required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period in which the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost. Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income (loss) included in the consolidated statement of income. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences. Research and development costs Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred. 13 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of translation of financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries The financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated into Japanese yen based on the following procedures: (1) Assets and liabilities of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. (2) Income and expenses are translated into Japanese yen at the average rate during the year. The differences of translation are included in foreign currency translation adjustment and non-controlling interests, which are presented as separate components of net assets. Translation of foreign currency accounts Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date and any difference arising from the translation is recognized in the consolidated statement of income if hedge accounting is not applied. Derivatives and hedging activities To hedge risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts, currency swaps, interest rate swaps, and commodity swaps. To hedge a part of the risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities, the Company uses loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Group does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transactions are classified and accounted for as follows: 1) all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income and 2) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions. Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the contracted rates if the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. If interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting and meet certain specific matching criteria, they will not be measured at market value, rather the differential paid or received under the swaps will be recognized in interest expenses or interest income. Per share information Earnings per share (basic) is computed by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares issued for the period, retroactively adjusted for stock splits. The Company implemented the consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1 with July 1, 2016, as the effective date. Earnings per share (basic) is calculated based on the assumption that the consolidation had been implemented at the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Earnings per share (diluted) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Earnings per share (diluted) assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants. Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year. Cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, comprises interim dividends of ¬•4.00 (before the consolidation) and year-end dividends of ¬•60.00 (after the consolidation). If the consolidation had been taken into consideration, cash dividends per share applicable to the period for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, would be ¬•100.00. From the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company introduced the Board Benefit Trust (BBT). The shares held by the trust are recorded under net assets as treasury shares. The number of treasury shares excluded from the number of shares issued as of the balance sheet date used for the calculation of equity per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. The number of treasury shares excluded from the weightedaverage number of shares issued during the fiscal year used for the calculation of earnings per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. 14 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3: Additional Application of Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets Information Effective from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has applied the ‚ÄúImplementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets‚Äù (ASBJ Guidance No. 26, March 28, 2016). Board Benefit Trust (BBT) With regard to the compensation for executive officers, as well as directors who concurrently serve as executive officers (the ‚ÄúTarget Officers‚Äù), the Company introduced a new performance-based stock compensation plan called Board Benefit Trust (BBT) (the ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù) from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The purpose of the Plan is to further clarify the linkage between the compensation of the Target Officers, and corporate performance and the value of the Company‚Äôs shares. The intended result is strengthening the Target Officers‚Äô awareness of their contributions to the mediumto long-term improvement of corporate performance and value. Accounting treatment related to the trust agreement is in accordance with ‚ÄúPractical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company‚Äôs Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts‚Äù (PITF No. 30, March 26, 2015). (1) Outline of the transactions The trust established under the Plan acquires the Company‚Äôs shares by cash contributed by the Company. The trust provides shares of the Company and the cash equivalent to the market price of the shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äôs Shares and Cash Benefits‚Äù) to the Target Officers, in accordance with the Rules of Officer Share Benefit established by the Company. The Target Officers shall in principle receive the Company‚Äôs Shares and Cash Benefits upon their retirement. (2) The Company‚Äôs shares remaining in the trust The shares remaining in the trust are recorded under net assets as treasury shares at the book value in the trust (excluding incidental costs).

The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: (1) Dividends Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders‚Äô meeting. For companies that meet certain criteria such as: (a) having the board of directors, (b) having independent auditors, (c) having the board of corporate auditors and (d) the term of service of the directors is prescribed as one year rather than two years of normal term by its articles of incorporation, the board of directors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends in kind (non-cash assets) to shareholders subject to a certain limitation and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¬•3 million. (2) Increases/decreases and transfer of common stocks, reserve and surplus The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders. (3) Treasury shares and treasury stock acquisition rights The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury shares and dispose of such treasury shares by resolution of the board of directors. The amount of treasury shares purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights, which were previously presented as a liability, are now presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury shares. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights. Note 12: Capital Stock The Company retired its treasury shares on January 15, 2016. In addition, the Company implemented the consolidation of shares of common stock by a factor of 10 to 1 with July 1, 2016, as the effective date. As a result, the number of authorized shares as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, are 150,000,000 shares, and the number of shares issued as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, are 95,156,904 shares. 21 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13: Treasury Shares The number of treasury shares as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, are as follows: Shares 2017 As of January 1, Increase in Decrease in As of December 31, 2017 FY2017 FY2017 2017 Treasury shares: Common stock 356,552 155,741 ‚Äî 512,293 Total 356,552 155,741 ‚Äî 512,293 Notes: 1. The increase of treasury shares of common stock (155,741 shares) was due to the purchase of odd shares (4,041 shares) and the acquisition of the Company‚Äôs shares by the Board Benefit Trust (BBT) (151,700 shares). 2. The shares held by the Board Benefit Trust (151,700 shares) are included in the number of treasury shares.

The increase of treasury shares of common stock (19,473 shares) was due to the purchase of fractional shares in connection with the consolidation of shares (2,492 shares) and the purchase of odd shares (Total 16,981 shares, 13,440 shares for before the consolidation and 3,541 shares for after the consolidation). 2. The decrease of treasury shares of common stock (16,957,672 shares) was due to the retirement of treasury shares (13,803,000 shares) and the consolidation of shares by a factor of 10 to 1 (3,154,672 shares).

As a result, net deferred tax assets decreased by ¬•7,863 million and income taxes‚Äìdeferred (debit) recognized during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, increased by ¬•7,863 million. The Company records provisional amounts for an income tax accounting effect of the Act, adopting Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, ‚ÄúIncome Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,‚Äù which allows for recording provisional amounts based on a reasonable estimate for an income tax accounting effect of the Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Note 15: Research and Research and development costs charged to income for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, Development are ¬•12,427 million and ¬•11,206 million, respectively. Costs Note 16: Leases Operating leases Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases at December 31, 2017, and 2016, are as follows: Millions of yen 2017 2016 Due within one year ¬• 2,652 ¬•2,509 Due after one year 8,270 6,576 Total ¬•10,922 ¬•9,085 23 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 17: Financial Group policy for financial instruments Instruments The Group manages funds with safe and secure financial assets. Means of financings include direct financing such as the issuance of bonds and commercial papers and liquidation of receivables, as well as indirect financing such as shortand long-term bank borrowings, the terms of which are determined based on financial market conditions and balance of account at the time. Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Receivables such as trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, some of such receivables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Investment securities, mainly the stocks of customers and suppliers, are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Payment terms of payables, such as trade notes and accounts payable, are less than one year. In addition, some of such payables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Funds needed for operations are mainly procured as short-term loans payable, whereas funds needed for capital expenditure and investment are mainly procured as long-term loans payable, bonds payable and lease obligations with regard to finance lease transactions. A part of such bank loans, bonds and lease obligations are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. Trade accounts payable and loans payable of the Company are also exposed to liquidity risk that the Company cannot meet its contractual obligations in full on maturity dates. Risk management for financial instruments The Company manages its credit risk from trade notes and accounts receivable on the basis of internal guidelines, which include the monitoring of payment terms and balances of customers by the sales and business administration departments to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. The consolidated subsidiaries of the Company manage the exposure to credit risk on their own in accordance with their internal guidelines. Investment securities are managed by monitoring market values, the financial position of issuers and considering the relationship with customers and suppliers on a regular basis. The Group also tries to mitigate liquidity risk by arranging lines of credit with financial institutions, along with adequate financial planning. Fair value of financial instruments The following tables present the carrying amounts and the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2017, and 2016.

Net debt amounts are indicated in parentheses. The valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and information on the marketable securities and derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable‚Äìtrade The fair value of cash and deposits and notes and accounts receivable‚Äìtrade approximates their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Investment securities The fair value of investment securities is measured at the quoted market price on the stock exchange. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable‚Äìtrade, short-term loans payable and income taxes payable The fair value of these accounts approximates their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Current portion of long-term loans payable and long-term loans payable For long-term loans payable bearing a floating interest rate, the fair value of those subject to special treatment of interest rate swaps are based on present value by totaling the amount of principal and interest, together with related interest rate swaps, discounted by the interest rate that would apply if equivalent long-term loans were newly entered into. The fair value of other long-term loans payable for which a floating interest rate is 25 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements applied approximates their carrying amount, due to the fact that the market rate of interest is quickly factored in while credit status of the Company remains unchanged. On the other hand, the fair value of long-term loans payable for which a fixed interest rate is applied is determined by discounting the cash flows related to the long-term loans payable. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for loans payable with similar terms and conditions. Bonds payable The fair value is measured at the quoted market prices. Lease obligations (current) and lease obligations (non-current) The fair value of these accounts is determined by discounting the cash flows related to the lease obligations. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for lease obligations with similar terms and conditions. Derivative financial instruments Please see Note 18 ‚ÄúDerivative Financial Instruments‚Äù for more information. Financial instruments whose fair value is not reliably measured There are no market prices for non-listed stocks and others (carrying amounts as of December 31, 2017, and 2016, are ¬•29,375 million and ¬•22,755 million, respectively) whose future cash flows cannot be estimated. The fair value of such non-listed stocks and others is not reliably determinable and thus is excluded from investment securities.

Instruments Foreign currency forward contracts and currency options and swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on receivables and payables or anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of interest rate changes and to reduce financing cost. Commodity swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of commodity price changes of fuel. Loans denominated in foreign currencies are entered into to hedge a part of risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities. The Group does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative transactions performed by the Group have risks due to fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and other factors. Because these transactions are executed with creditworthy financial institutions, the Group does not anticipate the likelihood of any losses resulting from default by the counterparties to these agreements. Internal regulation for managing derivative transactions has been established for the purpose of risk control in the Company, and all derivative transactions are performed under this regulation. The execution of derivative transactions is carried out by the Company‚Äôs finance department, and the management of risk is monitored by the Company‚Äôs accounting department. Transactions are periodically reported to the board of directors by the officer in charge of the Finance and Accounting Division. Consolidated subsidiaries execute transactions in accordance with their regulations for derivative management and periodically report the results of those transactions to the Company. 27 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative transactions to which hedge accounting is not applied at December 31, 2017, and 2016 (1) Currency related Millions of yen 2017 Contract/notional Contract/notional amount due after Unrealized amount one year Fair value gain/loss Currency swaps: (Note 1) (Payment in H.K.$ and receipt in U.S.$) ¬• 826 ¬•‚Äî ¬• 12 ¬• 12 Other 437 ‚Äî 4 4 Currency options: (Note 1) Selling Euro 603 ‚Äî (5) (5) Buying U.S.$ 6,578 ‚Äî (118) (118) Euro 1,124 ‚Äî 2 2 Foreign currency forward contracts: (Note 2) Selling Russian ruble 5,812 ‚Äî (39) (39) Colombian peso 1,724 ‚Äî 11 11 Canadian $ 1,586 ‚Äî (108) (108) Other 1,486 ‚Äî (24) (24) Buying U.S.$ 2,836 ‚Äî (101) (101) Other 291 ‚Äî (28) (28) Total ¬•23,303 ¬•‚Äî ¬•(394) ¬•(394) Notes: 1.

Basic framework for internal control over financial reporting Kaoru Ino, Representative Director, President and CEO, and Masayuki Saito, Representative Director, Executive Vice President and CFO of DIC Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), are responsible for designing and operating internal control over the Company‚Äôs financial reporting and have designed and operated internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the basic framework for internal control set forth in ‚ÄúOn the Revision of the Standards and Practice Standards for Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (Council Opinions),‚Äù issued by the Business Accounting Council of the Financial Services Agency of Japan. Internal control aims to achieve its objectives to a reasonable extent with the organized and integrated function of basic individual elements of internal control as a whole. Accordingly, due to the inherent limitations, there is a possibility that misstatements may not be completely prevented or detected by internal controls over financial reporting. 2. Scope of assessment, the basis date of assessment and assessment procedures The assessment of internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2017 was conducted as of December 31, 2017, which is the end of this fiscal year. The assessment was performed in accordance with relevant assessment standards generally accepted in Japan for internal control over financial reporting. In conducting this assessment, we began by evaluating internal control which may have a material impact on overall consolidated financial reporting (‚Äúcompany-level controls‚Äù) and, based on the results of this assessment, business processes to be assessed were selected. We then analyzed these selected business processes to identify key controls therein that may have a material impact on the reliability of the Company‚Äôs financial reporting, after which we examined the design and operation of these controls. These procedures thus allowed us to accurately evaluate the effectiveness of the Company‚Äôs internal control. We determined the required scope of assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates from the perspective of materiality or the degree to which it may affect the reliability of financial reporting. Materiality of the impact which may affect the reliability of financial reporting is determined based on potential quantitative and qualitative impact on financial reporting. In light of the results of assessment of company-level controls, we reasonably determined the scope of assessment of process-level controls. Consolidated subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates which were concluded as immaterial taking into account the degree of quantitative and qualitative impact are not included in the scope for assessment of company-level controls. With regard to the process-level controls, significant locations and business units to be tested were selected based on the changes in the scope of consolidation during the year, as well as on net sales for the previous year, with locations and business units the combined sales volume of which reached approximately twothirds of consolidated net sales being defined as ‚Äúsignificant.‚Äù The scope of assessment at these locations and business units encompassed business processes relevant to net sales, accounts receivable-trade, accounts payable-trade, inventories and manufacturing facilities included in property, plant and equipment as significant accounts that may have a material impact on the business objectives of the Company. In addition, business processes relating to (i) greater likelihood of material misstatements, and/or (ii) significant accounts involving estimates and management‚Äôs judgment, were also identified as business processes having greater materiality, taking into account their impact on financial reporting, and were included in the scope. 3. Results of the assessment Based on the results of the assessment, we concluded that as of the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting was effectively maintained.
