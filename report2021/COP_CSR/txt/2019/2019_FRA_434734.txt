The Group increased its production capacity to visionary entrepreneur. meet soaring demand from large industries: firstly, for oxygen in the steel industry, and secondly, for nitrogen in chemicals. 1906 The Large Industries business was launched with customers committing to long-term contracts of 15 years or more. The Group currently manages more than 9,400 km (≈ 5,800 miles) of pipelines worldwide, in particular in the US along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, from the north FIRST INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS of France to the Benelux, in the Ruhr Valley in Germany and in several Asian countries including China and Singapore. Gas, by its very nature, is difficult to transport and thus local production is required. This was one of the reasons why Air Liquide set its sights internationally early on, building numerous production units abroad. 1962 Development was rapid in Europe (1906), Japan (1907), Canada (1911) and the United States (1916). SPACE INDUSTRY 1913 Convinced of the industrial potential of cryogenics, Jean Delorme, Chairman & CEO of Air Liquide, decided to create a research center near Grenoble dedicated to these technologies. The first applications LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE were rapidly integrated in the space industry. Air Liquide has been a partner of the space adventure for 65 years.

The 11 founding companies will contribute to the development of a large-scale hydrogen infrastructure in order to build a network of 320 stations by 2025, and 900 by 2030. Today, there are about 100 stations already in operation in Japan. For its part, Air Liquide will install and operate some 20 stations by 2021. )) In March, Air Liquide inaugurated a new hydrogen station near Versailles in France. This station will fuel two hydrogen-powered buses, scheduled for rollout in 2019, and supplement the Paris hydrogen taxi fleet “Hype” which is developing rapidly. This is the third station that has been installed by Air Liquide in the Greater Paris Area. )) Air Liquide has commissioned three new biomethane production units, in the United States, in France, and in the United Kingdom in the 1st quarter 2018, doubling its biomethane production capacity, which now stands at 60 MW, the equivalent of 500 GWh for a full year of production. Over the course of the last four years, the Group has decided around 100 million euros in investments in biomethane production. The Group operates 10 production units around the world, designed to purify biogas in order to transform it into biomethane and inject it into the natural gas network. )) Early September, Air Liquide inaugurated in Hobro, Denmark, HyBalance, a pilot site for the production of carbon-free hydrogen, in the presence of the project’s partners. This facility uses electrolysis technology and allows to balance the electricity grid and store surplus electricity in the form of hydrogen that will be used in industry and transportation. The electrolyser, with a capacity of 1.2 MW, enables the production of around 500 kg of hydrogen a day without releasing CO2. As part of this project initiated in 2016, Air Liquide developed, built, and is operating the facility that produces hydrogen from water electrolysis as well as the filling center for its customers delivered by trailers. )) At the end of November, Air Liquide announced the construction of the first world scale liquid hydrogen production unit dedicated to the hydrogen energy markets, located in the Western U.S. Air Liquide expects to invest more than 150 million US dollars for the production of nearly 30 tons of hydrogen per day that will serve the growing needs of the hydrogen mobility market in California. )) At the end of January 2019, Air Liquide announced that it acquired an 18.6% stake in the capital of the Canadian company Hydrogenics Corporation, a leader in electrolysis hydrogen production equipment and fuel cells. This strategic transaction represents an investment of 20.5 million US dollars (18 million euros). Air Liquide and Hydrogenics have also entered into a technology and commercial agreement to jointly develop electrolysis technologies.

Overall, efficiency has increased by 1%, representing 21% of the target to be achieved in 2025. A new remote operations center in South-East Asia One year after the launch of its first remote operation center in France, Air Liquide inaugurated in 2018 its Smart Innovative Operations (SIO) Center for the South-East Asia Pacific region, located in Malaysia. The SIO Center enables the remote management of the production for 18 Air Liquide Large Industries units spanning eight countries across the region. Through big data combined with the Group’s expertise, the workflow of each Air Liquide production unit linked to the SIO Center is adapted in real time to the needs of each customer. The SIO Center enables 24/7 responsiveness to customer demand and improves the energy efficiency of our assets, by leveraging predictive maintenance to ensure continuous supply. Reducing the carbon footprint of its bulk and cylinder the efficiency of industrial gases transportation continues to improve.

Thanks to its essential molecules management (oxygen, hydrogen, CO2, etc.) and its in-depth knowledge of its customers’ processes, Air Liquide offers technologies which allow its customers to improve the energy efficiency of their industrial processes and reduce their emissions. Air Liquide has identified two key levers to reach this objective: Rolling out low-carbon offerings and solutions Air Liquide provides its customers with the possibility of outsourcing some of their processes in order to pool assets and thus reduce the amount of energy used by up to 20%. Air Liquide starts up the world’s largest oxygen production unit in South Africa In 2018, Air Liquide started up in South Africa the world’s largest oxygen production unit for its customer Sasol, an international integrated energy and chemicals company. Owned and operated by Air Liquide, it is the first time that Sasol had chosen to outsource its oxygen needs at this site to an industrial gas production specialist. This outsourcing decision confirms Sasol’s trust in Air Liquide’s technological expertise and ability to innovate. The new unit, with a total production capacity of more than 5,000 tons of oxygen per day, was designed and built by Air Liquide’s Engineering & Construction teams using proprietary technologies, including several air compression process innovations. It allows Sasol to decrease its annual electricity consumption by more than 20% and contributes to reducing its carbon footprint by 200,000 tons of CO2 each year. The Group is also developing offerings which will reduce transport-related emissions, in particular through on-site production and new generation cylinders which are 40% lighter than those made of steel. Through its promotion of oxy-combustion technology, Air Liquide has already helped its customers to avoid more than 10.7 Mt of CO2 emissions in 2018. Co-developing innovative procedures with its customers Air Liquide is working in partnership with its customers to introduce new solutions that will reduce the environmental footprint in various business areas: )) either by reducing, where possible, customers’ CO2 emissions; )) or by capturing CO2 to give it a second life (CCU (a) – Industrial Merchant business and Large Industries customers) or by storing it permanently (CCS (b) – storage in old offshore natural gas reserves, for example). A new range of advanced etching materials: enScribe™ Semi-conductor manufacturers must meet growing needs for data storage capacity with the quantity of data being 300 times greater today than it was 10 years ago, while at the same time, components have reached nanometric scale. In this new environment, balancing compactness and performance represents an ongoing challenge. To support its customers in this goal, Air Liquide has developed enScribe™, a new family of advanced etching materials. Designed for the 3D construction of a new generation of memory chip, the innovative materials of enScribe™ are capable of etching the new chip structures very deeply. Moreover, due to their chemical structure, they have a lower lifespan in the atmosphere, thus helping to reduce the impact of the etching process on the environment. Its products are designed to reduce the Global Warming Potential (GWP) impact that is typically associated with most gases currently used in etching processes. Its use, for a single customer, has already reduced the global emissions of the semi-conductor industry by 1% , which represent 117,000 tons of CO2-eq. per year. (a) Carbon Capture & Usage.

With ecosystems, via an active dialog with key players (public authorities, These applications represent more than 40% of Group revenue for 2018. industrial partners, NGOs, etc.), Air Liquide is contributing to the development of a low-carbon society. Air Liquide has identified four key levers to reach this objective: Expanding the circular economy (a) Air Liquide currently owns around 10 biomethane production units and some 60 charging stations. Through the construction of new biomethane units, the Group contributes to the purification of biogas, in particular in Europe and the United States. For further information, please refer to page 82. For road freight transport, the use of biomethane reduces fine particles emissions by 85%, CO2 emissions by 90% and noise emissions by 50% compared with diesel. The use of biomethane is growing and diversifying into the industrial and transport sectors by using new efficient and environmentally-friendly applications. In 2018, this use has made it possible to avoid 84,000 tons of CO2 emissions. Pot-au-Pin Énergie initiative in Cestas Planète Végétal – a carrot and leek farmer operator – and Air Liquide have joined forces to create Pot-au-Pin Énergie to valorize biomass from the farm to produce biomethane. At the end of the process, the biomethane is injected into the natural gas distribution network, which supplies Air Liquide’s multi-energy station in Cestas, located 3 km from the production site. This station distributes biomethane (bio-NGV), an alternative to fossil fuels, to Casino Group carriers. The Pot-au-Pin Énergie initiative shows that the biomethane value chain contributes to the development of the circular economy by bringing together local players who are working together to make the energy transition happen. Facilitating clean refrigerated transport Refrigerated transport is changing and cryogenic technologies are at the forefront of this change. The use of molecules for cryogenics in refrigerated transport helps reduce noise emissions and improve the carbon assessment of vehicles. Air Liquide’s expertise in cryogenics has led to the development of Blueeze™, an innovative solution (based on liquid nitrogen) for refrigerated transport by truck, and Cryocity™ (based on CO2), aimed at inter-urban delivery and reducing air and sound pollution. Promoting hydrogen for clean mobility Air Liquide is investing in low-carbon hydrogen production assets as well as in a distribution network for hydrogen mobility. To date, Air Liquide has installed more than 120 stations worldwide. First large liquid hydrogen production unit Air Liquide announced the construction of the first large liquid hydrogen production unit dedicated to the hydrogen energy markets in the Western United States. The Group has also signed a long-term contract with First Element Fuel Inc. (FEF), a major player in hydrogen distribution in California, to supply hydrogen to its network of stations in California. The plant will have a production capacity of nearly 30 tons of hydrogen per day — an amount that can fuel 35,000 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs). Through this investment of more than 150 million US dollars, Air Liquide will contribute to the large-scale rollout of hydrogen mobility on the West Coast of the United States. (a) Even if the fight against food waste is not a subject considered a priority by Air Liquide because of its industrial activity, the circular economy initiatives participate in the fight against this food waste. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 75 1 Integrated Management report Performance Creating a global hydrogen economy play a major role in the storage of surplus energy in markets dominated by renewable energies.

The increase in indirect emissions between 2017 and 2018 is linked to the start-up of large units, including the world’s largest ASU in South Africa. The emissions of these new units are offset by the improvement in the overall efficiency of ASU units. Avoided emissions by customers this year include 0.2 million tonnes from the consumption of biomethane produced by Air Liquide or the use of enScribe™ molecules (Electronics market). In addition, 3.5 Mt of CO2 were purified and supplied to customers by Air Liquide in 2018 for use in various applications such as greenhouses or the food industry. Finally, most of the hydrogen produced is used to remove sulphur from fuels and thus avoid the emission of 1.6 Mt of SOx. (a) Includes 0.2 Mt CO2-eq. due to the Group’s other activities. 5.3.

Shareholders’ trust and loyalty are key to Air Liquide’s growth. For more than a century, the Group has been dedicated to involving them in its growth and has fostered a long-term relationship based on transparency, dialog and proximity. At the end of 2018, more than 410,000 individual shareholders of the Group owned 32% of the capital, the highest percentage among companies in the CAC 40. Meeting with shareholders The Shareholders’ Meeting: The 2018 Shareholders’ Meeting welcomed 3,569 people and almost 130,000 votes are counted each year. The dates for the next Air Liquide Combined Shareholders’ Meeting are Tuesday May 7, 2019; Tuesday May 5, 2020; and Tuesday May 4, 2021. “Post-Shareholders’ Meeting” conferences: the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer visits several towns and cities in France to present the Group’s results, strategy and outlook. Conferences and trade shows: the Director of Shareholder Services and his teams regularly meet with shareholders. Talks at business schools, universities and colleges are also organized, so that the future generations have an early awareness of the culture of the stock market and of the major role of the shareholder in financing the economy. Institutional investors The Investor Relations team met with more than 600 investors in 2018 during 18 roadshows, 22 conferences and many individual meetings. Members of the Executive Committee took part in some of these events. In 2018, these roadshows and conferences were held in Europe, notably in London, Paris and Frankfurt, and in North America, primarily in New York, Boston and Los Angeles. These meetings provided the opportunity to discuss subjects related to strategy and performance, Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) and corporate governance with investors. On November 30, 2018, an event was organized in Paris during which Air Liquide announced its Climate objectives. Initiatives in favor of the climate: TCFD and SBTi The Group believes that the major challenges facing our society can be met through active dialog. For this reason, it has been an active member of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures), a task force which brings together institutional investors, audit firms and listed companies with the aim of developing recommendations for voluntary disclosures regarding financial risks linked to climate change. The TCFD’s recommendations were published in July 2017. Today, like all European companies, the Air Liquide Group applies the European Directive on extra-financial reporting for the publication of information corresponding to 2018. This directive includes all of the recommendation made by the TCFD, except for the financial forecast for climate-related measures. Although the Group believes that improved reporting on climate-related opportunities and risks may be of significant help in responding to global climate change challenges, it also believes that these recommendations must be implemented in a fair manner in a global competitive environment in order to be efficient. In the same spirit of dialog and openness, and driven by its Climate objectives, announced in November 2018, the Group is working towards taking part in the Science Based Targets (SBTi) initiative. SBT is a certification created by a coalition of players committed to environmental issues. It is used by companies to validate GHG emission reduction objectives in line with the 2°C average temperature rise scenario. However, for the moment, there is no sector approach that is specific to the Group’s businesses, which main characteristic is to serve a wide range of economic sectors. Moreover, SBT’s current methodology does not take into account avoided emissions, which is one of Air Liquide’s major commitments for reducing emissions beyond its own businesses. Air Liquide will continue its efforts and discussions with the SBT initiative to better value its actions in favor of the climate. 78 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Integrated Management report Performance 1 Employee shareholders management of the Group’s strategic accounts, commercial excellence and the sharing of best practices across regions and the Group’s The Group wishes to continue increasing the involvement of its various business sectors. employees at the global level in its development by encouraging them to play a greater role in the capital of L’ Air Liquide S.A.

(pursuant to article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code) This section describes the remuneration and the benefits granted to the corporate officers during the 2018 fiscal year in accordance with article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code and the remuneration structure adopted for the 2019 fiscal year as approved by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019. To determine all the components of the remuneration for the Executive Officers, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance. Taking account of several external studies, the Board of Directors adopts a remuneration policy which provides strong incentives for the Executive Officers and is related to the steady operating performance which the shareholders expect from Air Liquide over time. This remuneration policy includes incentive elements reflecting the Group’s strategy which is steered toward profitable long-term growth, while acting responsibly with regard to all stakeholders. In a highly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every transaction, while maintaining an ongoing effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee training and development, together with the environment. In this context, the elements taken into account for the determination of the remuneration are as follows: )) a short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration; )) a long-term incentive (hereinafter the “LTI”) through the grant of share subscription options and performance shares, both tools being subject in full to the same performance conditions calculated over three years; )) other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officers’ terms of office, including: −− a defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible senior managers and Executive Officers, subject to performance conditions for Benoît Potier since May 16, 2018 (the date of renewal of his term of office), −− a collective life insurance plan, −− a death and disability benefits plan, −− commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company’s initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period, −− entitlement to unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group. A full description of all these components of remuneration is set out below, and, when such commitments are subject to the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, they are also described in the Statutory Auditors’ Special Report on pages 327 et seq. In accordance with the AFEP/ MEDEF Code, the remuneration components of the Executive Officers are made public after the Board meeting during which they are approved. The information included in this document takes into account the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance for listed companies, as interpreted by the Haut Comité de Gouvernement d’Entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) (Application guide for the AFEP/MEDEF Code; Activity report of the Haut Comité de Gouvernement d’Entreprise in October 2018) and the AMF’s recommendations included in the Guide on the preparation of reference documents and the AMF Report on corporate governance and the remuneration of Executive Officers of listed companies dated November 26, 2018. For a summary of the application of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, see the summary table in the Report on corporate governance, at page 112 of this Reference Document. Pursuant to article L. 225-100 II of the French Commercial Code, the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019 is invited to decide upon the elements which make up the total remuneration and the benefits of all kinds paid or granted to each Executive Officer in respect of 2018 (see the tables at pages 150 et seq. below). Furthermore, in accordance with article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code, the principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and allocation of the fixed, variable and exceptional elements of the total remuneration and the benefits of all kinds that may be granted to the Executive Officers, as described in the presentation contained at pages 156 et seq., are subject to the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 125 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 1.

This policy is in line with the policy introduced in 2017, after the acquisition of Airgas, which was a major, transforming event for the Group. It reflects the increased level of responsibility of the Group’s senior executive and is adapted to the Group’s new context, remains competitive and is an incentive to promote the Group’s performance over the medium to long-term, in compliance with the Company’s interests and the interests of all the stakeholders. The principal elements of this policy are as follows: )) in accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the LTI 40% of the total annual remuneration. Accordingly, the weight of the variable remuneration and the LTI, which are subject to performance conditions, represents approximately 75% of this remuneration; )) the variable part is expressed as a target variable remuneration and as a maximum (as a % of the fixed remuneration). For the quantifiable criteria, the target variable remuneration corresponds to an achievement of 100% of the target objective set at the start of the year. The fixed target objectives are demanding and are completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program; )) a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria. There were three quantifiable criteria for 2018, including ROCE and revenue, which are some of the strategic objectives in the NEOS plan; )) a weighting is now given to each of the qualitative criteria in order to meet the expectations of certain shareholders. With regard to the LTI, following remarks made by certain shareholders, the Board now applies the principle of proration on the basis of actual presence at the Group for any Executive Officer, in the event of a departure (a) between the initial allocation and the expiry of the period of assessment of the performance conditions. As before, no allocation is granted in the year of departure. In the Group’s new context following the acquisition of Airgas, it had also been decided to reposition the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2017/2018, subject to a good performance, a successful integration of Airgas and the achievement of the Airgas synergies in line with the forecasts for the end of 2017. Since the conditions for this repositioning have been achieved, in accordance with the principles approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting, the total annual target remuneration for 2018 has increased by +5.2% as compared to 2017. As announced, this repositioning is now finalized. The elements of Benoît Potier’s remuneration in respect of 2018, as determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the principles and criteria approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018, are described below. (a) A departure for reasons other than a resignation or removal from office for serious cause which continue to result in the loss of the LTI. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 127 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2.1.

Benoît Potier receives all of his remuneration for his corporate office. (b) During 2018, the Group paid contributions to third parties, for the benefit of Benoît Potier, pursuant to the supplementary defined contribution pension plan (9,500 euros), pursuant to the collective life insurance contract (211,831 euros) and pursuant to the collective death and disability benefit plan (4,673 euros). The total sum of these contributions amounts to 226,003 euros. These plans are described in further detail below. 2.1.1. Fixed remuneration for 2018 In accordance with the principles and criteria determined by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018, the fixed remuneration was determined taking account of the level of responsibilities, the experience in executive management function and market practices. The amount of the fixed remuneration for the Executive Officer is shown in the following table. Over the last five years, this fixed remuneration has undergone an average annual increase of +3.8% (see the graph on page 126). 2017/2018 (in thousands of euros) 2017 2018 change Benoît Potier 1,275 1,325 +3.9% 2.1.2. Variable remuneration for 2018 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer The principles and criteria for the variable remuneration, as decided upon by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 were approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 (13th resolution). The Board of Directors on February 13, 2019 assessed the performance of the Executive Officer in 2018. The criteria for the variable remuneration, their weighting and their rate of achievement are detailed in the following summary table (see page 131). A. (Quantifiable) financial criteria The variable remuneration for 2018 is based on three financial criteria: increase in recurring earnings per share (hereinafter “recurring EPS”), Return on Capital Employed after tax (hereinafter “ROCE”), growth in consolidated revenue. These criteria are detailed in the following summary table (page 131). The increase in EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of the ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the return on capital employed, is relevant for a highly capital-intensive industry. The criterion of an increase in sales reflects the momentum in the activity. These three criteria – revenue, EPS and ROCE – reflect the balance achieved each year between profitable growth and return on investment. The criteria of ROCE and growth in revenue are part of the four objectives in the NEOS strategic plan. 128 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 For each criterion, the Board of Directors of February 14, 2018 had defined a target objective. The objectives were exacting and were completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program which targets, for the period 2016-2020, an average annualized growth in Group revenue of +6% to +8% (including a scope impact linked to the consolidation of Airgas corresponding to +2% as an annualized average) and a return on capital employed (ROCE) of more than 10% in 2021-2022. For each financial criterion, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable remuneration is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero. The objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion) is communicated in the summary table below (page 131). The results for 2018 were above the target for the recurring EPS and revenue criteria and slightly below the target for the ROCE (see summary table on page 131). B. (Qualitative) personal criteria The variable remuneration for 2018 is also based on the following (qualitative) personal criteria: )) Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter “CSR”) −− Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety in terms of the lost time accident frequency rate and vigilance concerning the prevention of road traffic and business related accidents, −− Deployment of the Corporate Sustainability Program – Definition and communication of the CSR objectives for the Group, in line with the NEOS Program; )) Organization/Human Resources: continuation of the policy to develop talent, in particular for the advancement of young managers – Organization of future succession plans; )) Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors’ desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board’s assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated. A weighting is now given to each of the (qualitative) personal criteria, as detailed in the summary table below (page 131). A target and a maximum weight is set for each of them. For 2018, the performance, concerning the (qualitative) personal objectives, was held to be excellent. The Board of Directors noted the following elements: CSR criteria: )) Safety and reliability: With regard to safety, 2018 is a somewhat paradoxical year, with: −− a historically low lost time accident frequency rate of 1.29 compared to an average of 1.63 over the last five years. This indicator has dropped significantly; −− unfortunately, several fatal accidents, with three deaths from among Air Liquide’s employees and five at subcontractors. They have been analyzed in detail at the Group’s Executive Committee meetings: special preventative measures have been implemented during the course of the year with regard to road traffic risks, which remain the principal cause of accidents, in particular those which resulted in fatal accidents. Action plans have been rolled out in the relevant operations and geographical areas and an awareness campaign has been carried out throughout the whole Group. Concerning reliability, the Group’s IMS (Industrial Management System) program which was implemented over 10 years ago has profoundly changed the way of working, and has consolidated the management processes for safety, reliability, environmental protection and industrial risk control. Based on the experience acquired, a project was launched in 2018 to adapt the IMS, in order to improve its efficiency and its implementation at all Group entities. )) Corporate Sustainability Program: The Environment and Society Committee, formed in 2017, met on three occasions in 2018 and continued its work and recommendations concerning, in particular, the Climate objectives which were published on November 30, 2018, the Group’s sustainable development issues, the assessment of the environmental and societal risks and the review of the vigilance plan. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 129 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. Air Liquide has for many years been dedicated to an approach designed to foster responsible growth, aiming in particular to limit its CO2 emissions and those of its customers. Air Liquide announced its Climate objectives on November 30, 2018, including in particular the reduction of its carbon intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach including its assets, customers and the ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector and are in line with the NEOS company program. This announcement was the theme for an investor day and the subject of global communication at the Group. A campaign has been launched to roll out the objectives in operations. Benoît Potier is co-Chairman of the Hydrogen Council. This Council, formed in 2017, brings together more than 50 leaders in the energy, transport and industry sectors to promote hydrogen in order to achieve the climate change objectives, and held, for the first time, a meeting in China. Organization and Human Resources : The talent development policy has been pursued. Regular reviews of talent, at the level of operating clusters (groups of countries) and up to the highest level of the Company, have led to a certain number of moves. These reviews have also been implemented at Airgas, where the roll-out of the Group’s processes and policies is continuing. The succession plans for the Company’s key positions have also been reviewed. Dedicated reviews with the Executive Committee and the Appointments and Governance Committee have taken place regarding talent with the greatest potential. Diversity objectives for 2025 (at both Group and entity levels) have been defined and shared (the proportion of women and of different nationalities in “Executive” positions, the gender mix of teams, etc.), together with objectives to hire young graduates, which is a key factor in the creation of talent pools. The development program for technical talent, TCL (Technical Career Leaders), also received particular attention in 2018 with the appointment of two Senior Fellows (the highest form of recognition on the program), of leading international experts from the Airgas teams and an improvement in the gender mix with the appointment of the first female Fellow. This program is an essential factor for innovation, and makes a significant contribution over the long term to ensuring the Group’s reliability and safety. In parallel to NEOS Customer Experience program, a program has been launched which focuses on employees’ responsiveness and commitment. Individual performance : Individual performance was considered to be excellent. The Group’s results are very good in an uncertain economic and geopolitical context. As regards the acquisition of Airgas, the synergies are more than one year ahead of schedule. Moreover, following the acquisition, it can be noted in Airgas teams the expression of a strong feeling that they belonged to the Group and that their career prospects had expanded. Furthermore, Benoît Potier’s strong personal commitment to the development of the Hydrogen Energy business was noted. 130 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 SUMMARY TABLE OF THE VARIABLE REMUNERATION FOR 2018 Target (a) Maximum Rate of achievement (e) As a % As a % As a % As a % As a % of the target As a % As a % of the fixed based of the fixed based remuneration of the fixed based Indicator Measure remuneration on 100 remuneration on 100 for this criterion remuneration on 100 Financial criteria (quantifiable) including: 105 70 122 73 108.6 71.8 Recurring earnings Increase in recurring EPS 40 26.7 47 28.1 113.1 45.2 30 per share (recurring EPS) (b) Return on capital Value (d) 45 30 52 31.1 94 42.3 28 employed, after tax (ROCE) Revenue (c) Comparable growth in 20 13.3 23 13.8 105.5 21.1 14 consolidated revenue Personal criteria (qualitative) including: 45 30 45 27 42.8 28.2 CSR nn Safety and reliability: 15 10 15 9 90 13.5 9 continue efforts to improve safety in terms of the lost time accident frequency rate and vigilance concerning the prevention of road traffic and business-related accidents nn Deployment of the Corporate Sustainability Program – Definition and communication of the CSR objectives for the Group, in line with the NEOS company program Organization / Continuation of the policy to 15 10 15 9 95 14.3 9 Human Resources develop talent, in particular for the advancement of young managers – Organization of future succession plans Individual Assessment by the Board of 15 10 15 9 100 15 10 performance Directors, in light in particular of the external environment for the year TOTAL (FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL CRITERIA) 150 100 167 100 151 100 (a) The target corresponds to 100% achievement of the performance criterion.

Total fixed and variable remuneration – Changes Benoît Potier’s total fixed and variable remuneration for 2018 is up by +3.3% as compared to 2017. This variation reflects the last phase of the repositioning of the target remuneration in 2017-2018 in the Group’s new context following the acquisition of Airgas, this repositioning being finalized in 2018. As an annualized average, Benoît Potier’s fixed and variable remuneration has increased by +6.6% over 3 years, by +5.1% over 5 years and by +2.9% over 10 years. 2.1.4. Other elements of annual remuneration for 2018 The benefits in kind paid for the benefit of the Executive Officer in 2018 include the use of a company car and the contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. In addition, the Group paid to third parties, for Benoît Potier, the contributions to the supplementary defined contribution pension plan, to the Group life insurance plan and the additional death and disability benefits plan. The amount of these contributions is stated in the footnotes to Table 2 (page 128). 2.2. STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES 2.2.1. 2018 stock option and performance share plans A. Principles of grant for 2018 For the Executive Officer, the grant for 2018 forms part of the 2018 remuneration policy defined by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 (Cf. policy described on page 127). In such circumstances, it had been agreed by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 that the grant of stock options/performance shares to Benoît Potier in 2018 would represent an IFRS value of approximately 2,250 thousand euros, an increase of +7.14% as compared to 2017. B. Performance conditions of the 2018 Plans All the stock options and performance shares granted to any beneficiary are subject to performance conditions which apply to both the stock option and performance share plans and are calculated over three years. The performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in the autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years. For reasons of confidentiality, the exact objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post, at the end of the Board of Directors’ meeting in February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance must be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of stock options that vest/performance shares definitively awarded are also published at the end of this Board meeting. The performance conditions applicable to the stock option and performance share plans implemented in 2018 were adopted by the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018. Accordingly, the number of stock options which can be exercised out of the total number of options which will be allocated, together with the number of performance shares definitively awarded pursuant to the 2018 Plans will depend: (i) for 65% of the stock options/performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the average annual rates of growth in Group undiluted net earnings per share, excluding foreign exchange impact and significant exceptional items (“Recurring EPS”) for the fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, and then decreases on a straight-line basis to zero, if there is no growth in the EPS. This objective has been set, as for the 2017 Plans, at a level of growth included within the bracket of +6% to +10% per year. The exact objective will be communicated ex post; 132 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 (ii) for 35% of the stock options/performance shares granted, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of total shareholder return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020 (“AL TSR”). The objective of absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of total shareholder return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends – sourced from Bloomberg (“B TSR”), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2020 fiscal year. The result achieved and the percentage of performance shares awarded/stock options which can be exercised will also be communicated.

Rules specific to the Executive Officers The grant to the Executive Officers is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted at pre-established periods in the autumn, in the form of share subscription options granted without any discount, and performance shares. The grant of stock options and performance shares is examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer’s annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the shareholders are respected. Every year, before the grant of stock options and performance shares, it is verified that the conditions provided for in articles L. 225-186-1 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code aimed at involving all the staff in France in the Company’s performance are satisfied. In 2018, all the Company’s employees and 99% of the employees in the Group’s French entities are covered by an incentive plan or a special or voluntary profit-sharing plan. Limits on grants to the Executive Officers Within the scope of the sub-limits authorized for 38 months (a) by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code. The limits set by the Board of Directors for 2018 are identical to those for 2017 and are as follows: (i) the total number of performance shares granted to the sole Executive Officer in 2018 cannot give rise to a number of shares in excess of 0.012% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.15% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016); (ii) the total number of stock options granted to the sole Executive Officer in 2018 cannot give rise to a number of shares in excess of 0.035% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.3% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016); (iii) the maximum aggregate IFRS value of the stock options and performance shares granted to the Executive Officer cannot exceed (all 2018 stock option and performance share plans combined) approximately 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer’s maximum gross annual remuneration (fixed + variable maximum), it being noted that the stock options and performance shares granted represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration. (a) Last authorized by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016 (18th and 19th resolutions). 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 133 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. Implementation of the proration principle Pursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 14, 2018, the 2018 grant of LTI to the Executive Officer is subject to the principle of a pro rata calculation. In practice, if the Executive Officer leaves for a reason other than his resignation or removal from office for serious cause (a), the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata the number of months’ actual presence of the Executive Officer at the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. The Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted. Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer in the year of his departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code. Shareholding and share ownership obligations Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares respectively as from September 28, 2015, as follows: For each stock option/performance share plan granted to the Executive Officers with effect from September 28, 2015, the Executive Officers shall hold, in registered form, until the termination of their duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares. However, this percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Executive Officer resulting from the exercise of stock options or the definitive award of performance shares (all plans combined since the 2007 plan for Benoît Potier) represents a minimum amount equal to at least three times the Executive Officer’s gross annual fixed remuneration. This rule is regularly reviewed by the Board at the time of each grant. In 2018, the Board of Directors decided to maintain this rule in identical form. The previous obligations to hold shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, decided by the Board of Directors on May 9, 2007, which apply with effect from the grant of stock options on May 9, 2007 for Benoît Potier, remain in force with regard to the relevant stock options plans, up until the September 22, 2014 stock option plan inclusive. It was reported to the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019 that this rule was applied with regard to the exercise of options pursuant to the 2010 stock option plan. Additional shareholding obligation – Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code In addition, the internal rule defined by the Board of Directors since 2008 remains in effect, pursuant to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold, in a registered share account, a number of shares equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration and one time the gross annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President. This obligation will remain in force, until it is exceeded by the effect of the aforementioned rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. The Board noted that the valuation of the shares held as at January 1 and July 1, 2018 and as at January 1, 2019 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was much greater than the amounts required and concluded that the shareholding obligation was complied with by the Executive Officer. Recommendations encouraging the ownership of a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to 0.5 times their gross fixed annual remuneration, have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009. Other rules applicable to the Executive Officers )) Obligations regarding the restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the “black-out periods” prior to the publication of the financial statements, as defined by the Company. These abstention periods open 30 days before the date of publication of the annual and half-yearly consolidated results and 15 days before the date of publication of the financial information relating to the 1st and 3rd quarters. They end on the date of publication of the information at close of business. )) Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning stock options/shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and concerning the performance shares awarded, throughout the length of their term of office.

See pages 167 and 171. 2.2.3. Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the November 29, 2016 stock option and performance share plans (Annual plans) The Board of Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A., at its meeting on November 29, 2016, decided the annual performance share and stock option plans for 2016. On the basis of the financial statements adopted for the 2018 fiscal year submitted for the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019, the Board of Directors recorded, at its meeting on February 13, 2019, the rate of achievement of the performance conditions which apply to all the stock options and performance shares awarded to any beneficiary under the November 29, 2016 stock option and performance share plans. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 137 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. The annual 2016 plans provided that the number of stock options which could effectively be exercised in respect of the total number of stock options granted, together with the number of performance shares definitively awarded, would depend on the rate of achievement of the following objectives: (i) for 65% of the stock options/performance shares granted, an objective of the average of the annual rate of growth in the Recurring EPS excluding the impact of foreign exchange and exceptional items for the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 set at +8% (a) in order to be able to exercise all the stock options and (b) in order for all the shares to be awarded, and then decreasing on a straight-line basis to 0% growth. In order to take account of the impact of the Airgas acquisition and its financing, the following principle had been adopted: −− to calculate the Recurring EPS on the basis of 2016 pro forma financial statements, making it possible to take into account comparable data for the periods concerned (2016, 2017, 2018), −− to increase the objective of the average of the annual rate of growth over this period. This objective, which was previously +5% per year, had thus been set at a level of growth included within the bracket of +6% to +10% per year, i.e. +8%. The Board of Directors recorded that the average of the annual rate of growth of the recurring EPS over the aforementioned period amounted to +8.05%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 100%; (ii) for 35% of the stock options/performance shares granted, an objective of shareholder return: −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): an objective defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares for the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 (“AL TSR”), set at 8% (a) in order to be able to exercise all the stock options and (b) in order for all the shares to be awarded, and then decreasing on a straight-line basis to 4%. The Board of Directors recorded that this growth, over the aforementioned period, amounted to 5.6% per annum, i.e. an objective achieved as to 40%, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): the rate of total shareholder return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends – sourced from Bloomberg (“B TSR”), as compared to a reference index made up: -as to half by the CAC 40 index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), and -as to half by the total shareholder return of the companies in the industrial gas sector – Peers, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), -in respect of the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The objective with regard to the relative part of TSR was based on the average of the two indexes. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions was 0% if Air Liquide TSR was lower than the average of the two indexes, 50% if it was equal to the average of the two indexes and 100% if it was more than 3% higher than the average of the two indexes, on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the two indexes was impossible. The rate of return for Air Liquide over the aforementioned period is 8.33%. That of the CAC 40 index over the same period is 4.4% and that of the companies in the business sector amounts to 10.8%. Consequently, the difference between the rate of return for Air Liquide and the average rate of return for the CAC 40 and Peers indices amounts to 0.73%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 62.13%. Accordingly, the Board of Directors recorded that the rate of achievement of the performance conditions for the November 29, 2016 stock option plan and the November 29, 2016 share performance plan amounts to 82.87%. For further details on the definitive award to Benoît Potier, see table on pages 167 and 171 of this Reference Document. 2.2.4. Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the July 29, 2016 performance share plans (Airgas Plans) The Board of Directors, at its meeting on July 29, 2016, decided to make a specific grant of performance shares intended to show the Company’s recognition for the work carried out by all the teams who contributed to the successful completion of the Airgas acquisition. For each of these “Airgas” Plans (“France” Plan and “World” Plan), the Board adopted performance conditions calculated over three fiscal years and identical to those used for the November 29, 2016 stock option and performance share plans (see description above). On the basis of the financial statements for the 2018 fiscal year submitted for the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of May 7, 2019, the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019 recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions, which apply to the whole of the performance shares granted to any beneficiary and which were determined at the time of the grant of the July 29, 2016 Airgas performance share plans. This rate amounts to 82.87%. Pursuant to the decision of the Board of Directors on July 27, 2017, specifically for Benoît Potier, an additional performance condition was added, based on the rate of achievement of the synergies after the Airgas acquisition. The Board meeting which will approve the 2019 financial statements will assess the level of performance achieved for this additional condition. 138 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 3. 2019: Total annual remuneration (fixed remuneration, variable remuneration, LTI) of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 3.1. REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO THE CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER The remuneration policy which applies to Benoît Potier was determined by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, in accordance with the principles approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meetings on May 3, 2017 and May 16, 2018. It is adapted to the Group’s context, remains competitive and incorporates incentives which reflect the Group’s strategy which is steered towards long-term, profitable growth while acting responsibly in compliance with the Company’s interests and the interests of all the stakeholders. It is noted that, in 2017, a decision had been made to progressively change the remuneration policy for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in order to reflect the increased level of the Executive Officer’s responsibility following the Group’s change in size linked to the acquisition of Airgas. Since this repositioning was completed in 2018, the Board of Directors decided to maintain the fixed remuneration for 2019 at the same level as for 2018 and thus to stabilize the level of the total target annual remuneration. In this context, the structure of the total annual remuneration for 2019 is in line with that for previous fiscal years, some improvements having been made following remarks from shareholders. This structure is as follows: )) A proportionate balance between the three remuneration components (fixed, variable and elements of long-term motivation or “LTI”) so that, in accordance with recurring practice at Air Liquide: −− the weight of the variable remuneration and the LTI, which are subject to performance conditions, continues to represent approximately 75% of the total annual remuneration; −− as part of the balance between the aforementioned three components, a slightly greater weight continues to be given to the LTI. Accordingly, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the LTI 40% of the total remuneration. )) Criteria for the variable remuneration and the LTI: taking into account remarks made by shareholders, the Board decided, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, to change the performance criteria to which these two remuneration tools are subject with effect from 2019. Accordingly, the EPS criterion will henceforth only be taken into account in one remuneration tool: it remains a criterion for the annual variable remuneration, but is no longer included in the performance criteria for the LTI. Furthermore, the ROCE becomes a criterion for the long term remuneration (LTI) as a replacement for the EPS. The revenue criterion is maintained as a criterion for the variable remuneration. )) Upper limits on the grant of LTI to the Executive Officers: the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019 is asked to decide upon the renewal of the authorizations for the grant of stock options and performance shares (see draft resolutions 13 and 14, at pages 322 et seq.). At this time and following remarks from shareholders, the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders’ Meeting reduce by one-third each of the sub-limits on the grants to the Executive Officers submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in order to bring them closer to the historical levels of grants by the Board. Consequently, subject to the approval of the resolutions by the Shareholders’ Meeting, the number of stock options granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital (instead of 0.3% previously) and the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital (instead of 0.15% previously). As before, the Board of Directors also sets annual grant limits, which remain significantly below these sub-limits, it being noted that, as stated above, the LTI must represent approximately 40% of the Executive Officer’s annual remuneration. )) The other principles which apply to the annual variable remuneration are unchanged. Accordingly: −− the variable part continues to be expressed as a target variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) with a maximum. The total target variable remuneration represents approximately 90% of the total maximum variable remuneration, for a very good performance. Consequently, for a fixed remuneration of 100, the target is 150% and the maximum is 167%; −− concerning the weighting of the various criteria adopted (see table below): -a greater relative weight is still given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria, -Quantifiable criteria: as before, each quantifiable criterion is given a target weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set at the start of the year, and a maximum weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration), -Qualitative criteria: • as in 2018, in order to meet shareholder expectations, a weighting is given to each of the qualitative criteria, • the qualitative criteria continue to be based, as to two-thirds, on three to four categories or sub-categories of objectives which are defined each year and, as to one-third, on an assessment of the individual performance; 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 139 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. • the target weighting and the maximum weighting are communicated ex ante; the actual weight of each criterion in determining the variable remuneration due in respect of the fiscal year shall be established in accordance with the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective, based on applying a formula for the financial criteria and on the assessment of the Executive Officer’s performance by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria. The rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration, expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration for this criterion, will be communicated ex post. )) Finally, the other principles which apply to the LTI are also unchanged (the proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer’s departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, the level of requirement of the objectives, the rules which are specific to the Executive Officers as described in paragraph 3.2.3 – C). 3.2. IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE 2019 REMUNERATION Applying the principles and objectives noted above, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 13, 2019, adopted the components of Benoît Potier’s remuneration for 2019 as follows: 3.2.1. Fixed remuneration The fixed remuneration is set at 1,325,000 euros, identical to that for 2018. The average annual increase in the fixed remuneration over the last five years is +3.8%. 3.2.2. Variable remuneration The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that the criteria for the variable remuneration for 2019 would be as follows: )) Two quantifiable financial criteria, which were already included in the criteria for the variable remuneration for 2018: −− increase in the recurring earnings per share (excluding the impact of foreign exchange and significant exceptional items) (hereinafter “recurring EPS”); −− comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of foreign exchange and energy). The weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below. Following remarks made by shareholders, the Remuneration Committee carried out a detailed review of the criteria for the variable remuneration and the LTI and made its recommendations. Based on this, the Board considered that the ROCE is more a long-term indicator and that it is more appropriate to include it as a performance criterion for the LTI. Consequently, the Board decided that the ROCE would no longer be included in the criteria for the annual variable remuneration. The criterion of an increase in the recurring EPS makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an increase in sales reflects the momentum of the activity. The two criteria, growth in revenue and the recurring EPS, reflect the Group’s ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the NEOS company program also incorporates efficiency objectives, the achievement of which contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS. For each criterion, the Board of Directors has defined a target objective, which is not made public for confidentiality reasons. The target objectives set are demanding. They are completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program which aims, for the period 2016-2020, at an average annualized growth in Group revenue of +6% to +8%, including a scope impact linked to the consolidation of Airgas corresponding to +2% as an annualized average. For each financial criterion, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the fraction of the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero. )) (Qualitative) personal criteria, a weighting being allocated to each of them. They are detailed in the table below and relate: −− as to one-third, to Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter “CSR”); −− as to one-third, to organization and to Human resources; −− as to one-third, to individual performance. This criterion responds to the Board of Directors’ desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board’s assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated. An identical target and maximum weight is set for each qualitative criteria. 140 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 The summary table below provides details of the criteria for the variable remuneration, together with the target and maximum weights for each element.

(b) Excluding the foreign exchange impact and significant exceptional items. Excluding the effect of applying the IFRS 16 standard as from January 1, 2019. (c) Excluding significant scope impact, foreign exchange impact and energy. The total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2019 fiscal year in respect of the term of office will be paid in 2020, after approval of the financial statements by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on the approval by an Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of the elements of Benoît Potier’s remuneration for 2019, under the conditions provided by article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code. 3.2.3. Long-term remuneration components A. Principles of grant The performance share and stock option plans are aimed, in addition to the grant of incentives and profit-sharing, at involving the employees more in the Company’s performance and constitute a long-term motivation factor, aligned with the interests of the shareholders for value creation over time. The following principles were adopted by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019 for the allocation programd for the autumn of 2019: )) The Board confirmed that, according to the principle adopted in 2016, the award of performance shares and options to the Executive Officer and the changes therein over time will be assessed in terms of the IFRS value (and not in terms of the volumes granted), for all stock option and performance share plans combined. For 2019, the Board of Directors intends to grant to Benoît Potier LTI representing an IFRS value of approximately 2.25 million euros, which is stable by comparison with the 2018 grant, representing 40.4% of the total target remuneration for 2019, in accordance with the remuneration policy. )) All the stock options and performance shares granted are subject to performance conditions that apply to both the stock option and performance share plans and are calculated over a period of three years. The performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in the autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years. Following remarks made by shareholders, the Remuneration Committee carried out a detailed review of the criteria for the annual variable remuneration and the LTI and made its recommendations. Based on this, the Board considered that the ROCE is more a long-term indicator and that it is more appropriate to include it as a performance criterion for the LTI. Consequently, the Board decided that the EPS would no longer be included in the criteria for the LTI but would continue to be a criterion for the annual variable remuneration. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 141 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. In a highly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every transaction. The ROCE criterion thus makes it possible to measure the return on capital employed and constitutes a key indicator with regard to Air Liquide’s activity. The total shareholder return (AL TSR and relative TSR) is maintained as a second performance criterion for the LTI. It makes it possible to promote the alignment of the Executive Officer’s interests with the interests of the shareholders. The demanding objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post, at the end of the Board Meeting in the month of February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved. The rate of achievement for the performance conditions and the percentage of stock options that vest/performance shares acquired are also published at the end of this Board Meeting. B. Performance conditions As a consequence of the above, the performance conditions which apply to all the beneficiaries of the stock option and performance share plans which will be allocated in 2019 have been determined by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019. The number of stock options which can be exercised out of the total number of options which will be allocated, together with the number of performance shares definitively allocated pursuant to the 2019 Plans will depend: (i) for 60% of the stock options/performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on capital employed after tax (ROCE (a)) recorded at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit below which there will be no grant. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 bps less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities. The objective has been set within the trajectory of the NEOS company program which aims at a ROCE of more than 10% in 2021-2022. (ii) for 40% of the stock options/performance shares granted, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of total shareholder return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 (“AL TSR”). The objective of absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of total shareholder return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends – sourced from Bloomberg (“B TSR”), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2021 fiscal year. C. Rules specific to the Executive Officers The rules specific to the Executive Officers are unchanged compared to 2018, with the exception of the sub-limits on the grants to the Executive Officers submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. As part of the renewal of the authorizations for the grant of stock options and performance shares, the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders’ Meeting reduce by one-third each of the sub-limits on the grants to the Executive Officers submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in order to bring them closer to the historical levels of grants by the Board. Consequently, subject to the approval of the resolutions by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019, the number of stock options granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital (instead of 0.3% previously) and the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital (instead of 0.15% previously). For more details regarding other rules specific to the Executive Officers, see page 133. (a) The Return on Capital Employed after tax (“ROCE”) will be calculated as follows: ((Net profit after tax before deduction of minority interests – net cost of debt after taxes) for the period 2021)/weighted average of (shareholders’ equity + minority interests + net indebtedness) at the end of the three last semesters (H2 2021, H1 2021 and H2 2020)), these aggregates being adjusted for the impact of the currency variation as compared to the exchange rate for 2018 and for the application of the new IFRS 16 standard. 142 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 4. Long-term commitments The long-term commitments set out below which Benoît Potier benefits from are taken into account for the determination of his total remuneration. 4.1. COMPANY’S PENSION AND SIMILAR BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS In addition to the mandatory basic and supplementary pension schemes (Agirc/Arrco) with which he is, or was affiliated, Benoît Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social benefit schemes set up by L’ Air Liquide S.A. 4.1.1. Defined benefit pension plan A. Description of the defined benefit pension plan Pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 137-11 of the same Code, L’ Air Liquide S.A. set up a collective defined benefit pension plan “S” for the benefit of the senior managers and executives and Executive Officers: (i) whose remuneration exceeds 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS); (ii) who have a total of three years’ length of service with the Air Liquide Group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance; and (iii) who do not have the capacity of a participant under the supplementary defined benefit pension plan with guaranteed cover (“garantie de ressources”) which was closed in 1996. Benoît Potier’s rights under this plan: (i) may be applied for if the beneficiary definitively ends his professional career with the Company and decides to claim his mandatory basic and supplementary pension (Arrco and Agirc) entitlements, whether or not at the full rate. In the event of termination of his corporate office at the Company’s initiative, a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years’ length of service shall retain his rights, if he does not resume any professional activity until his retirement. The condition of ending his career at the Company is then considered to be met, as he has not performed any activity after leaving the Company. This rule, which is in line with the position of the social security administration reflects the Human Resources policy at Air Liquide, for which long careers within the Group constitute a key element; given the length of service of the potential beneficiaries of this plan, some of whom have spent the whole of their career at the Group, it would not be justified for them to lose the benefit of this plan in the event of a forced departure (except in the event of gross or wilful misconduct) at the end of their careers. Furthermore, in accordance with the position of the social security administration, the rules also provide for the maintenance of the potential rights of the beneficiaries in the event of a disability of the 2nd or 3rd category; (ii) will be equal to 1% for each year of service of the average of the three best years in the last five years of remuneration exceeding 24 times the annual social security ceiling (“PASS”) (the “Reference Remuneration”). The basis for calculation of the pension annuity will be limited to the fixed and variable remuneration only, to the exclusion of any other form of remuneration, whether paid by the Company or by any French or foreign subsidiary. For this calculation, the average of the total variable portions taken into account cannot exceed 100% of the average of the total fixed portions taken into account. Where applicable, an annuity equal to 60% of the aforementioned benefits will be paid to the surviving spouse, subject to certain conditions, notably with regard to age; (iii) will be capped, in all cases, as they are for all the senior managers and executives benefiting from the defined benefit plan, and for all pension plans combined, whether public or private, in France or abroad, at 45% of the Reference Remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit plan would be reduced accordingly; (iv) have been the subject of: −− contributions paid to an insurance body, that are deductible from the corporate income tax base, and −− provisions in the Group’s consolidated financial statements; (v) are estimated, as at December 31, 2018, at 590,847 euros gross per year, Benoît Potier having a total of 36 years’ length of service in the Group; (vi) will be subject to the employer’s contribution due on pension annuities provided for by article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 32%. The application of this plan to Benoît Potier has been authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010 and February 17, 2014 and approved, in resolutions specific to Benoît Potier, by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9th resolution) and May 7, 2014 (10th resolution). At the time of renewal of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, as amended by Law n° 2015-990 of August 6, 2015, the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 decided to make the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in his conditional pension rights under the defined benefit pension plan S which Benoît Potier benefits from, subject to conditions relating to Benoît Potier’s performance assessed in light of the Company’s performance (see description below). This commitment was approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a resolution specific to Benoît Potier (10th resolution). 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 143 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. B. Performance conditions applicable to the annual increase in Benoît Potier’s conditional rights Since the renewal of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 16, 2018, the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in Benoît Potier’s conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan S which he benefits from, will depend, and the amount of that increase will be adjusted in accordance with, the average annual gap between the Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. The proportion of the annual increase in the conditional rights will be determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive: Average of the annual gaps (ROCE – WACC) over three years in bps (a) Proportion of increase ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. It is specified that the Air Liquide pension plan S is more restrictive than the new article L. 225-42-1 paragraph 8 of the French Commercial Code. Pursuant to this article, the conditional rights cannot increase annually by an amount which is 3% higher than the annual remuneration used as a reference for the calculation of the annuity paid under this plan, whilst Air Liquide’s S plan provides that the pension rights will be equal to 1% per year of service (see the description of the plan set forth above). Compliance with the conditions set forth above will be verified on an annual basis, before the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the last completed fiscal year, by the Board of Directors which shall determine the increase, in respect of that fiscal year, in the conditional rights which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from. The decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 which makes the increase in Benoît Potier’s pension rights under the defined benefit pension plan subject to performance conditions has no effect on the conditional rights which had been granted to Benoît Potier up until the renewal of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 16, 2018. Pursuant to article L 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, this decision was published on the Company’s website on February 16, 2018. In respect of 2018 (the period from the renewal of the office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to the end of the fiscal year), the Board of Directors recorded, on February 13, 2019, that the performance condition had been 100% achieved with an increase of 1%, corresponding to a potential acquisition of an additional 1% of the reference remuneration for the relevant year. If amendments are made to the regulations governing the defined benefit pension plans S, the Board of Directors might have to amend the existing defined benefit pension plan or put an alternative system in place. This alternative system, if implemented, would be subject to performance conditions in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code. 4.1.2. Defined contribution pension plans )) Pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, the Air Liquide Group has set up, at several companies including L’ Air Liquide S.A. a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of all the employees. The Board authorized the application of this defined contribution pension plan to Benoît Potier in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The pension entitlements of Benoît Potier under this plan: −− may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme; −− are or have been financed by monthly contributions broken down as follows: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary; 144 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 −− these contributions are assessed on bracket A (the portion of remuneration that is less than 1 PASS) at a rate of 2.32%, and on brackets B and C (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between 1 PASS and 4 times the PASS and between 4 times the PASS and 8 times the PASS) at a rate of 6.50%. Furthermore, they are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 20%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 5 times the PASS; −− are estimated, as at December 31, 2018, at 6,607 euros gross per year. The individual application of this plan to Benoît Potier was authorized by a decision of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9th resolution). During the 2018 fiscal year, the amount paid by the Company to the third party responsible for managing the aforementioned supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Benoît Potier is stated in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 128). )) In addition, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, sections 6 and 7 of the same Code, L’ Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of the senior managers and executives, defined by reference to a collective bargaining agreement coefficient, and of Executive Officers who have at least one year’s length of service. Since 2015, Benoît Potier no longer benefits from this defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of the senior managers and executives, the contribution paid for his benefit having been transferred to the life insurance plan (see below). Benoît Potier’s pension entitlements under this plan: −− may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme; −− were financed by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the Company. These contributions were last set at 2.5% of the portion of remuneration that is lower than 8 times the PASS. Furthermore, they were subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid pursuant to the defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above); −− are estimated, as at December 31, 2018, at 177,556 euros gross per year. 4.2. OTHER LIFE BENEFITS 4.2.1. Life insurance plan As the Executive Officers are no longer beneficiaries of the defined contribution pension plan for senior managers and executives (see above), L’ Air Liquide S.A. has entered into a collective life insurance contract which enables them to create savings which are available at any time. The insurance contract provides that the beneficiaries can ask for the payment of a single capital sum or conversion of the capital into a life annuity. In the event of a conversion of the capital into a life annuity, Benoît Potier’s rights under this plan: )) are estimated, as at December 31, 2018, at 42,236 euros gross per year, )) are, or were, financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and which concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS. The opening of this plan, for the 3rd bracket (16 to 24 times the PASS) and then the 2nd bracket (8 to 16 times the PASS), and finally its extension to the 1st bracket (0 to 8 times the PASS) of the reference remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid by the Company to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the reference remuneration of the beneficiaries corresponding to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions identical to those of the previous plan. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions. For Benoît Potier, the signature of this contract, for the 3rd and then the 2nd bracket, was authorized by the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7th resolution). The extension of the plan to the 1st bracket concerning the band of reference remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by a decision made by the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution). The amount paid by the Company in 2018 to the insurance plan manager pursuant to the life insurance plan for the benefit of Benoît Potier is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 128). 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 145 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 4.2.2. Death and disability benefits plan Benoît Potier benefits from the additional “incapacity, disability, death” benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the Executive Officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan, which provides in particular for: )) the grant to the beneficiaries: −− of additional daily indemnities in the event of incapacity and a disability annuity set, all benefits combined, at a maximum annual amount of 444,998 euros, and −− of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120 times the PASS in the event of an accident. The life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the incapacity/disability and death benefits for the same insured party; )) the payment in full, by the Company, of the contributions calculated as a percentage of the reference remuneration which is capped at: −− 16 times the PASS for the incapacity and disability cover, and −− 24 times the PASS for the death cover. The contribution rate amounts to 0.85% of the reference remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 0.65% between 16 and 24 PASS (a). These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS. The individual application to Benoît Potier of this unified benefit plan covering all the personnel, in respect of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution (7th resolution). The amount of the contribution paid in 2018 by L’ Air Liquide S.A. in respect of the benefit plan for the benefit of Benoît Potier, is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 128). 5. Commitments relating to termination of duties 5.1. TERMINATION INDEMNITIES In accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code and the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 14, 2018 (b), set the terms of the agreement applicable to Benoît Potier, along the following main lines: )) only the cases of forced departure of Benoît Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within 6 months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity; )) the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration; )) the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Benoît Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company’s articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months’ gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure; )) the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions). Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity: The Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Benoît Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary’s performance assessed in light of the Company’s performance, defined as of today as follows: Entitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of the average of the annual gap between the Return On Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed using (a) The contribution rate of this collective plan was reduced in 2018, as well as the call rate (following the resizing of the profit sharing reserve). (b) For the record, in order to take account of the expectations of certain shareholders, the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 amended the terms of the agreement applicable to Benoît Potier before the renewal of his term of office in 2018. The Board thus decided (i) to remove the non-renewal of office from the list of events of forced departure which grant an entitlement to the indemnity; (ii) that when the departure is related to a change of control, the termination indemnity is only due if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control, as compared to 24 months previously; (iii) to review the performance conditions, the thresholds for an increase having been made more exacting than before. 146 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 the net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between ROCE and WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and will be calculated the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place. Given the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes, this gap makes it possible to measure the regular creation of value over the three years prior to the departure. The proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive: Average over 3 years of the annual (ROCE – WACC) gaps in bps (a) Proportion of indemnity due ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. The decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 relating to this indemnity was made in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure and published on the Company’s website on February 16, 2018. It was approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9th resolution). 5.2. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR COMPANY MANAGERS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS Pursuant to a decision made by the Board of Directors in May 2006, Benoît Potier benefits, in his capacity as an Executive Officer, from the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are added back to Benoît Potier’s remuneration as benefits in kind. This decision had been approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 9, 2007, in accordance with the regulated agreements procedure (7th resolution). The Board of Directors confirmed, at its meeting in May 2018, that Benoît Potier continues to benefit from this unemployment insurance within the scope of the latest renewal of his duties. TABLE 8 (SEE PAGE 166), TABLE 9 (SEE PAGE 168) AND TABLE 10 (PAGE 170) TABLE 11 The table shown below presents a summary of the commitments relating to the termination of the duties of the Executive Officers, as set out above.

The distribution policy for directors’ fees is regularly reviewed and readjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the remuneration is competitive from an international standpoint, in order to benefit from the best and most suitable skills in the business sector and geographical area, and to ensure that the values which have led to the Group’s long-term success are maintained. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 149 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 7.

It is in line with the policy introduced in 2017, after the acquisition of Airgas, which was a major, transforming event for the Group. It reflects the increased level of responsibility of the Group’s Executive Officer and is adapted to the Group’s new context, remains competitive and is an incentive to promote the Group’s performance over the medium to long-term, in accordance with the Company’s interests and the interests of all the stakeholders. In this connection, the fixed remuneration is determined taking account of the level of responsibilities, the experience in the management duties and market practices. It represents approximately 25% of the total annual remuneration. In the Group’s new context following the acquisition of Airgas, it had been decided to reposition the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for 2017/2018, subject to a good performance, a successful integration of Airgas and the achievement of the Airgas synergies in line with the forecasts for the end of 2017. Since the conditions for this repositioning have been achieved, in accordance with the principles approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting, the total annual target remuneration for 2018 has increased by +5.2% as compared to 2017, the fixed remuneration increasing by +3.9%. As announced, this repositioning is now finalized. Over the last five years, Benoît Potier’s fixed remuneration has undergone an average annual increase of +3.8%. Annual variable €2,005,653 The target variable remuneration is equal to 150% of the fixed remuneration. remuneration The variable remuneration is limited to 167% of the fixed remuneration. The target variable remuneration is linked in 2018: nn For 105% of the fixed remuneration (with a maximum of 122% of the fixed remuneration), to three (quantifiable) financial criteria which are based on: (i) for 40% (a max. of 47%) of the fixed remuneration, an objective of increase in the recurring earnings per share (excluding foreign exchange impact and significant exceptional items) (hereinafter “recurring EPS”); (ii) for 45% (a max. of 52%) of the fixed remuneration, an objective of Return on Capital Employed after tax (hereinafter “ROCE”) as at December 31, 2018 and (iii) for 20% (a max. of 23%) of the fixed remuneration, an objective of comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact, foreign exchange impact and energy). The increase in EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of the ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the return on capital employed, is relevant for a highly capital-intensive industry. The criterion of an increase in sales reflects the momentum in the activity. These three criteria – revenue, EPS and ROCE – reflect the balance achieved each year between profitable growth and return on investment. The criteria of ROCE and growth in revenue are part of the four objectives in the NEOS company program. For each criterion, the Board of Directors had defined an exacting target objective which is completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program. For each criterion, a formula makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) taking into account the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set (the target variable remuneration corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set). The objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration (as a % of the fixed remuneration and as a % of the target variable remuneration for this criterion) is communicated hereafter; 150 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 Amounts Comments nn For 45% of the fixed remuneration (target variable and maximum remuneration), to (qualitative) personal criteria linked: (i) as to one-third, to Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) (safety and reliability – deployment of the Corporate Sustainability Program and the definition and communication of the CSR objectives for the Group); (ii) as to one-third, to organization and Human resources (development of talents, future succession plans); and (iii) as to one-third, to individual performance (this criterion responds to the Board of Directors’ desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board’s assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated). Assessment for 2018: Concerning the (quantifiable) financial criteria, the results for 2018 were above the target for the recurring EPS and revenue criteria and slightly below the target for the ROCE. The amount of the variable remuneration relating to these criteria is as follows: nn Recurring EPS: 45.2% of the fixed remuneration, representing 113.1% of the target remuneration for this criterion, nn ROCE: 42.3% of the fixed remuneration, representing 94% of the target remuneration for this criterion, nn Revenue: 21.1% of the fixed remuneration, representing 105.5% of the target remuneration for this criterion. The performance concerning the (qualitative) personal objectives was held to be excellent. The amount of the variable remuneration relating to these criteria is as follows: nn CSR: 13.5% of the fixed remuneration, representing 90% of the target remuneration for this criterion, nn Organization/Human Resources: 14.3% of the fixed remuneration, representing 95% of the target remuneration for this criterion, nn Individual performance: 15% of the fixed remuneration, representing 100% of the target remuneration for this criterion. The amount of the variable remuneration relating to the personal objectives is thus 43% of the fixed remuneration, representing 95% of the target remuneration for the personal objectives. When assessing the personal criteria, the Board of Directors noted the following elements: nn CSR criteria: -Safety and reliability: With regard to safety, 2018 is a somewhat paradoxical year, with: -a historically low lost time accident frequency rate of 1.29 compared to an average of 1.63 over the last five years. This indicator has dropped significantly; -unfortunately, several fatal accidents, with three deaths from among Air Liquide’s employees and five at subcontractors. They have been analyzed in detail at the Group’s Executive Committee meetings: special preventative measures have been implemented during the course of the year with regard to road traffic risks, which remain the principal cause of accidents, in particular those which resulted in fatal accidents. Action plans have been rolled out in the relevant operations and geographical areas and an awareness campaign has been carried out throughout the whole Group. Concerning reliability, the Group’s IMS (Industrial Management System) program which was implemented over 10 years ago has profoundly changed the way of working, and has consolidated the management processes for safety, reliability, environmental protection and industrial risk control. Based on the experience acquired, a project was launched in 2018 to adapt the IMS, in order to improve its efficiency and its implementation at all Group entities. -Corporate Sustainability Program: The Environment and Society Committee, formed in 2017, met on three occasions in 2018 and continued its work and recommendations concerning, in particular, the Climate objectives which were published on November 30, 2018, the Group’s sustainable development issues, the assessment of the environmental and societal risks and the review of the vigilance plan. Air Liquide has for many years been dedicated to an approach designed to foster responsible growth, aiming in particular to limit its CO2 emissions and those of its customers. Air Liquide announced its Climate objectives on November 30, 2018, including in particular the reduction of its carbon intensity by 30% between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach including its assets, customers and the ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector and are in line with the NEOS company program. This announcement was the theme for an investor day and the subject of global communication at the Group. A campaign has been launched to roll out the objectives in operations. Benoît Potier is co-Chairman of the Hydrogen Council. This Council, formed in 2017, brings together more than 50 leaders in the energy, transport and industry sectors to promote hydrogen in order to achieve the climate change objectives, and held, for the first time, a meeting in China. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 151 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. Amounts Comments nn Organization and Human Resources The talent development policy has been pursued. Regular reviews of talent, at the level of operating clusters (groups of countries) and up to the highest level of the Company, have led to a certain number of moves. These reviews have also been implemented at Airgas, where the roll-out of the Group’s processes and policies is continuing. The succession plans for the Company’s key positions have also been reviewed. Dedicated reviews with the Executive Committee and the Appointments and Governance Committee have taken place regarding talent with the greatest potential. Diversity objectives for 2025 (at both Group and entity levels) have been defined and shared (the proportion of women and of different nationalities in “Executive” positions, the gender mix of teams, etc.), together with objectives to hire young graduates, which is a key factor in the creation of talent pools. The development program for technical talent, TCL (Technical Career Leaders), also received particular attention in 2018 with the appointment of two Senior Fellows (the highest form of recognition on the program), of leading international experts from the Airgas teams and an improvement in the gender mix with the appointment of the first female Fellow. This program is an essential factor for innovation, and makes a significant contribution over the long term to ensuring the Group’s reliability and safety. In parallel to NEOS Customer Experience program, a program has been launched which focuses on employees’ responsiveness and commitment. nn Individual performance Individual performance was considered to be excellent. The Group’s results are very good in an uncertain economic and geopolitical context. As regards the acquisition of Airgas, the synergies are more than one year ahead of schedule. Moreover, following the acquisition, it can be noted in Airgas teams the expression of a strong feeling that they belonged to the Group and that their career prospects had expanded. Furthermore, Benoît Potier’s strong personal commitment to the development of the Hydrogen Energy business was noted. Overall, the total amount of the variable remuneration is at the target, up by +2.8% as compared to the variable remuneration for 2017. As an annualized average, Benoît Potier’s variable remuneration has increased by +6.8% over 3 years, by +6.1% over 5 years and by +3% over 10 years. The total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2018 fiscal year in respect of the term of office will be paid in 2019, after approval of the financial statements by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting it being noted that its payment is conditional on approval by an Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of the elements of Benoît Potier’s remuneration for 2018, under the conditions provided by article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code.

Performance conditions The stock options and performance shares awarded are all accompanied by performance conditions which are common to both tools and are calculated over three years. They are based in 2018 on: (i) as to 65%: the rate of achievement of an objective consisting of the average annual rates of growth in Group undiluted net earnings per share, excluding foreign exchange impact and excluding significant exceptional items (“Recurring EPS”) for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to zero if there is no growth in EPS. This objective was set, as for the 2017 Plans, at a level of growth included within a range of +6% to +10% per year. The precise objective will be communicated ex post; (ii) as to 35%: -for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of an objective of total shareholder return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years (“AL TSR”).

At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit, -for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of the rate of total shareholder return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends – sourced from Bloomberg (“B TSR”), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years. The rate of achievement will be 0% if the average Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average CAC 40 TSR and 100% if it is at least higher than 2% of the average CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average CAC 40 TSR is impossible. Other conditions/shareholding obligation The shareholding obligation defined pursuant to the French Commercial Code applies both to shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares that have vested. It is completed by an internal rule which requires Benoît Potier to hold a number of shares which is equivalent to twice his annual fixed remuneration. Benoît Potier has made a commitment not to carry out any hedging transactions during his term of office. Plan Regulations: The stock option plan consists of a term of ten years and a condition of continued presence. The France performance share plan comprises (i) a three-year vesting period; (ii) followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be transferred, as well as a condition of continued presence aligned with that for the stock option plan.

This gap, in a highly capital-intensive business activity, makes it possible to measure the regular creation of value. An average gap of 300 basis points between ROCE and WACC over three years is required to be able to benefit from the total indemnity. The proportion of the indemnity due shall be established as follows, with an increase by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds inclusive: Average over three years of the annual (ROCE – WACC) gaps in bps (a) Proportion of indemnity due ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. The decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 taken in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure of the “TEPA” Law was approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9th resolution). It is re-examined and submitted for the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on each renewal of Benoît Potier’s term of office. Non-competition indemnity: there is no commitment with regard to a non-competition indemnity. Supplementary €0 received Pension commitment pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan pension plans For that portion of the remuneration which exceeds 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS), pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan, Benoît Potier potentially benefits from a supplementary pension annuity equal to 1% for each year of service of the reference remuneration paid by the Company. The defined benefit pension plan only applies, if the beneficiary is still with the Company at the time of his retirement and decides to claim his pension entitlements, whether or not at the full rate; in the event of the termination of the term of office at the Company’s initiative (except in the event of gross or wilful misconduct), the beneficiary may retain his rights, if he is over 55 years of age and if he does not resume any professional activity until he retires. This rule, which reflects the Human Resources policy at Air Liquide, encouraging long careers within the Group, is in line with the position of the social security administration. Benoît Potier joined the Group in 1981. The total pension benefits, under all plans combined, are capped at 45% of the reference remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit pension plan would be reduced accordingly. The application of this plan to Benoît Potier has been authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010 and February 17, 2014 and approved, in resolutions specific to Benoît Potier, by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9th resolution) and May 7, 2014 (10th resolution). At the time of renewal of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, as amended by Law n° 2015-990 of August 6, 2015, the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 decided to make the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in his conditional pension rights under the defined benefit pension plan S which Benoît Potier benefits from, subject to conditions relating to Benoît Potier’s performance assessed in light of the Company’s performance (see description below). This commitment was approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a resolution specific to Benoît Potier (10th resolution). 154 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 Amounts Comments Performance conditions applicable to the annual increase in Benoît Potier’s conditional rights: Since the renewal of his office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on May 16, 2018, the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in Benoît Potier’s conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan S which he benefits from, will depend, and the amount of that increase will be adjusted in accordance with, the average annual gap between the Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. The proportion of the annual increase in the conditional rights will be determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive: Average of the annual gaps (ROCE – WACC) over three years in bps (a) Proportion of increase ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. In respect of 2018 (the period from the renewal of the office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to the end of the fiscal year), the Board of Directors recorded, on February 13, 2019, that the performance condition had been 100% achieved with an increase of 1%, corresponding to a potential acquisition of an additional 1% of the reference remuneration for the relevant year. Pension commitment pursuant to a defined contribution pension plan Benoît Potier benefits from the defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, the contribution to which is paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the remuneration which does not exceed 8 times the PASS. The application of this plan to Benoît Potier was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010 and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9th resolution). The amount of the contributions paid in 2018 pursuant to the supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Benoît Potier amounts to 9,500 euros. Group life €0 received Since the Executive Officers are no longer beneficiaries of the defined contribution pension plan for senior insurance plan managers, a collective life insurance plan was entered into which makes it possible to create savings for the benefit of the beneficiary which are available at any time. The contributions paid by the Company are calculated on identical terms to those of the previous plan. The opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 PASS), and finally its extension to the first bracket (0 to 8 PASS) of the reference remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. For Benoît Potier, the signature of this contract was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution). The amount of the contributions paid in 2018 pursuant to the life insurance plan for the benefit of Benoît Potier is 211,831 euros. Group death and €0 received Benoît Potier benefits from the supplementary death and disability plan, unified with effect from disability plan January 1, 2015, covering the whole of the personnel and the Executive Officers who are duly authorized to benefit from it, in which (a) the remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the contributions is capped at (i) 16 times the annual social security ceiling for the incapacity and disability cover, (ii) 24 times the annual social security ceiling for the death cover; and (b) the rate of the employer’s contribution was reduced in 2018 and amounts to 0.85% up to 16 times the annual social security ceiling and to 0.65% between 16 and 24 times the annual social security ceiling. The individual application to Benoît Potier, in respect of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of this unified death and disability benefits plan covering all the personnel, was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution).

Principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and allocation of the fixed, variable and exceptional elements which make up the total remuneration and the benefits of any kind which may be granted to the Executive Officers (submitted for the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting pursuant to article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code) This Executive Officer remuneration policy describes the principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and allocation of the fixed, variable and exceptional elements which make up the total remuneration and the benefits of any kind which are granted to the Executive Officers in respect of their corporate office. This remuneration policy is in line with the policies approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meetings on May 3, 2017 and May 16, 2018. It was adopted by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019, upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. In order to take account of comments made by shareholders and on the recommendation of this Committee, the Board of Directors decided to amend the criteria for the variable remuneration and the long-term incentives (or “LTI”) and to propose to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019 that it reduce the upper limits on the grants of stock options and performance shares to the Executive Officers. In accordance with article L. 225-37-2 of the French Commercial Code, the principles and criteria set out in this section are submitted for the approval of the Ordinary Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019, in the 9th resolution entitled “Approval of the remuneration policy applicable to the Executive Officers”. 8.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND STRUCTURE OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL REMUNERATION 8.1.1. General principles Traditionally, the remuneration policy adopted by the Board of Directors includes incentive elements reflecting the Group’s strategy, which is steered toward profitable long-term growth, while acting responsibly in the interests of the Company and the interests of all the stakeholders. In a highly capital-intensive industry, profitable long-term growth requires constant attention to be paid to each investment decision and to the competitiveness of every transaction, while maintaining an ongoing effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee training and development, together with the environment. In this context, the elements taken into account for the determination of the remuneration are as follows: )) a short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration; )) a long-term incentive through the grant of share subscription options and performance shares, both tools being subject in full to the same performance conditions calculated over three years; )) other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officer’s term of office, including: −− a defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible senior managers and Executive Officers, subject to performance conditions in respect of Benoît Potier since May 16, 2018 (the date of renewal of his term of office), −− a collective life insurance plan, −− a death and disability benefits plan, −− commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company’s initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period, −− entitlement to unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group. To determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance. The remuneration policy reflects the increased level of responsibility of the Group’s senior executive and is adapted to the Group’s context, remains competitive and is an incentive to promote the Group’s performance over the medium to long-term, in compliance with the Company’s interests and the interests of all the stakeholders. This remuneration policy, which is applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, applies whether the Group’s senior Executive Officer acts as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or, if circumstances so require, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In such circumstances, a Chairman who does not also have the duties of Chief Executive Officer would receive fixed remuneration to the exclusion of any variable remuneration. 156 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 Furthermore, if such a situation were to arise, the remuneration policy applicable to a Senior Executive Vice President would be determined on the basis of the policy applicable to a Chief Executive Officer of the Company, after taking account, however, of the difference in the level of responsibility, consistent with the earlier practices applied at the Company for this type of Executive Officer. 8.1.2. Structure of the total annual remuneration In keeping with the remuneration policy approved in 2017 and in 2018 by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the structure of the total annual remuneration is as follows: )) A proportionate balance is maintained between the three components of remuneration (fixed remuneration, variable remuneration and LTI) so that, in accordance with recurring practice at Air Liquide: −− the weight of the variable remuneration and the combined elements of long-term incentive continues to represent approximately 75% of the total annual remuneration; and that −− in the balance between the three above-mentioned elements, slightly greater weight continues to be given to the LTI. Accordingly, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration 35% and the LTI 40% of the total remuneration. )) Criteria for the variable remuneration and the LTI: taking into account remarks made by shareholders, the Board decided, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, to change the performance criteria to which these two remuneration tools are subject with effect from 2019. Accordingly, the EPS criterion will henceforth only be taken into account in one remuneration tool: it remains a criterion for the annual variable remuneration, but is no longer included in the performance criteria for the LTI. Furthermore, the ROCE becomes a criterion for the long term remuneration (LTI) as a replacement for the EPS. The revenue criterion is maintained as a criterion for the variable remuneration. )) Upper limits on the grant of LTI to the Executive Officers: the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019 is asked to decide upon the renewal of the authorizations for the grant of stock-options and performance shares (see draft resolutions 13 and 14, at pages 322 et seq.). At this time and following remarks from shareholders, the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders’ Meeting reduce by one-third each of the sub-limits on the grants to the Executive Officers submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in order to bring them closer to the historical levels of grants by the Board. Consequently, subject to the approval of the resolutions by the Shareholders’ Meeting, the number of stock options granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital (instead of 0.3% previously) and the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital (instead of 0.15% previously). As before, the Board of Directors also sets the annual grant limits, which remain significantly below these sub-limits, it being noted that, as stated above, the LTI must represent approximately 40% of the Executive Officer’s annual remuneration. )) The other principles which apply to the annual variable remuneration are unchanged: (i) the variable part continues to be expressed as a target variable remuneration (150% of the fixed remuneration) and as a maximum (167% of the fixed remuneration); (ii) concerning the weighting of the various criteria adopted: -a greater relative weight is still given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria, -Quantifiable criteria: as before, each quantifiable criterion is assigned a target weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set at the beginning of the year, and a maximum weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration), -Qualitative criteria: • as in 2018, in order to meet shareholder expectations, a weighting is allocated to each of the qualitative criteria, • the qualitative criteria continue to be based, as to two-thirds, on three to four categories or sub-categories of objectives which are defined each year and, as to one-third, on an assessment of the individual performance; -the target weighting and the maximum weighting are communicated ex ante; the actual weight of each criterion for the determination of the variable remuneration due in respect of the fiscal year will be established on the basis of the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective, on the basis of the application of a formula for the financial criteria and the assessment of the Executive Officer’s performance by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria. The rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and, hence as a percentage of the target variable remuneration for this criterion, will be communicated ex post. )) Finally, the other principles which apply to the LTI are also unchanged (the proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer’s departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, the level of requirement of the objectives and the rules which are specific to the Executive Officers as described below). 8.2. IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE 2019 REMUNERATION By applying the principles defined above, the criteria for the determination, distribution and allocation of the elements which make up the Executive Officer’s total remuneration for 2019 are as follows: 8.2.1. Fixed remuneration The fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility, the experience in the executive management function and market practices. The fixed remuneration will represent approximately 25% of the total target annual remuneration. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 157 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 8.2.2. Variable remuneration The variable remuneration will be based on: )) two quantifiable financial criteria, which were already included in the criteria for the variable remuneration for 2018: −− increase in the recurring earnings per share (excluding the impact of foreign exchange and significant exceptional items) (hereinafter “recurring EPS”), −− comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of foreign exchange and energy). The weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below. Following remarks made by shareholders, the Remuneration Committee carried out a detailed review of the criteria for the variable remuneration and the LTI and made its recommendations. Based on this, the Board considered that the ROCE is more a long-term indicator and that it is more appropriate to include it as a performance criterion for the LTI. Consequently, the Board decided that the ROCE would no longer be included in the criteria for the annual variable remuneration. For each criterion, the Board of Directors has defined a target objective, which is not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nonetheless, the rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion, will be communicated ex post. For each financial criterion, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the fraction of the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero; )) (qualitative) personal criteria, a weighting being allocated to each of them. They relate: −− as to one-third, to Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter “CSR”), −− as to one-third, to organization and to Human Resources, −− as to one-third, to individual performance. This criterion responds to the Board of Directors’ desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board’s assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated. An identical target and maximum weight is set for each qualitative criteria. The allocation key for the quantifiable/qualitative criteria and, within each category, the target (corresponding to the 100% achievement of the objective set) and the maximum weights for each element, determined by applying the principles set forth above, is as follows: Target Maximum As a % of the fixed As a % As a % of the fixed As a % Indicator remuneration based on 100 remuneration based on 100 Financial criteria (quantifiable) including: 105 70 122 73 Recurring EPS 75 50 87 52 Consolidated revenue 30 20 35 21 Personal criteria (qualitative) including: 45 30 45 27 CSR (safety and reliability / Sustainable Development) 15 10 15 9 Organization / Human Resources 15 10 15 9 Individual performance 15 10 15 9 TOTAL (FINANCIAL AND PERSONAL CRITERIA) 150 100 167 100 The total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2019 fiscal year in respect of the term of office will be paid in 2020, after approval of the financial statements by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on approval by an Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of the elements of the Executive Officer’s remuneration for 2019, under the conditions provided for in article L. 225-100 of the French Commercial Code. 158 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 8.2.3. Other elements of annual remuneration The benefits in kind include the use of a company car as well as contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. In accordance with the Group’s internal practice, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, like any other Executive Officer, does not receive any Directors’ fees, if he holds executive duties at L’ Air Liquide S.A. 8.2.4. Long-term remuneration components A. Principles of grant )) In accordance with the principle adopted in 2016, the Board confirmed that the award of performance shares and options to the Executive Officers and the changes therein over time will be assessed in terms of the IFRS value (and not in terms of the volumes granted), for all stock option and performance share plans combined. )) All the stock options and performance shares granted are subject to performance conditions that apply to both the stock option and performance share plans and are calculated over a period of three years. The performance conditions applicable to the plans decided upon in the autumn are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the Board meeting in February, in order to have a reference period of three full years. )) Following remarks made by shareholders, the Remuneration Committee carried out a detailed review of the criteria for the annual variable remuneration and the LTI and made its recommendations. Based on this, the Board considered that the ROCE is more a long-term indicator and that it is more appropriate to include it as a performance criterion for the LTI. Consequently, the Board decided that the EPS would no longer be included in the criteria for the LTI but would continue to be a criterion for the annual variable remuneration. The total shareholder return (AL TSR and relative TSR) is maintained as a second performance criterion for the LTI. The exact objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post, at the close of the Board of Directors’ meeting in February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance must be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of stock options that vest/performance shares definitively awarded are also published at the end of this Board meeting. B. Performance conditions As a consequence of the above, the performance conditions which apply to all the beneficiaries of the stock option and performance share plans which will be allocated in 2019 have been determined by the Board of Directors on February 13, 2019. The number of stock options which can be exercised out of the total number of options which will be allocated, together with the number of performance shares definitively allocated pursuant to the 2019 Plans will depend: (i) for 60% of the stock options/performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on capital employed after tax (“ROCE” (a)) recorded at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit below which there will be no grant. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 bps less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities. The objective has been set within the trajectory of the NEOS company program which aims at a ROCE of more than 10% in 2021-2022; (ii) for 40% of the stock options/performance shares granted, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of total return for the shareholder set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 (“AL TSR”). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100%, then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit, −− for 50% of the stock options/performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of total shareholder return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends – sourced from Bloomberg (“B TSR”), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), for fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board at the time when the financial statements are adopted for the 2021 fiscal year. (a) The Return on Capital Employed after tax (“ROCE”) will be calculated as follows: ((Net profit after tax before deduction of minority interests net cost of debt after taxes) for the period 2021)/weighted average of (shareholders’ equity + minority interests + net indebtedness) at the end of the three last semesters (H2 2021, H1 2021 and H2 2020)), these aggregates being adjusted for the impact of the currency variation as compared to the exchange rate for 2018 and for the application of the new IFRS 16 standard. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 159 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. C. Rules specific to the Executive Officers The grant to the Executive Officers is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted at pre-established periods in the autumn, in the form of share subscription options granted without any discount, and performance shares. )) Limits on the grants to Executive Officers As part of the renewal of the authorizations for the grant of stock options and performance shares, the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders’ Meeting reduce by one-third each of the sub-limits on the grants to the Executive Officers submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting in order to bring them closer to the historical levels of grants by the Board. Consequently, subject to the approval of the resolutions by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019, the number of stock options granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital (instead of 0.3% previously) and the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital (instead of 0.15% previously). Within the scope of these sub-limits authorized by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting (a), the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and for each Executive Officer (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code. Accordingly, the total aggregate IFRS value of the LTI granted cannot exceed 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer’s maximum gross annual remuneration, it being noted moreover that, in accordance with the 2019 remuneration policy referred to above, the grant of LTI represents approximately 40% of the Executive Officer’s total annual remuneration. )) Shareholding and share ownership obligations −− Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares respectively as from September 28, 2015. They lead to the obligation, for the Executive Officer, to hold, in registered form, until the termination of his duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares. This percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Executive Officer represents an amount equal to at least three times the Executive Officer’s gross annual fixed remuneration. −− Additional shareholding obligation – Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code In addition, the internal rule defined by the Board of Directors since 2008, pursuant to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold in a registered share account a number of shares equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration (one time the annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President) remains in effect. This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the aforementioned rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. )) Other rules applicable to the Executive Officers −− Condition of presence: loss of the stock options/rights to the performance shares in the process of being acquired, in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause. −− Implementation, with effect from 2018, of the principle of a proration on the basis of the actual presence of the Executive Officer, in the event of a departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions. This principle will apply (i) to the Executive Officers, (ii) in all cases of a departure for a reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause. Accordingly, in practice, the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) will be reduced on a prorated basis to the number of months’ actual presence of the Executive Officer at the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. The Executive Officer remains subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-in and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted. In addition, no grant will be made to an Executive Officer in the year of his departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code. −− Obligations regarding the restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the “black-out periods” prior to the publication of the financial statements, as defined by the Company. These abstention periods open 30 days before the date of publication of the annual and half-yearly consolidated results and 15 days before the date of publication of the financial information relating to the 1st and 3rd quarters. They end on the date of publication of the information at close of business. −− Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning stock options/shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and concerning the performance shares awarded, throughout the length of their term of office. (a) Submitted for the approval of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2019 (13th and 14th resolutions). 160 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 8.2.5. Other elements of remuneration The Board of Directors takes into account, in the overall assessment and determination of the Executive Officers’ remuneration, the other elements of remuneration submitted for the approval of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting within the scope of the regulated agreements and commitments procedure. For the record, in the case of Benoît Potier, these elements are as follows: A. Long-term commitments At the Company, the long-term commitments relating to the Executive Officers are usually as follows: )) a defined benefit pension plan which applies to eligible senior managers and Executive Officers, subject to performance conditions for Benoît Potier since May 16, 2018 (the date of renewal of his term of office); )) a collective life insurance plan; )) a death and disability benefits plan; )) commitments to pay an indemnity in the event of the termination of duties at the Company’s initiative, in certain circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over a three-year period; )) entitlement to unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers, in the absence of an employment contract with the Group. In the case of Benoît Potier, these commitments are as follows: The Company’s pension obligations Benoît Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social protection schemes set up by L’ Air Liquide S.A., as follows: )) Defined benefit pension plan For that portion of the remuneration which exceeds 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS), pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan, Benoît Potier potentially benefits from a supplementary pension annuity equal to 1% for each year of service of the reference remuneration paid by the Company. The defined benefit pension plan only applies if the beneficiary is still with the Company at the time of his retirement and decides to claim his pension entitlements, whether or not at the full rate; in the event of the termination of the term of office at the Company’s initiative (except in the event of gross or wilful misconduct), the beneficiary may retain his rights, if he is over 55 years of age and if he does not resume any professional activity until he retires. This rule, which reflects the Human Resources policy at Air Liquide, encouraging long careers within the Group, is in line with the position of the social security administration. Where applicable, an annuity equal to 60% of the aforementioned benefits will be paid to the surviving spouse, under certain conditions, notably with regard to age. Benoît Potier joined the Group in 1981. Total pension benefits, under all pension plans combined, are capped at 45% of the reference remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit plan would be reduced accordingly. The application of this plan to Benoît Potier was notably authorized by a decision of the Board of Directors on February 17, 2014 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2014 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (10th resolution). Pursuant to article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, as amended by Law n°2015-990 dated August 6, 2015, known as the “Macron Law”, the Board of Directors decided on February 14, 2018 that, with effect from the renewal of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2018, the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in the conditional pension rights under the defined benefit pension plan S, which Benoît Potier benefits from, would be subject to conditions linked to the performance of Benoît Potier, assessed in light of the Company’s performance. This commitment was approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (10th resolution). Consequently, since the renewal of Benoît Potier’s office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2018, the increase, in respect of each fiscal year, in Benoît Potier’s conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan S which he benefits from, will depend, and the amount of that increase will be adjusted in accordance with, the average of the annual gap between the Return On Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 161 2 Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. The proportion of the annual increase in the conditional rights is determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive: Average of the annual gaps (ROCE – WACC) over three years in bps (a) Proportion of increase ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. If amendments are made to the regulations governing the defined benefit pension plans S, the Board of Directors might have to amend the existing defined benefit pension plan or put an alternative system in place. This alternative system, if implemented, would be subject to performance conditions in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code. )) Defined contribution pension plan Benoît Potier benefits from the defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, the contribution to which is paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on that remuneration which does not exceed 8 times the PASS. The individual application of this plan to Benoît Potier was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9th resolution). Other benefits )) Life insurance plan As Benoît Potier is no longer a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan for senior managers, a collective life insurance policy was entered into which enables them to create savings on behalf of the beneficiary which are available at any time. The Executive Officer’s rights under this plan are financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS. The opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 times PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 times PASS), and finally its extension to the first bracket (0 to 8 times PASS) of the reference remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the beneficiaries’ reference remuneration which correspond to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions which are identical to those of the previous plan. For Benoît Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of reference remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution). )) Death and disability benefits plan Benoît Potier benefits from the additional “incapacity, disability, death” benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the Executive Officers duly authorized to benefit from such plan in which (a) the remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the contributions is capped at (i) 16 times the annual social security ceiling for the incapacity and disability cover, (ii) 24 times the annual social security ceiling for the death cover; and (b) the rate of the employer’s contribution was reduced in 2018 and amounts to 0.85% up to 16 times the annual social security ceiling and to 0.65% between 16 and 24 times the annual social security ceiling. The individual application to Benoît Potier, in respect of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of this unified death and disability benefits plan covering all the personnel, was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 6, 2015 in a specific resolution for Benoît Potier (7th resolution). 162 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Remuneration of the Executive Officers and Directors of L’ Air Liquide S.A. 2 B. Commitments relating to termination of duties Termination indemnities In accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code and the AFEP/MEDEF Code of corporate governance, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 14, 2018, set the terms of the agreement applicable to Benoît Potier, along the following main lines: )) only the cases of forced departure of Benoît Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within 6 months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity; )) the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration; )) the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Benoît Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company’s articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months’ gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure; )) the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions). The decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 relating to this indemnity was made in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure and published on the Company’s website on February 16, 2018. It was approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9th resolution). Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity The Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Benoît Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary’s performance assessed in light of the Company’s performance, defined as of today as follows: Entitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of the average of the annual gap between the Return On Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed using the net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between ROCE and WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and will be calculated the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place. The proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive: Average over 3 years of the annual (ROCE – WACC) gaps in bps (a) Proportion of indemnity due ≥ 300 100% 250 66% 200 50% 100 25% < 100 0% (a) bps: basis points. Unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers By decision of the Board of Directors in May 2006, Benoît Potier benefits, in his capacity as Executive Officer, from the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are added back to Benoît Potier’s remuneration as benefits in kind. This decision had been approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 9, 2007, in accordance with the regulated agreements procedure (7th resolution). The Board of Directors confirmed, at its meeting in May 2018, that Benoît Potier continues to benefit from this unemployment insurance within the scope of the latest renewal of his duties. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 163 2 Corporate Governance Description of the stock option and performance share plans DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS 1. Allotment policy The Company implements, each year in principle: )) a plan for the grant of stock options to its Executive Officers and its employees; and )) performance share plans for its employees since 2008, and which have been open to the Executive Officers and the members of the Executive Committee since 2015. These grants are decided upon by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations granted by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, and most recently by the Combined Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016 for a period of 38 months. The introduction of performance share plans has enabled the Company since 2008 to have a medium-term instrument of remuneration with complimentary features to those of the long-term instrument of remuneration constituted by the stock options, and to expand the scope of the beneficiaries. The system for the stock options and performance share plans is aimed at three sets of beneficiaries: )) the Company’s Executive Officer, who receives stock options and performance shares and for whom the Board has decided that the grant of performance shares and stock options and changes in that grant over time would continue to be assessed in light of the IFRS value (and not in terms of the volumes granted), taking account of all stock options and performance share plans combined; )) the members of the Executive Committee and the Group’s managers who hold positions with a high level of responsibilities or who make special contributions to the Group, who benefitted up until today from a mixed allocation of stock options and performance shares now exclusively receive an allocation in the form of performance shares (a few of the Group’s managers still benefit from a mixed allocation of stock options and performance shares, the performance shares remain to be preponderant); )) the specific contributors, such as those employees distinguished by the quality of their conduct in exceptional situations, the inventors and innovators, the middle managers, as well as an expanded category of new employee beneficiaries, who benefit solely from performance shares. The criteria used to draw up the lists of the beneficiary employees reflect the jobs and the geographical areas in which the Group carries out its activities and the specific contribution, the particular potential, or indeed the individual or collective conduct of the persons concerned, which has been noted in exceptional situations. The lists of beneficiary employees are also drawn up with the desire to ensure a certain rotation and an expansion of the beneficiary population. Accordingly, 28.03% of the beneficiaries of the Plans dated September 25, 2018 are employees who had not been awarded stock options/performance shares during the last five years.

Stock option plans (Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-184 of the French Commercial Code) Pursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors, following the authorizations of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting and on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted plans granting a certain number of stock options to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries worldwide, including the Executive Officers. These options are granted for a price that may not be lower than the average of the opening trading prices over the 20 trading days prior to the date they are granted. The maximum exercise period is eight years for options granted until June 28, 2010 inclusive, and 10 years as from the October 14, 2011 stock option plan. The options cannot be exercised before a minimum period of four years after they are awarded. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate this lock up period, if there is a public bid for the Company’s shares or a merger or takeover of the Company. The outstanding options thus awarded by the Board of Directors in the context of the authorizations voted by the Shareholders’ Meetings and which have not yet been exercised amounted, after adjustment, to 3,119,897 options (at an average price of 81.76 euros) as at December 31, 2018, i.e. 0.73% of the shares which make up the capital, including 611,731 options (at an average price of 80.98 euros) awarded, during his term of office, to the Executive Officer present as at December 31, 2018. Out of the total stock options whose issue was authorized by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016, there remained a potential allocation of 8,298,309 options as at December 31, 2018. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 165 2 Corporate Governance Description of the stock option and performance share plans TABLE 8 – SUMMARY OF THE ONGOING STOCK OPTION PLANS IN 2018 2010 2011 2012 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Total Date of authorization by the EGM 05/05/10 05/05/10 05/05/10 05/05/10 05/07/13 05/07/13 05/07/13 05/12/16 05/12/16 05/12/16 Date of Board meeting 06/28/10 10/14/11 05/11/12 (e) 09/27/12 09/26/13 09/22/14 09/28/15 11/29/16 09/20/17 09/25/18 Total number of share subscription 532,760 675,680 6,000 704,791 768,866 868,385 467,194 143,240 73,540 73,380 options granted (d) of which Benoît POTIER (a) 88,000 88,000 88,000 100,000 100,000 70,000 60,000 23,100 23,690 of which Pierre DUFOUR (a) 50,000 50,000 50,000 57,000 57,000 39,900 Of which the top ten employee 165,000 172,000 183,000 208,000 212,000 92,090 23,160 7,160 6,540 beneficiaries (excluding Executive Officers) Number of beneficiaries 305 578 1 672 727 863 399 243 204 217 % of share capital represented 0.19% 0.24% NS 0.23% 0.25% 0.25% 0.14% 0.04% 0.02% 0.02% by each grant Rate of achievement of performance 100% 98% 100% 90.50% 94.90% 83.38% 82.50% 82.87% To be To be conditions (f) recorded recorded in February in February 2020 2021 Option exercise period start date 06/28/14 10/14/15 05/11/16 09/27/16 09/26/17 09/22/18 09/28/19 11/29/20 09/20/21 09/25/22 Expiration date 06/27/18 10/13/21 05/10/22 09/26/22 09/25/23 09/21/24 09/27/25 11/28/26 09/19/27 09/24/28 Subscription price in euros 83.00 87.00 97.00 96.61 102.00 97.00 105.00 93.00 104.00 107.00 As at 12/31/2018, subscription price 60.28 63.18 70.44 77.36 81.68 85.66 92.73 84.34 94.32 107.00 in euros (b) As at 12/31/2018, adjusted number 694,675 891,257 8,265 861,330 927,743 963,779 526,896 157,862 81,184 73,380 of stock options (b) As at 12/31/2018, number of shares 674,904 371,925 8,265 244,672 164,832 40,265 3,045 subscribed (d) As at 12/31/2018, number of stock 19,771 76,392 91,961 58,957 194,189 113,693 29,230 1,105 options cancelled (b)(c) NUMBER OF STOCK OPTIONS REMAINING (b) 442,940 524,697 703,954 729,325 410,158 128,632 80,079 73,380 3,093,165* ON DECEMBER 31, 2018 As of % of the share capital 0.72% 429,423,434 (a) Stock options granted (historical data).

Performance share plans (Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-197-4 of the French Commercial Code) 3.1. DESCRIPTION In order to retain and more dynamically motivate talented employees and award their medium-term performance, an additional remuneration system was set up in 2008 involving performance share awards. The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting authorized the Board to grant performance shares to the Group’s employees, within an upper allocation limit equal to 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months; pursuant to this upper limit, it sets the limit on the number of shares which can be awarded to the Executive Officers over the same period, which amounts to 0.15% of the share capital since 2013. For each allocation, the Board determines two different plan regulations (the “France” Plan and the “World” Plan) which govern the award of performance shares to the beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The “France” and “World” Plans essentially differ in terms of the condition of presence which is required – paragraph a) below and the corresponding absence of an obligation to hold shares for the “World” Plan – paragraph c) below. The performance shares are accompanied by: a) a condition of presence during the acquisition period: the shares granted to a beneficiary will only be definitively acquired, if he continues to be an employee or Executive Officer of a Group company during an acquisition period, which is calculated from the award date, of three years for the beneficiaries of the “France” Plan and four years for the beneficiaries of the “World” Plan. In the event of a retirement, the beneficiary shall retain his rights and the condition of presence will no longer be required; b) performance conditions which relate, since the first allocation in 2008, to the whole of the performance shares awarded to any beneficiary; see the performance conditions in the summary table of the awards of performance shares below; c) a holding requirement: with effect from the definitive allocation date, the beneficiaries of the “France” Plan have an obligation to hold the shares for an additional two years during which the said shares cannot be transferred (other than in the event of a death or disability). To date, the performance shares delivered are treasury shares issued as part of the Company’s buyback program (see pages 310 and 311). The outstanding performance shares awarded by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations voted by the Shareholders’ Meetings, whose definitive allocation date has not yet occurred amounted, after adjustment, to 1,539,577 shares as at December 31, 2018, i.e. 0.36% of the shares which make up the share capital. Out of the total performance shares whose allocation has been authorized by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016 for 38 months, 835,188 performance shares remained potentially available for allocation as at December 31, 2018. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 169 2 Corporate Governance Description of the stock option and performance share plans TABLE 10 – SUMMARY OF THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS IN 2018 PPR Plan “Airgas” Plan Performance Performance Performance Performance performance Performance Performance Performance shares 2013 shares 2014 shares 2015 shares 2015 shares 2016 shares 2016 shares 2017 shares 2018 Total Date of authorization by the EGM 05/07/2013 05/07/2013 05/06/2015 05/06/2015 05/12/2016 05/12/2016 05/12/2016 05/12/2016 Date of award by the Board meeting 09/26/2013 09/22/2014 09/28/2015 09/28/2015 07/29/2016 11/29/2016 09/20/2017 09/25/2018 Total number of performance shares 122,595 140,472 287,172 1,132 75,230 426,346 416,579 393,774 awarded (a) of which Benoît POTIER 10,000 20,000 (e) 17,800 17,980 18,230 of which Pierre DUFOUR 5,700 10,000 of which the top ten employee 2,500 2,500 36,166 1,132 22,425 63,046 71,363 69,100 beneficiaries (excluding Executive Officers) receiving the highest number of shares Share capital represented by each award 0.04% 0.04% 0.08% 0.00% 0.02% 0.11% 0.11% 0.09% Number of beneficiaries 1 077 1 248 1 744 5 89 1 955 1 832 1 734 Performance conditions Objective of Objective of nnEPS Annual gap nnRecurring nnRecurring nnRecurring nnRecurring (“France” and “World” Plans), growth in growth in nnTSR, between EPS EPS EPS EPS over a period of three years recurring EPS recurring EPS including Return on nnTSR, nnTSR, nnTSR, nnTSR, for FY 2015 as for FY 2016 as an element Capital including including including including compared to compared to of relative Employed an element an element an element an element 2012 2013 comparison (ROCE) and of relative of relative of relative of relative weighted comparison comparison comparison comparison average cost of capital (WACC) Number of performance shares 13,645 21,459 72,264 15,140 95,824 9,966 cancelled before definitive award Rate of achievement 92,10% 97,12% 82,50% 100% 82,87% 82,87% To be To be of the performance condition (b)(d) recorded recorded in 2020 in 2021 France Plan Definitive award date 09/26/2016 09/22/2017 09/28/2018 09/28/2018 07/29/2019 11/29/2019 09/20/2020 09/25/2021 End of holding period 09/26/2018 09/22/2019 09/28/2020 09/28/2020 07/29/2021 11/29/2021 09/20/2022 09/25/2023 Number of performance shares 34,954 39,962 80,660 1,132 733 18 after definitive award Adjusted number of performance shares 39,936 39,962 91,612 1,270 733 18 after definitive award (c) Adjusted number of performance shares 50,558 156,420 180,286 164,946 in acquisition period (c) “World” Plan Definitive award date 09/26/2017 09/22/2018 09/28/2019 07/29/2020 11/29/2020 09/20/2021 09/25/2022 (no additional holding period) Number of performance shares 70,674 82,912 367 after definitive award Adjusted number of performance shares 74,667 95,103 377 after definitive award (a) Adjusted number of performance shares 158,227 19,529 217,339 270,360 228,828 in acquisition period (c) ADJUSTED NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE 114,603 135,065 91,989 1,270 733 18 SHARES DEFINITIVELY AWARDED (“FRANCE” AND “WORLD”) (c) ADJUSTED NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE 158,227 70,087* 373,759* 450,646 393,774 1,446,493* SHARES IN ACQUISITION PERIOD (“FRANCE” AND “WORLD”) (c) (a) Number of performance shares expressed in historical data.

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS DATED SEPTEMBER 25, 2018 Pursuant to the authorization of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting on May 12, 2016, in connection with the “France” and “World” Plans dated September 25, 2018, the Board of Directors made a conditional allocation of a total of 393,774 shares representing 0.09 of the share capital in terms of the number of shares to 1,697 distinct beneficiaries (164,946 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the “France” Plan and 228,828 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the “World” Plan). The IFRS individual fair value for these performance shares amounts to 98.75 euros for the “France” Plan and to 94.81 euros for the “World” Plan (see details of this IFRS value in Note 22.5 “Share-based payments” in the consolidated financial statements). Subject to the satisfaction of the condition of presence and the performance conditions, these shares will definitively be vested in the beneficiaries on September 25, 2021 for the “France” Plan (but cannot be sold prior to September 25, 2023) and on September 25, 2022 for the “World” Plan. For both these Plans, the Board adopted performance conditions to be calculated over three fiscal years, which are identical to those set for the stock options (for a full description, see pages 132 and 133).

The Board meeting which will approve the 2019 financial statements will assess the level of performance achieved for this additional condition. 172 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Employee savings and share ownership 2 EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND SHARE OWNERSHIP For many years, Air Liquide has pursued an active policy promoting employee profit-sharing and incentive schemes in connection with the Group’s growth and the development of employee share ownership in the Company’s capital. 1. Profit-sharing Profit-sharing and incentive schemes have been organized for many years in Group companies in France and paid almost 48.6 million euros for 2017 performance. This year these schemes cover over 98% of employees in France. Under the main Company Savings Plans, Group employees in France can make payments to dedicated and diversified investment funds, managed by equal-representation supervisory boards, on a voluntary basis or based on profit-sharing, incentives and, where applicable, contributions, and thus benefit from the preferential tax regime applicable in consideration for locking-in their assets over a period of five years. In 2018, L’ Air Liquide S.A. paid 6.47 million euros to 1,196 beneficiaries in respect of profit-sharing and incentives. Company contributions to the Company Savings Plan are negotiated every year and amounted to nearly 1.05 million euros in 2018. These payments correspond to an average amount of 6,180 euros per employee excluding employer contribution. In 2018, L’ Air Liquide S.A. employees invested 83% of their profit-sharing and incentives in savings plans, respectively in bond-weighted assets (43%) and equity-weighted assets (57%). A total of 30% of employee savings was invested in corporate mutual fund holding only Air Liquide shares. 2. Employee share ownership The Group is keen to involve its employees in its development. These employees share ownership transactions contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and sense of belonging to the Group. Since 1986, the Company has regularly performed share capital increases reserved for Group employees, for which subscription is offered at a preferential rate. The most recent capital increase, conducted in November 2018, resulted in the subscription of 1,049,529 shares by 19,078 Group employees, representing 29.4% of the eligible employees in 72 countries (for details of this operation, see the Supplementary Report page 174). In France, the shares subscribed in these capital increases are also eligible for the preferential tax regime applicable provided that they are blocked over a period of five years, while those held abroad are governed by the legal regulations prevailing in each relevant country. At the end of 2018, the share of capital held by Group employees and former employees was estimated at 2.4%, of which 1.7% corresponds (within the meaning of article L. 225-102 of the French Commercial Code) to shares subscribed by employees under employee-reserved capital increases or held through mutual funds. The percentage of Group employees holding L’ Air Liquide S.A. shares totaled more than 43% of the workforce. Air Liquide wishes to pursue this strategy and further the development of its employee share ownership, by regularly offering share capital increases to employees. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 173 2 Corporate Governance Employee savings and share ownership 3. Increase in capital reserved for employees (2018) – Supplementary report To the Shareholders, We set out below the supplementary report pursuant to article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code, on the use we have made of the delegation of authority you granted to the Board of Directors, at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of the Company on May 3, 2017, in the fifteenth resolution, for a maximum period of 26 months, in order, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-138-1 of the French Commercial Code and articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code, to increase the share capital, on one or more occasions, within the limit of 5.5 million shares with a par value of 5.50 euros each, the subscription of such shares being reserved for the employees of the Company and French or foreign companies that are related to it within the meaning of articles L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and article L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code, who adhere to a company or group savings plan. 3.1. AUTHORIZATIONS AND DECISIONS We wish to remind you that, pursuant to this delegation of authority by the Shareholders’ Meeting: )) by decision dated May 16, 2018 and confirmed on July 27, 2018, the Board of Directors decided on the principle of a capital increase limited to 1,500,000 shares in favor of the employees of the Group who have adhered to a company or group savings plan in accordance with the provisions of articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code and article L.225-138-1 of the French Commercial Code; )) for this purpose, the Board of Directors at the aforementioned meetings, delegated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer all the necessary powers to decide on the completion of this capital increase and implement this transaction and in particular: −− to decide on the list of companies eligible for the transaction; −− to set the subscription price (including, where applicable, the subscription prices applicable locally); −− to set the terms and conditions and deadline for paying up the shares subscribed; −− to adopt the dates for the opening and closing of the subscription period; −− to record the creation of the new shares and completion of the corresponding capital increase; −− to deduct the expenses, duties and fees incurred due to the issue, where applicable, from the amount of the corresponding issue premium; −− to amend the articles of association accordingly; −− and to do everything that is useful and necessary for the implementation of the transaction. Accordingly, making use of the delegation of authority granted by the Board of Directors, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer decided, on October 30, 2018, to carry out this transaction, set the opening and closing dates for the subscription period and set the subscription price for the new Air Liquide shares within the scope of the increase in capital reserved for employees. 3.2. MAIN FEATURES OF THE TRANSACTION The increase in capital reserved for employees falls within the scope, provided for by the applicable legal and regulatory provisions, of the France Share Purchase Plan (PE France) and the International Group Share Purchase Plan (PEGI) currently in force. The subscription to this increase in capital was open to employees of French and foreign companies of the Group that were more than 50%-owned by L’ Air Liquide S.A. in terms of share capital or voting rights and who have adhered to the PE France or the PEGI, on condition that these employees have been employed for at least three months at the date of the end of the subscription period (stricter conditions with regard to length of service are set by certain countries pursuant to local regulations). It is to be noted that, pursuant to decisions made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on March 30, 2009, November 2, 2010, October 29, 2013 and March 16, 2016 certain companies, of which L’ Air Liquide S.A. directly or indirectly held 40%-50%, were allowed to adhere to the PE France or the PEGI. Pursuant to a decision by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2018, the same right was also given to Group companies located in China, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, the employees of which were eligible for the 2018 transaction. However, for reasons connected to the local context, employees of the Group’s foreign subsidiaries in the following countries were not able to participate in the transaction: Algeria, Angola, Bahrain, Brunei, Mozambique and Vietnam. The subscription price was set at 87.09 euros (92.53 euros for the United States) per share, the amount corresponding to the average of the opening trading prices of the Air Liquide share over the 20 trading days prior to the date of the decision of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer setting the dates of the subscription period, i.e. 108.85 euros per share (the “Reference Price”); this amount was then reduced by 20% (15% for the United States) and rounded up to the nearest euro cent. 174 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Corporate Governance Employee savings and share ownership 2 The maximum subscription amount per eligible employee was limited to 25% of the gross annual remuneration of each subscriber in accordance with the regulations on employee savings plans (with this limit including in France all other voluntary payments made into employee savings plans or employee retirement savings plans in 2018). An additional employer contribution in shares was proposed by L’ Air Liquide S.A. and the French subsidiaries that have adhered to the France Share Purchase Plan and adopted the 2018 amendment agreement with regard to this point, on the basis of one free share for four shares subscribed with a maximum of three free shares per employee. The subscription period for the shares was open from November 5, 2018 to November 16, 2018 inclusive. Pursuant to the powers given him by the Board of Directors at its meetings on May 16, 2018 and July 27, 2018, the increase in capital was recorded by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on December 7, 2018. The total number of new shares issued is 1,049,529 with a par value of 5.50 euros each, for a total number of 19,078 subscribers. The new shares issued are Air Liquide ordinary shares of the same class and that are immediately assimilated to the Air Liquide shares already admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market (Compartment A). They will be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market under the same ISIN code (FR0000120073) as the existing Air Liquide shares and shall grant entitlement to any dividend distribution decided by the Shareholders’ Meeting after the date of the decision of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer recording the increase in capital. The new shares will be subject to all the provisions of the articles of association. 3.3. IMPACT OF THE ISSUE OF 1,049,529 SHARES ON THE SITUATION OF SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR PERCENTAGE OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND THEORETICAL IMPACT ON THE STOCK MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARE A. Impact on the shareholder’s holding in the Company’s share capital On the basis of the share capital of L’ Air Liquide S.A. at December, 7 2018 prior to the increase in capital reserved for employees, namely 428,344,317 shares, the impact of the issue on the shareholding of a shareholder who owns 1% of the share capital of L’ Air Liquide S.A. prior to the issue and not subscribing to the issue is as follows: Percentage of capital held by the shareholder Undiluted basis Diluted basis (a) Prior to the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase 1% 0.990% After the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase 0.998% 0.987% (a) The calculations are made on the basis of an assumption of the exercise of all the Company’s dilutive instruments existing as at December, 7 2018 which may be exercised, taking into account an average of the last share prices of the Air Liquide share over the last 20 trading days and amounting to 105.24 euros. B. Impact of the issue on the percentage of the Company’s shareholders’ equity On the basis of the Company’s shareholders’ equity as shown by the individual financial statements at December 31, 2018, the impact of the issue on the percentage of shareholders’ equity for the holder of one Air Liquide share prior to the issue and not subscribing to the issue is as follows: Percentage of shareholders’ equity (in euros) Undiluted basis Diluted basis (a) Prior to the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase 29.32 29.59 After the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase 29.46 29.72 (a) The calculations are made on the basis of an assumption of the exercise of all the Company’s dilutive instruments existing as at December, 7 2018 which may be exercised, taking into account an average of the last share prices of the Air Liquide share over the last 20 trading days and amounting to 105.24 euros. C. Theoretical impact on the stock market value of the Air Liquide share The theoretical impact of the issue of 1,049,529 shares at the issue price on the stock market value of the share is calculated as follows: )) Theoretical share price prior to the transaction = average of the last 20 opening trading prices of the Air Liquide share prior to the decision by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer setting the dates of the subscription period (calculated as the average of the last opening trading prices of the share between October 2, 2018 and October 29, 2018). This theoretical price amounts to 108.85 euros. )) Share price after the transaction = [(average of the last 20 opening trading prices of the share prior to the transaction x number of shares prior to the transaction) + (issue price x number of new shares)] / (number of shares prior to the transaction + number of new shares). The average issue price of the reserved capital increase amounts to 87.69 euros. In light of these assumptions, the theoretical stock market value of the share post-transaction would amount to 108.80 euros for a theoretical value of the share price prior to the transaction of 108.85 euros. It is specified that this theoretical approach is given purely as an indication and does not in any way prejudge future trends in the share price.

Note 7 Income taxes 7.1. CHANGE IN THE US TAX RATE In December 2017, the US Congress adopted the US Tax Cuts & Jobs Act of 2017 tax reform, which was signed on December 22 by the President of the United States for final adoption. The federal corporate income tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21% for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2018. Moreover, the accumulated undistributed retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries of US holding companies will be subject to a flat tax of 15.5% (cash reserves) or 8% (other reserves). Consequently, the Group recognized in 2017 a net deferred tax income of 508.1 million euros in “tax expense”, leading to a 20.1% decrease in the effective tax rate. This notably includes estimates of -140 million euros for tax on accumulated undistributed retained earnings of foreign subsidiaries of US holding companies. In 2018, no material corrections have been made to the 2017 estimates. The release of final regulation from the US Department of Treasury will enable to confirm these estimates. 7.2.

The 2018 Group effective tax rate is significantly lower than the 2017 Group effective tax rate excluding the impact of non-recurring items and amounting to 29.4%, mainly due to the US tax reform. In France, L’ Air Liquide S.A. has elected to determine French income taxes on a consolidated basis. This scheme applies to all French subsidiaries complying with the legal requirements. Foreign subsidiaries have elected to apply for similar rules wherever this is allowed under local regulations. Note 8 Discontinued operations Air Liquide is focused on its Gas & Services activities following the Group’s acquisition of Airgas, as well as on the implementation of its company program NEOS for the 2016-2020 period. In this context, at the end of 2016 the Group decided to divest its “Other activities” sector, including the Diving and Welding World Business Lines. After having sold its full stake in Aqua Lung on December 30, 2016, Air Liquide announced on March 2, 2017 that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. for the sale of its subsidiary Air Liquide Welding, specialized in the manufacturing of welding and cutting technologies. At the end of July 2017, Air Liquide completed this disposal.

Discount rates are determined based on Government bonds rates or, when the financial markets are sufﬁciently liquid, on “high-quality” corporate bond rates, which can vary from one period to another. Changes in discount rates can materially change the present value of the Group’s obligations and the expense recorded in the year. The amount of obligations is affected to a lesser extent by revised wages and inﬂation indexes, as well as legal changes regarding retirement age or ofﬁcial mortality tables.

Any adverse movement in these variables would require additional Group contributions to the pension funds on a timely basis.

This Statutory Auditors’ Report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the Management Report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Annual General Meeting of L’ Air Liquide, OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of L’ Air Liquide for the year ended December 31, 2018. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee. BASIS FOR OPINION Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1, 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Large Industries activity: qualification of the contracts and related revenue recognition method Risk identified The gas supply of the Large Industries activity is based on long term contracts with a limited number of customers and requires significant industrial investments. As described in note “accounting policies 3.a. Revenue recognition – Gas & Services” to the consolidated financial statements, these investments are usually made to share production capacity with the Industrial Merchant business line or to serve customers connected to pipelines in an industrial region. In such cases, the Group considers that those assets are not specific to customers as defined in IFRIC 4 “Determine whether an arrangement contains a lease”. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 249 3 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements When assets used for the long term supply agreements are dedicated to a customer, the Group considers, as described in note “accounting policies 5.g. Leases” to the consolidated financial statements, that all the risk and rewards resulting from the utilization of those assets are not transferred to the customers. Accordingly, gas supply agreements linked to those assets are not considered as finance leases. These industrial investments continue to be owned by the Group from an accounting standpoint and are recorded as property, plant and equipment, the full amounts received for the contracts being recognized as revenue. Due to the complexity of those contracts and the impact on the consolidated financial statements of the judgments made when the contract is signed, or in case of subsequent significant modifications, we have considered the qualification of Large Industries long-term contracts and related revenue recognition criteria as a key audit matter. Our response Our procedures consisted in: )) assessing the criteria to qualify these contracts, considering in particular the specific nature of the underlying assets and certain risks and rewards, resulting from the use of the assets, retained by the Group; )) considering internal control procedures implemented by the Group to confirm the compliance of the contracts with standard terms and conditions on which the Group IFRIC 4 analysis is based; )) for the significant new contracts in the current year, assessing the compliance of the contracts to standard terms and conditions and the impact of potential deviations on the accounting treatment; )) verifying the appropriateness of the disclosure included in note “accounting policies 3.a. Revenue recognition – Gas & Services” to the consolidated financial statements, in particular the confirmation that IFRS 16 “Leases”, mandatory from January 1, 2019, will not impact the current accounting treatment of the contracts. Large Industries activity: useful lives of production units and measurement of their recoverable amount Risk identified As at December 31, 2018, the net book value of property, plant and equipment amounts to 19,248 million euros (45,9% of the Group total assets). The Large Industries activity requires significant industrial investment to execute customer agreements. Large Industries production units are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life, usually between 15 and 20 years. The estimated useful lives are reassessed on a regular basis and the resulting change in estimates, if any, are recorded on a prospective basis. In addition, the Group can be exposed to certain risks specific to industrial investments. Expected returns on investment and their recoverable value can, for example, be adversely impacted by overruns and construction delays, start-up conditions, technology changes, geographical location or counterparty risk. As disclosed in note “accounting policies 5.f. Impairment of assets” to the consolidated financial statements, the Group determines on a regular basis whether asset impairment indicators exist. If a triggering event is identified, an impairment test is performed to confirm whether the net book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value. These principles lead the Group to individually test production assets, in particular in case of significant start-up delays, project termination or early termination of related customer contracts. The measurement of the recoverable value of the equipment relies on significant estimates relating to the Group’s capacity to re-use certain equipment for other internal or external customers or to sell the assets to the related customers or to third parties, or to obtain indemnification, notably from customers. Due to the significant value of each production asset and the cumulative value of these assets, the key assumptions used to assess their useful life, their re-use or the compensation to be received, we have considered the depreciation principles and measurement of the recoverable value of Large Industries assets as a key audit matter. Our response Our procedures consisted in: )) assessing the procedures performed by the Group to assess and update the depreciation period of the equipment and the consistency of their useful lives with contractual terms and available technical studies; )) assessing the Group process to identify impairment indicators; )) corroborating, in particular through management inquiries, the reasonableness of the key underlying data and assumptions used for these estimates; )) examining correspondence with Group customers and advisors. 250 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Financial statements Consolidated financial statements 3 Impairment test of goodwill Risk identified In connection with its external growth strategy, the Group monitors the related goodwill at the level of group of cash generating units. For the Gas & Services activity, goodwill is mostly allocated on a geographical basis. For the World Business Units Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, goodwill is monitored at the business unit level. As at December 31, 2018, goodwill amounts to a net book value of 13,345 million euros (31,8% of the Group total assets). The Group performs annually, an impairment test, mostly by reference to market values and, if required, with discounted cash-flows as described in note “accounting policies 5.f. Impairment of assets” to the consolidated financial statements. The determination of fair value and recoverable value, and the sensitivity to the fluctuation of market value and key data and assumptions used, require significant management judgement and estimates. We have considered the measurement of the recoverable value of the groups of cash generating units as a key audit matter. Our response Our procedures consisted in assessing: )) principles used to determine the groups of cash generating units; )) principles and methods used to determine the market value and their measurement based on multiples of market capitalization; )) in particular for cash generating units (or groups of cash generating units) subject to a value in use valuation, management key assumptions and estimates, notably the underlying operating data and long-term growth rates of the cash-flow. We have also assessed with the support of our valuation experts the discount rates applied and performed sensitivity tests; )) the appropriateness of the information included in note 11. Goodwill to the consolidated financial statements. SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the Management Report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial information statement required by article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code is presented in the Group’s Management Report, being specified that, in accordance with article L.823-10 of this Code, the information given in this statement have not been verified by us with respect to the fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated financial statements and has to be subject to a report by an independent third party. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as Statutory Auditors of L’ Air Liquide by the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 5, 2010 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres. As at December 31, 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its third year of uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its ninth year of uninterrupted engagement. Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit, member of the EY network, was Statutory Auditor of L’ Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE 251 3 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements STATUTORY AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: )) identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; )) obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; )) evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; )) assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; )) evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; )) obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee We submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

This Statutory Auditors’ Report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the Management Report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Annual General Meeting of L’ Air Liquide, OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of L’ Air Liquide for the year ended December 31, 2018. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee. BASIS FOR OPINION Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1, 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. Equity investments measurement Identified risk Our audit response As at December 31, 2018, the net book value of the equity investments Our procedures consisted in: amounts to 12,362 million euros and represents 82,6% of the total )) assessing, based on information provided by Management, balance sheet.

The selection of the method used to determine the carrying amount requires significant Management judgement.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as Statutory Auditors of L’ Air Liquide by the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 5, 2010 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres. As at December 31, 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its third year of uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its ninth year of uninterrupted engagement. Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit, member of the EY network, was Statutory Auditor of L’ Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 268 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Financial statements Statutory accounts of the parent company 3 STATUTORY AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: )) identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; )) obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; )) evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; )) assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; )) evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee We submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control relating to the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit and Accounts Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

The Group is currently composed of more than 50 multinationals, including Air Liquide. The initiative is growing rapidly, with 11 new members joining the Hydrogen Council in March and 14 new members in September 2018. If deployed on a large scale, hydrogen could represent almost one fifth of total energy consumed by 2050. This would help reduce annual CO2 emissions by around 6 gigatons compared with current levels and account for 20% of the decrease required to limit global warning to 2°C. Through its ambition to limit global warming, the Hydrogen Council is committed to providing 100% carbon-free hydrogen for mobility by 2030. This objective was presented by Benoît Potier and Dr. Woong-Chul Yang during the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco in September 2018.

Environmental indicators 2.1. LIST OF PRODUCTION UNITS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT The environmental elements that are most representative of the Group’s activities and part of Air Liquide’s Sustainable Development reporting are described below. They cover a total of 565 Air Liquide production units worldwide. Number of Type of production production unit units Applications and environmental footprint Large Air Separation 332 Large Air Separation Units produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, with some sites also producing rare gases Units (ASUs) such as krypton and xenon. These plants “without chimneys” do not use any combustion processes. They are particularly environmentallyfriendly as they emit no CO2, sulfur oxide (SOx) or nitrogen oxide (NOx). They use almost exclusively electricity: worldwide they use about 3,600 MW at any given moment. The electricity purchased from our energy suppliers and consumed by the Air Separation Units is the source of indirect emissions. The cooling systems of these units require back-up water. Hydrogen and 46 Large hydrogen and carbon monoxide units also produce steam for some customers. They primarily use carbon monoxide natural gas as raw material and some water, required for the reaction that produces hydrogen. Carbon units (HyCO) monoxide is an essential raw material in the chemical industry for producing plastics. The desulfurization of hydrocarbons in order to produce fuels with reduced sulfur content is one of the main applications of hydrogen. These units emit CO2 and nitrogen oxides (NOx), but practically no sulfur oxide (SOx). They also consume electricity and their cooling systems require back-up water. Cogeneration units 19 Cogeneration units produce steam and electricity simultaneously. They consume natural gas and water, mostly converted into steam and supplied to customers. The steam can be condensed at these customers’ facilities and then reused in the cogeneration unit. In most cases, the electricity produced is supplied to the local electricity distribution network, which in some countries can be used to power the Group’s other units. Combustion of natural gas produces CO2 and leads to low nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, but practically no sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions. Acetylene units 60 These units produce acetylene, a gas primarily used in metal welding and cutting. 50 of these units produce this gas through the decomposition of a solid (calcium carbide) using water. Two units fill cylinders with this gas, which is supplied by another industrial company. This process produces lime, at least 90% of which tends to be recycled in industrial and agricultural applications. Nitrous oxide units 7 Nitrous oxide is used primarily as an anesthetic gas in the healthcare sector and as a sweetening agent in the food industry. It is produced from ammonium nitrate in solid form or as a water-based solution. Carbon dioxide 72 These units liquefy and purify carbon dioxide, which has many industrial applications, especially in the food liquefaction and industry where it is used to deep-freeze foods or to produce carbonated beverages. purification units Carbon dioxide is most often a by-product of chemical units operated by other manufacturers. In certain cases, it is found naturally in underground deposits. While in others, it comes from the Group’s hydrogen and carbon monoxide units. It is purified and liquefied in Air Liquide units consuming electricity and cooling water. Carbon dioxide is thus reused for other industrial applications instead of being emitted directly into the atmosphere. Units for the 8 These production units for the Hygiene and Specialty Ingredients business are located in France, Germany Hygiene and and China and belong to the subsidiaries Schülke (Hygiene business) and Seppic (Specialty Ingredients Specialty business). Air Liquide experts work closely with hospitals to help them reduce the risk of nosocomial infection Ingredients and contamination, thanks to the products the Group has developed. These units consume natural gas, business electricity and water. Combustion of natural gas produces small amounts of CO2. Engineering & 6 Units for the Engineering & Construction business taken into account in this reporting are located at five sites Construction units in France, China and the United Arab Emirates. They are mainly used for the construction of air separation columns and cryogenic tanks. Biogas units 15 These units process waste to produce biogas, a renewable energy source. Biogas is produced during the methanization of biomass: household waste, industrial and agricultural waste and sewage sludge.

SUMMARY OF THE GROUP’S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 2.3.1. The various Scopes Companies’ greenhouse gas emissions are usually broken down into three “scopes”, depending on their origin. )) Scope 1 includes direct emissions generated by all possible emission sources owned or controlled by Air Liquide. This scope includes: −− the Group’s production units; −− the transport of products to customers or patients. 94% of the direct emissions are related to the nature of the thermal energy used as a raw material by the Group’s large hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units, and cogeneration units (for steam and electricity production). The vast majority of these units use natural gas. )) Scope 2 corresponds to all indirect emissions related to the production of electricity or steam purchased outside the Group in the various countries where it operates. These emissions therefore have a close link with the carbon content of the electricity of countries where Air Liquide operates. Direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1 and 2) represent 99% of the Group’s total reported emissions in 2018. )) Scope 3 corresponds to other indirect emissions generated, for example, by Group employees’ business travel or emissions linked to home-office commuting. 294 2018 REFERENCE DOCUMENT AIR LIQUIDE Environmental and societal reporting Annual reporting 4 2.3.2.

(b) Total of indirect GHG emissions generated by the production of electricity purchased outside the Group. The indirect emissions only concern CO2 emissions. The calculation takes into account the various primary energy sources that each country uses to produce electricity (source: International Energy Agency). * Indicator verified by the independent verifier. The Group’s direct emissions increased from 14.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2017 to 15.4 million tons in 2018, i.e., an increase of 6.3%. This growth is mainly due to the start up of new units, as well as overall increase in sold hydrogen volumes. The Group’s indirect emissions decreased from 11.7 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2017 to 12.4 million tons in 2018, i.e., an increase of 6.4%. This increase is related to the start-up of several large units including worlds largest ASU in South Africa. This growth is counteracted by improvement of overall efficiency of the ASU production units. 2.3.3. Scope 3 emissions related to business travel Business travel by plane, road or train is the source of reported Scope 3 CO2 emissions. Emissions from business travel represented around 210,000 tons of CO2 in 2018 for all subsidiaries, representing less than 1% of the Group’s total emissions. 2.4.

For Air Liquide, seven cogeneration sites in Germany, France Most of the time, environmental incidents in the Industrial and Medical and the Netherlands, along with all of the Group’s large hydrogen Gas business have a very low impact on the environment compared to production sites in Europe were affected by this directive in 2018. the traditional chemicals industry. For example, in air gas production, With regard to hydrogen production units, CO2 emission quotas are any possible leak of these gases does not represent any danger for mostly allocated for free, according to a benchmark set for the top the atmosphere. Likewise, the water used in Air Liquide’s processes is performing European facilities. Air Liquide obtains CO2 quotas from primarily used in cooling and steam production. The risk of possible the market or its customers in order to cover the emissions from pollution of the water used is therefore very low. In 2018, there were hydrogen production sites not covered by the free allocations and for a total of 15 environmental incidents in the Group, mainly involving all emissions from the cogeneration sites. air gas and oil leaks.

In order to maintain this allotment policy, shareholders are invited to renew the existing authorizations. As previously, performance conditions are calculated over three years and are applicable to all options and performance shares attributed to any beneficiary. They are set at the beginning of the year, during the February meeting of the Board of Directors, in order to have a reference period of three full years. Therefore, as from the 2019 stock option and performance annual share plans, the EPS (Earning Per Share) performance condition will be replaced by the ROCE (Return on Capital Employed, which is thus no longer part of the short term variable remuneration criteria). The TSR (Total Shareholder Return) criterion remains a performance condition of the stock option and performance share plans. Moreover, the Board proposes that a deduction of one third to each of the sub-limits for allocations to Executive Officers is submitted to the Shareholders’ Meeting to bring them in line with historic practices in terms of allocations to corporate officers. As previously, the Board of Directors sets annual allocation limits which are considerably lower than these sub-limits. Furthermore, these allocations to Executive Officers come with strict holding requirements for existing securities. Moreover, since 2018, the allotment of LTI (long-term incentive) to Executive Officers is subject to the pro rata principle. In practice, in the event an Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause, the total rate of allocation (after applying the performance conditions) is reduced on a pro rata basis to the number of months during which the Executive Officer was effectively present at the Group during the assessment period for the performance criteria. Finally, according to the principle adopted since 2016, the allocation of stock options and performance shares to an Executive Officer and the changes therein over time are assessed in terms of the IFRS valuation. The purpose of the 13th resolution is to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization given to the Board of Directors in 2016 to grant Company share subscription options or share purchase options, in favor of employees and Executive Officers. Pursuant to the draft resolution, the total number of options that may be granted is maintained at 2% of the share capital over a period of 38 months and the maximum number of options that may be granted to Executive Officers is set at 0.2% of the share capital (compared with 0.3% previously) over the same period. The purpose of the 14th resolution is to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization given to the Board of Directors in 2016 to grant performance shares of the Company in favor of employees and Executive Officers. Pursuant to the draft resolution, the total number of shares that may be allocated is maintained at 0.5% of the share capital over a period of 38 months and the maximum number of shares that may be granted to Executive Officers is set at 0.1% of the share capital (compared with 0.15% previously) over the same period.
