People move from country to city for jobs, education opportunities and cultural offerings. The issues of overcrowding are compounded in towns and cities, while rural areas are left to deal with depopulation. At Gottlieb Paludan Architects, we contribute to easing the congestion in towns and cities and reducing the distance between country and city. For example, we have been involved in designing for the Danish State Railways continuously during the last century. We focus particularly on developing transport hubs, intermodal passenger transport and cohesion with the surrounding urban space – both in Denmark and abroad. It must be easy and attractive to travel – across the country, within the town or city, by public transport, by bicycle, in a car or by a combination of several modes of travel. We regard this as a key job for architects. We design light rails, bus systems, stations, traffic terminals, bridges, urban squares, station forecourts, roads, streets as well as workshops, technology buildings and control rooms, improving travel experiences and traffic flows. In addition, we promote bicycle culture with projects such as foot and cycle bridges, bicycle paths and bicycle parking facilities. However, our mobility solutions are not just about getting from A to B. They must also become part of the surroundings.

An analysis by the European Commission shows that biomass emits 90% less CO2 than coal and gas. 90% less CO2 The Amager Power Plant, BIO4 Gottlieb Paludan Architects has designed a new biomass-fuelled combined heat and power unit for Copenhagen with a ”forest facade” that people can walk in. As a symbol of renewable resources, ‘The forest’ will be a recurring architectural theme for both the new combined heat and power (CHP) unit, BIO4, at the Amager Power Plant and the master plan for the future development of the area. The planting of trees is a principal, distinguishing element of the landscape design. The CHP unit is enclosed by a deep façade made up of suspended tree trunks. The tree trunks are sourced from South African FSC labelled eucalyptus trees. The FSC aims to promote environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world’s forests. The cultivar is thus both sustainably produced and long-lasting. The facade tangibly depicts the changeover from fossil fuels to renewable energy. BIO4 integrates seamlessly with the existing technical installations, while infusing the peninsula with new architectural expression. Though prioritizing security and safety, the architectural design enables visitors to get close to the energy production processes and learn about the re˄ source cycles involved.
