In 2018, the Group occupational health expertise was further reinforced through the appointment of a new Industrial Hygienist. A detailed Group occupational health roadmap will be formalized in 2019. To that effect an Occupational Health Maturity Matrix was defined and will, as with the other matrices in the Group “I-Cube” and SustainAgility programs, be used to support the global program deployment in a continuous improvement cycle. (1) Imerys has a different TRIR definition than many other Groups. Many Groups consider an injury as “recordable” when its treatment requires more than first aid. However, Imerys considers a recordable injury as an accident without lost-time whenever a medical service provider is involved in the treatment, even if the treatment is first aid.

Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main extra-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented with respect to these risks as well as the results of these policies, including key performance indicators. The Statement was prepared by applying the Company’s procedures (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), summarized in the Statement and available on the Company’s website or on request from its headquarters. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie). In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor appointed as independent third party Based on our work, our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on: yythe compliance of the Statement with article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code; yythe fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of article R. 225 105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks, hereinafter the “Information.” However, it is not our responsibility to provide any conclusion on: yythe Company’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions, particularly with regard to the duty of vigilance, anti-corruption and taxation; yythe compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations. Imerys Document de Référence 2018 173 5 C orporate social responsibility Attestation and correlation table Nature and scope of procedures We performed our work in accordance with articles A. 225 1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement and with ISAE 3000 (Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information). We conducted procedures in order to assess the Statement’s compliance with regulatory provisions, and the fairness of the Information: yyWe familiarized ourselves with the Group’s business activity, the report on the main social and environmental risks relating to this activity and the impacts thereof with regard to the respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion, together with the subsequent policies and their results. yyWe assessed the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector; yyWe verified that the Statement covers each category of information stipulated in section III of article L. 225 102 1 governing social and environmental affairs, the respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion. yyWe verified that the Statement includes an explanation justifying the absence of information required by paragraph 2 of section III of article L. 225-102-1. yyWe verified that the Statement presents the business model and the main risks relating to the Group’s business activity, including, where relevant and proportionate, the risks generated by its business relations, products or services as well as policies, measures and outcomes, including key performance indicators. yyWe verified that, when relevant to the main risks or policies presented, the Statement presents the information stipulated in section II of article R. 225-105. yyWe assessed the process of selecting and validating the main risks. yyWe inquired as to the existence of internal control and risk management procedures set up by the Company. yyWe assessed the consistency of the results and key performance indicators used with regard to the main risks and policies presented. yyWe verified that the Statement includes a clear and reasoned explanation justifying the absence of policy regarding one or more of these risks. yyWe verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with article L. 233-16, with the limits specified in the Statement. yyWe assessed the collection process set up by the entity to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information. yyFor the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes(1) that in our judgment were of most significance, we carried out analytical procedures that consisted in verifying the correct consolidation of collected data as well as the consistency of changes thereto; substantive tests, on a sampling basis, that consisted in verifying the proper application of definitions and procedures and reconciling data with supporting documents. These procedures were conducted for a selection of contributing entities(2) and covered between 13% and 47% of the consolidated data for the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests; yyWe consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that in our judgment were of most significance(3); yyWe assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the Company. We believe that the procedures we have performed, based on our professional judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for a limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.

To assist us in conducting our work, we referred to our corporate social responsibility and sustainable development experts. We conducted around ten interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the non-financial statement does not comply with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines. Commentaires Without qualifying the conclusion expressed above and in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we make the following comments: The change of the HR information system during the year, combined with a revision of the nomenclature, has required manual reprocessing of the database and has made it difficult to compare 2017 data with 2018 data, site by site.
