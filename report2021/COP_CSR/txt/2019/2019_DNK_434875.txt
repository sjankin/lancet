In our “Centers of Excellence” a complete system of training rooms, practical rooms, trainers and mentors aiming to expand our employees’ skills and knowledge – we thoroughly prepare new employees for working in an LM Wind Power factory. Safety is a core element of this training program. One of the initiatives we rolled out is the GE Stop Work Authority, which provides us with a tool where we can register risk incidents, follow up on remedial actions and share knowhow and learning across all our plants around the world. The purpose of this procedure is to establish the authority of employees to stop work when their own personal safety and the safety of others is, or is likely to be, endangered by actions, site conditions, or omissions or when environmental damage is likely to occur. It outlines the situations when stop work authority should be exercised, the process to stop, notify, correct, followup and document the interventions. The “stop work” concept and authority links closely to our Critical Safety rules, where we also ask employees and leaders to stop work if the work cannot be done in a safe way. 26 | L M W I ND POWER SUSTA INA B ILIT Y P ERFORMA NCE 20 18 Environment 0.80 0.80 0.31 0.31 Illness Illness Illness Illness and andand and Injury Injury Injury Injury rate rate raterate per per per per Days Days Days Days Away Away Away Away from fromfrom from WorkWork Work Work raterate rate rate 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 working working working working hours, hours, hours, hours, per per per per200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 working working working working hours, hours, hours, hours, compared compared compared compared toto to to 1.35 1.35 1.35 inin in 1.35 2017 in 20172017 2017 compared compared compared compared toto to to 0.30 0.30 0.30 0.30 inin in 2017 in 2017 2017 2017 00 100% 100% Renewable Renewable Renewable Renewable electricity electricity electricity electricity Net Net Net carbon Net carbon carbon carbon footprint footprint footprint footprint (tCO(tCO (tCO (tCO e), e), e),e), consumption, consumption, consumption, consumption, compared compared compared compared 22 22 compared compared compared compared toto to to 239,470 239,470 239,470 239,470 inin in 2017 in 2017 2017 2017 toto to to 15% 15% 15% 15% inin in 2017 in 2017 20172017 25% 25% $$17.8 17.8 Waste Waste Waste Waste reduction reduction reduction reduction Total Total Total Total waste waste waste waste for for for for recycling, recycling, recycling, recycling, savings, savings, savings, savings, compared compared compared compared toto to to compared compared compared compared toto to to25% 25%25% 25% inin in 2017 in 2017 2017 2017 million million $3.0 $3.0 $3.0 $3.0 million million million million in in inin2017 2017 2017 2017 Why is this important?
