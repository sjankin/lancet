The sustainability strategy is there to help the business succeed while aiming to contribute towards a more sustainable planet. Our long-term commitment to become a sustainable company is also echoed through our Swedish brand attributes and our focus on using ingredients from nature. We started updating our sustainability strategy in 2018, with an overall focus on increasing our positive impact whilst reducing any negatives. This decoupling is absolutely fundamental and has led us to the strategy’s three core areas: Opportunities for Consultants, Respect for Nature and Passion for People. More explicitly than previously, we want to capture the core of our business model and how the opportunities given to our Consultants convert into real positive change. This can range from a simple increase in disposable income and the social impact this has on a family, to increased business skills, improved self-esteem and confidence, as well as to a newly acquired sense of belonging. Reducing our most significant impact areas is focused around the actions where we have the greatest opportunity and possibility to achieve change. Our newly set target to reduce our environmental footprint per unit of product with 50 % by 2030* demonstrates our serious commitment to eliminating the negatives of our business. We know that all this is a journey, but recent developments in relation to climate change and biodiversity loss indicate that it has become more urgent than ever to achieve fundamental change. *Baseline 2020. 12 13 Three new strategic focus areas Water Additional Opportunity 1 income for Consultants Opportunity for Consultants Forest Focusing on the value we can offer our Consultants, this section addresses the Growth & Respect income opportunity and subsequent increase in flexibility and freedom.

Development Goals in Agenda 2030. 14 15 Opportunity for Consultants 16 Our business reaches more than three million Consultants every year, giving us a truly unique opportunity to touch lives. This is central to Oriflame’s OPPORTUNITY FOR CONSULTANTS business model, and at the core of our sustainability strategy. The impact our business has on people’s lives is exciting. Every week we are impressed by testimonials from our Consultants. Social selling gives people – most often women – a real opportunity to earn an income within a more flexible framework than traditional employment, and combine it with childcare, studies or working from home. One of the most important advantages is the flexibility and freedom that our Consultants get from the business opportunity. Furthermore, when someone becomes an Oriflame Consultant, they get access to a network, to trainings, to meetings and events. They also earn recognition, which boosts their self-esteem and confidence, as well as their abilities. All these benefits enable development, in places where this impact plays a more important role. To keep moving forward, we want to continue bringing positive sustainable change to our Consultants’ lives while contributing to economic development. Our vision is to become the #1 Beauty company selling direct. By reaching for this goal, our business will become even more accessible to people around the world. This opportunity, together with people’s natural desire to improve their lives, will create real, positive change. 18 19 “I wanted to earn some “It’s lots of fun and I meet extra money.

Measuring their satisfaction provides insights into how our brand is meeting their expectations and how we can work with improvements within each region. We are using the Net Promotor System (NPS) to measure Consultant satisfaction on an ongoing basis. The measure shows us how likely our Consultants are to recommend A direct selling survey Oriflame to a close friend or relative. In addition, we also measure satisfaction of other metrics such as customer conducted by the service, product availability and product quality.

We started by identifying and understanding how we impact the world around us – within our own operations and along the length of our value chain. From this foundaRESPECT FOR NATURE tion we built a sustainability strategy that focused on our most significant impacts and where we have the biggest o ­ pportunities and possibilities to achieve change. Respecting nature starts by truly valuing its contribution. This includes valuing the services nature provides, such as clean air and water, a stable climate, fertile soil and vibrant wildlife. We want to make our business completely environmentally sustainable. Of course, we are already on the path towards sustainability, and are always finding new ways to accelerate towards it. In practice, this means preventing deforestation, avoiding the pollution of air, land and waterways, decarbonising our demand for energy, fuel and ingredients, safeguarding animal welfare, and driving demand for environmentally responsible products both in terms of the formulations and materials we use and the packaging we choose. Our environmental policy is integrated in our Code of Conduct and followed up by 28 goals and commitments. By 2030, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint by 50 % per unit of product produced compared to 2020. 32 33 Reducing environmental impact – our journey All new rinse-off products on the market produced with natural origin exfoliants only.

Oriflame has been involved in the Deepalaya School in Gusbethi, Haryana since 2006, sponsoring the education of 7,000 COMMUNICATE AND ENGAGE girls since last 12 years. Oriflame is to contribute to the construction of a new three-storey building, sprawling over 90,000 sq. ft. area with classrooms and an administrative block. The premises will be accessible to over 3,000 students from underprivileged backgrounds. The Oriflame team inaugurated the premises with much pride, reaffirming Oriflame’s commitment to responsible beauty. Ever since we started our association with Deepalaya in 2006, we have witnessed the extent of change we have brought into the lives of underprivileged children in the area. For many of these children, the school is an educational haven. During its years of association with the company, Deepalaya school has seen an appreciable decrease in drop-out and absentee rates. Oriflame has also donated two buses to the school to encourage the children’s access to education.
