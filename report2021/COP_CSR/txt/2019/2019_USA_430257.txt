In our first annual Communication of Progress, we discuss our current policies and procedures, future goals and last year’s action items that describe how we integrated the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations” Yours Sincerely, Jon Wertjes, President 3 Human Rights Assessment, Policy and Goals At AMK9, adhering to the principles of humanitarian law and human rights is central to our core beliefs and principles. As part of our commitment to conducting operations in a legal, ethical and moral manner, we continue to follow and enforce our organizational-wide human rights policy to further inform and educate our employees. Human Rights Policy The Company will treat all persons with dignity and respect for human rights. The Company recognizes and respects all fundamental human rights and will be guided in the conduct of its business by the United Nations Declaration of Human rights (the “Universal Declaration”) and other applicable human rights documents and principles. These basic rights include the following:  Right to life, liberty, and security of person  Freedom from torture or cruel, inhumane treatment or punishment  Right of Recognition  Freedom of expression and opinion  Anti-Discrimination / Equality of Opportunity  Freedom of Engagement Implementation Reporting Violations Personnel aware of, or who suspect possible violations of the Human Rights Policy, must report these circumstances by notifying their manager, the Chief Legal officer, or by using the Company’s anonymous Ethics Hotline. The Ethics Hotline is hosted by a third party provider so employees or third parties can make reports to the Company on a totally confidential and anonymous basis if so desired. 4 Auditing and Measuring Effectiveness Effectiveness is monitored by an in-house governance program, which is led by an internal executive management team and managed by the Legal Department and the Corporate Quality, Certifications and Safety departments. Both internal and external audits are conducted on all operations, including review of our obligations towards human rights. Findings from these audits, in conjunction with reports made to the Ethics Hotline, are reported quarterly to the Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors. Labour Assessment, Policy and Goals AMK9 is committed to providing a safe and respectful work environment free from threats, violence, harassment, and discrimination. Respecting others and performing with excellence create opportunities to achieve success in our work place. In addition, we have adopted a “zero tolerance” policy for trafficking in persons and will not tolerate the practice in any form. Any employee, or third party, acting on behalf of the Company who directly or indirectly engages in human trafficking will be immediately terminated. Implementation Our Supply Chains AMK9 continues to conduct robust due diligence checks on all companies that do business with us (“Suppliers”). AMK9 requires all of its Suppliers to adhere to The Company’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (“the Code”) which, among other things, clearly states that the Company has “Zero tolerance” for human trafficking and that the Company is “committed to the eradication of human trafficking.” The Code requires that Suppliers comply with the Code in all aspects of their operations that relate to their business with AMK9. In the event of a violation of the code, AMK9 reserves the right to either terminate its relationship with the Supplier. Training All employees are required to complete quarterly training, which covers the following topics:  Zero Tolerance Policy for Human Trafficking  Anti-Harassment Policy  Anti-Retaliation and Whistleblower Policy 5 Environment Assessment, Policy and Goals AMK9 considers its responsibility to preserve the natural environment of the utmost importance and is committed to strict compliance with all laws and regulations governing pollution and other abuse of the environment. AMK9 routinely reviews established policies & procedures in an attempt to decrease our environmental footprint and remain current with environmental best practices. We have established programs for waste disposal, recycling and considerate procurement and reduction in energy consumption. Similarly, we aim to reduce impact on the environment as it pertains to our clients and to the services we provide them. Implementation NKWE Wildlife and Security Services In 2017, AMK9 donated Canine Hunter a Male Dutch Shepard to NKWE Wildlife and Security Services. NKWE specializing in anti-rhino poaching and wildlife security. AMK9 also provided all the canine equipment and handler training. Auditing and Measuring Effectiveness Hunter is still working with NKWE Wildlife and Security Services today and primarily supports their anti-poaching efforts. According to NKWE, Hunter easily tracks throughout the mountainous landscape; without him, much time would be wasted navigating the rough terrain. Hunter has also proven to be a valuable asset in HKWE’s newest endeavor to assist rural farms who are under attack. These attacks primarily occur at night and without K9s, all night operational capabilities would be lost. 6 Anti-Corruption Assessment, Policy and Goals It is imperative that AMK9 employees understand and abide by the applicable laws of the countries in which we conduct business. Compliance with applicable laws reflects our commitment to conduct business with the highest level of integrity. Operating in this manner is critical to building and maintaining the reputation for excellence worldwide. Our Anti-Corruption Policies AMK9 follows established company policies against the engagement in or tolerate bribery or any other form of corruption. The policies prohibit any payment or offer or promise of payment that would violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act (“Bribery Act) or any law of a country where the Company operates. Implementation Training All employees company-wide are required to complete quarterly training related to our AntiCorruption and Bribery Policies. 7
