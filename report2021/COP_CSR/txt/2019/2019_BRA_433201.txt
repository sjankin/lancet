GRI 102-48 Copel 2018 Integrated Report The new transformer will increase the reliability of power supply, Although microgrids are already being deployed in Brazil in structures benefiting more than 500,000 people, among residential consumers, such as condominiums, the difference in COPEL’s project is that, instead commerce and industry, in the region of Maringá and Apucarana. of benefiting only a specific group of consumers, it may extend to neighbors and other users who are not necessarily part of this system. In Bateias, located in Campo Largo, in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, the objective of the investment was to increase the reliability In this first deployment, the initiative will contemplate the adaptation of the electric system, since it is part of the most important branch in of a bio digestion plant that generates energy from methane gas 2018 COPEL IN NUMBERS the capital and region.

Investment in microgrid project in Paraná ABOUT COPEL AND BUSINESS MODELS COPEL developed an innovative initiative in partnership with Itaipu Binacional, involving so-called microgrids, a concept of generation and use CORPORATE GOVERNANCE of energy considered the future of the electric system. The pilot of the OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY Microgrid COPEL-Itaipu Project was installed in the municipality of São Miguel do Iguaçu (PR), based on the generation of energy from biodigesters ENERGY PLANNING AND of swine manure. The system began operating in the second half of 2018. DEMAND INCREASE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT The concept of microgrid basically consists of an “energy island” in which generation, storage and consumption can function connected or not to the SUSTAINABILITY distribution grid. This technology has gained space especially in Europe CAPITAL PERFORMANCE and the United States to assist in grid operation and act as a fast and efficient backup in cases of contingency, especially in remote regions. This GRI CONTENT INDEX is because the microgrid creates a kind of reliability area in which the set APPENDIX of facilities can be inert to the network and continue to feed a group of customers while the main network is repaired. In Paraná, the proposal could bring more resilience to the concessionaire’s grid and contribute to the Mais Clic Rural Program (see page 89). In addition, they act as support in cases of contingency. In this project, there is also an environmental gain, since pig manure have productive destination. 49 COPEL transmission assets Copel 2018 Integrated Report d demand increase 50 Parque Birigui (Birigui Park) Author: Leandro da Silva Bernardino GRI 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, EU7 been hired by the Federal Government.

These standards require compliance with ethical requests, including independence requirements, and that the work be performed with the objective of obtaining limited security that the information related to the GRI indicators, contained in the 2018 Integrated Report, 215 taken jointly, are free from relevant distortions. Copel 2018 Integrated Report A limited assurance work conducted in accordance with NBC-TO-3000 (ISAE 3000) consists primarily of inquiries to the administration of the Company and other professionals of the Company who are involved in the elaboration of information related to GRI indicators in the 2018 Integrated Report, as well as in the application of analytical procedures to obtain evidence that allows us to conclude in the form of limited assurance on the information taken as a whole.
