U K 3 INTRODUCTION OUR STORY African Adventures is an award-winning volunteer travel company that provides humanitarian and financial support to educational projects in Africa, whilst delivering eye-opening and rewarding volunteer experiences for people from across the UK. Company Director Dan Mew first travelled to Kenya in 2007, where he volunteered at a community project called The Walk Centre. Set up by Alex and Patricia Maina, it provided a basic education and lunchtime meal for children living on and around the nearby dumpsite. Dan was so impacted by his time at The Walk Centre, and in Kenya, that he decided to spend his professional life supporting similar projects and increasing access to education or as many disadvantaged children in Africa as possible. Two years later, African Adventures was born, and this year we were proud to celebrate our 10th anniversary. Today, the company employs 14 staff in England and, at peak times, almost 50 across our host destinations of Ghana, Kenya and Zanzibar. Over 6,000 volunteers have travelled with us, and over £585,000 has been given by both African Adventures and African Adventures Foundation our charity arm to aid our partner projects’ development. Our principle aims as a company are to enable development at our partner projects in order to increase access to education for young people, and to provide valuable learning experiences for people from across the UK to increase global awareness. By being a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), we commit to upholding the 10 principles which focus on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption, and to helping to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) regarding peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and in the future.

U K 5 INTRODUCTION FOREWORD 2019 has been a milestone year for African Adventures and I am delighted to introduce our first Communication on Progress report that will explain some of the reasons why. We reached our 10th birthday earlier this year, celebrating a decade of changing lives in the UK and Africa through a sustainable, ethical model of volunteering that our team works tirelessly to deliver, with the core aim of ensuring both our volunteers and partner projects benefit. Over the past 10 years, more than 6,000 volunteers from the UK have travelled with us to Ghana, Kenya or Zanzibar with the goal of making a difference to the lives of young people who have had a less fortunate start in life. In Africa, we now support over 20,000 children across our three volunteer programmes via the partnerships that we have with 25 schools, which are a combination of non-government organisations and government schools. We have a ‘project-first’ policy, which means we focus on putting their needs before our own. This translates into improving facilities for the benefit of their students, by building or renovating classrooms, kitchens, toilets, and security walls, and providing equipment and learning resources. By meeting the needs of our partner projects, we know our volunteers will come back from their experience having achieved their aim. The overwhelming majority of volunteers return home with a renewed sense of purpose, having experienced a new culture and way of life that they have not seen before, whilst putting their time to valuable use. We have seen many volunteers return home as more well-rounded, better informed global citizens. In our three-year development plan, we have committed to improving our work further by introducing mechanisms to more effectively evaluate the work that our volunteers carry out. We will also use the objectives set out in the UN Sustainable Development Goals to focus our long-term aims. This includes ambitious environmental targets, ensuring that we reduce waste at source, offset what we can’t avoid and advocate responsible, reduced consumption across our network of people. I would like to pay tribute to our staff and volunteers who bring our work to life. From the cooks and cleaners, to the group leaders and project staff, we couldn’t do what we do without their commitment to their roles. They have all contributed significantly to the achievements described in this Communication on Progress report. Finally, I would like to use this foreword as an opportunity to reaffirm African Adventures’ commitment to the UN Global Compact and its principles, and to helping drive the UN Sustainable Development Goals through our operations. Yours sincerely, Dan Mew Founder, African Adventures Ali, Imani, Dan and Samson (left to right) 6 W W W.

Siva had a very difficult childhood, becoming homeless as a young boy. His father died when he was young, and, because he had fathered over 50 children with different women, there was not enough money to be shared around the various families, meaning that Siva’s mother and siblings were left with no means of support. Unable to provide for everyone in the family, Siva’s mother was forced to move elsewhere, leaving Siva living on the streets as a young boy. It is impossible to comprehend what Siva went through over the years; needless to say, there were many hellish and heartbreaking experiences, but, inspirationally, Siva managed to turn his life around. He managed to find a job on a farm, and he used the small amount of money that he made to pay his school fees. He attended school for the first time at the age of 14 and found himself learning alongside six-year-olds. Since that time, he has worked very hard to find himself in the position he is today, and he has become a respected figure within the local community. Siva is at the forefront of the work we do in Ghana. His life experiences have shaped the person he is and given him the drive to succeed in helping others. We are honoured to work with Siva.

Finding themselves in a relatively fortunate financial position, they were unable to stand by and do O U R S C H O O L , S O M U C H . nothing when witnessing the plight of children living on the periphery of the Hilton Dumpsite in Nakuru. Many of these children were unable to afford an education, ALEX MAINA so spent their days scavenging on the dumpsite for materials to sell to help support their families. Initially, Alex was able to rent two rooms in a local church, and started providing a basic education and food for 60 nursery-aged children. When the school grew to over 100 pupils, more space was needed, and, with support from a generous donor, The Walk Centre was able to relocate to its permanent site. The Walk Centre was officially registered as a pre-primary school in 2006; by this time, the school was also running a feeding programme for 120 children. What Alex has done for many children in the Nakuru area cannot be downplayed. Together with African Adventures, he has increased access to education for thousands of children, providing them with the opportunity to change their lives. He has dedicated his life to helping others, and we feel privileged to work alongside him. ““ The community in Nakuru faces a number of problems, the root causes of which are poverty. The community near The Walk Centre, where we work in partnership with African Adventures, is a very poor environment, and many people depend on the Hilton Dumpsite to make a living. African Adventures volunteers have helped our community, The Walk Centre, and the children who attend our school so much, by providing teaching assistance, supporting with building ” work, and assisting with sports coaching.

This, in turn, helps to alleviate poverty by increasing access to opportunities in higher education or employment for these children, later in life. C U R R E N T LY, M O R E T H A N Our work with our partner projects has also helped to reduce the number of children who are in employment rather than education. This is especially important in the Volta region of Ghana, where children typically work from a young age to bring in an income instead of attending school. We are working with our partner projects in this region to encourage more children to start school earlier and stay in education longer. C H I L D R E N A R E S U P P O R T E D We are doing this through: •• Funding, and supporting, the construction of new classrooms, so that more children can attend school and, crucially, class numbers are decreased, resulting in a better standard of education. •• Improving the facilities and resources at the projects, to demonstrate to parents and children that it is beneficial to attend. •• Offering volunteer teacher support, which provides an extra incentive for the children to come to school. 18 W W W.

As a child, Eric lived with his grandmother in the slum area of the town’s Hilton Dumpsite, where access to education was severely limited. Many children from the slum were unable to afford an education, and therefore spent their days scavenging on the dumpsite for materials to sell instead. In 2005, Eric began attending The Walk Centre, which had been set up by Alex and Patricia Maina in the same year (see ‘Our Story’ on page 5). Here, he received a free education and a daily meal. In 2009, African Adventures partnered with The Walk Centre in order to increase access to education for thousands of disadvantaged children in Nakuru. As a result of the education Eric received at The Walk Centre, he was able to complete a Bachelor of Science degree in Community Development at Laikipia University. He now works in Nairobi as a Social Worker for One Child Matters, an international development organisation that supports children living in poverty: ““ The Walk Centre has had a very big impact on my life. Alex and Patricia sponsored me from Grade Seven all the way through to university, provided career counselling, and even built a house for my grandmother to live in. They have given me a life. I hope that Alex and Patricia continue the great work they are doing they are truly making a difference, and they have a very special place in my heart. In the future, I would love to set up a community project like The Walk Centre so that I can help more children living in poverty change their lives, IN THE FUTURE , I WOULD LOVE TO ” just as The Walk Centre changed mine.
