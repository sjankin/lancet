So for this reason, we are in a permanent search for the characteristics and trends of the local sustainability context. We abide by a series of indicators closely related to this action; some of them are: 1. Demography Demographically speaking, Romania3 follows the general European Union trend. It is one of the states characterized by a decrease of the population, caused both by negative natural growth and by a significant migration rate. ROMANIA Natural growth as Population in 2016: Net migration 2016: compared with 2015: 19,760,000 -75.7% -35% 2. Labor market The labor market4 is also uneven; this unevenness is prompted by a decrease of unemployment, against the backdrop of the reduction of workforce availability and an increasingly more acute lack of qualified personnel. 3 Eurostat, demographic data: hp://bit.ly/2sEfgbi 4 European Union. Romania – country factsheet: hp://bit.ly/2rPFO6O 16 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs 3. Purchasing power According to OECD, the population’s purchasing power5 has been increasing constantly in Romania, from the equivalent amount of 1,550 USD in 2011 to 1,642 USD in 2016. 1.660 1,642 1.640 1,627 1.620 1,615 1,606 1.600 1.580 1,564 1.560 1,550 1.540 1.520 1.500 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 European Union data6 shows a more accelerated increase of prices in 2018, which will decrease private consumption in the near future. 4. Food consumption According to ScienceDirect7, food consumption is one of the factors with a significant environmental impact, given that almost 60% of the initial weight of the food products will become waste, because of agricultural-industrial and household processing. 5. Waste impact and recycling rate With a total of 220 kg of waste per capita and with more than 95% of municipal waste sent to the landfill, Romania occupies one of the lowest ranks8 in the European Union with regard to recycling. 5 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

The certification is renewed annually. BRC (British Retail Consortium) is used in the standardization of product quality, of processing safety and in the whole process chain; it guarantees us that the manufacturers comply with their legal obligations regarding consumer protection. The certification is renewed annually. FSSC (Food Safety System Certification) proves that the supplier operates with food safety management systems and that they fulfil both the requirements of ISO 22000 and our customers’ expectations. It is renewed every three years. In order to obtain and keep a certification, factories are audited by the certifying organizations. Lidl also conducts audits, additional to BRD, IFS or FSSC. In the reporting period, we conducted: 63 AUDITS IN FACTORIES THAT DELIVER PRODUCTS TO US IN ROMANIA. Our goal is directed towards all of our suppliers to obtain the IFS or BRC certification. At the end of the year, more than 90% of the factories we work with had obtained one of the aforementioned certifications, while for the remaining ones the certification process was in progress. 20 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs Together with our suppliers, we have pledged to There have been, however, cases of customer observe the highest quality standards and the complaints. In the reporting period, we had a total legal regulations. We perform regular checks of the of 10 penalties regarding the quality of the products; products, in order to make sure that they meet the five of these ensued from customer complaints.

These complaints were singular cases, relating to a Of a total number of 1,333 tests conducted in single article and they were not severe breaches that the financial year 2016, 7.2% showed that some could have required batch recalls. improvements are necessary (e.g. weight), but none of them revealed significant departures from the rules. We are also interested in how the customer sees the quality of our products. To this end, we have a mobile laboratory in which we offer food sampling. In the reporting cycle, 1,992 clients tasted 83 articles. After the products were tasted, we modified 6 of the 83 articles (7.2%), according to our customers’ recommendations. The quality of Lidl products also improves owing to their involvement. Quality assurance and the certification of food products sold in our chain stores help us with regard to origin control and to the monitoring of products in all the stages of production and marketing. Our measures are in line with our corporate responsibility policy. In Lidl stores customers will find products manufactured responsibly and sustainably. In our chain stores we do not accept products that do not meet our requirements for the raising of poultry and other animals. For example, as of May 2016, we have stopped marketing eggs from chicken raised in baery cages. Ever since then, we have been selling only cage-free, free range and organic eggs categories 0, 1 and 2. We have also started to work with local suppliers who offer articles with eggs as one of the ingredients to work with in order to replace the eggs from baery caged chicken. As of the end of 2017, all products containing eggs are made with category 0, 1 and 2 eggs. This commitment is valid for all the articles obtained from Romanian suppliers. 21 ASSORTMENT Sustainable procurement We are constantly focusing on the responsible management of resources and we are aware that we need to manage carefully the raw materials we are using now, in order to benefit from them on the long term. For this reason, when we choose the products for our assortment, we seek to provide customers with food produced responsibly and sustainably. Furthermore, we always take measures to improve the quality of the products sold in our stores, as well as to reduce their environmental impact and to generate a positive impact on society and economy. Our product assortment includes: REGULAR ASSORTMENT The articles regularly found in our stores. “IN-OUT” ASSORTMENT A concept by which we provide customers with different products every week. The “in-out” assortment includes both food products (e.g. thematic weeks – Italian week, Romanian week etc.) and non-food products (e.g. clothing items, educational materials, toys, gardening tools etc.). 22 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs Traceability, origin, certifications During the development of a new product, suppliers provide us with details about the ingredients and they have to possess all the information regarding traceability. The labels on our products offer accessible information, which enable our customers’ understanding of the product characteristics. Our weekly magazine and the website also provide information, keeping our customers up to date with our policies, with the characteristics of the products we sell, with our regular offers and with their rights.

To this end, in our stores, we sell MSC (Marine Stewardship Council), ASC (Aquaculture Stewardship) or Dolphin Safe certified fish and crustaceans, and by the end of 2018 we intend to get all the tuna cans we sell in Romania from companies observing the measures described by the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation. MSC certification is the confirmation that fish or seafood products are harvested responsibly. MSC is obtained in compliance with the strictest sustainability standards and the logo confirms fishing solely from sustainably managed sources, as well as fishing practices and tools that do not pose a threat to the existence of other marine life. ASC certification confirms a responsible production of aquaculture seafood, in environmentally responsible farms, observing the rights of the employees and protecting the neighboring communities. The ASC logo on the label is the guarantee of a product obtained with a reduced impact on society and environment, a product that can be traced across its production chain to the originating farm. The Dolphin Safe label is a confirmation of the fact that fish or seafood products are harvested without posing a threat to the existence of dolphins, whales or oceanic environment. We keep away from unreported and unregulated fishing, as well as from illegal fishing methods (IUU Fishing10) and we ask our suppliers not to use raw materials from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Therefore, suppliers agree to use only fishing vessels that are not operated under flags of convenience or are not on the EU “blacklist”. You can consult our policy in this respect on www.lidl.ro 10 For additional information, see the European Union regulations on illegal fishing: hp://bit.ly/2uGAXta 25 ASSORTMENT For the non-food private label branded product we work with suppliers from all over the world. Our work with them takes into account their long-term presence on the local market, a good awareness of the local context and the manner in which they collaborated with our company along the years. An efficient communication across the value chain and a high level of responsibility among our partners help us to respond effectively to social and environmental aspects. Many of the private label branded non-food products are manufactured in Asia, where local suppliers may encounter challenges in meeting our quality standards or the legal requirements. And, because we understand the sustainability context of our activity at international level, we monitor carefully the risks regarding the breach of labor safety, human rights or environmental regulations. We monitor international indicators, such as the Global Rights Index, the Global Slavery Index and the BSCI Country Risk Classification. We maintain a constant dialogue with our local partners, international organizations and the relevant civil society players. Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG was the first German food retailer that adhered to the Greenpeace Detox Campaign11, in December 2014. GREENPEACE With this, they pledged not to include any discharge of hazardous chemicals in their supply chain of private label branded textiles and DETOX footwear. There is a list of chemical products (MRSL) not allowed in the manufacture of textiles and, under the contractual conditions and the Code of Conduct, our business partners are required to observe these rules and not to use the prohibited substances. In the same year, Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG joined the Fur Free Retailer12 initiative. Therefore, we do not sell textiles, footwear or accessories made from the fur of minks, foxes, coyotes, and hares. At group level, we apply strict monitoring and we work closely with labelling organizations, such as OekoTex 100, Bluesign or Fairtrade. Lidl Group was the first German retailer to publish online the list of manufacturing units for private label branded textiles and footwear in the first echelon of the value chain. This list includes approximately six hundred manufacturers, with their full names and addresses, and it is updated every six months. 11 Greenpeace Detox: hp://bit.ly/2rRYCDd 12 Fur Free Retailer: hps://furfreeretailer.com/ 26 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs With regard to the sustainable procurement policy, we approached this topic from four points of view: • what we sell, so that the impact of the product design and production process is as low as possible; • to whom we sell, so that the supply process has a low impact; • how we communicate, so that our interaction with the suppliers, manufacturers and customers has the lowest negative impact on consumption and food loss, on how non-food products are used and on what remains as waste; • the number of products and services we acquire from the local market. We want to make known the fact that we operate with good conduct principles13 that we observe in all the relationships with our partners. All those who believe that Lidl or its employees in Romania use business practices contrary to these principles may apply the litigation selement mechanisms and may obtain a quick solution to the problem. The selement service operates independently from the procurement one and contact is available by e-mail at solutionarelitigii@lidl.ro. Of course, the procedure does not exclude the claimant’s right to other selement mechanisms, including a procurement department employee able to respond to all these types of claims. As REAP (Retailers’ Environmental Action Programme) members, our group has aligned to a number of goals transposed also at national level. These goals relate either to how we streamline the use of resources (aspects described in the environment section of the report) or to the procurement-related practices. Furthermore, since 2014, we’ve also commied to the voluntary compliance with the good practice principles adopted by the High-Level Forum14, the EU initiative for the improvement of the food supply chain operation. 13 Lidl Principles and Code of Conduct: hp://bit.ly/2mB7gDH 14 The Supply Chain Initiative: hp://bit.ly/1BoMaI0 27 to create new perspectives and smiles SOCIETY 28 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs The Society Chapter covers the following topics considered relevant following the dialogue with the stakeholders: Social actions and campaigns, sponsorships For a beer future 29 SOCIETY Involvement in the community The input of Lidl in the development of our society and its support of social causes represent a relevant area for both internal stakeholders as well as external collaborators and partners.

We have started to get involved in the community ever since we entered the Romanian market. With the expansion of our chain and with the opening of Lidl stores in more and more cities throughout Romania, we diversified the projects we support and we increased the amount of the financial contributions. In the financial year 2015, we offered more than 1,315,006 lei to projects and programs developed by organizations such as: Salvați Copiii, SMURD, Hospice Casa Speranței, World Vision and Lile People. 1.6 million EUROS In the reporting period, we continued to support the organizations with more than 7,000,000 lei (approx. Aside from a hot meal, more than 3,000 children included in the World Vision programs received Christmas gifts (clothes, footwear and sweets) and Children’s Day presents (educational materials). By 2020, we intend to reach a higher number of children helped by our organization each year. 1.6 million euro), an increase by 85% as compared to 2015, which meant support to more than 30 organizations. These organizations implemented projects during the calendar year 2017; they will be described in the next reporting cycle. 30 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs One of our long-term partnerships is with SMURD Another national project started 5 years ago is Verde (Mobile Service of Emergencies, Resuscitation and la educație pentru circulație (Green light for trafficExtrication).

During these campaigns we donate 1 leu for each sold unit from a specific category of products. We organize two such campaigns every year, one at the beginning of the school year, where we donate 1 leu per sold article from the Back to School offer, and one campaign at Christmas time, where we give 1 leu for each toy that we sell. The first campaign was organized in 2016, 1 leu pentru leul curajos, together with the Association Lile People. We donated 1,005,192 lei. Then we continued with the Christmas campaign, together with World Vision, whereby we donated 987,500 lei for the program Pâine şi mâine. 1,992,692lei 32 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs 10% Subject to the economic context of our activity, we intend to increase the budget by 10% and to promote projects and organizations strategically linked with our company’s activity.

We have replaced the air conditioning and the electric equipment, we redesigned the furnishing system for the sales area and we implemented the BMS (Building Management System). For the decrease of water consumption, green areas were equipped with drip irrigation systems replacing the conventional sprinklers. Our strategy stipulates an analysis, once every five years, of all the stores that require modernization. This relates both to the safety of the buildings and to the new requirements for the sales areas. For this reason, in 2016, some of our stores The refrigerated display cases installed underwent a process of modernization, which also aimed at during the modernization of the stores are replacing non-efficient energy systems. advanced systems and have an energy consumption level 20% lower than the old ones. 36 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs Chain store expansion We are constantly seeking to expand the chain stores, both by acquiring new land and building new stores, with a low environmental impact, as well as by the construction and reorganization of the product storage sites, for the streamlining of store supply. In the reporting period, we opened 12 stores and the warehouse in Lugoj, Timiş county, which will LIDL LUGOJ WAREHOUSE soon be BREEAM certified. BREEAM certification is the most frequent method for the assessment of a building’s environmental performance and it helps us to build responsibly, to limit both the environmental impact and the operational costs. It also offers a more productive and healthier work space. At present, for the construction of new stores we use a standard design of building, without upper floors, with an optimized glazed surface and a light line across the long façade, for a significant reduction of energy consumption and for the spaces requiring special temperatures. The optimization of energy consumption and the use of recycled construction materials (e.g. the For our future construction projects, we intend use of crushed concrete from demolitions) are to keep and complete the steps for a responsible provided since the design phase.

We built this office in line with the highest environmental standards and we are to obtain the BREEAM certification, meaning that the environmental impact will be as low as possible. NEW ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE LIDL ROMANIA Another example illustrating our intent to build responsibly is the Lidl store in Pantelimon, a district in Bucharest. Based on a new project, it provides our customers with an improved buying experience, a work environment adjusted to the needs of the colleagues working in the store and a low environmental impact. Having a green roof – the first one in our portfolio – the store helps decrease the greenhouse gas effect in the area, by absorbing dust and carbon dioxide, but also by decreasing the air temperature. It also supplies a micro-habitat for birds and insects. The roof also contributes to the building’s energy efficiency, by cooling the construction naturally during warm seasons and by heating it during cold seasons. It also filters stormwater naturally and it decreases significantly the amount of water discharged in the sewerage systems. STORM MICRO-HABITAT GREENHOUSE ENERGY WATER FOR BIRDS GAS EFFECT EFFICIENCY NATURAL AND INSECTS REDUCTION FILTERING LIDL STORE PANTELIMON In November 2016, we also opened the greenest store in our portfolio, in the Bucharest Băneasa area. We used recyclable and recycled materials (e.g. crushed concrete from demolitions), skylights allowing natural lighting in, LED and occupancy sensor lighting system. The roof has photovoltaic panels able to generate the energy necessary for the operation of the store of up to 100%, depending on weather. The store will obtain the BREEAM certification and it was designated “Best New Retail Concept” in the annual competition Progresiv Awards 2017. 38 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs Resource efficiency increase Water Water is one of the most important resources, which is why we monitor consumption monthly. For the detection of water losses, we track consumption values permanently. Our colleagues in the logistics centers and inside the stores are trained to monitor and notify promptly any fault in the water supply systems (pipes, tubes), which will allow their quick repair, thus preventing potential losses. Some of the measures taken to decrease the water quantity used in the company include also the mounting of rainfall sensors in all our stores in which we have irrigation systems, so that the laer do not operate when it is raining. We have a store in which we implemented a pilot-project – the water is collected, treated and used in the sanitary fixtures. OVERALL, IN THE REPORTING PERIOD, WE HAD A CONSUMPTION OF 232,420 CUBIC METERS OF WATER AND 341,541 CUBIC METERS OF STORMWATER DRAINED ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS 15 IN FORCE. 15 Order no. 88/2007 of ANRSC (National Regulatory Authority for Public Local Management Services). 39 ENVIRONMENT Energy and renewable energy According to the energy label16 submied by our energy suppliers, the primary sources that we used were: renewable energy (44.89%), coal (26.29%), nuclear (15.35%), natural gas (12.55%), heating oil (0.45%) and other conventional sources (0.47%). 1 2 renewable coal energy 26.29% 44.89 % The total quantity of active energy used in the 3 4 reporting period in our stores and warehouses was 97,359 MWh. It is supplemented by 21,880 MWh natural gas generated from gas. As compared with 2015, despite 15.35 % the fact that we increased the number of stores and 12.55% opened a warehouse in Lugoj, in 2016 we managed to decrease the amount of energy consumed per square meter, owing to the implemented energy efficiency measures (from 222.64 kWh/m2 in 2015 to 221.51 kWh/ m2 in 2016). 5 6 heating oil other conventional 222.64 kWh/m2 0.45% sources 0.47% 221.51 kWh/m2 3 4 5 6 To ensure efficient energy use, we conduct regular 2 energy audits, both inside the stores and inside our logistics centers. We operate with a system (GLT) which monitors in real time the consumption in each of our units. The system has a number of energy 1 meters per different category of consumer. 16 According to ANRE Order no. 69/ 2009 – Electric Energy Labelling Regulation. 40 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs All the refrigerated display cases and refrigerating Moreover, six Lidl stores (two in Bucharest and four rooms are fully deiced and cleaned regularly to in other cities) are provided with heat-pump heating ensure their optimal consumption.

Heat-pumps which the display cases are closed in the stores to are at least 70% more economic than a conventional reduce energy losses. Furthermore, 150 refrigerated system. boxes were replaced in order to streamline energy consumption. We are monitoring the energy consumption at all times, which allows us to detect quickly and to act promptly when excess consumption occurs. We take constant measures for the improvement of the systems. For example, in three stores modernized in 2016, the old HVAC system was replaced completely and now it is operating with the BMS. This is a computerized system allowing the monitoring and controling of the building’s electric and mechanical equipment, such as the ventilation, the indoor and outdoor lighting system and the electric equipment. Two of our logistics centers and all our stores have already implemented the outdoor LED lighting system. All the stores that we will build will have both indoor and outdoor LED lighting. The lifespan of the LED lighting system is three times higher than the one of a conventional lighting system, and the energy consumption is considerably lower for the same level of light intensity. 41 ENVIRONMENT Transport and the carbon footprint Logistics (warehouse-store transport of goods) and warehouse fleet The transport17 of goods has a vital role in our activity and a significant social and environmental impact. This aspect is also emphasized by the fact that the standards for the means of transport, the fleet we operate with and the manner in which we transport the goods or in which our employees travel have been relevant for the partners we consulted. For this reason, we carefully monitor these processes and we optimize them, in order to reduce the negative impact. Our four warehouses ensure optimal supply routes and a balanced number of stores is IERNUT aached to each warehouse (Lugoj, Iernut, Mureș County Chiajna, Nedelea). The Lugoj warehouse was opened in November 2016. In the reporting period, along with the LUGOJ NEDELEA opening of the warehouse, we reduced the Timiș County Prahova County average distance of transport between the warehouses and the branches by 29%, from 231km to 164km travelled, at the end of the CHIAJNA reporting period; we also reduced the fuel Ilfov County consumption by 16%. -29 % AVERAGE TRANSPORT DISTANCE ON THE STORE-WAREHOUSE ROUTE FROM 231 TO km 164 km 17 Since the logistics / transports sector is not covered as such by the GRI standards used in the writing of this report, we consulted the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) for guidance and we used a pilot-methodology: the sector supplement project for logistics and transports, drafted by GRI. 42 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs In the reporting period, we worked with almost 30 exceeding the admied load weight or for the transport service suppliers, owning a total number of transport conditions.

We are constantly taking measures to reduce the quantity of packaging and to send the waste to the recycling centers. From the outset, we have focused on the use of as few packages as possible, in order to reduce the quantities entered on the market, which then should be sorted and recycled. For this reason, we adapted all packages to the type and characteristics of the products, in order to use the strictly necessary amounts. For example, we created PET bole shapes that ensure improved stability, by using as lile plastic as possible. We continue our search for solutions to reduce the quantity of packages. One example is the project aiming to reduce the plastic weight in 2l Freeway PET boles, from 42 g to 33.8 g, starting with 2018. This will mean savings of 24.5 tons of plastic per year. Because we are also concerned with the origin of the materials in our packaging, we intend that FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certification should become mandatory for all our local suppliers who manufacture labels and boxes. Half of the packaging of private label branded products which are purchased from Romania are already aligned with this requirement. In the bakery area, for example, paper bags are completely obtained from FSC certified manufacturers. Starting from 2018, all the labels and boxes for private label branded products purchased locally will be certified by FSC. 45 ENVIRONMENT In the calendar year 2016, the total quantity sorted in our stores and warehouses and taken to the recycling centers amounted to 23,520.596 tons. 758.276 tons 750.550 tons WOOD 3.224% IRON 3.191 % 31.288 tons BATTERIES 1.117.099 tons PLASTIC 0.133% AND FOIL 4.749 % 0.751 tons FLUORESCENT 0.003% 20.862.632 tons PAPER AND 88.699% CARDBOARD With the help of our colleagues, we sought to increase the waste quantities sorted in the stores and warehouses, as well as in the headquarters and regional offices. Therefore, in order to enable their involvement in our actions aimed at reducing the environmental impact we will increase the number of waste sorting recipients in stores (kitchens), the headquarters (office building) and the regional offices. We also know that our customers want to be able to return the purchased packaging. To this end, we will create a new type of waste sorting recipients, the same for all the branches, to be placed in an accessible spot for the customers. 46 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT #ResponsibleforUs Food waste According to the Eurobarometer22 and to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), one third of the annual food production across the world is wasted or lost. In the European Union, this quantity amounts to 88 million tons, i.e. on average 173 kg of food waste per person. The same sources estimate that 5% of this quantity is generated by the retail activity. Across the country, Food Waste România23 estimates that, overall, Romanian consumers generate, every year, 5 million tons of food waste; 5 million of these, more than 60% are fruit, vegetables and bread. According to tons of the same source, this happens because half of the Romanian population food waste allocates nearly 40% of the family budget to buying food products.
