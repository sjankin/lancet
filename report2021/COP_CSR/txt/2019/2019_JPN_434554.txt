Article 1 of the Norinchukin Bank Act states that this role of the Bank in Japanese society is our only and ultimate mission that each of us—directors and employees—never forgets while working regardless of the ﬁeld. To fulﬁll the mission, the Bank conducts various activities in the three business areas of the “food and agriculture business,” the “retail business” and the “investment business” and the corporate functions that support each of the Bank’s businesses. The domestic agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries, which are the foundation of the Bank’s businesses, are vital and precious industries with the important functions of The Norinchukin Bank producing food that nurtures “life,” revitalizing local communities and preserving the naKazuto Oku tional lands. Although it is discussed globally that these industries might be posing an President and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer environmental burden mainly by emitting CO2, in Japan these industries are contributing to the environment through the progress in environment-friendly agricultural operations, the development of resource-managed ﬁsheries and the outcomes of the multifaceted functioning of forests through measures such as thinning and reforestation. With ﬁrm recognition of such a situation and current issues, the Bank has established the Sustainability Topics (ﬁve focus areas and 14 topics) aiming for the Bank’s business operations to be sustainable by providing solutions to environmental and social issues. By formulating medium-term sustainability goals as the ideal vision for each topic, the Bank intends to promote sustainability management to realize each topic. June 2019 Our Spirit Condensed in the Bank’s Corporate Logo The landscape depicted here represents Japan itself where agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry are connected to all life. The tapestry woven from the earth, the seas and the forests portrays the breath of life and the strength of the will that carries each one of us forward, step by step. Our businesses exist together with the “life” nurtured by the operations of the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries in line with the cycles of nature. The Norinchukin Bank engages in measures to solve environmental and social issues and contributes to realizing sustainable primary industries and society through its business activities, which are deeply rooted in local communities. These are the roles that the Bank has fulﬁlled to date and we will continue our efforts for further contributions. 3｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Outline of Sustainability Management Responding to the Changes in Social Responsibility Required of Corporations Given the non-continuous changes in Japan and overseas such as the increase in the global population, the low birth rate and aging society in advanced countries, climate change, the loss of biodiversity and issues of economic disparity and poverty, we are now at a signiﬁcant turning point, being required to create value not only to build on the status quo but also to assume future changes. In addition, given the progression of the initiatives toward the sustainable development of society such as “Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)” by the United Nations and the “Paris Agreement,” which is a new framework of measures to address climate change, expectations are on the rise for corporations to address such social issues. Given these changes, the Bank recognizes the rapid changes in the roles expected of corporations. Currently, corporations must contribute through business activities to the sustainability of their business foundation, that is, environment and society (= sustainability management). The Bank’s brand statement is “Dedicated to sustaining all life.” Returning to its origin—a ﬁnancial institution based on agricultural, ﬁshery and forestry cooperatives—the Bank strives to address the sustainability issues that are important for the Bank and its major stakeholders appropriately, aiming to improve the sustainability of environment and society, as well as the Bank’s management.

United Nations Global Compact The Bank signed the Global Compact advocated by the United Nations in November 2016, thereby supporting the Ten Principles, consisting of the four areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption, and further promoting the initiatives toward the sustainable development of Japan and international society. CDP The CDP is an NGO conducting international activities. Responding to the requests from institutional investors, the CDP sends major international corporations a questionnaire related to climate change, water resources, forests and commodities, and then analyzes, evaluates and discloses the collected answers, thereby giving signiﬁcant inﬂuence to global ESG investments. The Bank signed onto the CDP in March 2017. Equator Principles The Equator Principles is a risk management framework that provides private-sector guidelines related to environmental and social risks mainly in project ﬁnance. The Bank adopted the Equator Principles in May 2017. 8｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Participation in Major Initiatives Principles for Financial Action for the 21st Century The Principles for Financial Action for the 21st Century were adopted in October 2011 as action guidelines for ﬁnancial institutions that aim to establish a sustainable society. The Bank signed the Principles in March 2012. At the General Assembly in ﬁscal 2015, the Bank’s Nochu Potential Forest Productivity Fund was selected as a preferred project of the year. TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in December 2015. The Bank endorsed the recommendations of the TCFD in April 2019. The Bank will address the predictable impact and risks posed by climate change on the Bank’s businesses appropriately, work on the initiatives based on the TCFD recommendations and expand the related disclosure. 9｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019-FY2023) Medium-Term Management Plan —Catch the Winds of Change. Create New Value.— The Bank conducts business and organizational management under its Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019-FY2023) with a goal of becoming the “Leading Bank that Supports the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry Industries, Food Production and Consumption, and the Daily Lives of Local Communities.” In each of its three business areas of “food and agriculture business,” “retail business” and “investment business,” and the corporate functions that support each of the Bank’s businesses, the Bank aims to contribute to achieving SDGs in the ways described below through business activities toward a sustainable environment and society, which is the foundation of the Bank’s businesses. Food and Agriculture Business Major Initiatives in Our Food and Agriculture Business under the Medium-Term Management Plan • Help increase agricultural production, increase income for agricultural producers and revitalize local communities through agricultural loans, investments and solutions • Provide food and farming education and training farm operators • Help strengthen the vitality of ﬁshery communities by performing the Bank’s functions as the main bank for ﬁshery industries • Lead the growth of forests and the forestry industry mainly by supporting forest rejuvenation and the expansion of lumber use • Support the development of the agricultural industry by establishing the food and agriculture value chain that connects producers, industries and consumers The SDGs That the Bank Contributes to Achieving Through Initiatives in the Food and Agriculture Business 10｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019-FY2023) Retail Business Major Initiatives in Our Retail Business under the Medium-Term Management Plan • Provide ﬁnancial network services across the country • Promote the life-plan support business for individual members and customers who lead the growth of the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries • Offer services leveraging the strengths of multi-purpose cooperatives which could handle various businesses The SDGs That the Bank Contributes to Achieving Through Initiatives in the Retail Business Investment Business Major Initiatives in Our Investment Business under the Medium-Term Management Plan • Realize investments with consideration to sustainability and global trends The SDGs That the Bank Contributes to Achieving Through Initiatives in the Investment Business 11｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Medium-Term Management Plan (FY2019-FY2023) Corporate & Shared Services Major Initiatives in Our Corporate & Shared Services under the Medium-Term Management Plan • Realize operational reforms by promoting digital innovation • Address climate change • Establish a sophisticated business administration structure that is well adjusted to changes in the management environment • Foster a sound risk culture • Promote the creation of a worksite where diverse human resources can perform to their fullest potential • Support employees’ growth through training and other opportunities The SDGs That the Bank Contributes to Achieving Through Initiatives in the Corporate & Shared Services 12｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Dialogue with Experts For further evolution of the Bank’s sustainability-related initiatives, the Bank holds “Dialogue with Experts” sessions. The First Dialogue with Experts (February 2019) In February 2019, the Bank implemented a dialogue session with experts related to sustainability with the participation of Senior Managing Directors (Representative Directors), directors and employees. Given that the Bank is a primary industry–based cooperative, we asked the sustainability experts what kinds of business activities the Bank is expected to conduct toward the realization of a sustainable society. After receiving their insights, we exchanged opinions. Fiscal 2019 marks a new step by the Bank toward sustainability management. Reﬂecting the experts’ opinions, the Bank’s directors and employees together will further promote sustainability initiatives with concerted efforts. Sustainability Experts Mr. Takejiro Sueyoshi Ms. Kaori Kuroda Special Advisor to UNEP FI Executive Director, in the Asia Paciﬁc region CSO Network Japan Mr. Masataka Mitsuhashi Mr. Norichika Kanie (Facilitator) Professor, Graduate Chairman, PricewaterSchool of Media and GovhouseCoopers Sustainernance, Keio University ability LLC 13｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Dialogue with Experts Major Opinions Take the Trend or Get Left Behind Today, the SDGs and the “Paris Agreement” are changing the world. Toward the realization of a decarbonized society, creative disruption—the simultaneous progression of the disruption of conventional frameworks and new creation—is emerging in various ﬁelds. Such creative disruption will lead to the birth of new risks and new opportunities in the ﬁnancial ﬁeld. We expect the ﬁnancial ﬁeld to play a role in supporting the shift to a decarbonized society and ﬁnding new sources of growth in Japan. Mr. Takejiro Sueyoshi How to Address Various Human Rights Issues Regarding human rights, there is increasing recognition of “human rights due diligence,” which not only establishes a system for respecting human rights but also continually observes, evaluates and improves the system, although progress has been slow in Japan. Concerning the issue of gender equality, Japan’s gender gap index is 110th in the world, which is extremely low. The whole country needs to work on this issue. Given that the preface of the SDGs mentions human rights and gender, we need to focus on these themes across the board in promoting our initiaMs. Kaori Kuroda tives to address the SDGs. How to Address the SDGs An important aspect of the SDGs is visualizing the existing initiatives in common language. Most companies have a philosophy that references social contribution through business activities. Promoting initiatives to address the SDGs provides an opportunity to return to a corporation’s origins. In Japan, most large-scale companies have started to address SDGs. From now, I believe that the emphasis will shift from large-scale companies to mediumand small-scale companies, and from metropolises to suburbs. Therefore, it will become important to generate and share Mr. Norichika Kanie preferred case studies in promoting related initiatives. Concluding the Dialogue Session The Bank’s Brand Statement Formulated Two Years Ago “Dedicated to sustaining all life.” This is the value of our existence. This value—to contribute to “life” through various initiatives— certainly links to sustainability, I believe. The most important thing is, I think, that all directors and employees of the Bank have a perspective of “how our businesses contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.” To realize a sustainable society, the Bank will work via the uniﬁed efforts of all directors and employees. Thank you very much for your valuable opinions and suggestions.

Contribution to the Agricultural Industry Positioning the revitalization of agriculture as a facet of the Japanese government’s growth strategy, interest in domestic agriculture is on the rise. To advance agriculture as a growth industry, agricultural leaders who can drive that growth will need to be secured and cultivated. Along with its industrial aspect, agriculture serves multiple functions and plays a major role in maintaining Japan’s national lands. As a member of the JA Group as well as a ﬁnancial institution that plays an integral part in JA Bank, the Bank supports the development of agricultural leaders who will sustain the country’s agriculture going forward and the development of agricultural management by facilitating a smooth fund supply and offering diverse solutions to the food and agricultural ﬁeld. Contribution to the Fishery Industry Living in a country surrounded by the ocean, everyone in Japan has enjoyed the bounty of the seas. To pass on these marine beneﬁts to future generations, we must protect the seas and promote a sustainable ﬁshery industry. As a member of the JF Group, the Bank is coordinating with ﬁshery operators and people in coastal areas to protect the seas and the lives of community residents. Contribution to the Forest Industry Japan is a forest country with forests covering 70% of its land area. Japan’s land has been covered by greenery thanks to a moderate climate and ample rainfall. However, 40% of Japan’s forests are man-made and were planted after World War II. Many of these man-made forests have been neglected due to sluggish lumber prices and a decrease in the number of forestry leaders. We need further initiatives to protect forests, which are a valuable resource. The Bank supports the revitalization of Japan’s forests and forestry industry through the Norinchukin Forest Rejuvenation Fund (Nochu Potential Forest Productivity Fund). Reconstruction Support Efforts Eight years have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake. But, looking at the disaster-affected areas as a whole, there are regions where the reconstruction process is still only half-way complete. As a cooperative organization founded on the agricultural, ﬁshery and forestry industries, The Norinchukin Bank will continue to provide full and multifaceted support for the reconstruction of agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries and local communities. 36｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Contribution to the Development of the Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry Industries Contribution to Local Communities In addition to business operation, the Bank conducts various activities in each region to contribute to the further development of local communities as a community member. Contribution to Local Communities and Society Hana Ippai Campaign • Donation of ﬂower seeds and ﬂower bulbs to local authorities, various kinds of schools and social welfare councils, etc. • Co-sponsorship of greening promotion activities in each region • Participation in planting and plant cultivation events Hana Ippai Campaign Environmental beautification activities • Participation in volunteer cleaning activities • Donations to environmental beautiﬁcation groups and events Citizens participating in largescale cleanup Support for the promotion of local communities • Co-sponsorship of regional development activities organized by local authorities, JA, JF and JForest groups Social welfare activities • Volunteers among the Bank’s employees worked together to collect donations (NHK fundraising campaigns at year-end as well as overseas relief efforts, the Japanese Red Cross Society, red feather campaign by the Central Community Chest (also known as the Red Feather), year-end educational support for the children of ﬁshery boat disaster victims and the Green Fund, among others) • Dispatching a support squad to regions affected by the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes and cooperation in related donations • Cooperation in crime prevention and trafﬁc safety activities • Participation in call for blood donation campaign 37｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Contribution to Local Communities Initiatives outside Japan • Donations to funds, etc. • Co-sponsorship of various kinds of events • Participation in tree-planting and other events Tree-planting activities in Singapore branch Environmental and Natural Protection Activities Cooperation in global warming prevention and biodiversity preservation activities • Promotion of the use of domestic thinning lumber (Donations of wood products), tree education activities • Co-sponsorship of the Wild Bird Society of Japan • Participation in ﬁshermen’s forestation activities Donation of wood products Education and Study Support Activities Endowed lectures at universities • Waseda, Tokyo University of Science, Keio, Hitotsubashi, Kyoto and Hokkaido (Performance for FY2018) Endowed lectures: Citizen symposiums at Hitotsubashi University 38｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Responsible Finance Responsible Investments and Loans To conduct investments and make loans in Japan and overseas using funds entrusted with JA Bank and JF Marine Bank, The Norinchukin Bank has formulated policies for appropriate operations and engages in such activities in a well-structured manner. Basic Policy on Finance In addition to the fundamental mission stated in Article 1 of the Norinchukin Bank Act, the Bank has another mission of contributing to the prosperity of the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry and related industries and the revitalization of local communities as a dedicated ﬁnancial institution for the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries. As the basic principles for fulﬁlling these missions, the Bank has formulated the “Basic Policy on Finance.” With strong recognition of the Bank’s public nature and social responsibility as an important part of Japan’s ﬁnancial system, the Bank has formulated this policy from the perspective of compliance, and based on the Bank’s Code of Ethics, Basic Policies for Risk Management and other internal rules. The Bank recognizes that it has an important social responsibility to conduct business operations adhering to the “Basic Policy on Finance.” Development of Sound Investments and Loans The Bank conducts sincere and fair investments and loans in compliance with social codes, fully understanding its fundamental mission and role. To this end, the Bank is dedicated to conducting sound business operation with a focus on accountability at the time of investments and loans and even thereafter. In addition, the “Compliance Manual” clariﬁes, as the code of conduct of directors and employees, that they must always keep in mind the soundness of operations despite the enthusiastic execution of business and should not set excessive plans and performance goals for investments, loans and other businesses. Finance Facilitation Initiatives Policies on Finance Facilitation As the ﬁnancial institution founded on agricultural, ﬁshery and forestry cooperatives, the Bank considers one of its most important roles is to provide necessary funds smoothly to its customers engaging in agricultural, ﬁshery and forestry operations and SMEs, and conducts initiatives under basic policies for ﬁnance facilitation, including the ﬂexible handling of loan applications from customers, making changes to ﬁnancing conditions in response to customers’ request for reduction of debt repayment burdens, proactive response to management consultation from customers, and support for their initiatives for management improvement. In addition, in order to proceed with these initiatives properly, the Bank has developed a structure through discussion and reporting at meetings attended by relevant directors and executive ofﬁcers, the designation of the department in charge of ﬁnancing facilitation, the assignment of a ﬁnancing facilitator at each branch who can collaborate with the department in charge of ﬁnancing facilitation, and the creation of a customer service counter to respond to consultations and complaints from customers. 39｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Responsible Investments and Loans Management Support Initiatives for Customers The Bank focuses on providing services to customers who need support for management improvement and business reconstruction with due consideration to the impact on their local communities and other factors, and divisions and branches that handle customer transactions, together with a department in charge of ﬁnancing facilitation, assist with the customers’ efforts in the development and execution of plans, and review their progress and revise them as appropriate. We also collaborate with external parties, including consulting ﬁrms, Small and Medium-size Enterprise Revitalization Support Councils (SMERSCs) and Regional Economy Vitalization Corporation of Japan (REVIC) as the need arises, using various tools to achieve the best solution. Policy to Address the Guidelines for Management Guarantee Based on the Guidelines for Management Guarantee published in December 2013, the Bank has developed a structure for compliance with the guidelines, and we will continue efforts to address the issue of personal guarantees by business owners in good faith based on these Guidelines. Initiatives for the Equator Principles What is the Equator Principles? The Equator Principles is an assessment framework used by private ﬁnancial institutions when ﬁnancing large-scale development projects to assess whether the development project has appropriate attention to the natural environment and local communities. This framework is widely used in the project ﬁnance ﬁeld as a method to identify, evaluate and manage environmental and social risks. The ﬁnancial institutions that have adopted the Equator Principles are required to include the Equator Principles in their internal policies and procedures, and establish a system for administering and operating them appropriately. Such ﬁnancial institutions do not ﬁnance projects that fail to meet the criteria of the Equator Principles. Thus, as a system for directing fund ﬂows to foster environmental and social considerations, the Equator Principles promote the social responsibility of ﬁnancial institutions to contribute to the realization of a sustainable environment and society. The Norinchukin Bank’s Initiatives The Bank has a basic policy to make investments and loans with a high-level of public responsibility and a broad range of social responsibilities, including considerations relative to the sustainable maintenance of the environment. Based on the increasing public awareness of environmental and social issues and society’s expectations of ﬁnancial institutions, from the viewpoint of realizing a higher level of consideration toward the sustainable maintenance of the environment, the Bank adopted the Equator Principles in May 2017. Speciﬁcally, based on the Basic Policy on Finance, the Bank has formulated the Basic Policy Regarding the Equator Principles and the Administration Guidelines for the Equator Principles, deployed in the Project and Asset Finance Division the staff dedicated to verifying the eligibility of applying projects according to the Equator Principles. The Bank continues to request that customers address environmental and social considerations at the required level according to the project category. 40｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Responsible Investments and Loans Equator Principles Loan Eligibility Verification Flow Chart 1.

Environmental Finance Initiatives Against the background of increasing interest in environmental issues such as global warming prevention, the ﬁnance industry is in an expanding trend of supporting pro-environmental business activities and projects from a ﬁnancial perspective. Based on such a trend, the Bank is engaged in initiatives for environmental ﬁnance. The Bank has introduced the Agricultural, Forestry, Fishery and Ecology Rating System in 2010 to evaluate its customers which practice proenvironmental activities. The Bank added its own evaluation items to those of the system, including initiatives for environmentally sound agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries and for the sixth industrialization. Moreover, in March 2012, the Bank began acting as a broker of domestic emission credit (J-VER) trading. The J-VER System is the domestic emission trading scheme operated by the government. The Bank aims to support initiatives for environmentally-responsible agricultural and forestry operations such as forest improvement and environmental measures of companies by acting as a broker of J-VER trading derived from the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries. In ﬁscal 2018, at an event cosponsored by the Bank, we implemented a carbon offset utilizing a J-VER scheme organized by JForest cooperatives. Event at which a carbon offset was implemented CO2 reduction J-VER organizer November 10-11, 2018 5 tons in total JForest Kashimo (Gifu) The ninth “Farmers’ & Kids’ Festival 2018” 42｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Environmental and Social Contribution Contribution to Creating a Sound Society The Norinchukin Bank aims to contribute to the sound development of society as a highly public cooperative financial institution and fulfill its role as a good corporate citizen. Severing Anti-Social Forces We have a zero-tolerance policy against anti-social forces which threaten the safety and order of civil society, and thoroughly sever any relations with them. To refuse trading with anti-social forces, the Bank promotes an initiative to tackle this issue with an organizational structure consisting of a front ofﬁce (divisions and ofﬁces in charge of practical managerial duties), a middle ofﬁce (management and compliance departments) and a back ofﬁce (internal audit department). Prevention of Fraudulent Uses of Financial Institutions The Bank promotes a uniﬁed initiative to prevent trading with anti-social forces, money laundering and ﬁnancing of terrorism, etc., under its “Prevention of Fraudulent Uses of Financial Institutions.” In addition, to combat fraudulent uses of ﬁnancial services such as using a deposit/saving account to receive cash generated by scams or other crimes, the Bank takes appropriate and timely measures, striving to contribute to a safe and secure society. Alliance among Cooperatives As a cooperative organization with JA, JF and JForest as its members, the Bank collaborates with various cooperatives. What are Cooperatives? Cooperatives refer to nonproﬁt organizations that are joined voluntarily by individuals or business operators for common purposes and are operated and managed democratically for sharing business. Cooperatives’ fundamental characteristic is that they are operated by cooperative members and their representatives via the “spirit of helping each other” without the pursuit of proﬁts. Currently, cooperatives are organized for diverse purposes in more than 100 countries. In Japan, JA, JF, JForest and many other cooperatives play roles in diverse ﬁelds related to people’s lives. Such cooperatives include the ﬁnancial business contributing to economic activities and the afﬂuent lives of community residents; the mutual insurance business providing comprehensive security for people’s lives; manufacturers and providers of safe/secure nutrition-rich food products and daily necessities useful for everyday life; and healthcare and welfare businesses to help people live healthy daily lives, as well as various social initiatives to contribute to local communities broadly. 43｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Contribution to Creating a Sound Society Brochure made by the International Year of Co-operatives (IYC) national cooperative alliance “Cooperatives Japan” Alliance among Cooperatives in Japan and Overseas The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA), a global coalition of cooperatives established in 1985, is the world’s largest NGO. The ICA has been joined by 308 cooperative organizations in 107 countries operating in various ﬁelds (April 2018), including The Norinchukin Bank, JA, JF, JForest, Japanese Consumers’ Co-operative Union and labor, housing and credit cooperative associations. Moreover, in Japan, to inherit and further develop the fruits of the Japan National Planning Committee, which had continued activities toward IYC 2012, the International Year of Co-operatives (IYC) national cooperative alliance, “Cooperatives Japan,” was launched in May 2013. Cooperatives Japan, as its purposes, disseminates the roles and value of cooperatives widely throughout society, creates new value through alliances among cooperatives and promotes cooperatives’ activities. The Bank has been a member of Cooperatives Japan since its establishment, serving as a standing core organization. 44｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Contribution to Creating a Sound Society The “Idea and Practice of Organizing Shared Interests in Cooperatives” Was Inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO On November 30, 2016, the “Idea and practice of organizing shared interests in cooperatives” was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO. This does not mean the registration of a speciﬁc country’s cooperatives or individual cooperatives. Rather, the globally expanding concept and practice of the “Idea and practice of organizing shared interests in cooperatives” was registered. As a reason for this selection, the intergovernmental committee that made this decision evaluated cooperatives highly as organizations that can create communities through shared interests and value and have provided creative and ingenious solutions for various social issues from the creation of employment, support for the elderly and the revitalization of cities to renewable energy-related projects. Cooperatives Are Promoting Initiatives to Address SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) refer to the 17 goals that were included in “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit 2015 in September 2015. The cooperatives have worked to date on issues related to these 17 goals and are positioned by the United Nations as a constituent of the diverse private sector for achieving the SDGs. The ICA also encourages cooperatives around the world to work together with collective efforts to achieve the SDGs. In Japan, the cooperatives are clearly indicated on the “SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles” as a stakeholder allied with the Japanese government. 45｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Environmental and Social Contribution Environmental Consideration The Norinchukin Bank supports environmental conservation initiatives through financing operations—its major business—and engages in the reduction of the environmental load incurred by its business activities. Environmental Consideration Through Our Business Operations The Bank not only conforms to environment-related laws and regulations but also aims to engage in initiatives to develop measures to prevent global warming and establish a circular society. Initiatives to Save Energy and Resources When the “Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Act)” was revised, the Bank newly established its energy management structure and implemented the “visualization” of organization-wide energy uses. By promoting initiatives such as adopting energy efﬁcient features at the time of facility updates and disseminating a Cool-Biz campaign, the Bank continues efforts to prevent global warming. The Bank also continues efforts to save resources such as shifting to paperless methods. The Bank will continue to address the Energy Conservation Act and each prefecture’s ordinances and other regulations appropriately, and engage in ongoing energy-saving efforts.

Speciﬁcally, the Bank adopted the Ecology Rating System in 2010 to evaluate its members and other corporations that practice pro-environmental activities and acts as a broker of domestic emission credit (J-VER) trading. 46｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Trust from Customers Reliability of Financial Infrastructure To perform its functions as a highly public financial institution, The Norinchukin Bank manages risks that might affect business management appropriately and takes measures to address such risks. Risks Surrounding the Bank’s Businesses and Measures to Address Such Risks Today, when Japanese and overseas economic and social situations are changing radically, the risks that could affect business management and operations are increasingly diverse and complicated. Also, an ever-higher level of social demand is seen for customer protection and prevention of fraudulent uses of ﬁnancial institutions and other scams. Against such a background, the Bank strives to enrich its risk management structure to prevent customers’ interests from being harmed unreasonably. Moreover, given the increasing number of crimes related to deposit and saving accounts, the Bank is promoting measures to ensure the safety of deposits and savings. The Bank has improved its security level to prevent cyberattacks, as well as fraudulent money transfers and withdrawals, etc., in Internet banking. To address customers victimized by such crimes, the Bank responds with sincerity, considering the various circumstances. Furthermore, to prepare for emergency situations such as the occurrence of a disaster, the Bank implements measures to ensure business continuation such as resuming operation as quickly as possible after such an incident and continuing to provide basic ﬁnancial services. Operational Risk Management Operational risk refers to a risk that arises in the course of business operations which per se do not generate proﬁt. Operational risk is different from market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk, or the types of risks the Bank actively takes to generate proﬁts. At the Bank, operational risk is further broken down into subcategories, such as processing risk, IT systems risk, legal risk, personnel risk, tangible assets risk, information security risk, business continuity risk, reputational risk and regulatory risk. For operational risk management, the Bank has established deﬁnitions of the risk, its management framework and basic management processes by resolutions of the Board of Directors. In line with these, the Bank has clearly formulated basic policies for operational risk management such as the prevention of large-scale operational risks and has been managing the risk control framework based on such policies. Speciﬁcally, for the appropriate management of operational risks that are borne by the Bank’s company-wide operations, the Bank has adopted the operational risk reporting system for the collection and analysis of risk events that have come to light, as well as the Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) system for the evaluation of potential risks applicable to all divisions and branches. Important issues such as the basic policies and annual planning of the Bank’s operational risk management are ﬁrst discussed at the Risk Management Committee, and then approved by the Board of Directors. The Operational Risk Management Committee, comprised of relevant members of the Board as well as the general managers of related divisions, is set under the Board’s supervision, and monitors the current status of the Bank’s operational risk management. The committee also promotes cross-risk as well as cross-divisional approaches towards managing operational risk. Furthermore, the Bank has established a division to be in charge of operational risk management, which is independent of the business lines, as well as divisions to be in charge of individual risks. The Bank has also designated a person to be in charge of operational risk management in each branch and division. 47｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Reliability of Financial Infrastructure Information Security Initiatives The Bank utilizes a variety of information obtained during transactions with customers, etc., for various kinds of operations. Amid the increasingly diverse environments and purposes for information handling due to the rapid progress and evolution of information technology, the Bank is focused on information security measures to protect and manage customers’ information appropriately. The Bank works systematically to enhance its information security, centered on the Risk Management Division with overall responsibility for information security planning, promotion and progress management. Also, important matters related to the improvement of the information security management frameworks are discussed mainly at the Operational Risk Management Committee. Especially concerning personal information, the Bank has set out the Personal Information Protection Declaration and has created a framework for the requirements from a Personal Information Handling Business Operator and Person in Charge of a Process Related to an Individual Number to facilitate the proper handling of Personal Information and Individual Number. Cyber-Security Initiatives The Bank recognizes the threat of increasingly sophisticated and intricate cyberattacks as an important managerial risk. Mainly at the core IT & Systems Planning Division in charge of cyber-security, under the cross-division management framework including discussions at managementlevel meetings, the Bank is strengthening its cyber-security measures. The Bank also has installed a cyber-security–dedicated CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), which is in charge of addressing a situation at the occurrence of an incident, multi-tier prevention of such incidents, improving detection and monitoring systems, and conducting training assuming that such an incident has just happened. 48｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Reliability of Financial Infrastructure The Main Classifications and Specific Management Methods for Operational Risk Main Classifications Specific Risk Management Methods • In the operational risk reporting system, a comprehensive and clear reporting standard is established, and information of risk events is collected and analyzed. • With RCSA (Risk & Control Self Assessment), processing sections uncover the risks Risk in inherent in their own business processes, evaluate the effectiveness of controls and General remaining risks, and important matters that require improvement are incorporated into the management plan for the year. • Coordination of the operational risk reporting system and RCSA. • The processing risk management plan is formulated based on the results of the operational risk reporting system and processing risk RCSA, and the progress of the plan is reported to the Bank’s management periodically. • Ongoing initiatives such as implementing preventive procedures for speciﬁc risk events Processwhich have surfaced in the past, updating the current procedure manuals, carrying out ing Risk self-checking exercises and hosting staff training sessions. • Implementing risk assessments that respond to any major environmental changes in Risks for which the Bank’s key the Bank’s business environment due to the adoption of new products and services or management strategy is the preorganizational restructuring, etc. vention of risk event occurrence • An IT system risk management plan is formulated based on the results of IT system risk RCSA, etc., while appropriately handling emerging risks generated by changes in the internal and external environment relating to information security, etc., and progress is reported to the Bank’s management periodically.

To Meet the Needs of Our Customers The Bank considers it an important role to provide necessary funds smoothly to its customers engaging in agricultural, ﬁshery and forestry operations and SMEs. To meet the needs of customers by offering customer-oriented services, we engage in ongoing efforts to enhance our functions and services with careful attention to customers’ requests. Sincere Attitude toward Our Customers As a provider of ﬁnancial products and services, the Bank regards it as important to seriously consider customer protection with the perspective of a customer and provides information to help customers make appropriate decisions. Especially when we help customers carry out transactions in ﬁnancial products that require highly-specialized knowledge, it is essential that we make the effort to carefully explain contracts in easy-tounderstand language. For that purpose, we have established various committees and set rules and regulations for customer protection. Dealing with Consultations and Complaints by Customers Consultations and complaints by customers are systematically handled by the departments concerned, and liaise and reports are provided according to the rules and regulations for customer support and related services that prescribe the use of ﬁnancial ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) measures to resolve ﬁnancial disputes out of court. The Bank’s contacts for handling consultations and complaints by customers are widely publicized on its Web site and elsewhere. JA Bank Consultation Service Center JA Bank has internal rules and systems in place to deal with consultations and complaints by customers in a swift, fair and appropriate manner, while considering ﬁnancial ADR measures. Consultations and complaints by customers are handled through the JA Bank Consultation Service Center, a fair and neutral third-party organization, as well as the relevant avenues at JA (Japan Agricultural Cooperatives) and JA Shinnoren. With the consent of the customer, we urge the relevant JA or JA Shinnoren to promptly resolve the issue. In addition, we address our areas of operation that might need improvement relative to consultations and complaints and take measures to prevent recurrences by uniting all forces of JA Bank. 50｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Respect for Customers JF Marine Bank Consultation Service Center JF Marine Bank has internal rules and systems in place to deal with consultations and complaints by customers in a swift, fair and appropriate manner, while considering ﬁnancial ADR measures. Consultations and complaints by customers are handled through the JF Marine Bank Consultation Service Center, a fair and neutral third-party organization, as well as the relevant avenues at JF (Japan Fishery Cooperatives) and JF Shingyoren.

In addition, we address our areas of operation that might need improvement relative to consultations and complaints and take measures to prevent recurrences by uniting all forces of JF Marine Bank. 51｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Trust from Customers Appropriate Business Activities The Norinchukin Bank constantly strives to establish and maintain a fair business relationship to ensure a long-term relationship of mutual trust with its customers. Strict Information Management Directors and employees of the Bank have access to information concerning customers’ assets, credit, privacy, etc. Strict measures are in place to ensure that such customer information is not leaked by the relevant persons while at or after leaving the Bank. Extra care is taken to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations to prevent insider trading when we obtain yet-to-be announced signiﬁcant facts concerning listed or other important customers. Protection of Personal Information As a Personal Information Handling Business Operator and Person in Charge of a Process Related to an Individual Number, the Bank has created a required framework to facilitate the proper handling of Personal Information and Individual Number. The Bank educates and trains employees. Fair Business Operations The Bank explicitly makes it an important management policy to systematically prevent any inappropriate acts that could lead to a failure to fulﬁll social responsibilities, such as the Bank or its directors and employees causing damage to customers or damaging the soundness of or fair competition in the ﬁnancial market, by promoting a sound risk culture throughout the Bank. When investing in ﬁnancial products, placing system orders and/or purchasing goods and services, we comply with fair market rules and appropriate business practices to ensure fairness and transparency in our relationships with business partners and suppliers. With governmental organizations, we abide by the National Public Service Ethics Act and other relevant laws, rules and regulations to establish and maintain sound and normal relationships without engaging in any entertainment or gift-giving acts designed to provide unfair proﬁts to public servants or other government employees. Regarding entertainment for and gift-giving to customers, we comply with the relevant rules and follow the approval, reporting and other prescribed procedures. 52｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Respect for Employees Fair Labor Practices To become a leading bank that supports the agriculture, fishery and forestry industries, food production and consumption, and the daily lives of local communities, the Bank has established a Basic Policy on Human Resource Management to develop human resources essential to achieve its missions and goals and promote employee engagement. Basic Policy on Human Resource Management Future Vision • Develop human resources essential to achieve the Bank’s missions and goals and promote employee engagement to realize its goal of becoming a leading bank that supports the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries, food production and consumption, and the daily lives of local communities Basic Policy • Form a group of self-motivated human resources capable of “Catching the Winds of Change” in the business environment and executing new business strategies • Nurture high employee satisfaction by helping each employee to understand the strategies and goals of the Bank and its cooperative group and grow through tenacious engagement in each employee’s business duties with self-motivated passion for contributing to the Bank and its cooperative group and tackling challenges. In line with this basic policy, our effort is focused on the planning and management of personnel systems including performance and competency assessment systems and personnel development. Goals are set during interviews between superiors and their subordinates, their achievements are validated, and employee competency demonstrated in various work-related situations is reviewed. Through repetition of this process, the Bank promotes employee awareness and efforts to contribute to the Bank’s performance and develop competency while also supporting it through extensive training options. Development of Employees’ Careers For the development of employees’ careers, the Bank deploys and assigns personnel based on the competency, aptitude and career perspective of each person, and supports self-fulﬁllment through work, by adopting the Career Challenge Program (a job transfer application system) and the Career Change Program. In addition, the Bank is aggressively recruiting and employing highly competitive external human resources. When recruiting and allocating employees, care is taken not to exercise any type of discrimination. Ensuring Pleasant Working Environment The Bank regards each employee as its biggest asset and endeavors to enhance working environments to improve employee motivation and promote mutual cooperation. We are promoting our initiative to control long working hours and promote ﬂexible workstyles, and taking steps to improve health management and beneﬁt programs for employees so that they can work in a state of good health and with peace of mind. The Bank is also focused on improving the work environment such that employees can devote themselves to business operations by providing stronger child-raising and nursing-care support. 53｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Respect for Employees Employee Diversity The Norinchukin Bank is seeking to create a working environment where a diverse range of employees can demonstrate their capabilities and talents and perform their duties over the long term. Initiatives Supporting the Raising of Next-Generation Children and Promoting the Active Participation of Women The Bank received the Kurumin Certiﬁcation for Childcare Support Company for its efforts to realize a work-life balance and support for balancing work with childrearing such as providing maternity leave before and after childbirth, a support program for employees who take childbirth and childcare leave, and a shortened working hour program for childcare. In addition, the Bank is promoting measures to introduce various initiatives to promote and familiarize workstyle reform such as ensuring a certain interval between work hours and arranging staggered work hours. In addition to these measures and our efforts to increase the rate of women among new graduate hires, we are helping to build a network among female employees by holding “Women Employee Career Forums.” Women Employee Career Forum Initiatives for Hiring People with Disabilities The Bank is striving to make a workplace where people with disabilities can engage in business duties with high morale and feel secure and rewarded. As an effort to this end, the Bank established Norinchukin Business Assist Co., Ltd., an organization mainly engaging in the administrative work related to ﬁnancing, to expand the employment of people with disabilities in alliance with Group companies. To offer a pleasant working environment, its ofﬁces are designed to provide a bright and spacious room for working comfortably while providing a relaxing space that can be occupied by a single person and a room where people can lie down for a rest. 54｜Sustainability Report 2019 Part 1 Part 2 Respect for Employees Human Resource Development The Norinchukin Bank engages in the development of human resources capable of demonstrating their strengths of their own accord and taking on challenges boldly from the viewpoint of cooperatives and from a global perspective, with a sense of mission to support the agriculture, fishery and forestry industries, food production and consumption, and the daily lives of local communities. Providing Opportunities to Develop Various Skills With the goal of training core personnel in each headquarters, the Bank is actively providing opportunities for them to develop their skills in order to support the self-motivated efforts of each and every employee. For example, in addition to subsidy programs for correspondence courses, certiﬁcation exams, foreign language study and sending employees to overseas study and cross-industry seminars, the Bank holds after-work training based on required subjects in each business ﬁeld. The Bank holds after-work training and group study, etc., by years of service or by rank.

The Bank also provides on-the-job training and conducts a mentoring system for each new employee. Young, Mid-Career and Manager-Level Employees For young, mid-career and manager-level employees, we are helping them develop their careers leading to further growth through such measures as sending them on loan to JA and JA Shinnoren. We are also deepening employee understanding of the Bank’s fundamental mission by holding workshops led by specialists in the cooperative system and the agriculture, ﬁshery and forestry industries to develop human resources who can play a role as employees of the cooperative system. Management-Level Employees To raise the management capabilities of management-level employees, we offer programs to send employees to study at European and U.S. business schools to develop management skills, as well as personal coaching to help managers to implement the Bank’s management plan. Career Development Support System To help employees proactively work on their own career development, the Bank introduces the Career Development Support System.

Health Management While ensuring that all employees take regular health checkups, we urge their families to take health checkups as well.

Discriminatory words and actions because of race, creed, sex, age, nationality, ethnic group, religion, social status and physical features are unacceptable in or outside the workplace. All directors and employees of the Bank are strictly advised not to engage in such acts or language under any circumstances. Response to Global Human Right Issues In addressing global human rights issues, we adhere to and respect the international standards, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the UN Global Compact. In addition, we comply with the domestic laws of the nations where we operate and prepare or update the rules and regulations on operations concerning human rights in the course of our business activities.
