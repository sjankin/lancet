Increasingly higher R&D investment is by businesses to service providers. necessary to achieve such a differentiation, whether through There are two main reasons why businesses outsource their ER&D technology, price, quality, products and services, business services: (i) to improve their capacity to design products and models or user experience; reduce the time-to-market of these products, in particular through j the need to tackle digital disruption and technological access to expertise and cutting-edge technologies rarely available convergence: the emergence and maturity of technologies, in in-house and (ii) to improve the efficiency of their ER&D functions particular in the digital field, is continuously accelerating. and processes in terms of costs and quality. Historical players are under threat of disappearing if they cannot adapt to these disruptions, in the face of new more agile To meet these needs, service providers provide a wide range of entrants, with revisited business models that are capable of services, including design, prototyping, mechanical engineering, leveraging these technologies. As a result, they invest massively systems engineering, software engineering, testing, in R&D to adapt their products and services and remain manufacturing, after-sales services and IT activities linked to R&D competitive; (as opposed to typical IT services which are not part of the ER&D services market). j the imperative need to reduce time-to-market: the acceleration of consumers‚Äô speed of adoption of new products confers disproportionate benefits to first movers selling products that include the new technologies.

ALTRAN ____ Registration Document 2018 23 1 OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP Market and competitive environment 1.2.1.5 Growth outlook and main trends by industry The Company considers the growth outlook for the ER&D services market to be positive, with specific trends in each of the following industries. Industry Growth outlookb(a) Main trends by industry In the Automotive industry, an increase in R&D budgets at several levels should continue to stimulate market growth: j development of autonomous and connected vehicles and tackling the related safety and security issues; ++ j optimization of power train systems‚Äô energy efficiency and introduction of alternative solutions (electrification, hybridization); AUTOMOTIVE j improvement in the efficiency of the new models‚Äô development process (automation and digital). In the Aeronautics industry, the end of the major R&D programs in civil aviation, combined with the focus on incremental developments, continues to impact R&D expenses, despite the recovery of the expenses on certain issues such as: j development of new services for airlines; + j improvement in industrial operations, made necessary by the ramp-up of the production chains (e.g. industry 4.0); AERONAUTICS j preparation of new development processes for future generations of aircrcraft (Model Based System Engineering, Design-to-X‚Ä¶). In the Space and Defense industries, the growth in R&D expenses by the main operators is expected to remain moderate due to governments‚Äô budgetary restraints. + In the Naval sector, demand is mainly drawn by the problems arising from the automation and digitization of the ship production process. SPACE, DEFENSE &bNAVAL A good growth of the ER&D services market is expected in the Rail industry, due to the modernization and automation of trains and railway infrastructures and opportunities arising from Industry 4.0. ++ RAIL, INFRASTRUCTURE &bTRANSPORT In the equipment manufacturers sector: the development of new products and the emergence of new energy sources should lead to growth in R&D investments. + In the oil and gas industry, growth should gradually resume due to increased oil prices. ENERGY The Industry and Consumer Goods sector is expected to be buoyant, mainly supported by the modernization of industrial equipment driven by Industry 4.0, robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. + INDUSTRIAL &bCONSUMER In the Life Sciences industry, the complexity of developing new medicines and the need to renew patents reaching expiry for new molecules should make up for the cost reduction initiatives taken by the main pharmaceutical laboratories. Furthermore, the convergence between the pharmaceutical ++ industry and the medical devices industry should lead to significant investments in connectivity applied to health. Lastly, an increasingly complex regulatory framework also stimulates market growth. LIFE SCIENCES 24 ALTRAN ____ Registration Document 2018 OVERVIEW OF THE GROUP Market and competitive environment Industry Growth outlookb(a) Main trends by industry 1 As regards equipment manufacturers, despite cost saving initiatives, a recovery in investment is expected in the short and medium term due to developments relating to the virtualization of the network functions, 5G, and the definition of new cases of use in other sectors (e.g. connected + vehicles). As regards operators, substantial pressure on prices and market consolidation should encourage cost COMMUNICATIONS control. However, these factors could also lead to a reinforcement of outsourcing policies. In the medium term, the deployment of 5G networks should stimulate demand. In the Semiconductor and Electronics sector, growth should be sustained by the development of new platforms and integrated circuits for specific applications (e.g. artificial intelligence) and less energy-intensive circuits (e.g. for connected systems). + SEMICONDUCTOR AND ELECTRONICS The Software and Internet industry is on a high growth trend and is witnessing a sustained level of R&D investment, driven by ‚ÄúGAFAM‚Äù (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) and numerous start-ups. This increase in R&D investments, combined with the scarcity of resources and the ++ development of large-scale commercial contracts for the management of products further down the development cycle should support the growth in ER&D services.

The change in demand for ER&D services varies according to the industrial sectors of the Group‚Äôs customers. These sectors have 2.1.1.3 Risks related to the challenges of different sensitivities to those of the economic cycles, such as the assimilating and renewing Aeronautics or Semi-conductor sectors. As the Group has a diversified exposure to these various industrial sectors, it is less technologies, and potential impact on exposed to an unfavorable economic situation which would affect the Group‚Äôs ability to meet the one sector only, moreover as crises rarely impact several industrial demands of its customers sectors at the same time. The market for ER&D services is subject to rapid changes, notably as a result of technological innovations. Consequently, the 2.1.1.2 Risks related to competition in the Group‚Äôs performance depends on its ability to adapt to frequent technological changes which could affect the various sectors in Engineering and R&D services market which its customers operate and to respond to their requirements. As presented in sectionb1.2 ‚ÄúMarket and competitive The Group‚Äôs inability to adapt successfully to these changes and environment‚Äù, the market for ER&D services remains relatively to assimilate to new technologies, or to renew its technologies in a fragmented but has tended to concentrate, which could lead to timely manner, could lead to a loss of market share, decreased the emergence of competitors with potentially superior financial, revenues or lower profitability, and thus have a significant adverse commercial or human resources to those of the Group and which effect on the Group‚Äôs business, income, financial position or could form strategic or contractual relationships with current or outlook. potential Group customers in the markets in which the Group is 34 ALTRAN ____ Registration Document 2018 RISK AND CONTROL Risk factors In addition, in the event that the Group invests in the development 2.1.1.4 Risk related to customers‚Äô policy of of technologies that ultimately prove to be ineffective, its financial resources would be allocated to unprofitable investments, which referencing ER&D service providers could have a significant negative effect on the Group‚Äôs business, income, financial position or outlook.

As a result, the Group‚Äôs largest customers have drastically reduced the number of suppliers they can use and In order to keep pace with the latest technological innovations, introduced a smaller list of preferred suppliers. Although the the Group has provided a technical department, and in particular procedures for setting up panels depend on each customer, a Research and Innovation team, in charge of identifying the panels are often organized either by technological areas or by future needs of the Group's customers upstream and, as well as entities within the ordering customer (by subsidiary, division or developing and improving the innovation roadmap for the Group. hub) and for specific, defined periods of time.

Group is not part of the new panels of growing companies or is excluded from a panel on which it appeared (because of its positioning in terms of price or its failure to perform a service, for example) it could have a significant adverse effect on the Group‚Äôs business, financial position, income and outlook. Moreover, the Group devotes significant resources in terms of the time spent by its employees on, and the costs related to, the preparation of its proposals, notably to identify potential ordering customers, to establish the Group‚Äôs reputation with them, to demonstrate to them the Group‚Äôs ability to master the required technologies, and to meet the compliance criteria that may be required. The costs thus incurred may not be offset if the Group fails to obtain the desired referencing from an ordering customer. The realization of one or more of these risks could materially affect the activity, the results, the financial situation and the prospects of the Group. The Group‚Äôs size, its recognized industrial expertise and its long-term relations with numerous ordering customers enable it to mitigate this risk. The Group succeeded in being included on a large number of its various customers‚Äô panels, and is favored by the referencing principle as it is one of the rare players in thebengineering andbR&D services marketbto offer expertise in all its customers‚Äô fields of interest.

ALTRAN ____ Registration Document 2018 163 6 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements Goodwill impairment Notes 1.4, 1.7, 1.9 and 5.1 to the consolidated financial statements Risk identified Our response In recent years, the Group continued its expansion through numerous targeted acquisitions, in different countries, in all of the activities in which it operates. Since 2016, Altran has acquired Lohika Systems in the USA and Ukraine, Synapse Product Development in the USA and Hong-Kong, Swell in the Czech Republic, Benteler Engineering Services in Germany, Pricol Technologies and Global Edge Software Limited in India, Information Risk Management in the United Kingdom and, in 2018, the Aricent group. These acquisitions lead to, if applicable, the recognition of goodwill, in accordance with the principles of IFRS 3, Business combinations, equal to the difference between (i) the consideration transferred, plus the value of any non-controlling interests in the acquired company, and (ii) the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. At the reporting date, net goodwill represents nearly 51% of total Group assets. In accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, this goodwill is allocated, on acquisition, to the Cash-Generating Units (CGU) or groups of CGUs which should benefit from the synergies of the business combinations, at the CGU level at which the Group will monitor this goodwill for management purposes. Impairment tests on goodwill and the CGU to which it is attached are carried out based on estimates developed internally as part of the multi-annual business plans. The tests are performed at December 31 of each year, and during interim accounts closings where there is indication of loss in value. The multi-annual business plans require Management to exercise significant judgment with regard to estimates used to define business plans and financial parameters adopted to determine the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is allocated: j The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use determined based on the present value of cash flows that the Group expects to generate; j An impairment is recognized when the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill is allocated is less than its net carrying amount. We considered impairment tests on goodwill (‚ÄúGoodwill impairment‚Äù) to be a key audit matter given the high level of estimates and judgement made by Management, the sensitivity of the recoverable amounts to changes in forecast assumptions and the relative weight of these assets in the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements. 164 ALTRAN ____ Registration Document 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements Valuation of provisions for material contingencies and liabilities Notes 1.4, 1.16 and 5.12 to the consolidated financial statements Risk identified Our response The Group is exposed to risks, notably tax and social risks and Our audit approach consisted notably in: risks relating to legal proceedings instigated following the j examining the procedures implemented by the Group to revenue fraud at the beginning of the 2000s, still underway, as identify the risks to which it is exposed and obtaining described in note 5.12 to the consolidated financial statements. confirmation from all of the Group‚Äôs external experts/advisors The estimate of risks is reviewed regularly by each subsidiary of our understanding of the litigation, and claims; and by the relevant Group departments, with the support, if j familiarizing ourselves with the risk analysis carried out by the necessary, of expert advisors.
