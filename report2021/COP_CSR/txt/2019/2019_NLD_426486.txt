Our work helps to protect people’s health and prosperity, and contribute to a safe and just society. Sustainability is at the heart of our growth strategy and drives the way we interact with our stakeholders. We are committed to sustainability as part of our day-to-day business. We are guided by the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and acknowledge the importance of the Sustainable Development Goals that the United Nations has set for 2030”. Nancy McKinstry, CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board Wolters Kluwer Stakeholder input for Materiality Analysis Wolters Kluwer continuously identifies economic, social, and environmental topics that are relevant to our business success and are linked to the interests of our stakeholders through our annual materiality analysis. We assess the level of importance of the topics for our stakeholders and Wolters Kluwer and categorize them as operational, strategic, or material. This year, we provide, where applicable, qualitative information and/or data to 18 identified topics in the Annual Report or in this document. The results of our analysis highlight the topics that are most important to the company’s business performance or substantially influence the assessments and decisions of its stakeholders, driving value creation. We capture information from customers, business partners, employees, and investors to identify which topics are material according to each of these stakeholders to revise and update our materiality analysis accordingly.

Enablon software solutions support hundreds of global industry-leaders and millions of users to increase safety, manage environmental performance, minimize risks, and improve profitability and sustainability. The clear assignment of responsibilities for data contribution, validation, and final sign-off establishes a coherent management system for complete and reliable data. Furthermore, the tool supports the analysis of the data to support the development and implementation of our sustainability strategy. The Corporate Sustainability team works together with various departments such as Procurement, Human Resources, Real Estate, Legal, Group Accounting & Reporting, and Corporate Communications to discuss and establish material topics, policies, processes, and targets, and to collect data from divisions and operating companies within the predefined scope. The Corporate Sustainability team reviews the final data. Each Wolters Kluwer division rolls out its sustainability initiatives based on specific local opportunities and in line with our business focus. These initiatives are required to adhere to our globally-established policies and compliance regulations. To ensure continuity and transparency in our reporting processes and performance, we prepared the reporting in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and the GRI Standard 2016: Core Option. For more information see GRI Content Index. We report data on the last three consecutive years where applicable and provide explanations for the fluctuation in the data trends or the exclusion of data. For new topics, only data for 2018 is provided. The data presented in this report is collected on an annual basis and represents the reporting period from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018. The data provided in the resource efficient operations paragraph (under the Our Society section) is reported with a lag of one year to allow for the delay in accessing this information. These are our scoping guidelines for our sustainability data: • We collect data from countries that represent at least 1% of the group’s revenues or 1% of Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) • Where we report data in euro, currencies are converted using the financial year’s average exchange rate The table below provides an overview of the specifications per topic: Chapter Section Specification Our Employees All sections Data is collected centrally Our Society Resource efficient operations 1 Data is collected as follows: • Europe and Rest of World (ROW): facilities that cover more than 1,000 m2 • North America (N.A.): owned properties • We extrapolate for offices smaller than 1,000 m2 in Europe and ROW and for leased offices in N.A. 2 Data expressed ‘per FTE’ (emissions from energy consumption, waste production, water consumption) is based on the average number of FTEs 3 CO2 emissions from electricity are calculated with location-specific conversion factors, which are adjusted annually based on the newly released conversion factors of the International Energy Agency (IEA) for electricity conversion factors. CO2 emissions from heating sources are calculated from source-based conversion factors from the Guidelines to Defra/DECC’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Business air travel • Data is collected per country • CO2 emissions from business travel are calculated from source-based conversion factors from the Guidelines to Defra/DECC’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting. Charitable donations Cash contribution is collected centrally via the corporate finance department In-kind contributions are collected per division and management overhead is collected globally Corporate All sections Data is collected globally, although some exceptions may apply due to governance local legislation Please note that selected sustainability information is integrated within the 2018 Annual Report.

We continuously strive for an inclusive company culture in which we attract, develop, and retain high-performing, productive, engaged, and diverse talent to deliver on our business strategy. Sustaining high engagement Based on our engagement survey feedback, we continued to monitor our progress on actions taken and initiated additional actions for improvement. To strengthen our leadership pipeline, we continued our annual leadership talent review process to understand their skills, capabilities, and career aspirations. Two hundred of our top leadership attended the 2018 Leadership Summit. We globally use a performance management/appraisal scheme based on management by objectives. Performance goals are established by people managers with employee input and performance is assessed based on these goals.

In the United States, Wolters Kluwer offers a comprehensive well-being program – Be Well – which is an incentive-based program designed to encourage employees to make positive overall health choices by taking a holistic view of the individual by offering programs that focus on physical, mental, financial, and social well-being. Be Well offers a variety of programing including on-site health screenings, flu shots, health assessment questionnaire, and health improvement challenges to encourage year-round engagement. Almost half of employees in the United States participated in at least one well-being activity in 2018. Additionally, aggregate data, collected from the annual, self-reported health assessment, showed that program participants improved their physical activity and stress levels from previous years. We are excited by the opportunity to increase program offerings globally due to the increasing importance of well-being as one of the key engagement drivers. Wolters Kluwer 2018 Sustainability Data 8 Our Society As a digital-first organization that provides expert solutions to professionals, we are present where critical decisions are made daily. Sustainability is at the heart of our growth strategy and drives the way we interact with our stakeholders. Resource efficient operations Energy Consumption Energy use is based on electricity, natural gas, heating oil, and district heating. Energy consumption for 2017 has been restated in North America, which resulted in an increase to 89 GWh. Our total energy consumption in 2018 is comparable to 2017. In 2018 several of our offices in Germany, Belgium, and Canada continue using 100% renewable energy contributing to minimizing our environmental footprint. Energy consumption 2018 2017 2016 Total energy use in GWh 89 89 92 Electricity from renewable sources 16% 16% 14% Total CO2 emissions from energy in metric tons 30,953 31,140 31,527 Tons of CO2 emissions from energy per FTE 1.6 1.6 1.7 Waste Waste production has increased mainly due to one-time clearances at some of our offices. During the clearance at the offices in the UK and the Netherlands paper waste has been sorted, contributing to an increased percentage of our recycled waste. Waste consumption 2018 2017* 2016 Total waste production in metric tons 4,271 4,172 3,598 Total waste recycled in metric tons 2,597 2,371 2,047 Percentage recycled waste 61% 57% 57% Waste production in metric ton per FTE 0.23 0.22 0.19 Water We use efficient water systems in our offices and in the irrigation of our garden areas and we managed to further decrease our water consumption in 2018. Water consumption 2018 2017* 2016 Total water use in m3 132,796 143,446 157,435 Water use in m3 per FTE 7.0 7.6 8.3 Business Travel Total business travel has decreased for business travel by plane as encouraged in our updated Global Travel and Entertainment Policy. For business travel by plane, relatively more kilometers were travelled in business class than in 2017. This explains the increase in CO2 emissions from business air travel in metric tons despite the decrease of kilometers (km) travelled by plane. Car travel increased compared to 2017 as the scope for data collected was enlarged. * Due to restating our information on North America, waste production and water consumption has increased in 2017.

In 2018 alone, 5,478 trees were planted. Responsible supply chain We review our procurement process critically and are striving to achieve an environmentally and socially sustainable supply chain. The six main elements of the Third-Party Management Program include: 1. Governance and Oversight 2. Requirements Definition and Risk Assessment 3. Third Party Selection and Due Diligence 4. Contract Negotiation 5. Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting 6. Termination We have set new targets for 2019 to continue improving our supply chain responsibility.

Our work helps to protect people’s health and prosperity and contribute to a safe and just society. To provide the appropriate support, in form of expertise, effort, solutions, and funding, our community involvement efforts are managed locally. Wolters Kluwer continues to use the London Benchmarking Group (LBG) community support framework. The LBG framework provides the structure to measure and report on our community contributions. It separates donations, costs, and time invested and portrays it in a transparent and reliable manner. Community contributions in thousands of euros 2018 2017* 2016 Community contributions in cash 597 820 617 Community contributions in kind 497 842 1,765 Management cost related to community contributions 34 32 29 Total 1,128 1,694 2,183 * Cash contribution for 2017 is updated based on restatements made We have numerous examples of LOCAL COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT INITIATIVES. Our long-term collaboration with the United Nations program Hinari enables communities in need to access our digital health solutions free of charge and has resulted in close to 90,000 downloads in 2018. The World Health Organization set up Hinari together with major publishers to enable lowand middle-income countries to gain access to one of the world’s largest collections of biomedical and health literature. MERCY SHIPS CLINICIANS aboard their floating hospital ship, the Africa Mercy, care for the world’s most vulnerable populations. The ship is currently on a nearly year-long mission in the west African country of Guinea, providing free lifesaving surgeries in a region where medical care is very limited. To support Mercy Ships, Wolters Kluwer Health has donated Lexicomp® app subscriptions to ensure clinicians throughout the ship have access to the most current and comprehensive drug information as part of the high quality care they provide. Docked in Conakry, Guinea, the Africa Mercy is the world’s largest civilian hospital ship. The ship provides modern healthcare facilities and advanced surgical care to those in desperate need. With only two and one-half physicians per 10,000 people in Africa, many have little or no access to healthcare. The Africa Mercy brings medical teams comprised of volunteers from around the world and sterile operating rooms directly to people who would otherwise go without care. The remarkable floating hospital includes five operating theatres, recovery, intensive care, and low dependency wards—totalling 80 patient beds. Volunteers anticipate providing over 2,000 free surgeries to patients in Guinea during the next 10 months. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) could be considered the most important technological development of our time. For this reason, a National AI course is being launched in the Netherlands in collaboration with various Dutch stakeholders. The National AI course is a free course offered online. Course participants gain knowledge about the principles of AI, its applications, its impact on jobs and society and any ethical questions that may arise. Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory in the Netherlands has partnered with the course and contributed to one of the video cases: AI in Jurisdiction. The video shoes how predictive analytics and autoclassification are used in our Expert Solutions and highlights how our products have a positive impact for our customers and on society. In addition to the monetary contribution of € 40,000 and contribution to the video case, as a partner we are also putting effort into generating wider reach and attention for the course. We are promoting it internally and are currently in contact with other partners to explore joint activities and PR for the course. Wolters Kluwer 2018 Sustainability Data 11 Corporate Governance The 2018 Annual Compliance Training Program was launched globally for all employees hired on or before August 1, 2018. Our Annual Compliance Training is in place to ensure we continue to uphold our history of high ethical and legal standards, to protect the security of our information and the information of our customers, and to safeguard the company’s reputation. Compliance training is a key element of an effective compliance program. It helps employees to understand how to apply our values, policies, business principles, and our other rules of conduct in their daily work and business dealings with colleagues, clients, suppliers, and other stakeholders. The 2018 Annual Compliance Training Program consisted of the following courses: 1. Wolters Kluwer Ethics Training (business ethics, values, anti-bribery, fair competing, sanctions and export control, data protection, reporting issues) 2. IT Security Awareness Training 3.

All our employees based in Europe and other selected employees received the GDPR general awareness training module. Additional GDPR training was assigned based on role and function, including HR, Marketing & Sales, and IT. GDPR and data privacy training will be part of Wolters Kluwer’s Annual Compliance Training Program as of 2019. In case of non-compliance with laws or regulations in the social and economic area, we track significant fines and sanctions finally imposed on Wolters Kluwer legal entities.
