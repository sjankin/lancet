VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS Timberland is committed to using adhesives in our stockfit and assembly shoe manufacturing process that cause less harm to the environment. Traditionally, footwear manufacturers use solvent-based chemicals for gluing, cleaning or painting shoe components. Solvent-based adhesives release volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ), which can create human and environmental health hazards. VOCs are chemical compounds that evaporate easily in normal conditions. Measuring grams of VOCs allows Timberland to account for the overall quantity of VOCs used in the production of our footwear. Disclosing chemical consumption in this manner also allows us to target specific, high VOC-content materials for reduction, substitution or elimination, thereby promoting lower environmental impact and improved working conditions in factories. To facilitate ongoing reduction efforts, engineering reviews are conducted to promote the use of water-based adhesive in the construction and manufacturing of product, while also maintaining the quality and physical integrity of the shoe.

We ended 2018 with a VOC average of 53 grams per pair, slightly higher than our 2017 result (51 grams/pair). Timberland’s manufacturing facility in the Dominican Republic has incorporated several strategies to reduce VOC usage, including employee training, better containment of VOC adhesives to prevent evaporation, upgrading VOC application equipment, more targeted application, and increased material pre-treatment processes to minimize the VOC adhesives needed. We are working to share these best practices with other factories around the world to further reduce our use of VOCs while maintaining the necessary performance attributes for our product lines. We remain committed to our goal of averaging 42 grams of VOCs per pair. LEATHER – GOLD/SILVER RATED TANNERIES Leather processing is a chemical, water, and energy-intensive process. To ensure the leather we purchase is processed using environmental best practices, all our leather suppliers for footwear and apparel undergo an environmental audit under protocols established by the cross-brand Leather Working Group ( LWG ). LWG certification is awarded to tanneries that demonstrate environmental best practices and performance in all areas of leather production, from chemical, water and waste management to energy use and hide traceability. Tannery environmental audit performance is scored on a scale of Audited, Bronze, Silver, or Gold, with separate percentage scores awarded for the degree of hide traceability. In 2008, Timberland made a public commitment to only source leather for our footwear products from tanneries that have an LWG rating of Silver or Gold. In 2015, we expanded this commitment to include the leather we source for our apparel products and accessories.

When looking at leather used during Q4 for Timberland footwear only, 99.86% came from tanneries rated Gold or Silver. For full-year 2018, 96.2% of leather used in all Timberland products came from Gold or Silver rated tanneries, and 99.1% of leather used for footwear only came from Gold or Silver rated tanneries. We remain committed to our goal to limit production at non-certified tanneries until they achieve Gold or Silver status. COTTON Chemicals used to grow cotton can be detrimental to the health of farmers, and seep into run-off water contaminating lakes, rivers, and waterways. Conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticides and requires significantly more water than organically grown cotton. As such, Timberland has had a longstanding goal of increasing our use of organic cotton year over year. Organic cotton remains our preference; however, when organic cotton is not feasible, we commit to eliminating our use of conventionally grown cotton. Our new 2020 target is for 100% of the cotton used in our apparel, accessories and licensed goods to be sourced more sustainably than conventional cotton. This includes cotton that is Certified Organic, Recycled or Fairtrade; of US-origin; or sourced as Better Cotton through the Better Cotton Initiative (“BCI”).

For full-year 2018, Timberland used 2821 metric tons of cotton, 75% of which was organic (24%) BCI-certified (48%), or US-origin (3%). Our global apparel production, which accounted for 89% of all cotton sourced during the year, significantly increased their use of responsible cotton during 2018. Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the cotton used for global apparel production (1871 metric tons) was either organic (40%) or BCI-certified (59%). This increase was offset by the addition of a new sock licensee that is phasing into our requirements. They are the second highest user of cotton for Timberland products and are currently confirming best ways to incorporate responsible cotton into their line. FOOTWEAR WITH RECYCLED, ORGANIC OR RENEWABLE MATERIALS Since 2008, Timberland has had product development strategies for increasing the use of recycled, organic, and renewable ( ROR ) materials in our footwear and set yearly targets to increase the use of these environmentally-preferred materials year over year. Renewable materials are defined by Timberland as plant-based materials which replace the use of fossil fuels in our products (e.g. castor bean oils used in outsole compounds, hemp, bamboo). Our largest use of ROR in footwear is with recycled polyester ( PET ) and recycled rubber. The chart below reflects the percent of Timberland footwear that is constructed with at least one component made from organic, renewable or recycled materials (with a minimum threshold of 10% ROR content within a component). We are pleased with our progress over the years to increase our use of recycled, organic and renewable materials. While some challenges currently exist in utilizing ROR materials over conventional materials, we are confident that by 2020 every Timberland boot, shoe, and sandal will incorporate ROR materials. *continued on next page* In 2017 we changed our method of reporting our use of ROR materials. From 2011 to 2016 we included all materials, including those used in minor components such as webbings, trims and labels. To drive focus toward using ROR content in more significant components of our footwear, we are no longer including these minor components.

Recycled PET continues to be the largest source of ROR materials in our footwear, incorporating over 717,519 pounds – the equivalent of 32 million plastic water bottles. To date, we have incorporated the equivalent of over 345 million plastic bottles into our footwear. To further advance toward our 2020 goal, we have affected design policies that require ROR content in all new product development and will be revisiting carry-over styles to engineer in ROR where there is none currently. PVC-FREE FOOTWEAR Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a polymer used in a wide variety of applications such as construction, plumbing, and cable insulation, and it is also used in the footwear industry. Unfortunately, the use of PVC has some negative aspects associated with its creation and its end of life. Given the human and environmental risks associated with the creation and disposal of PVC, Timberland is committed to phasing out the use of PVC in its products. We are committed to finding and utilizing PVC alternatives where feasible to decrease our use. Our goal is to be 100% PVC-Free.

While not yet at 100% PVC-free, we are proud of the progress that we’ve made over the years to phase out PVC in our footwear. There are stringent performance expectations in certain styles in our PRO product line that cannot be met with current PVC-free alternatives. We continue to seek PVCfree material substitutions and to review materials and manufacturing equipment updates to allow for further PVC reduction to occur. Additionally, our parent company VF Corporation’s Restricted Substances List policy calls for a complete phase-out of PVC use in all products. For more details see their policy at http://responsiblesourcing.vfc.com/policies-and-standards/. NON-PFC DURABLE WATER REPELLENT Timberland products are built to protect our consumers from the elements of nature, and waterproofing is of prime importance to outdoor enthusiasts. Durable Water Repellent (“DWR”) is a coating added to fabrics at the factory to make them water-resistant. PFCs (per-fluorinated compounds) are a class of chemical substances found in many DWRs that are potentially hazardous to humans – at the factory level where the waterproofing is applied, as well as to the end user. Timberland is committed to the elimination of all PFCs in our waterproof footwear and apparel. Our end goal is for 100% of our DWRs to be non-PFC. This was a new metric in 2016. Non-PFC Durable Water Repellent 100% 91% 2017 2020 TARGET Percent of total footwear production that is non-PFC 2017 Result: Although this is our first time reporting on our Non-PFC DWR status, it is not our first year working towards this goal. We have made significant efforts to eliminate PFC-based DWR treatments from our top volume waterproof leathers and are excited to report our success this year. Our remaining products with PFC-based DWRs have specific performance requirements that, to-date, can only be achieved with PFCbased chemistry. We are actively researching and engaging chemical suppliers with the goal of identifying Non-PFC chemistry innovations that can achieve the required performance attributes for these products. We are still collecting the data for non-PFC DWR in apparel fabric and will update the above chart once this has been finalized. (2018 data not yet available – we will include in our Q1, 2019 reporting.) RECYCLED PACKAGING Since 2007, Timberland has been committed to providing responsible packaging for our footwear. Our boxes are made from 100% recycled materials (at least 80% post-consumer) printed with soy-based and sesame-based inks. Starting in 2012 we began using water-based inks and have phased out sesamebased inks.

After being acquired by VF Corporation ( VF ) in 2011, our Code of Conduct was replaced by VF's Terms of Engagement and Global Compliance Principles. VF’s policy is to monitor every facility that is involved in the manufacture of VF-branded product. This includes all cutting facilities, sewing plants, screen printers, embroiderers, laundries, and packaging locations. At the end of each VF audit, the factory receives one of the following ratings: x Accepted – factory has no serious safety, health, or labor issues and is certified to produce VF products for 12 months, at which time a re-audit is necessary to maintain an 'Accepted' rating. x Developmental – factory has some minor safety, health, or labor issues. The factory is authorized to produce for VF while the issues identified are corrected in a timely manner and a follow-up audit is scheduled within 6 – 9 months. If the problems are corrected as required, then the status of the factory will be elevated to 'Accepted.' If not, the factory is downgraded to 'Pending Rejection-180 days' ( PR-180 days ), at which time they have a final 6 months to satisfactorily resolve the outstanding issues or be downgraded to 'Rejected.' x Rejected – factory has major safety, health or labor issues. Examples would include excessive working hours, incorrect overtime compensation or locked emergency exits. In this situation, the factory is not authorized to produce VF products. If a factory is Rejected twice consecutively, they are banned from producing for VF for 12 months. In 2017, VF Compliance began auditing Tier 2 suppliers (textile mills, outsole factories, and tanneries) for life safety issues. Life Safety Audits cover Legal Business Practices, Child Labor, Forced Labor, Health and Safety, Monitoring and Compliance, Worker Residence and Environment. Metrics below include results of both standard compliance audits and life safety audits. For more detailed information, please see VF's audit policy.

Broken down by business unit, this equates to 65 footwear factories, 162 apparel factories, 90 factories producing licensed goods and accessories, 30 tanneries, 61 fabric mills and component suppliers, and 14 independent distributor factories. One hundred seventy-one (43%) were rated Accepted, and 241 (57%) were rated Developmental. VF Compliance audited 120 Timberland factories during Q4. Of these 120 factories, 38 (32%) were rated Accepted, 70 (58%) were rated Developmental, 7 (6%) were rated Pending Rejection, and 5 (4%) were rated Rejected. The factories rated Pending Rejection are working on their corrective action plans and will be re-audited within 6 months. Purchase orders with the Rejected factories are on hold until the factories are re-audited and favorable ratings are attained, or production is relocated to other factories. *continued on next page* Full-Year 2018 Result: In 2018, 495 audits were conducted by VF Compliance at 410 Timberland factories. The graph above shows the results of the audits physically conducted in 2018 this does not represent our overall supply chain ratings because the data does not include the 138 factories that were not audited but approved to produce in 2018. Examples of why audits were not conducted would be factories that were covered by a 2017 audit and dropped in 2018 prior to their audit due date, or factories that are on a 24-month audit frequency. Timberland sourced from a total of 529 factories in 2018. When looking at all factories that produced in 2018, including those not audited in 2018, and those dropped midyear, our overall supply chain risk can be summarized as follows: 37% were Accepted, 62% were Developmental, and 1% were Rejected (orders with Rejected factories were withheld until corrective actions were implemented or production was relocated.) Working hours were cited in 16% of the audits conducted in 2018, down signigicantly from 2017 (36%). VF defines this issue as anything over 60 hours per week or working more than 6 days consecutively. Minimum wage issues were also reduced in 2018, only found in 2% of factories audited. For a full list of all topics included in the VF Compliance audits, please see VF's audit policy. Timberland believes, along with others in our industry, that factory disclosure and collaboration can create common standards and shared solutions – helping to advance global human rights in all our factories. For this reason, we disclose our factories on a quarterly basis. See the most recent factory list here. Although our supply chain sources may change from time to time, our quarterly factory disclosure represents our best attempt to disclose all of Timberland's active factories as of that date. Timberland, along with other VF Corporation brands, recently published full supply chain transparency footprint maps on 9 of its most iconic products. The source maps, available on VF’s sustainability website, help ensure every step in the production of VF’s apparel and footwear meets the corporation’s standards of quality, sustainability and social responsibility – from raw material extraction to VF distribution centers. The interactive maps display the number and locations of suppliers in a region and users can zoom in for a close-up look at each supplier, including onsite inspections, verifications and associate interviews. FACTORY CONDITIONS SUPPLIER SELECTION As Timberland’s sourcing managers consider new factories, social compliance performance is an important aspect of their vendor selection pre-screening process. Such pre-screening is accomplished by having factories provide evidence of their social compliance performance by way of recent audits by other brands, external monitoring firms, or social certificates, such as WRAP or SA8000. To facilitate discussions internally with our sourcing teams in regard to their commitment to select social/labor compliant factories, we track the number of new factories that receive Rejected or Pending Rejection-180 Days ratings on their initial VF Compliance Audit.

Of these 28 factories, 6 (21%) were rated Accepted, 15 (54%) were rated Developmental, 2 (7%) were rated Pending Rejection-180 days, and 5 (18%) were rated Rejected. The 2 factories rated Pending Rejection will be re-audited in 6 months. If adequate improvements have not been made, they will be Rejected and no longer approved to produce for Timberland. Alternative sources will be found for the factories that were rated Rejected. Full-year 2018 Result: Timberland added 147 new factories in 2018. Thirty-four (23%) were rated Accepted, 81 (55%) were rated Developmental, and 32 (22%) were rated either Pending Rejection-180 days (17) or Rejected (15). The factories rated Pending Rejection had 6 months to make improvements and be re-audited. Two of the 15 Rejected factories were re-audited and upgraded to Developmental; the other Rejected factories were dropped before any manufacturing took place. HIGG FACILITY ENVIRONMENTAL MODULE In 2015, VF’s Sustainable Operations Team introduced our strategic suppliers to the Higg Facility Environmental Module. The first step is for the factory to complete an online self-assessment, answering questions on seven different components: Environmental Management Systems, Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Water Use, Wastewater/Effluent, Emissions to Air, Waste Management, and Chemical Use and Management. Factories receive a score of 1 to 100. The next step is to have the VF Sustainable Operations Team (or other SAC-approved verifier) verify the factories’ scores, by either on-site or off-site evaluation. Scores are aggregated, allowing facilities to benchmark their results against the industry. Higg Environmental 97% 85% 66% 57 49% 53 50 47 2015 2016 2017 2018 % Completed Average Score 2018 Result: As of the end of 2018, 97% of Timberland Strategic Supplier factories had participated in the Higg Environmental Module. Strategic Suppliers are VF’s top volume factories that collectively represent 80% of global production for footwear and apparel. The average score for Timberland Strategic Suppliers that have done the self-assessment is 47, as shown in the chart above. Once a factory completes the self-assessment, a member of VF’s Sustainable Operations Team visits the factory to verify their score. In 2018, 34 factories had their scores verified, and the average score was 39. The two areas of greatest disparity are chemical management and air emissions. With this information, the VF team is now increasing their support and training to factories on both topics.

Renewable energy purchases represent on and off-site generation, as well as renewable energy credits. Our 2015 target is considered best practice within the Ceres 2020 Roadmap, which challenges businesses to obtain at least 30% renewable energy by 2020. 2017 Result: In 2017, 29% of the energy used at Timberland’s owned and operated facilities was from renewable sources, which is a slight decrease from our 2016 (31%) result. We have aligned our targets with VF Corporation’s goal to be sourcing 100% renewable energy for all owned and/or operated facilities by 2025. Our overall Timberland target is to source at least 50% of all energy used at Timberland sites worldwide from renewable sources by 2020. *With new data available, 2016 result decreased from 32% to 31%.

All facilities owned and operated globally tracked landfill diversion rates for the first time in 2013. As the above chart reflects, our efforts to date have been successful in diverting the majority of our waste streams. We continue to seek means of further improving our waste diversion rate and are looking at applying best practices from our parent company’s (VF Corporation’s) zero waste facilities. Note: data is self-reported by each facility and is not third-party validated. *continued on next page* 2016 Result: In 2016, our landfill diversion rate rose to 75%, from 54% in 2015. In 2016, sites began tracking cardboard boxes that were reused in addition to those that were recycled. Our Ontario, CA distribution center, which is one of our largest facilities, re-used 744 metric tons of cardboard in 2016, which led to our increase in diverted waste. There has also been more of a concerted effort to recycle in facilities worldwide, including in our retail stores, which account for the majority of our sites.

We accomplished our goal in 2009 and were inspired to set a new goal of planting 5 million trees in the next five years. In 2014, we had accomplished that goal, primarily based on the success of tree planting projects in China, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. From 2001 through 2018, Timberland planted a total of 10,275,707 trees. Trees Planted Annually 1,841,701 1,559,855 1,443,994 1,153,840 1,042,485 597,482 449,735 413,757 163,006 210,531 199,014 285,887 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Number of Trees Planted . In 2018, we continued to support large-scale tree planting efforts in the Dominican Republic and the Horqin desert in China. Our ecological partner in the DR experienced challenges in 2018 due to extended drought periods and restricted water irrigation. As a result, fewer trees were planted by the program. Read more about our tree-planting initiatives in Haiti and China on our responsibility website. Having achieved our 2020 goal to plant 10 million trees, we are in process of establishing new goals to continue on this momentum.

COMMUNITY METRICS At Timberland, service is a part of our DNA. A belief in the power of people to transform their communities is one of our core values. Our purpose is to inspire and equip the world to step outside, work together and make it better. We live this purpose by offering our thousands of creative, dedicated, hardworking employees a number of ways to become involved: Path of Service™: This employee volunteer program gives full-time staff an annual benefit of up to 40 paid hours and parttime staff an annual benefit of up to 20 paid hours for community service. Pillar Service Events: To help employees use their service hours, Timberland organizes global two days of service each year: Earth Day in the spring and our own Serv-a-palooza event in the fall. In 2014, Timberland employees celebrated their one millionth hour of community service. Each year the Community Engagement team and the Global Stewards (Timberland’s volunteer team of CSR ambassadors who drive our service and CSR agenda worldwide, in addition to their regular job responsibilities) strive to increase employee engagement in community service by offering new service opportunities to employees. Service metrics are measured on an annual basis (from January 1 December 31) and revert to zero at the beginning of each year. To learn more about how we serve, click here.

Hours Utilization Rate for Q4 was 21%, which is even with our Q4 2017 result. Our Benefit Utilization Rate was 52%, which is a significant improvement over our 2017 result of 42%. Our team in the Dominican Republic served over 4,000 hours in Q4 alone. Some of their events included planting 2,000 trees, organizing toy and shoe donations for schools in the area, having a picnic and Christmas party with the elderly, and river cleanups at Rio Jacagua. The second busiest location was our Stratham, NH headquarters, serving over 2,000 hours in Q4. In lieu of the annual Christmas celebration, employees chose to serve the local community by providing handmade artwork and gift bags for a local nursing home, organizing food kits for the NH Food Bank, making blankets for the elderly, and packing gift bags for Operation Care for Troops. COMMUNITY SERVICE EVENTS ORGANIZED BY TIMBERLAND GLOBALLY To support and encourage Timberland employees to use their Path of Service™ benefit, the Global Stewards are tasked with organizing community service events beyond our annual Earth Day events in the spring and our annual Serv-a-palooza events in the fall. Most service events are designed to engage not only our employees, but also our business partners, VF associates, our customers, and others in the community. This metric shows the number of community service events organized by Timberland worldwide per year. Note to stakeholders: In 2016, we redefined “service event” to mean “projects involving 2 or more Timberland employees engaging in service to the community.” As such, our number of events decreased to conform to this new guideline.

We strive to engage our business partners, distributors, consumers, and local community members in our events. The purpose of this metric is to show the percentage of Timberland vs. non-Timberland volunteers that participated in Timberland organized service events throughout the year. % of Timberland and Non-Timberland Hours Served 35% 32% 24% 33% 24% 26% 40% 42% 56% 65% 68% 76% 67% 76% 74% 60% 58% 44% 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Timberland Volunteers Non-Timberland Volunteers
