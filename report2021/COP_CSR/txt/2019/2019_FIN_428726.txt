RISKS • Disruptive technologies in our value chain, slow renewal of our product portfolio and lack of differentiation, and failure to commercialize new products and service concepts. • Regulatory constraints related to our products or use of our products are always evolving. The outcome of regulatory processes can lead to a ban, authorization or restrictions of use which can affect our ability to place products on the market. MANAGEMENT APPROACH We focus our innovation work on products addressing global trends and resource efficiency. This is based on systematic monitoring of market developments, competitive activities, and emerging technologies to enable responsiveness to changing customer needs. Our approach to collaborative product development is aimed to ensure a fast response to market needs and effective product launches through targeted marketing activities and training of sales. All our products, raw materials and intermediates need to comply with all applicable chemical regulatory requirements in the countries where we manufacture and / or sell chemicals. We actively monitor changes both in chemical legislation and in regulations relating to the use of our products by customers. Our Product Lifecycle Management process covers assessments on regulatory compliance, human health impact, safety issues and environmental impact in every lifecycle phase, from conception and development to manufacturing and sales, and finally to product elimination.

RISKS • Chemical operations involve harmful and hazardous substances controlled with a wide range of physical and chemical parameters. Malfunction in processes can lead to incidents with possible impact on environment, employee health and safety, or our assets. This can happen due to human behavior, technical failures or process safety deficiencies. • Failure to develop safety management practices may increase risk of safety incidents causing supply and manufacturing disruptions. • Raw material supply disruptions due to force majeure situations at market or single source. • Failure by our vendors / suppliers to meet or comply with local environmental regulations. • Some of our major product lines are very energy-intensive with environmental impact through carbon emissions. There are regulations emerging which set a price for carbon emissions. MANAGEMENT APPROACH Our integrated management system provides a solid platform for systematic risk management and continuous improvements in competences, procedural, technical and physical protection mechanisms. We systematically develop and implement certifiable management systems for environment, occupational health and safety, quality, and energy management. Legal reviews of changing regulatory requirements are a part of management frameworks, and legal compliance issues are part of management system reviews. Our strategic sourcing through segmentation and the supplier management program aims to manage and develop performance and good governance throughout our supply chains, to reduce our risks related to the availability of raw materials, price volatility, and non-compliance, as well as to responsible business practices. Other measures include backward integration for critical raw materials and reducing the number of single / sole source situations, as well as effective contingency plans on core materials. We secure cost-effective energy supply though strategic investments and by hedging.

Our operations are managed to also meet the expectations of our stakeholders in our operating environment. The way to reach these goals are based on proactive hazards management, implemention of identified improvement initiatives, and engaging with our employees and business partners to enforce preventive EHSQ behaviors in our operations. All aspects of safety management are fundamental to our operations: process safety, chemical safety, workplace safety, transportation and loading / unloading safety. Incidents in our operations can have consequences for our people as well as to those third parties that are working for us at Kemira sites or at a location where Kemira is present. Our long-term target for safety is “Zero harm for people” and to be in the “World Class” in workplace safety. We measure our safety performance with Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) covering Kemira employees and contractors. Our short term target is TRIF ≤ 2.0 by 2020.

ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR GRI 206-1: Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices In 2018, Kemira had the following pending or completed legal actions initiated under national or international laws designed for regulating anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, or monopoly practices: Kemira continued to defend itself against a legal action filed by CDC PROJECT 13 SA against Kemira Chemicals Oy (former Finnish Chemicals Oy) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, related to an alleged historical infringement of competition law in the sodium chlorate business by Finnish Chemicals Oy between 1994 and 2000. Kemira acquired Finnish Chemicals in 2005. In the United States, three class action lawsuits (only two active) and ten individual suits have been filed during 2015–2018, based on alleged violations of anti-trust laws relating to the sale of certain water treatment chemicals. In those lawsuits, Kemira has been named as a defendant among other defendants. The ten individual legal suits are opt-out suits, whereby the plaintiffs opted out of the direct liquid aluminate sulfate class actions. According to Kemira’s assessment, all of these class actions and individual lawsuits against Kemira lack merit.

VOC is a sum of volatile organic compounds as defined in EU Directive 1999/13/EC. VOC increases are primarily associated with the site that is the largest emitter of VOC in Kemira. The site’s production rate increased in 2016, and the site improved the accuracy of the emissions calculation methodology for VOC. 4. Other standard categories of air emissions identified in relevant regulations. New reporting requirement starting in 2017. Includes former reporting requirement of Volatile Inorganic Compounds (VIC), which was reported as the sum of ammonia, hydrogen chloride and six other simple inorganic compounds through 2016. GRI Standard no longer requires reporting of VIC. 5 New reporting requirement starting in 2017. Changes in emissions between Other air emissions, POP, and HAP may be attributable to how emissions are regulated in a specific location. For example, acrylonitrile is specifically regulated under the term HAP in the United States and would be reported as such. However, acrylonitrile may not be regulated using the term HAP in another country and may be reported under Other air emissions. 6 A value of zero represents emissions equal to or greater than 0 and less than 0.5 tonnes. Emissions are primarily from one manufacturing site.

As a result of the changes in the standards, retained earnings in equity have been adjusted on January 1, 2018. IFRS 15 standard did not change Kemira’s revenue recognition principles and thus did not result in any adjustments in retained earnings. IFRS 9 standard mainly impacts Kemira’s valuation of loan receivables and credit losses recognition of trade receivables. Due to the change in the accounting policy, retained earnings have been adjusted for a total of EUR -1.0 million. When adopting the amendments to the IFRS 2 standard, Kemira has classified share-based payment arrangements as equity-settled in its entirety and liability related to the share-based payment arrangement has reclassified to retained earnings in equity. As a result of the change in the accounting policy, an adjustment of EUR 0.8 million has been recognized in the retained earnings. The total effect on equity from loan receivables, trade receivables and share-based payments is EUR -0.2 million including the deferred tax effect. Comparative financial periods were not restated.
