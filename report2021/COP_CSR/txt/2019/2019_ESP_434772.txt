In terms of financial results, as can be analysed in greater depth in the pages of this Annual Report, we have met the budget for the year, obtaining net profit of EUR 180 million. At the same time, worth particular note is the important reduction in net financial debt, which at year-end came to EUR 50 million, 0.1 times the Group's EBITDA. For the first time, this Annual Report contains the Non-Financial Information Statement, which provides detailed information about the Group's business model and its Divisions in addition to its relationship with society, plus relevant data on environment issues, social issues, the Group's staff and respect for human rights, among others. In 2018, the Group managed a total of 55,017 rooms in 250 establishments spread across Latin America, Europe, the USA and North Africa. Over the course of the year, we have continued to renovate hotels in order to improve the quality we offer, adapt to the standards of our new brands and provide our guests with modern and comfortable accommodation that is respectful of the environment, which has resulted in a constant improvement in our customers' satisfaction. During 2018, 13 new hotels, with 2,519 rooms, have been included in our portfolio, all operated under lease and management agreements in Spain (4), Cuba, Turkey (2), Portugal (2), Morocco (3) and the United Arab Emirates. Concerning new investments, the most significant was the start of construction on Phase VI of the Barceló Maya Grand Resort, in Mexico, involving the construction of a new 850-room hotel and a major conference centre, costing USD 200 million. In our Travel division, Ávoris has continued to consolidate all its businesses and has bolster its human resources and the new acquisition made. A change of fleet is forecast in 2019 for the airline division that will improve its operating efficiency. Thanks to the efforts and commitment of our shareholders and all the Group's employees, we look forward to 2019 with careful optimism, confident that our commitment to ensuring our customers have the best experience will also translate into better financial results.

The content of the NFIS includes additional information to that required by prevailing mercantile regulations in relation to non-financial information that has not been subject to our verification.

The directors are also responsible for the design, implementation and maintenance of such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a NFIS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based on the work performed, that refers exclusively to 2018. Information on prior years was not subject to the verification required by prevailing mercantile regulations. Our work has been performed in accordance with the requirements established in prevailing International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 “Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (ISAE 3000 Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with the Guidelines on assurance engagements on the Non-Financial Statement issued by the Spanish Institute of Chartered Accountants. The procedures carried out in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing and are less extent in scope than reasonable assurance engagements, and therefore, the level of assurance provided is likewise lower. Our work consisted in requesting information from Management and the various Group units participating in the preparation of the NFIS, reviewing the process for gathering and validating the information included in the NFIS, and applying certain analytical procedures and sampling review tests as described below:  Meetings with Group personnel to gain understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the main risks related to these matters and obtain the necessary information for our external review.  Analysing the scope, relevance and integrity of the content included in the 2018 NFIS based on the materiality analysis made by the Group and described in section “Materiality analysis” of the NFIS, considering the content required by prevailing mercantile regulations.  Analysing the processes for gathering and validating the data included in the 2018 NonFinancial Statement.  Reviewing the information on the risks, policies and management approaches applied in relation to the material aspects included in the NFIS.  Checking, through tests, based on a selection of a sample, the information related to the content of the 2018 NFIS and its correct compilation from the data sources.  Obtaining a representation letter from the Board of Directors and Management. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed in our verification and the evidence obtained, no matter came to our attention that would lead us to believe that the 2018 NFIS of the Group for the year ended Barceló I Annual Report 2018 December 31, 2018 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the content established in prevailing mercantile regulations and the criteria of the selected GRI standards, as well as other criteria described in accordance with that indicated for each subject in section Annex I “List of legal requirements under Law 11/2018”, included in the NFIS. 6 3 Use and distribution This report has been prepared as required by prevailing mercantile regulations in Spain and may not be suitable for any other purpose or jurisdiction. ERNST & YOUNG, S.L. (Signature on the original in Spanish) __________________________________ Antonio Capella Elizalde May 29, 2019 Barceló I Annual Report 2018 7 ABOUT THIS REPORT Content and criteria for drawing up this report The present Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) is part of the 2018 Consolidate Management Report of Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A. and fulfils requirements related to the reporting of non-financial and diversity set out in Spanish Law 11/2018 of 28 December 2018, amending the Code of Commerce, the consolidated text of the Corporate Enterprises Act approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010 of 2 July, and the Spanish Account Auditing Act (Law 22/2015 of 20 July). This report was drawn up following the requirements established in Spanish Law 11/2018 and the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Annexe I of the NFIS contains a correlation for both. The European Commission's Guidelines on Non-financial Reporting (2017/C 215/01) arising from Directive 2014/95/EU was also observed. According to the GRI Standards, the content of the present NFIS complies the principles of comparability, materiality, relevance and reliability in that the included information is accurate, comparable and verifiable. As the first one that the Group has ever drawn up and published, the present NFIS only includes information from 2018. Scope and boundaries of the information A global business approach was used for the scope/perimeter of this report, consolidating all the data of the Group's main business divisions, namely Barceló Hotel Group, including hotels owned, rented or managed, and Ávoris, the Travel Division, except for specific exclusions in certain indicators or information (identified throughout the report). Materiality analysis An analysis was made of relevant Group issues, businesses and the different stakeholders before defining the Corporate Reputation Plan included in the Strategic Plan (refer to section 1.5 herein). This materiality analysis was used as a reference for defining the information to disclose in this NFIS. The relevance of the different topics was examined from a double analysis, i.e. external and internal. Externally, the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations General Assembly were employed as the key reference to determine and prioritise key actions. The internal analysis and estimate of the impact of these actions on the Group involved the participation of different departments so as to establish common priorities for customers, the business, owners, the environment, vendors, suppliers and collaborators, competitors and the local communities in which we operate and, of course, for our employees, the fundamental value and driving force of our Company. The relevant issues identified from the results of this analysis were: • Employee-related issues: training, education and capacity-building of teams, description of the characteristics of our staff, diversity and inclusion, employee commitment, talent recruitment and occupational health and safety. • Environmental issues: energy and water consumption, generation of emissions, environmental risks and impacts and waste generation and management.. • Ethical and social issues: local community development, compliance, business ethics and transparency, corporate governance management and compliance with human rights. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 • Business-related issues: economic performance, customer satisfaction and service quality, Barceló's presence in the world, investments and the continuous innovation of services and products. 8 CONTENTS About this report 8 4.

Barceló I Annual Report 2018 13 Our current business model is the result of the combination of decentralisation and geographical specialisation, characteristics that, while not individually differential, constitute a flexible and efficient model when taken as a whole: • Decentralisation: our structure focuses decisions on each business unit with the support of a corporate structure, which entails strategic and other areas where centralisation permits economies of scale. Decentralisation lets us be highly efficient and adaptable to different markets and environments. • Geographic specialisation: while the industry tends towards asset-light models, Barceló has adapted its profile according to the geographies in which it operates. We can thus cover all the links in the value chain from franchisors (Asia) to full-cycle operators (Latin America), including pure management (USA) and hotel operation with risk in EMEA. CRESTLINE HOTELS & RESORTS The Barceló Group operates in the United States through Crestline Hotels & Resorts, a fully-owned subsidiary with a business model focused on managing third-party hotels (mostly under third-party brands such as Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, etc.). EE.UU. PURE EMEA MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT WITH RISK ASIA FRANCHISE CARIBBEAN & LATAM HERITAGE The geographical diversification and balance of our portfolio, a light and flexible central structure with a decentralised management model, an effective risk control policy and our commitment to a job well done, have been, throughout the history of the Company, a guarantee of solidity in the face of the vagaries of the world economy. In this context, the Group has a healthy balance sheet and maintains a solid financial capacity. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 14 We have always understood that success is not only about adapting to the shifting realities of the market, but also in anticipating them. Therefore, and especially now in a competitive and constantly changing world, we never settle. We are always at the front line. We are always looking forward, developing, progressing, improving, surpassing ourselves continuously. We are therefore a benchmark not only for guests as innovative hotel service providers but also for the sector as pioneers who lead the way. Always heading towards greater and better. We surpass ourselves daily by working hard without detours or complications. We face our challenges and projects with perseverance, resolve, dedication and solidity. Step by step. We stay away from any dogmatism so that we can seize opportunities as they appear. We do not let our past success get in our way. While we have the self-confidence to face what we propose, we are modest and diligent. We work so that our success speaks for itself. For us: Forward Hoteligence. B.

The company announced a direct flight to Mauritius Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Island in 2016 and then the incorporation of another route, this time to Jamaica, in the spring of 2017.

The PlanB! experience program comprises 32 different themed gift boxes at over 3,650 points of sale throughout Spain.

Grow in size: reaching a size that would consolidate our place among the major players in the global hotel sector (the 2018 RETO Plan contemplated growing from 104 hotels and 33,000 rooms to 190 hotels and 50,000 rooms). 3. Evolve as a management company: the Barceló Group has strong roots in property and ownership. Keeping true to this characteristic, which will continue to be one of our greatest strengths, the Group also evolved as a management company. In this regard, 12 action plans were defined, including 33 projects: Barceló I Annual Report 2018 20 4.

The Barceló risk management policies are established with a view to identifying and analysing the risks that the Group faces, setting limits, measures and adequate controls to mitigate the potential impact of these risks as much as possible. In this regard, the Barceló Group has had a risk map in place since 2014 as the main tool for Management to minimise risk and optimise their management. These risks were defined based on the analysis of levers to achieve the strategic objectives of the Group with an elevated involvement of Senior Management. By tracking and monitoring these risks, we can identify events or occurrences that could negatively impact the achievement of Barceló strategic objectives. A total of 24 risks to which the Barceló Group is exposed have been identified in the following general areas: • Strategic and operational risks related to the business model and the Barceló Hotel Group portfolio • Financial risks resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates, etc. • Risks related to corporate governance and the organisational structure • Risks related to customer satisfaction • Specific risks of the Travel business • Other risks Of the total of 24 identified risks, 8 were identified with an elevated net assessment in terms of magnitude of the impact and likelihood of occurrence, and mitigating actions were defined and implemented on them. Work will continue in 2019 to review and update, where appropriate, these risks and the subsequent definition of the action plans to mitigate their potential impact. In addition to the Company's global risk map, the Barceló Management Committee considers further risks intrinsic to the sector in which it operates and in line with the main challenges of the industry (e.g. changes in consumer habits, seasonality, accessibility/dependence of means of transport, online boom, etc.), countries where activities are carried out (e.g. climate, political situation, etc.), legislative developments/uncertainty in the face of new regulatory frameworks, etc. In addition to the foregoing, the airline Evelop has taken further steps in the past year regarding the general and environmental risks of its activity, having identified 14 specific risks for which specific mitigation actions have been defined. These risks are related to general aspects of the business (legislative developments, geopolitical situations at the destination, accidents, etc.) and environmental aspects (consumption of resources, environmental conditions, emissions, etc.).

WE ARE A TEAM: OUR PEOPLE Barceló has always been customer-centric, and the emphasis on this approach has been growing recent years in that customers are now squarely in the centre of all our decisions. This approach has allowed us to evolve towards a vision that is increasingly more focused on employees, our internal client and the true driving force of the business. We want them to feel taken care of, respected and, above all, recognised for their daily work at all times. 2.1 OUR VALUES One of the main steps taken to achieve that our employees have this satisfaction and pride of belonging is the feeling that we are all part of the same team, something FRESH has helped us achieve. The first letter of each of our main values of Flexibility, Responsibility and Energy for Service, to which we also add Hospitality as an intrinsic part of our business, form the acronym FRESH, a simple catchword to remember the values that have been in the essence of the Group since its founding. The #somosFRESH campaign has served to refresh and shine the spotlight brightly on these values. It is precisely in times of prosperity when we believe that we must work to shore up the pillars that sustain us as a Group, using them as a basis to develop new behaviours that, once in practice, strengthen business priorities and always consistent with our values. Therefore, we like to always have our values as a reference when defining our vision in the medium and long terms: what we want to be, where we want to go and how we want things to be done in the Group. And as we refine our values, we are setting up a company culture that helps us do things consistently and coherently. At Barceló we work passionately and collaboratively; we are committed and involved employees, and we like to recognise Barceló I Annual Report 2018 the efforts of our team; we are restless and innovative, with a will to excel and employees who are eager about training and being informed; we are flexible and disciplined, agile and open to change, working in a coordination with different business areas, yet without losing our permanent objective of placing the client at the centre of our decision-making. We are open to the latest technological trends, with a desire to be always connected, mobile and social. 27 FRESH Challenge With an aim of refreshing and making present all the values and culture of the Group, FRESH Challenge was one of our star programs in 2018.

To this end, we reorganised some corporate areas in the hotel business focused on people in 2018, working on two specialisations: Recruitment and Talent Management, and Employee Experience and Training. Both departments, together with the rest of the sections integrated in the Human Resources Department, cover the experience of our employees throughout their Employee Journey: Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Each phase encompasses some of our main challenges, projects that we faced during 2018 and in which we must continue working and investing our efforts in the coming years. 29 2.3.1 TALENT ATRACTION We work hard every day so that the experience of our employees exceeds their expectations in each phase of their journey through the company, including the experience of potential candidates at times and channels linked to talent recruitment. We thus have different programs and initiatives that, following a chronological structure, help us get the best out of our teams. • Employer branding One of the most recent initiatives that we have wanted to launch with force was the new Employer branding actions to generate and increase followers and promoters. These actions start with drawing up value proposals that could attract and motivate our candidates, including participation in different events and job fairs at the best universities and hotel business schools, and a wider diffusion of Barceló through different social networks. • HR Portal Another great achievement in 2018 entailed increasing our visibility through the Human Resources portal, which involved attracting more traffic to it. A value proposition with its own content about the daily work carried out in the company, including yet not limited to employee testimonials. It has become an attractive showcase for third parties, generating a greater desire to belong to Barceló. Currently, 21% of our candidates come to us through this channel, reaching a total of 72,863 applications received in 2018 for more than 435 selection processes. • LinkedIn Another source with the greatest potential for attracting talent; counting, to date, with over 62,000 followers and having received more than 1,100 candidacies throughout 2018. • Schools and job forums With a view to attracting new employees who stand out for their initiative and passion for hospitality, and to whom we wish to convey the values of the Group, we visited the best national and international hotel business schools and universities, tallying a total of 20 trips to schools and job forums in many countries, including Germany, France, Portugal and Switzerland. One of our main objectives is to incorporate more specialised profiles for each area. • Recruitment process manager Another 2018 innovation entailed the incorporation of the epreselec digital tool for optimising our selection processes. This database is common for all our channels and which lets us more efficiently manage every posted vacancies. In addition to this selection process management optimisation, the database -which already exceeds 81,000 candidatesguarantees that we have better talent management. • Internship program (greater details in section 5.1.) In the corporate area, a total of 51 trainees have collaborated with us in different company departments -mainly e-Commerce, Revenue and HR-. Our goal, at the end of this period, is to try to incorporate as many of them as possible. Hotel internships are mainly carried out at Reception, Kitchen and Restaurant. Over 2,000 students have completed internships at one of our hotels, and approximately 20% of them have joined the staff. During 2018, of the 57 future professionals who participated in our Management Training Program, 29 students were positively assessed to join the Development Program as part of the Barceló team, and the final results are still pending. Most likely between 30 and 40% of the students who completed the MTP will have the opportunity to join the Barceló Development Plan to become Hotel General Managers. Our talent acquisition program lets student get an overview of the General Managers mission at a Barceló hotel, in Barceló I Annual Report 2018 addition to crosstraining each of the different areas of the hotel. Thus, and according to the skills shown, their formal incorporation into one of our hotels is assessed. Most importantly, however, they are committed to continuous training to become a Barceló Hotel General Managers. . 30 2.3.2 DEVELOPING TALENT One of our main challenges in terms of people is their development, both professionally and personally. Barceló gives its employees the opportunity to grow in a constantly evolving, international environment with continuous growth prospects. In order to adapt and personalise a professional itinerary for each member of our staff, we designed a comprehensive employee-centric development model that we call B-Talent. This model was conceived to gain a vision of the development of teams thanks to the help of 3 coordinated assessment tools: Performance Evaluation, which qualitatively and quantitatively measures the achievement of the objectives set for the year; Talent or Potential Detection, for comparing the adjustment insofar as the profile and the profile of success for a specific position based on the key competences and the analysis of associated behaviours; and, finally, Individual Development Plan Tracking, which measures the degree of progress/operational learning and tracking in the workplace. We use the sum of these results to get the information that lets us measure the progressions of individuals and determine their development plans in a personalized way. Allegro Madeira · Portugal Additionally, we have three training programmes at the Barceló Hotel Group, each pursuing clearly defined objectives. a. Executive Programme At Barceló, we consider that all directors are responsible for their own business units with a general management Barceló I Annual Report 2018 vision (income and expenses). Therefore, and in order for our business model as managers to be sustainable in the long term, we have a group of highly qualified managers. B Campus is our corporate university for guaranteeing excellence-based training. B Campus comprises our 3 main management development programmes: 1. Firstly, the Global Management Programme, a four-year project focused on Hotel Managers. Its objective is focused on the development of key competences with a vision of general management and highly strategic approach. The second call in this programme was held in 2018 with the participation of 43 General Managers for contents related to Marketing, Commercial, Accounting and Finance 31 2. We also launched the Hotel Specialisation Programme. Organised into specialised schools, the content of this programme is linked in its entirety to the hotel business, thus guaranteeing a constant updating in the sector and its particularities. The focus was placed on Leadership and People Management in 2018. With Leadership Skills Training, our group of Directors reinforced their knowledge in this area, working on different objectives such as leadership in times of change, promoting proactivity in teams, and developing creativity, initiative and daring. Internally we defined it as a training to improve the attitudes of a leader .. 3. Lastly, our well rooted Barceló Development Program, especially designed for Deputy and Assistant General Managers, has had an extensive journey at the Barceló Hotel Group. Eighty-four professionals were trained in one of the modules in this training itinerary in 2018, the majority of which (around 70%) is taught by in-house managers. b. Corporate Programme In line with the Group's strategy and objectives defined annually by Management, the Corporate Programme includes crosscutting training actions touching upon all the groups. These training plans are promoted by the General Corporate Management, developed by the Human Resources Department and created in collaboration with the involved departments. 1. B Welcome is our onboarding programme for new employees, mainly aiming to simplify their adaptation to the position and Company by either face-to-face or e-learning methods. In 2018, 95% of our new EMEA employees -at both operational and corporate levelscompleted B Welcome training, a program that now runs in 5 different languages. 2. Committed to offering excellent service and differential and memorable experiences adapted to each client, SER Barceló has proven itself to be one of our main tools. With our own training system, this programme guarantees knowledge of the standards and procedures defined by brand for all employees. In 2018 alone we organised over 30 days of employee training taught by multidisciplinary corporate teams, with a duration of more than 200 teaching hours in not only Spain but also Bulgaria, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Mexico. Approximately 8,000 employees in the EMEA region currently have this training. In addition, in the Company's strategic digitalisation framework, the digital platform was designed specifically to support this programme for housing all available resources, thus guaranteeing its accessibility to all involved actors. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 3. Department Heads constitute a key group at Barceló, and are key figures for both their operational knowledge and actual running of the Company. They are responsible for conveying this information to their teams. With them in mind, we have two department gatherings yearly to provide them with the theoretical and operational tools and resources they need for their daily jobs. 32 4. Equally focused on Department Heads, and with the aim of making them aware of the importance of correctly evaluating their teams, while also equipping them with better tools to help them focus their interviews with collaborators, we launched the #IAMTALENTATOR programme, whose first step was to train 518 managers from 60 different hotels about the best way to carry out Performance Evaluations as team leaders. 5. The Corporate Programme also entails further training actions launched over the past four months of the year, including training on the new General Data Protection Regulation for the entire EMEA hotel management team and Reception, Human Resources, Guest Experience Managers and Marketing teams; and Time Management training for the Marketing Team. 6. Finally, Barceló Campus, our e-learning platform with potential for developing online training and an immediate aim of generating content with a greater scope and in support of our management project. This platform currently offers connection to more than 6,000 Group employees, who mainly access it for B Welcome reception training. c. Operational Programme All our hotels prepare an ad-hoc Training Plan every year with the aim of responding to the training needs of every single employee. The actions contemplated in these Training Plans cover team operational concerns, including training as diverse as specialisation in languages, image and personal branding, culinary innovation topics, postural hygiene and other mandatory training related Occupational Risk Prevention and Food Handling. In 2018, hotels in Spain carried out 1,105 training actions under this Programme, involving 21,805 participants, which represented a 28% increase versus data from the previous year.

It is not just about attracting and developing, but also having the right tools to help us maintain elevated talent retention levels. In this regard, we work in different lines: 33 • B Opinion Our third straight Labour Climate Survey was launched in the EMEA area under the B Opinion brand. This is a key tool for identifying the motivation and commitment trends of our teams. A crucial aspect in attracting and retaining talent entails fostering a good working environment and a culture that is consistent with the strategy. By aligning expectations and knowing our areas of improvement to work on them will result in excellent service for customers. In 2018, 65% of our staff participated in the surveys via a multilingual platform available in 11 different languages, to accommodate all nationalities working in our organisation. The results were once again very positive, striking a resounding 87% in global commitment with the Company. Subsequently, 76 hotels are working on establishing their own action plans for 2019. In past surveys, emphasis was placed on three key aspects: • Working environment and means: Including actions for the personal well-being of employees and work simplification and efficiency measures. Improved facilities (lunchrooms, offices, etc.), uniforms, nutrition and well-being, etc. • Training: More complete training programs were designed to meet training needs in terms of skills and abilities and also for staff motivation. • Communication: With actions that improve relationships with the team in terms of optimising interdepartmental meetings and improving communication with base personnel. Likewise, Employee Portal connection and task digitalisation are being encouraged. • B Conversations Following the initiative launched in 2017, and for the second consecutive year, different sessions were organised for Senior Management to share results, challenges and plans for the future, this time with over 300 Barceló Hotel Group corporate employees in attendance. • Seniority Dinners We hold Seniority Dinners annually and for employees celebrating 10 or 25 years of work performance or retirement. • Day for families At our hotels, we usually hold annual celebrations that, coinciding with the beginning or end of the season, bring all employees together with their family members and especially children to spend a fun day to break up the routine. • Family Day This is the first year that we held an organised celebration from corporate to focus on our little ones. This snack time event held a few days before Christmas brought together over 100 children of employees in a fun afternoon of games and crafts. We proposed that hotels follow suit, and many did with an elevated degree of satisfaction and gratitude by all the involved employees. We also carried out further ad-hoc actions in 2018, including a 90th birthday celebration for the Group's Chairman of Honour, Gabriel Barceló, and in tribute to the person who organised a special collection campaign for solidarity projects managed by the Barceló Foundation. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 34 2.4 DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION A staff of different ages balances the need for experienced people with the maintenance of a succession plan through the hiring of new talents.

Social responsibility in terms of gender equality is a standing reality at the Barceló Hotel Group. In this regard, the Company assumes the commitment to guarantee and promote real and effective equality between women and men, while continuing the promotion of the value of equality and the principle of non-discrimination as a basic pillar of company policy. The main objectives of our Equality Plan are the following: • Promote equality in selection and promotion processes that avoid vertical and horizontal segregation and the use of sexist language. • Ensure that hiring-related decisions are not based on stereotypes or assumptions about aptitudes, characteristics of people of a certain gender, race, age, disability, etc. • Continue ensuring that women and men have exactly the same opportunities to access and work in any area of the company they wish: in professional groups, occupations and in the management structure of the company. • Guarantee equal access to training for men and women in the company. • Conduct training and awareness-raising actions on equal treatment and opportunities. The Barceló Code of Ethics (Section 1.8.1) contains a non-discrimination commitment in the hiring and promotion of new and current employees, and the policies therein are governed exclusively by criteria of professional skill, availability, effort, knowledge and ability to do a given job. There will never be discrimination because of aspects of gender, beliefs, religion or any other personal or social condition outside their conditions of merit and ability, with special consideration for the care and employment integration of people with disabilities or handicaps. Another of the tools we have within the framework of our commitment to society and in compliance with the regulations on the rights of people with disabilities, are purchases from special employment centres and the contribution to indirect labour integration. Vacancies are posted through means that ensure that anyone at risk of social exclusion can be informed and access them (State Employment Services, local foundations to support workers at risk/danger of social exclusion, etc.). The Barceló Group has jobs reserved for people with disabilities according to the criteria established by the pertinent legislation. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 35 2.5 WORK ENVIRONMENT In addition to our daily efforts to carry out the actions resulting from each edition of B Opinion -our internal climate survey-, the Barceló Group has other actions in place for the interests and protection of its team. 2.5.1 SOCIAL DIALOGUE AND TRADE UNIONS Dialogue and negotiation are part of the way to address any difference or conflict in the Group. Relations with employees are an extremely important factor to improve and maintain staff commitment. At Barceló we respect the fundamental standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). All Group employees have the right to representation through the different applicable bargaining agreements. We guarantee that worker representatives receive fair treatment, free from discrimination and that they have all the facilities to be able to perform their representation functions. Regarding labour relations in Spain, the Group is part of the Fifth State Labour Agreement for the Hotel Industry and collective bargaining agreements for the hotel sector in each province, with the exception of two (company). They apply to virtually the entire workforce, supplemented by collective bargaining agreements as needed and signed with labour representation accordingly. Labour representatives are elected every four years by personal, free, direct and secret suffrage, and are informed of the relevant changes that may occur in the employment organisation at the Entity in accordance with the pertinent legislation in force. 2.5.2 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY The Occupational Risk Prevention Service is responsible for defining and carrying out the preventive policy that affecting the entire workforce, materialised in two lines of action: a. The prevention-technical line, which entails activities such as regular workstation assessments, implantation of emergency and evacuation plans and the coordination of the prevention activities. b. Occupational medicine, with medical checkups for personnel, the protection of especially sensitive employees and the adaptation of workstations with specific ergonomic material, in addition to activities and prevention campaigns for maintaining and improving the health of workers while contributing to the development of a culture of prevention and promoting healthy habits. . Barceló I Annual Report 2018 36 In this regard, we launched the Check your Health campaign in the first quarter of 2018, focusing on a first phase for corporate teams and with the aim of increasing the value of annual medical checkups, fostering closer and more positive communication with employees and completing the sense of such checkups, since the occasion was used to provide them with a guide full of recommendations on health and well-being and an invitation to enjoy a full and healthy snack. The same action was extended to the Group's hotels, with a goal for 2019 to cover, under this same umbrella and with a full scope, the communication of the different Occupational Risk Prevention actions aimed at improving the health of the people at Barceló. Further examples of initiatives in this line include vaccination campaigns, breast cancer awareness sessions, healthy eating actions in staff lunchrooms, weekly fruit baskets available to teams, organisation of Health Week and promotion of sports practice thanks to the sponsorship of different local actions, such as Palma Marathon. Seventy percent of all our hotels have labour representation with occupational health and safety attributions, in which regard Barceló Group maintains a transparent relationship with the maximum collaboration of each one, organising and attending regular meetings, and establishing the channels of communication and reception for suitable proposals in each case.

In Spain, it has an action and prevention protocol to deal with psychosocial conflicts. In 2018, two complaints were registered where the investigation and corresponding actions were carried out. Every person has the right to receive a correct, respectful and dignified treatment, and respect of his or her privacy and physical and moral integrity, and may not be subject to any circumstance, whether by birth, race, gender, religion, opinion or any other personal or social condition or circumstance, including employment status, to degrading, humiliating or offensive treatment. The actions pursued with this protocol are: • Inform staff throughout the organisation about the consequences and implications of psychosocial risks, specifically about harassment processes. • Identify harassment processes that occur with a view to correcting them and establishing the appropriate recommendations to prevent their reoccurrence. • Convey messages to workers in relation to the adoption of moral patterns of conduct that ensure solidarity, unity, collaboration, integration, respect and personal dignity. 2.5.5 ORGANISATIONAL POLICIES AND WORK-LIFE BALANCE OUTSIDE WORKING HOURS Striking a balance between personal and professional commitments is a major challenge and not easy to achieve given the high demands that the current environment poses and the sector of activity where we work, since we provide service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Most of our team members do not have laptops or mobile phones, thus guaranteeing work disconnection outside business hours. In the United States, Crestline corporate teams have no access to their work email from their mobile devices. In BCD Travel, the Ávoris business area, the pilot phase of the Homeworking Project began in 2018 as a mixed working model in which work is alternated between the company's main premises and an alternative, usually from the employee's private home. In the context of co-responsibility in the organisation of work and this balance, Barceló applies the measures of Ordering work time and work-life balance regulated in different laws currently in force, observing the maximum days legally established at all times. The following table provides details on the duration of legally defined permits for maternity and paternity cases Barceló I Annual Report 2018 depending on the referred geographical area. The objective is always to respect and simplify the work of women in the Group and strive to contribute as much as possible to the domestic economic responsibilities so that care can be shared by both members of the couple to facilitate the enjoyment of this balance and encourage the co-responsible exercise by both. 38 MA T ERN IT Y/P A T E R N I T Y L E AVE D U R AT I O N Maternity 112 days Spain (Travel and Hotels) Paternity 35 days Maternity between 84 and 120 days Latin America Paternity between 3 and 5 days Maternity between 120 days and 3 years EMEA International Paternity between 5 and 108 days Maternity 45 days UAE (United Arab Emirates) Paternity 0 days 2.5.6 EMPLOYEE TURNOVER TURNOVER TOTAL MEN WOMEN PERMANENT TEMPORARY TOTAL 52% 52% 48% 55% 45% There were a total of 1,698 dismissals in 2018: DISMISSALS UNDER BETWEEN OVER MANAGEMENT MIDDLE CORE NUMBER MEN WOMEN 30 30 AND 50 50 TEAM MANAGEMENT STAFF TOTAL 1.698 70% 30% 51% 43% 6% 1% 9% 90% 2.6 REMUNERATION • Average salary data by professional category, gender and age range of Barceló Group employees in 2018: AVERAGE SALARY PER CATEGORY, AGE RANGE AND GENDER MANAGEMENT TEAM MIDDLE MANAGEMENT CORE STAFF TOTAL MEN WOMEN MEN WOMEN MEN WOMEN MEN WOMEN Under 30 21,888 22,120 10,674 18,276 5,449 8,429 5,691 8,912 TOTAL Between 30 and 50 41,741 38,479 19,323 23,808 9,457 12,777 12,142 14,706 Over 50 74,647 58,835 32,750 35,410 16,611 17,981 23,445 21,520 76% percent of the Group's total workforce is linked and receives remuneration in accordance with applicable collective bargaining agreements.. • Salary gap data by employee category at the Group: SALARY BREACH PER CATEGORY AND AGE RANGE MANAGEMENT TEAM MIDDLE MANAGEMENT CORE STAFF TOTAL Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Under 30 -1% -71% -55% -57% TOTAL Between 30 and 50 8% -23% -35% -21% Over 50 21% -8% -8% 8% Salary gap data were calculated as the difference between the average gross annual salaries of men and women, expressed as a percentage. 39 3. CUSTOMER-CENTRIC 3.1 OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE STRATEGY Throughout its history, Barceló has been transforming successfully through successive organisational eras, namely distribution from 1960 to 1990, information from 1990 to 2010, and now, the CUSTOMER era. The digital revolution has empowered customers, giving rise to a new profile of a more informed, connected, participative and demanding guest. This new stage therefore requires a strategy that puts the customer at the centre of the entire organisation, with digitalisation being an essential element in this transformation. Understanding the profound impact of the customer revolution is no easy feat. Paradoxically, it can be even more complex for service companies like ours that have always thrived by being customer-focused. It is not about customer orientation, since we've always been customer oriented. It's about going the extra mile, relying on technology to build much more personal relationships with our guests, ones that go much deeper and more emotional than we could have even imagined 10 years ago. In the tourism sector, this revolution is also redefining the industry itself, motivated by the appearance of new digital actors such as online travel agencies (OTAs), which have had a special impact on distribution. However, hotel business managers like us have an important advantage when it comes to competing and our guests' stay with us is an opportunity to establish a personal and emotional relationship with them. At Barceló, we are convinced that improving Customer Experience is our only way to sustainable growth. This means that we not only are but also must be obsessed with being customer oriented. We should not do anything without considering what impact it has on customers, and all reflections should start with customers, their preferences and their needs. This customer-centric approach has brought about a change in our vision: evolving from a culture centred on assets and product quality to a Culture of Experience, focused on putting the customer at the centre of our decisions, on the quality of service measured in terms of satisfaction, in profitability driven by income and innovation as a differentiating element. At Barceló, we are convinced that improving Customer Experience is our only way to sustainable growth. This obsession with customers has involved a comprehensive review of all the pillars of the company -the strategy, structure, people, processes and technologyand an undertaking of projects of great transformational importance with the customer as the focal point: • Evolution from an organisational structure in silos that worked autonomously with a segmented vision of the customer, to sharing a single customer image. • Development of a quick and interconnected structure that promotes interaction between areas (cross and multi-departmental collaboration) and customer-focused transversal project developments. • Reorganising processes with a focus on the customer and basing decision-making on the impact of our customers' satisfaction. • Creation of a digitalisation strategy as an element that facilitates the transformation, supported by Cloud, Mobility, Big Data and Social Business capacities. The Data Driven project with a significant emphasis on transformation, allows us to manage the experience of our customers over the course of their relationship with us (the Customer Journey ) and obtain a 360º vision of the customer, to offer the best possible proposal during each digital and physical point of contact and guarantee that the experience is homogenous and optimum in each channel through which the customer makes contact with us (online, call centre and hotels). Barceló I Annual Report 2018 • Creation of a specific Guest Experience department, reporting directly to the CEO, to promote and coordinate all customer-related initiatives (with teams at both Corporate and in hotels through Guest Experience Managers). This area identifies and defines when and how each of the different roles participates in the Customer Experience. 40 3.2 OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE The starting point for our Customer Experience strategy is to carefully listen to our customers to identify their needs and the extent to which we have exceeded their expectations. At Barceló we define the Customer Voice from a broad perspective: we believe that the customer voice encompasses all feedback provided by our customers at all times over the course of the Customer Journey, and we constantly monitor new listening channels. Digital tools allow us to listen and analyse the customer voice in detail when they are not staying with us. Currently, we monitor the voice of our customers on an aggregated basis via 175 opinion websites and OTAs and analyse more than 1 million comments per year. This tool helps us to understand the customer voice in more detail through structured, segmented information with which we define group-specific action plans. 1,500 across the organisation have received training and regularly use the tool. Thanks to the improvements and investments made, we have significantly improved the satisfaction of all our customers in recent years. 29% of hotels in the Barceló Hotel Group have a GRI4 of over 90%. In terms of the presence of Barceló Hotel Group on social media, at present, we have 173 managed profiles and 3.5 million followers on the following social networks: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest and VK. In 2018, it had the most followers on Twitter and second most on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube of all Spanish hotel chains. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT Barceló Group has constant communication channels with customers in its different businesses, through which customers can share any incident, suggestion or comments about any aspect. A customer can tell us about anything he/she may be unhappy with in terms of the provision of our services in writing, creating a file and receiving a response in turn. % CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS RECEIVED Hotels Division 0.02% (of all stays) Airline 1.80% (of all travellers) Travel Division Wholesale 0.36% (of all travellers) Retail 0.48% (of all records) 3.3 ENSURING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR CUSTOMERS Under our customer centric approach and as part of our commitment to our customers, Barceló has implemented and maintains different controls and initiatives: • In order to guarantee food safety and hygiene, all hotels have preparation and service procedures in line with international hazard analysis and critical control point standards, periodically performing audits to verify and guarantee compliance with this standard. This is a very important control aspect and all teams at the hotel are trained on their correct implementation. The achievement of a minimum score in audits is linked to the variable remuneration of the hotels' teams. Furthermore, our airline outsources the catering service, having verified compliance with the applicable legislation. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 • All our hotels have specific preventive maintenance and cleaning plans to guarantee that all facilities are in perfect condition (for example, installation of air conditioning, high and low voltage installations, lifts, kitchen utensils, etc.). These programmes are monitored and complied with, on the one hand, as part of the B-EcologyS programme (see section 4. Environmental management) and, on the other hand, through internal and external audits as part of the Ser Barceló system (see section 2.3.2). 4 The Global Review IndexTM (GRI) is a standard index in the hospitality industry calculated by ReviewPro based on comments left on more than 170 opinion websites to measure the online reputation 41 • Furthermore, at the Barceló Hotel Group, we want to help our customers live better as part of our policy of wellbeing, where there is no right or wrong: everything is structured around improvement. Because there's always something to improve on. Improving is what motivates us. It is why we innovate in our products and services.

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 4.1 CONSEQUENCES OF BARCELÓ'S ACTIVITIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PREVENTION5 The Barceló Group is committed to preserving the natural environment, preventing and mitigating any impact, promoting environmental awareness to jointly contribute to sustainable development. At Barceló we are aware of the impact of our activities on the environment and we continuously work to prevent and anticipate potential environmental contingencies, integrating sustainability in all our processes to reduce any impacts generated. We structure the definition of Barceló's environmental strategy around environmental risk analysis and impacts. In 2018, the most significant risks were identified as those associated with climate change (mainly atmospheric emissions), the consumption of energy resources, water shortage, proper waste management (and in particular, the consequences of applying the European regulation on single-use plastics). Noise and light pollution have been identified as a minor risk, as have the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems. The consumption of raw materials was not significant in this analysis. To control and mitigate these impacts, at Barceló Group we are committed to: • Innovation, meaning we are constantly searching for more sustainable alternatives • Technology to improve the management of impacts generated and speed up the decision making process, in addition to gradually incorporating more energetically efficient equipment to constantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. • The continuous adaptation of operating processes to improve the efficient consumption of resources To this end, we involve the main stakeholders: employees, customers and suppliers to make progress towards a more sustainable further together. To properly manage the Company's environmental risks and impacts, Barceló concentrates its efforts in the following spheres of action: Barceló I Annual Report 2018 5 Environmental data does not include hotels manages by Crestline Hotels & Resorts, as the corresponding information is not available. 44 B-ECOLOGY At the end of 2012, Barceló launched the B-Ecology project, which summarises all the Company's know how and defines the objectives and actions in terms of energy efficiency and the responsible consumption of resources. This scope of this project, which initially focussed on monitoring and controlling energy consumption (electricity, diesel, natural gas, propane gas, renewable energy, etc.) has gradually expanded in recent years, transforming into the current project which is structured around 3 main pillars: • B-Ecology IDEAS: all factors relating to the implementation of new technologies, studies, technical audits and the implementation of the Company's know-how. In other words, works and improvements to facilities including ecological lighting systems, trigeneration systems, efficient climate control systems, greywater purification systems, thermal solar energy, geothermal energy systems, biomass process, etc. • B-Ecology 24/7: actions associated with the daily work at hotels, interdepartmental meetings, technical inspections at all facilities, energy training for our employees. In other words, measures relating to daily operations and maintenance at hotels. At all hotels, Barceló subjects energy consumption to daily control and monitoring (using a shared system), which makes it possible to obtain in-depth information on areas of the hotel where consumption is highest in order to prioritise energy saving measures. In this connection, each hotel has an Energy Book, which defines the energy characteristics of the hotel and each month, Energy Oversight Committee meetings are held at each hotel, at which compliance with energy saving measures and best practices implemented at the hotel is assessed. Furthermore, there is an Energy Manager at each hotel, responsible for implementing B-EcologyS at each hotel. • B-Ecology NEWS: all aspects relating to external communication (to our customers) and internal communication (to our workers) of the objectives and results obtained having implemented energy measures. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Barceló's commitment to preserving the environment starts long before a hotel is included in our portfolio. Barceló has defined a series of environmental and energy efficiency criteria for both newly built hotels and the acquisition of preexisting establishments that must be adhered to (for example, low-consumption lighting, motion detectors, taps fitted with savings systems, areas for selective waste consumption, etc.). Furthermore, in the specific case of newly-built hotels, whenever possible (depending on location, climate, hotel type, contract types, etc.), we consider the possible installation of renewable sources of energy (solar panels, cogeneration systems, micro cogeneration, trigeneration, geothermal energy systems, biomass boilers, etc.). Santa Catalina, a Royal Hideaway Hotel, named in the Top 10 best sustainability and hotel renovation projects at the Re Think Hotel Awards (organised by the Habitat Futura Group). The renovation project includes the creation of avenue of plants for the hotel to become integrated into Parque Doramas, LED lighting throughout the hotel, installation of a water chilled air conditioning system with significant energy savings in rooms and common areas, the installation of solar panels and different measures to improve energy efficiency (thermal insulation, harnessing natural light, green Barceló I Annual Report 2018 roofs, automation, motion detectors, etc.). Furthermore, green mobility will be promoted through a electric car and scooter hire service and electric chargers installed in car parks. Hotel Santa Catalina, considered a historic monument of patrimonial importance to local residents, is due to reopen in July 2019 under the Barceló Hotel Group's Royal Hideaway brand. 45 In June 2018, Barceló Cáceres reopened following comprehensive renovation works involving different activities in both rooms and common areas with a view to improving the energy efficiency of this hotel. Worth particular mention are: • Switch from the use of propane energy in kitchens and diesel in boilers to natural gas. • Switch from diesel boilers to a multi-stage natural gas condensing boiler, with the subsequent 36% reduction in CO2 emissions. • Installation of more efficient and quieter climate control devices in rooms and motion detectors in common areas. • Implementation of control systems to improve energy use. • All furniture, fixtures, mattresses, lighting, etc. has been donated to different associations, such as “Reto Cáceres”. The customer satisfaction score has increased by more than 7 points since the comprehensive refurbishment, up to 91. • Environmental certification programmes A total of 26 hotels have some form of environmental certification, including: Certification No. hotels Travelife 6 GreenGlobe 13 ISO 14001 4 BREEAM 1 Sustainable Tourism Certification (Costa Rica) 2 In the coming years, we will work to increase the number of hotels with a certification endorsed by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council. Furthermore, 32 hotels have been named TripAdvisor GreenLeaders. Our airline has an environmental and quality system in place, which is ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certified. Furthermore, since 2017 Evelop has been a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and in 2018, it renewed its IOSA certification (IATA Operational Safety Audit). The scope of these certifications encompasses the provisions of commercial passenger and cargo air transport, demonstrating its staunch commitment to improving the competitiveness and efficiency of the services provided.. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 • Resources dedicated to preventing environmental risks In 2018, we estimate that more than €4 million were invested in environmental protection and improvement initiatives (certifications, waste management, renewable facilities, consumption monitoring tools, audits, etc.). In addition to the preventive management of different environmental aspects, we have an environmental responsibility policy. 46 4.2 CONSUMPTION OF NATURAL RESOURCES As a hospitality and travel company, we are aware of the impact of our activities on the consumption of natural resources, with energy consumption and water consumption the most significant. 4.2.1 ENERGY CONSUMPTION Faced with the growing problem concerning the availability of resources and the increase in the cost of energy, in recent years, energy consumption has assumed a leading role in the structure of costs at hotels. Therefore, energy consumption has become a competitive advantage that must be coordinated; to this end, actions must be implemented that promote energy efficiency. The implementation of projects that promote energy efficiency generates direct benefits, including the mitigation of the environmental impact, cost reduction, improving process efficiency and facilitating the adaptation to greater legislative requirements. In recent years, Barceló has implemented a range of energy saving and efficient consumption measures. In the hotel business, the main initiatives implemented were as follows: • Renewable energy installations: 39 of our hotels have some form of renewable energy installation (solar, geothermal, biomass, aerothermal). In the EMEA region, approximately half of our rooms are supplied by renewable energy created in-house. In terms of energy efficiency, worth particular mention is the installation of a trigeneration system at the Barceló Bávaro Beach Resort, a pioneer in its implementation in the zone. This system makes it possible to obtain electricity, heat energy and cooling energy from a single fuel. As the resort is located close to a gas power plant, flue gases (which represent a form of waste to the plant), are harnessed by the resort to obtain both heat energy (to produce domestic hot water) and cooling energy (for use in air conditioning) thanks to an absorption device. • Measures to reduce consumption: • Replacement of practically all incandescent and halogen light bulbs at hotels with LED lighting. Implementation at approximately 85% of the Company's hotels (with an estimated investment of more than €2.3 million) • Installation of motion sensors to activate lights, timers and automation measures to turn on lights and air conditioning, in both rooms and common areas. • Replacement of fuels including diesel or propane with natural gas. • Optimisation of cooling towers and climate control systems or installation of more efficient climate control equipment (estimated investment of more than €5 million). • Improvements to doors and windows to conserve the temperature. • Optimisation of the room allocation process in line with occupancy levels. • Improvements to insulation of pipes to reduce thermal losses. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 47 The Royal Hideaway Corales Resort, named the best new hotel at the 2018 European Hospitality Awards and recently chosen as the best luxury hotel in Spain at the World Travel Awards, perfectly reflects the balance between design, luxury and sustainability. The hotel has a number of features that demonstrate our clear commitment to energy efficiency in the construction of this hotel: • Large-scale outer insulation, cavity walls, double glazing, appropriate levels of shade on outer walls, self-repairing concrete blocks and solar painting, reducing energy consumption. • Solar panels that make it possible to heat domestic hot water at the hotel, in addition to the water in 56 in-room swimming pools. • Geothermal technology used to generate electricity and power air conditioning • Coolers with heat recovery system that also facilitates the perfect operation at partial loads, reducing energy consumption by up to 25%. • Use of automation to efficiently manage energy use. • Communication and awareness raising actions: • 16 hotels have electric vehicle recharge stations available for customers to use. In some cases, such as the hotels in Fuerteventura, these recharge stations are also available for the general public to use. • Campaigns, training and awareness raising aimed at employees, customers and collaborators. At the travel division, the airline consumes the most energy, with the following measures implemented to cut consumption: • Acquisition of more efficient planes with fewer emissions. In 2019, an A350 plane will be included in the fleet, which consumes less fuel and therefore, releases less CO2 compared to the current A330 fleet. • Acquisition of lightweight cargo containers, reducing fuel consumption and emissions as a result. • Periodic outer cleaning of the plane and engines, reducing fuel consumption and emissions as a result. Energy consumption details by source: The Barceló Group has consumed a total of 634,700 MWh6 of energy, with electricity consumption accounting for 66% of the total. TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY SOURCE IN 2018 (MWH) 418,078 Barceló I Annual Report 2018 87,773 83,762 45,087 ELECTRICITY PROPANE DIESEL NATURAL GAS 6 Includes electricity consumption at Avoris travel agencies 48 The average ratio of energy consumption is 44.32 kWh/stay. In addition to the above fuels, operations performed by Evelop use jet fuel as a source of combustion (Jet-A1). The amount of this fuel consumed is directly related to the distance and number of passengers carried. In 2018, 63 million litres7 of Jet-A1 were consumed, coming to a total of 604,806 MWh. 4.2.2 WATER CONSUMPTION In the hotel business, in addition to energy consumption, water consumption is a relevant factor, used mainly for human consumption, watering green spaces and swimming pools. At Barceló, we are staunchly committed to promoting the responsible consumption of this resource and implementing the actions needed to reduce the amount consumed and improve the efficiency of use. • Measures to reduce consumption: • Installation of flow and pressure reducers at most hotels • Installation of sensors on taps • System optimisation (toilet tanks, irrigation, showers, laundry room, etc.) • Adaptation of green areas with native plants and less consumption of water • Replacement of traditional irrigation systems with drip systems • Harnessing of rainwater to water green areas • Communication and awareness raising actions: • Campaigns, training and awareness raising aimed at employees, customers and collaborators.

Emissions Travel Division In 2018, the airline generated a total of 240,643 tonnes of CO2 emissions, all associated with the fuel consumed by Evelop planes (whether operated by Evelop of third parties). It is worth noting that Evelop, on account of its activities and in line with the applicable legislation in force, is assigned Barceló I Annual Report 2018 emission rights, which were not exceeded in 2018. In addition to the CO2emissions generated, a total of 1,188 tonnes of NOx gas (nitrogen oxide) and 76 tonnes of SO2 gas (sulphur oxide) emissions have been generated, all associated with the fuel consumed by Evelop planes (whether operated by Evelop or third parties). 8 Includes emissions deriving from electricity consumption at Avoris travel agencies 50 4.3.2 NOISE EMISSIONS The following measures have been implemented at hotels to prevent noise emissions: • Periodic monitoring of noise levels to guarantee compliance with the applicable legislation • Sound limiters on music equipment • Installation of plant screens to minimise noise emissions • Replacement of equipment and installation of acoustic insulation 4.4 WASTE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT 4.4.1 WASTE MANAGEMENT At Barceló, our goal is to reduce the environmental impact caused by the waste we generate as part of our activities, with a clear focus on implementing the actions needed to minimise the generation of waste. The main management initiatives implemented: • Promoting selective waste management • Measures to minimise waste generation, such as the use of bulk products, the replacement at certain hotels of individual amenities with bulk dispensers or the minimisation of single-use packaging and containers. • Production of compost from organic waste. • Employee training and awareness raising • Customer and collaborator awareness raising (suppliers, subcontractors) The Barceló Maya Resort is a clear example of circular economy in terms of waste management. Sewage from the purifier and tree and plant cuttings are composted to obtain a fertiliser used in the complex's green areas. In 2018, more than 236 tonnes of fertiliser were generated. Furthermore, we have established a goal in the coming 2 years of reducing the use of plastic packaging, for which we have created a cross-departmental work group (operations, marketing, CSR, procurement, standards, maintenance and HR) with different lines of action: • Evaluate the plastic we can eliminate. • Seek and implement more sustainable alternatives for plastic that cannot be eliminated. • At the same time, work with suppliers to minimise plastic used in packaging. Some initiatives implemented in this connection include the replacement of water bottles with purified water fountains. TOTAL PRODUCTION OF WASTES SIMILAR TO URBAN TYPES (tonnes) BARCELÓ HOTEL GROUP Barceló I Annual Report 2018 26,648 3,115 1,774 1,362 875 ORGANIC WASTE GLASS PAPER AND CARDBOARD PACKAGING VEGETABLE OIL 51 Barceló has rolled out a waste generation system at the source for all hotels, making it possible to make sure this waste is recycled and/or recovered. The main waste generated is similar to urban waste (organic waste, paper, cardboard, packaging and glass) and used cooking oil. Ratios of kg waste generated per stay: Organic waste 1.40 Glass 0.16 Paper and cardboard 0.09 Packaging 0.07 Vegetable oil 0.05 Total 1.77 4.4.2 PREVENTION OF FOOD WASTE Each year, 1.3 billion tonnes of food goes to waste each year worldwide, which accounts for one third of all production, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). It is estimated that 40% of food waste is caused by customerfacing businesses, such as restaurants, supermarkets and hotels9. It is therefore a global problem in which Barceló has an important role to play in the creation of a corporate culture committed to reducing and managing food waste. It is worth noting that, according to Spanish legislation, once a dish leaves the kitchen, the food it contains can no longer be reused. The only option in this instance is for the diner to decide that he/she wants to take any leftovers home. Therefore, the actions implemented by Barceló Hotel Group in this connection are structured around “preventing food waste”: Many hotels (for example, those at the Barceló Maya complex) are working hand-in-hand with suppliers like Unilever on 0 waste programmes . Over the course of 2018, the Barceló Hotel Group has donated more than 84 tonnes of food to different soup kitchens, food banks, associations or foundations. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 9 ReFED, A Roadmap to Reduce US Food Waste by 20 Percent, (2016), www.refed.com 52 4.5 PRESERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY Approximately 35% of our hotels are located close to or in a special protection area, with the conservation of biodiversity and natural habitats in the destinations in which we operate forming part of our DNA. The main actions that we undertake in terms of protecting the environment are: • Concerning vegetation, promoting the planting of native plant species which, in addition to protecting the local ecosystem, require less water. Furthermore, we have collaborated in different reforestation initiatives. • In terms of fauna, hotels located in turtle nesting areas monitor and care for these nesting sites and help for turtles to be released, respecting the nesting period and adapting the hotels operations at these times (for example, outdoor lights are not turned on so as not to compromise the nesting process). Furthermore, endemic population control actions are required to promote the balance of the ecosystem. • The permanent monitoring work that our employees carry out in terms of the environment and raising awareness among customers is particularly important in ensuring they respect the environment and biodiversity (for example, refraining from removing flora and fauna from coral reefs). • To promote the conservation of the environment among employees, beach cleaning activities are carried out on a regular basis. El Embajador, at Royal Hideaway Hotel, has more than 10,500 m2 of green space, representing a special habitat for the daily migration of parrots from the wetlands towards the hotel at dusk and taking off at dawn. Since 2014, the Barceló Montecastillo has performed diagnosis and evaluation work on birds at the hotel, with a view to improving knowledge of wildlife on the golf course, the areas in which birds fly, their use of the different habitats, etc. Particular emphasis is placed on birds at Barceló Montecastillo during the migration period, as they stop at the resort before heading further north or to Africa. In spring, these birds reproduce on the more than 160 hectares of green space that the hotel occupies. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 53 The Barceló Montecastillo Golf has made a commitment to becoming a pioneer in its commitment to organic agriculture. Organic Vegetable Garden Creation of a vegetable garden, free from all mineral fertilisers and chemical products, without the use of pesticides. A wide variety of fruit and vegetables are grown at this vegetable garden: aubergine, courgette, squash, melon, watermelon and tomatoes to name but a few. A selection that is consumed each day at the hotel's restaurant. Furthermore, to raise awareness among our youngest guests of the importance of eating well and understanding the cultivation process, the hotel offers horticulture and cooking courses. Greenhouse At this vegetable garden, we have a small greenhouse to help round off the natural cycle and reflect the entire trajectory, from planting seeds to their transformation into seedlings ready to be transferred to the beds. The vegetable garden produces its own seeds, including lettuce and cabbages, in addition to other plants. Insect hotel The insect hotel consists of a series of compartments, each with a different texture, associated with each of the different insects that we aim to attract. A small pond for secondary fauna, built following a traditional process to help pest regulation and control. Around this insect hotel, there is a selection of aromatic plants to help attract insects. Chicken Coop The hens feed on organic kibble and scraps from the vegetable garden, including different types of weeds such as purslane, for which hens have a special preference. All excrement generated is used in the compost process, with other residues and a little topsoil. The California red earthworm (Eisenia foetida) is tasked with the rest of the process, producing solid and liquid fertiliser to be used on the beds, depending on the type of plant and their physiological state..

COMMITMENTS TO SOCIETY AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES 5.1 ACTIONS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY At Barceló, we are aware that we, just like anybody else in the countries we operate in, which is why we look to generate a positive impact on local communities. The commitment to society is one of the pillars of the Plan to Strengthen the Corporate Reputation of Barceló, with a view to promoting partnerships with local communities insofar as we can contribute to improving the quality of life of their residents. As part of the feasibility analysis of projects we collaborate with, we assess the impact on the local communities in which the activity is performed, under the framework of international and local regulations applied in each instance, prioritising actions that are aligned with the purpose of our business and Goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, generating shared value with society. Barceló is committed to promoting the growth and development of the communities in which the Company operates, including the following measures: • Promoting the recruitment of staff locally • Acquisition of local products and services. Supplier selection guided by criteria of objectiveness and transparency. • Seeking maximum harmony with the features and traditions of the regions and countries in which we operate, with respect for their laws, uses and customs. Thus, and thanks to these criteria, each of our hotels participates in a wide range of social actions on both an individual and joint basis. Below, a number of the most noteworthy activities performed in 2018 can be consulted. • Supporting employability Tourism is one of the fastest growing economic sectors in the world, currently accounting for the creation of 1 out of every 11 jobs10 and is one of the main sources of income in many countries. Therefore, it's key instrument is achieving inclusive and sustainable economic growth and offering decent employment conditions to a wide number of people, in particular young people and women. In line with the objective of attracting the best talent to our Company, but also aware of the impact that the Barceló Hotel Group has on the economic environment as a catalyst for the creation of employment opportunities for young people, we are staunchly committed to supporting the achievement of Goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which fights to achieve decent work and economic growth and believe that this is a priority area of the Company. Our internship programmes go beyond merely allowing students to get an idea of a real-life working environment. We want to offer actual opportunities to join the working world, as part of a programme that offers a wide range of options to different profiles, allowing us to become a reference point in society for providing young people with their first career development opportunity. Furthermore, the Barceló Hotel Group has collaborated with Fundación Integra since 2001, when the company joined its board of trustees to support its work with vulnerable groups. Since then, the Barceló Group has offered 168 employment contracts to people at risk of exclusion, who have joined our teams in Seville, Huelva, Barcelona, the Balearic Islands and Valencia. Furthermore, since 2014, the Barceló Hotel Group has dedicated a space at the Barceló Sevilla Renacimiento to serve as the headquarters for Fundación Integra in Andalusia. Barceló also participates in programmes to offer training to women in situations of vulnerability and intrafamily violence. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Finally, in terms of the employment of people at risk of exclusion, a project that we are particularly proud of is Project Chance, which we embarked upon in 2015; this involves collaboration between the main hotel chains in Mallorca to enhance our social presence in the tourism destinations we operate in. Project Chance seeks to facilitate the social development of the community through training and employment, choosing the Bávaro region as it once served as the point of access for Spanish hotels in the Caribbean, in addition to being a destination in which we all have a strong, consolidated presence. Thanks to this initiative, young people from the Bávaro and Verón regions in the Dominican 10 Panorama OMT del turismo internacional (Madrid: OMT, 2015 edition) 55 Republic with limited resources and that have not been able to study, have obtained the training required to work in the restaurants, bars and kitchens at the region's hotels. In 2018, 48 participants took part in the fourth edition of the programme. A total of 7 participants from the different editions of the programme currently work for the Barceló Hotel Group in its hotels in Bávaro. • Donations to food banks Our hotels participate in different food donation initiatives, ranging from the collection of non-perishable food to be sent to institutions including local food banks, foundations like Cáritas, one-off initiatives like Operación Kilo Sector Hotelero and Christmas food drives. • Transfer of property, fixtures and linens In 2018, 58 hotels have donated furniture (mattresses, bed bases, tables, chairs) or linens (towels, sheets, blankets, etc.) to non-profit organisations. • Corporate volunteering In 2018, 29 hotels performed some form of employee engagement activity, including participation in beach cleaning or visits to hospitals, nursing homes or community centres. More than 3,300 employees have participated in one of these activities. • Transfer of facilities and economic donations Last year, hotels from the Barceló Hotel Group collaborated to different extents with different associations, from economic donations to donations in kind, such as the assignment of spaces at our hotels or free accommodation to collaborate for beneficial purposes. • Viajes 2000 The goal of the Special Employment Centre at BTravel Turismo Accesible (Viajes 2000) is to sell travel focussing mainly on three areas: • ONCE social holiday programme for the elderly. • Travel management for different disability associations. • Corporate Travel for Companies. 70% of the workforce at Viajes 2000 have a disability. As a Special Employment Centre, the main aim of Viajes 2000 is to provide workers with disabilities with productive, paid employment that is appropriate to their personal circumstances and that enhances the employment and social integration of the disabled worked both at the workplace and in his/her family and social environment, as the social integration of disabled people is not restricted to merely obtaining a job, but their social inclusion in the community they belong to, reaching a sufficient degree of autonomy. • Contracts with Special Employment Centres (Ilunion, Lyreco etc.) worth more than €10 million in 2018. • Foundations and Institutions During 2018, more than €360,000 was contributed to Foundations and Institutions11, 31% was made to different hospitality federations and 22% to the Barceló Foundation. • Sporting sponsorships Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Furthermore, Ávoris has always demonstrated its commitment to sports and the values it transmits. In 2018, it invested almost €1 million in different agreements with athletes and teams, including the sponsorship of Mallorca-based club Imprenta Bahía San Agustín, which will compete under the name Iberojet Palma. Furthermore, in August, B the travel brand become the new official travel agency and official sponsor of Valencia CF for the next two seasons. 11 Corresponds to contributions by corporate societies and hotels in Spain. 56 5.2 BARCELÓ FOUNDATION Barceló Foundation is a non-profit institution created by the Barceló Oliver family on 24 October 1989 with the aim of improving the integrated development of individuals, contributing their efforts and economic resources to create a more equal society for everybody. For almost 30 years, the Barceló Foundation has performed its activities in the fields of health, education, cooperation, agricultural development, art and culture in order to contribute to improving the human, financial and social development of the most disadvantaged people. It cooperates in decreasing the needs of the most impoverished countries according to the Human Development Index, which is published each year by the UN. It also focuses on countries that are above this index but that suffer high levels of economic inequality and where the status of women is most precarious, which are mainly the poorest countries in Africa and Latin America, in addition to bearing in mind the needs of the surrounding area in Mallorca. Mission of the Barceló Foundation Contributing to improving the human, economic and social development of those most in need, mainly in the most impoverished countries in Africa and Latin America, in addition to health, education and integrated development, prioritising the improvement of women's living standards. Contributing to the development of agriculture and undertaking productive processes, caring for the preservation of the environment at all times. Promoting cultural activities. All actions undertaken by the Foundation are governed by a principle of Social Responsibility. This year, the Board of Trustees and the Advisory Board has been reorganised, with new internal and external members appointed, and a new Executive Committee has been set up, all with a view to upgrading management, effectiveness and efficiency. In 2018, a total of 134 actions or projects have been embarked upon in 24 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Spain, benefitting more than 380,000 people, with an investment of more than €2 million. Some of the projects performed by the Barceló Foundation include: • Following the donation of €90,000 from workers in the Barceló Group, to commemorate the 90th birthday of Gabriel Barceló, a new group of projects has been created: ACSOL-RHB, which encompasses 8 health, education and nutrition projects performed in Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 • In 2015, the FARMASOL Project (Farmacias Solidarias y Educación para la Salud) was rolled out, which is an integrated health project that not only focuses on supplying medication and the material required to health centres and hospitals with which we cooperate, but we also work with the local population to prevent illnesses and provide an education on health and hygiene habits (podoconiosis prevention programmes, nutrition and care programmes for expectant mothers, childbirth, etc.) Furthermore, to round off our activities in our areas of action, 12 projects have been undertaken, including the drilling of wells, construction of nurseries and nutrition and education projects, amongst others, with the ultimate objective of improving the living conditions of residents 57 in countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Chad. All hotels in the EMEA region participate directly in this project, placing collection projects on show for customers and employees to make donations. In 2018, the amount transferred from the Barceló Hotel Group to the Farmasol project came to €16,000 (twice the amount raised the previous year). • As part of environmental agricultural projects, worth special mention is the 2013 launch of the Alisol Project (Alimentos Solidarios), with a view to providing food to different charities that assist people who do not have a guaranteed supply of basic foodstuffs, thanks in large part of the operation of Son Barceló estate in Felanitx. In 2018, thanks to Alisol, the Foundation distributed more than 163 tonnes of perishable food to 14 charitable institutions in Mallorca, reaching 2,300 people each week. • The construction of wells to access drinking water and sanitation is of particular importance to health and the environment. In 2018, 28 wells were constructed in Malawi, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia, providing 40,000 people with drinking water, notably higher than the number of beneficiaries last year. • In terms of education, there has been a 44% increase on projects year on year, with 33 projects undertaken in 16 different countries in Africa and Latin America. Around 1,500 study grants have been awarded and work has continued to repair and build classrooms, in addition to providing equipment to support the schooling and professional education of girls and young people with limited resources. • In terms of microloans, we have launched a project targeting small companies in Nicaragua for the sum of USD 150,000. • In 2018, we held the third edition of the aid scheme for projects performed in Mallorca, financing 32 different activities with a view to collaborating with the important work performed by different non-profit associations and institutions on the island. These projects are not funded by the Administration and are cover different fields of action and beneficiaries, such as children, young people at risk of social exclusion, immigrants, people with different forms of cerebral palsy or a physical paralysis, rare diseases, etc.. It is worth noting that according to the “Construir confianza 2018” report produced every year by Fundación Compromiso y Transparencia, the Barceló Foundation remains among the most transparent family foundations in Spain.

HAND-IN-HAND WITH OUR SUPPLIERS In line with our commitment to the suppliers of our goods and services, we ensure that our relationship is lawful, ethical and respectful, based on communication and transparency. The selection of suppliers is governed, based on the provisions of our Code of Conduct, by the principles of objectivity and transparency, that combine the interest of the company in obtaining the best conditions, while maintaining stable relations with ethical and responsible suppliers. Barceló's employees and, in particular, those involved in the decisionmaking process concerning the procurement of supplies or services or establishing economic conditions, avoid all forms of interference that may affect their impartiality or objectiveness. Wherever possible, exclusive relationships are avoided. Procurement processes place a particular emphasis on the procedures for assessing and selecting suppliers, in order to avoid any kind of business relationship with natural or legal persons that may participate in unlawful or dishonest conduct or behaviour, in particular activities such as prostitution, grooming, fraud, public and private corruption, money laundering and the financing of terrorist or criminal organisations. In this connection, worth particular mention is the creation of a supplier management portal for suppliers of Ávoris at the end of 2018: https://avoristravel.bravosolution.com/. All suppliers who would like to register must complete an approval process that includes the commitment of suppliers to comply with: • Applicable employment regulations: health and safety law, commitment to abolish child labour, respect for working hours • Environmental regulations: compliance with legal requirements in all countries in which the company operates. • Ethical guidelines Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Occidental Pera Istanbul · Turkey 60 ANNEX I: LIST OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER LAW 11/2018 CONTENT LAW 11/2018 GRI SECTION General Description of the Company Business model Brief description of the Group's business model, including: 102-2 Activities, brands, products and 1.3 The Barceló business 1.

CORPORATE INFORMATION Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A (hereinafter the “Parent Company”) was incorporated on December 22, 1962 for an indefinite period of time with limited liability in Spain, under the name of Hotel Hamilton, S.A. On June 23, 2000, the Company modified its official name to the current name. Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A. and its subsidiaries, which are detailed in Appendix 1 (part of Note 1) comprise the Barceló Group (hereinafter the Group). The Group’s activities are basically the management and operation of hotels under an ownership, leasing or management basis, the operation of retail travel agencies, tour operators and airlines. The Group also promotes projects broadly related to the tourist and hotel industries, owning shares in other companies. In 2018 the Group has mainly carried out its activities in Spain, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Switzerland, Morocco, Portugal, Cuba, Egypt, Italy, Germany, Aruba and El Salvador. The Group’s registered address and head offices are located in C/ José Rover Motta, 27, in Palma de Mallorca (Spain). 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS 2.1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION These consolidated annual accounts have been prepared from the internal accounting records of the Parent Company, Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A. and from the accounting records of each of the consolidated subsidiaries, duly adjusted according to the accounting principles established in the EU-IFRS, to give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2018, and consolidated results of operations, consolidated cash flows and changes in consolidated equity for the year then ended. The accompanying consolidated annual accounts for 2018 also include, for each individual caption of the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes thereto, comparative figures for the previous period. The Group adopted IFRS-EU on 1 January 2007 and applied IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”. The accompanying consolidated annual accounts are expressed in euros, unless otherwise indicated. These consolidated annual accounts are authorised for issue by the Board of Directors, and subsequently submitted for approval by the shareholders at their annual general meeting and are expected to be approved with no changes. STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS APPROVED FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR The Group intends to adopt the applicable standards, interpretations and modifications to the standards issued by the IASB, that are not compulsory in the European Union at the preparation date of these consolidated annual accounts, when they come into force. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 With the exception of the cases mentioned below regarding IFRS 9 and IFRS 15, the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated annual accounts are the same as those applied in the 2017 consolidated annual accounts. 12 Although the Group is currently assessing their impact, based on the analysis performed to date, it is estimated that their initial application as of January 1 2019 will not have a significant impact on the consolidated annual accounts, with the exception of IFRS 16, which will have a significant impact and which we have detailed below. The accounting policies used for the first time in the preparation of these consolidated annual accounts are the following: IFRS 9 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IFRS 9 came into force with effect from January 1 2018, substituting the former IAS39. This standard establishes the classification and valuation of financial instruments, impairment and hedge accounting. Since the Group has chosen to prospectively apply IFRS 9 as of January 1 2018, the comparative information is shown according to IAS 39. The main aspects of this standard are the following: Classification and valuation Financial instruments are classified based on two criteria: • The Group’s Business Model for managing financial instruments. • Cash flows characteristics: principal and interest payments. At initial recognition, all financial instruments, including transaction costs, are valued at fair value. Subsequently, based on their classification, they can be valued at: • Amortised cost. • Fair value through other comprehensive income • Fair value through profit or loss. Impairment Impairment is based on expected losses and is applicable to all instruments which are not maintained at fair value through profit and loss and for assets related to contracts. Hedge accounting The adoption of IFRS 9 has not implied a change in the consideration of the Group’s hedges. The main effects are as follows: The entry into force of IFRS 9 in 2018, has implied an increase in the impairment provision for of long-term receivable time share contracts, due to the application of expected loss criteria. The effect of adopting IFRS 9 at January 1 2018 has been the following: ASSETS Trade debt Impairment provision (3,727) LIABILITIES Equity Reserves (3,727) Barceló I Annual Report 2018 The effects of applying IFRS 9 on the results for 2018 have been insignificant. 13 IFRS 15. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IFRS 15, which was published in May 2014 and amended in April 2016, establishes a new five-step model for revenue recognition from contracts with customers. According to IFRS 15, revenue is recognised for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The Group has adopted the new standard with effect as of January 1 2018, using the modified retrospective approach which implies the recognition of the effect of applying the new standard to all those contracts in force at January 1, 2018 included in the 2018 Equity opening balance. HOTEL DIVISION ACTIVITY In the hotel activity, IFRS 15 only effects the recognition of time share sales contracts. Contract description In this type of sale, the Barceló Group sells the right of use for a certain type of room and hotel, with characteristics determined in a contract. This acquired right is known as time-sharing. In these contracts, a significant amount is paid on signing and the customer obtains the right to use a room for a certain period of time (normally a week) over a 25year period. Identification of performance obligations and sale price In these contracts there is an initial fixed component and subsequent periodic payments which, according to the new standard, has to be distributed between all the performance obligations which are satisfied and identified in the contract (such as time-sharing, maintenance, other community services, etc.), based on the estimated relative individual sale price of each. Moreover, this type of contract includes variable components (external exchange programme, bonus time, special rates, etc.) and components which are dependent on events or circumstances which are out of the Company’s control. The clients has the right to take advantage of these additional services at any time. Given that these services are not included in the contract, the Group considers that they are different services and that if they are contracted by the client, the revenue will be recognised as a separate contract from the normal sale price contract. Revenue recognition Until the entry into force of this standard, the Group has recognised a significant amount of the initial advance payment as revenue to cover the commercial costs incurred in order to sell time-sharing rights. This accounting treatment was based on the Company’s estimate that the commercial costs incurred are those necessary to obtain part of the sale revenue and in order to correlate the revenue and expenses they are carried to results for the year. The remainder of the initial payment was deferred over the duration of the contract as revenue arising from the right of use of the room and other payments for maintenance, community services, etc., were recognised as revenue for the year in which they are collected or invoiced without making any additional estimates of whether the global sale price corresponds with the independent sale prices or the cost of rendering the service plus a reasonable margin. According to IFRS 15, the revenue recognition related to the use of the room and other services should not vary. Time-sharing revenue is income to be recognised over the long-term and any remaining services are to be recognised when they occur which, although not an exact moment in time are annual services, and therefore do not represent a significant difference in comparison to the time of recognition currently applied. However, under the new standard, considering that the price paid by the customer must be allocated to the performance obligations to be satisfied, the Group cannot consider that any revenue can be accrued in the initial moment since none of the performance obligations contracted have been fulfilled (use of the room, maintenance, community services, etc.). This results in a significant impact regarding the current accounting treatment, which is explained below. Capitalisation of expenses from obtaining contracts The new standard requires the capitalisation of incremental costs for obtaining contracts and any other expenses neBarceló I Annual Report 2018 cessary for the contracted service to begin. In this way, the presentation of the Group’s income statement is significantly different due to the fact that the amortisation of these expenses are no longer included in either the operating results or the EBITDA. 14 The main effects are the following: The entry into force of IFRS 15 in 2018 has resulted in an increase in the impairment provision for the time-share contracts. The effect is as follows (in thousands of euros): ASSETS Intangible asset Time Share 41,366 Total Assets 41,366 LIABILITIES Reserves 8,988 Conversion difference 81 Long-term prepayments and accruals 35,383 Prepayments (3,086) Total Liabilities 41,366 The application of IFRS 15 has not had a significant effect on the 2018 income statement. TRAVEL DIVISION ACTIVITY The Group’s activity in the travel division, consists of providing, among others, all those services inherent to a wholesale and retail travel agency, including among other aspects, the organisation of tourist services, the design, promotion and marketing of package holidays and tourist circuits, as well as acting as a tourism intermediary with third parties in the sale of tickets or the reservation of all types of transport, rooms, marketing full or partial package holidays, the organisation and mediation of all types of congresses, etc., either directly or through franchises. Agent or principal In general, since the Group performs activities inherent to retail travel agencies, it neither controls the services contracted for a third party (in the name of a third party) nor takes possession of said services to resell them. For this reason, revenue is only recognised for the intermediary activity and no revenue or gross cost is recognised for the subcontracted services since the Group is merely acting as an agent. This practice does not differ from that applied by the Group. The Group’s practices have been analysed with regard to the recognition of the sale of tourist packages, travel sales as a wholesale travel agency, the organisation of congresses as well as the remaining operations and the application of IFRS 15 does not have any significant effect with regard to those applied previously. STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS WHICH ARE NOT APPLICABLE IN 2018 The Group intends to adopt the applicable standards, interpretations and modifications to the standards issued by the IASB, that are not compulsory in the European Union at the preparation date of these consolidated annual accounts, when they come into force. IFRS 16 – LEASES IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC-15 Operating leases Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires the lessor to account for all leases under a sole balance sheet model similar to the current accounting of Barceló I Annual Report 2018 finance leases according to IAS 17. The standard includes two exemptions to the recognition of leases by the lessors: low value assets leases (for example, personal computers) and short-term leases (i.e. lease contracts with a lease period of 12 months or less). At the lease start date, the lessor will recognise a liability for the lease payments to be made (i.e. the liability arising from the lease) and an asset representing the right of use of the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e. the asset for the right of use). The interest expense arising from the lease liability and the expense for the amortisation of the right of use must be recognised separately by the lessors. 15 The lessors will also be obliged to remeasure the lease liability if certain events occur (for example, a change in the lease term, a change in the future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments). The lessor will generally treat the remeasurements as adjustments to the right-of-use asset. IFRS 16 also requires the lessors and lessees to include more detailed information than that stipulated in IAS 17. IFRS 16 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 has also been applied. The Group is applying IFRS 16 as of January 1, 2019. In 2018, the Group has evaluated the potential effect of IFRS 16 on its consolidated financial statements and estimates that the Property, Plant & Equipment heading (Assets for lease rights) under Assets and the Lease Liabilities heading under Liabilities, related to rental contracts at January 1, 2019, will increase by 902 million euros. Due to the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group’s EBITDA will improve and the amortisation and finance costs will increase. 2.2. CONSOLIDATION PRINCIPLES The accompanying consolidated annual accounts of the Group include the accounts of Barceló Corporación Empresarial, S.A. and subsidiaries. The consolidation methods applied are the following: SUBSIDIARIES These companies are directly or indirectly controlled by the Parent company and are fully consolidated from the date said control is obtained until it is terminated. This method consists in aggregating the items which represent assets and liabilities, income and expenses and equity items generated after the control is effective. All intergroup transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidation process. ASSOCIATES These are companies over which the Parent holds significant influence, owning between 20% and 50% of share capital, but does not have direct or indirect control. These companies are consolidated by the equity method. Appendix I includes information regarding the subsidiaries, associates and companies integrated by the joint operation method NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are recognised at the proportional part of the equity of the subsidiaries at the date of first consolidation. Profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive income are allocated to equity attributable to shareholders of the Parent and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their investment, even if this results in a balance receivable from non-controlling interests. Agreements entered into between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction. The increase and reduction of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary in which control is retained is recognised as an equity instrument transaction. Consequently, no new acquisition cost arises in increases nor is a gain recorded on reductions, rather, the difference between the consideration transferred or received and the carrying amount of the non-controlling interests is recognised in the reserves of the investor, without prejudice to reclassifying consolidation Barceló I Annual Report 2018 reserves and reallocating other comprehensive income between the Group and the non-controlling interests. 16 2.3. TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN COMPANIES’ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial statements with a functional currency that is not the euro (the Parent Company’s functional currency) are translated based on the following criteria: • Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at closing. • Income statement items have been translated using a weighted average exchange rate for the year. • Equity is translated at the historical exchange rate. • Differences generated by the application of the abovementioned criteria are included under equity in the consolidated balance sheet as “Translation differences”. The translation differences accumulated at the transition date (January 1, 2007) were reclassified to full integration reserves or associates according to IFRS 1.D13. Therefore, the translation differences included in the consolidated balance sheet relate to those generated since said date. None of the subsidiaries operates in a hyperinflationary economy. 2.4. SIGNIFICANT JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of the consolidated annual accounts requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies disclosures. A summary of the items requiring a greater degree of judgement or which are more complex, or where the assumptions and estimates made are significant to the preparation of the consolidated annual accounts, is as follows: IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL Impairment testing of goodwill is based on calculations of the value in use applied in the discounted cash flow model. Cash flows are based on the projected results for the next five years. The discount rate used was 10.39% and the perpetual growth rate was 1%. The recoverable amount of goodwill is sensitive to the discount rate, the achievement of the projected cash flows, the assumptions applied and projected growth rates. IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT AND TRANSFER RIGHTS The Group recognises asset impairment losses when the recoverable amount of the assets is less than their carrying amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. With very few exceptions, each hotel is considered as an independent cash generating unit. The Group mainly uses EBITDA multipliers to identify the existence of impairment in the hotels it owns. For those hotels that show signs of impairment, the cash flow discount model is used in order to determine possible impairment, based on estimated projected results for the next 5 years plus a residual value. The discount rate applied was 8.90% for hotels in Spain and 10.48% for the hotels in Latin America and the perpetual growth rate was 1.75%. For certain hotels in Spain, valuations performed by independent experts have been taken into account. The cash flow discount rate method has also been used to estimate the impairment of assets in leased hotels and transfer rights, based on the results projected for a minimum lease period. To evaluate the impairment of land with no buildings, the Group has used both internal valuations and the valuations performed by independent experts based on real estate indicators. The recoverable amount is very sensitive to the discount rate used in the cash flow discount rate model, the expected Barceló I Annual Report 2018 cash inflows and the growth rate used. 17 EVALUATION OF THE NATURE OF LEASES The Group has entered into non-current lease agreements for certain hotels and aircraft as a lessee. Management has determined that based on the terms and conditions of each of the contracts, the Group does not significantly assume the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the properties and aircraft. These arrangements are therefore recognised as operating leases in accordance with the prevailing accounting standards. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS The Group recognises assets corresponding to all the tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences it expects to offset against future taxable income. Management bases this criterion on judgements and estimates with regards to future estimated results, the years in which profits are expected to be obtained and tax credits will cease to be available for offset and future tax planning strategies. Note 27 shows details of capitalised and uncapitalised tax losses. LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFIT LIABILITIES The amount of defined benefit employment liabilities at the reporting date is determined based on actuarial calculations. The actuarial calculations are based on a number of judgements and assumptions detailed in note 21. PROVISIONS The amount of the provisions recognised under liabilities of the balance sheet is based on judgements made by Group management and in accordance with the estimates made by their lawyers and external advisors relating to their probability. The amount of these provisions may vary due to new evidence obtained in the future. ONEROUS CONTRACTS Provisions for onerous contracts are those derived from various lease contracts and management contracts which guarantee a minimum profitability for the counterparty of the hotel operation. These provisions have been calculated by discounting the cash flows estimated by the Group and evaluating the lowest possible cost of the various alternative outflows relating to each of the contracts. IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The value adjustment for client insolvencies and credit granted to third parties implies a high degree of judgment by Management and the review of individual balances based on the credit quality of the clients and debtors, current market trends, historical analysis of the insolvencies at aggregate level and the value of the underlying guarantees related to the credit. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 18 3. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 3.1. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL Business combinations are recognised applying the acquisition method. The acquisition date is the date on which the Group obtains control of the acquiree. The acquisition cost is the consideration transferred, which is valued at fair value on the acquisition date. Acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. At the acquisition date the Group recognises the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (and any non-controlling interest) at fair value. Liabilities assumed include any contingent liabilities that represent present obligations arising from past events for which the fair value can be reliably measured. Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are recognised at the proportionate interest in the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, which reflects the excess of the cost of the combination over the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination shall, from the acquisition date, be allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. 3.2. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES Group investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. An associate is an entity over which the Group does not have control but over which it does have significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but does not constitute control or joint control over the entity. The existence of potential voting rights that are exercisable or convertible at the end of each reporting period, including potential voting rights held by the Group or other entities, are considered when assessing whether an entity has significant influence. Equity-accounted investments in associates are recorded in the statement of financial position at cost, with any changes in the net assets of the associate following acquisition of the interest. The excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill, which is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Any shortfall, once the cost of the investment and the identification and measurement of the associate’s net assets have been evaluated, is recognised as income when determining the investor’s share of the profit or loss of the associate for the year in which it was acquired. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same accounting period as for the Parent. If necessary, adjustments are made to harmonise the accounting policies with those of the Group. The income statement reflects the share of results of operations in the associate. This is the profit attributable to the holders of the share in the associate and therefore, it is profit after tax and minority interest in the subsidiaries of the associates. When there is a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised losses and gains arising from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated in proportion to the share. Losses of an associate attributable to the Group are limited to the extent of its net investment, except where the Group Barceló I Annual Report 2018 has legal or constructive obligations or when payments have been made on behalf of the associate. On each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence of impairment of the investment in the associate. Impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying amount in the associate with its recoverable value. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Accordingly, value in use is calculated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the present value of estimated cash flows from ordinary operations and the income generated on final disposal of the associate. 19 3.3 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS Joint arrangements are those in which there is a contractual agreement to share the control over an economic activity, in such a way that decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group and the remaining venturers or operators. The existence of joint control is assessed considering the definition of control over subsidiaries. JOINT VENTURES Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method described previously. JOINT OPERATIONS For joint operations, the Group recognises the following in the consolidated annual accounts: • Assets and liabilities, including its share of any assets held jointly and liabilities which have been jointly incurred with the other operators. • Income and expenses arising from the joint operation. In sales or contributions by the Group to the joint operation, it recognises the resulting gains and losses only to the extent of the other parties’ interests in the joint operation. When such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in net realisable value or an impairment loss of the assets transferred, such losses are recognised in full. In purchases by the Group from a joint operation, it only recognises the resulting gains and losses when it resells the acquired assets to a third party. However, when such transactions provide evidence of a reduction in net realisable value or an impairment loss of the assets, the Group recognises its entire share of such losses. The Group’s acquisition of an initial and subsequent share in a joint operation is recognised following the same criteria used for business combinations, at the percentage of ownership of each individual asset and liability. However, in subsequent acquisitions of additional shares in a joint operation, the previous share in each asset and liability is not subject to revaluation. 3.4. CURRENT VERSUS NON-CURRENT CLASSIFICATION The Group presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An asset or liability is current when it is: • Expected to be realised or settled within 12 months after the reporting period. • Expected to be realised, sold, used or settled in the normal operating cycle. • A cash or cash equivalent unless restricted for at least twelve months after the reporting period. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 20 3.5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are measured at acquisition or production cost. • Intangible assets with finite useful life are amortised over the useful economic life. The amortisation expense is included under the “Amortisation and impairment” heading of the consolidated income statement. • Intangible assets with indefinite life are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Other intangible assets mainly comprise: • Industrial property, licenses and similar items, measured at costs incurred and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of between 3 and 10 years. • Computer software is measured at acquisition cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years. Computer software maintenance costs are charged as expenses when incurred. • Leaseholds: Leaseholds primarily comprise measurement of a lease contract for the Barceló Sants Hotel acquired through a business combination prior to the transition to IFRS. The contract is amortised on a straight-line basis over the duration of the lease, ending in 2035. 3.6. PROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, plus the financial and acquisition expenses related to the debt which finances the purchase of assets until they are put into use. At transition date, the plots of land on which certain hotels are located were revalued, taking into account their fair value as an attributable cost as of the transition date as permitted in IFRS 1. The valuations of assets in Latin America were performed by American Appraisal at December 31, 2008. The valuations were performed by means of the discounted cash flow method using a discount rate ranging between 8% and 10% and taking into account the investment risk and the profitability required for comparable investments. The valuations of assets in Spain were performed by Eurovaloraciones, S.A. at December 31, 2008. The valuations were performed by calculating the net present value and the residual value. Annual discount rates ranging between 7% and 10% were used. The increase in the deemed cost at the transition date (1 January 2007) of the land, based on the revaluations performed is 254 million euros. At December 31, 2018, the balance of these revaluations amounts to 132.1 million euros (131.5 million euros at December 31 2017). For those assets in leased properties, amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets or over the, remaining period of the lease contract, whichever is lower, as follows: ESTIMATED YEARS OF USEFUL LIFE Buildings 33 35 Technical installations, machinery, furniture and other items 2.5 18 Repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses when they are incurred. 3.7. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment properties are accounted for at the carrying value of the real estate assets maintained in order to obtain rental income or property sale gains. These assets are measured at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis following the same criteria used for property, plant and equipment. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 21 3.8. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group evaluates annually whether there are indications of possible impairment losses on non-financial assets subject to amortisation or depreciation to verify whether the carrying amount of these assets exceeds the recoverable amount. The Group tests goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready to enter service for potential impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount of the assets is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and their value in use. An asset’s value in use is measured based on the future cash flows the Company expects to derive from use of the asset, expectations about possible variations in the amount or timing of those future cash flows, the time value of money, the price for bearing the uncertainty inherent in the asset and other factors that market participants would reflect in pricing the future cash flows the Group expects to derive from the asset. For those assets which do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating units to which the assets belong. In the case of certain hotel assets which due to their individual characteristics include a significant proportion of real estate, market indicators for real estate have been applied to measure their recoverable amount by the Group’s internal departments. In assessing value in use of the hotel assets, the Group performs internal valuations using market-based discount rates. To determine the net selling price, independent experts perform valuations. Impairment losses are recognised for all assets, and where applicable for the cash generating units containing them, when their carrying amount exceeds their corresponding recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement. At the end of each reporting period the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversible. Impairment losses on other assets are only reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to calculate the recoverable amount of the asset. However, the increased carrying amount of an asset attributable to a reversal of an impairment loss may not exceed the original carrying amount net of depreciation or amortisation. 3.9. LEASES LEASE CLASSIFICATION Leases in which, upon inception, the Group transfers to third parties substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the assets are classified as finance leases. Otherwise they are classified as operating leases. THE GROUP AS LESSEE FINANCE LEASES At the commencement of the lease term, the Group recognises finance leases as assets and liabilities at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs are added to the asset’s carrying amount. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Interest is expensed using the effective interest method. Contingent rents are recognised as an expense when it is probable that they will be incurred. Leased assets are depreciated over their useful life. OPERATING LEASES Barceló I Annual Report 2018 Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on an accruals basis over the lease term. 22 THE GROUP AS LESSOR FINANCE LEASES The Group recognises a receivable in the consolidated statement of financial position for an amount equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments plus the unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the contractual interest rate implicit in the lease. Initial direct costs are included in the initial measurement of the finance lease receivable and reduce the amount of income recognised over the lease term. Finance income is taken to the income statement using the effective interest method. OPERATING LEASES Operating lease income is recognised in the income statement as it is accrued. Costs directly attributable to the contract are recognised as an increase in the amount of the leased asset and are recognised as an expense over the lease term, applying the same criteria as for the recognition of lease income. 3.10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial instruments are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, a financial liability or an equity instrument in accordance with the economic substance of the contractual arrangement and the definitions of a financial asset, a financial liability and an equity instrument set out in IFRS 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS ASSETS On initial recognition financial instruments are classified as assets based on two criteria: • Group Business Model to manage financial instruments. • Characteristics of financial assets from the point of view of the contractual cash flows. Financial instruments classified as assets are classified in four categories: • Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments) • Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income with recycling in results (debt instruments) • Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss All the financial assets are initially recognised at fair value including the directly attributable transaction costs. Trade debtors that do not possess a significant financial component are recognised at the transaction value determined under IFRS 15. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST (DEBT INSTRUMENTS) This heading includes all those assets that fulfil the following two criteria: • Business Model: The assets are included in the Group’s business model in order to pay or collect the contractual cash flows. • Characteristics of the cash flows: the cash flows solely relate to principal and interest. Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently valued using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Profit and loss are recognised in results when withdrawn, modified or impaired. Accrued interest from loans is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the effective rate. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 23 FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (DEBT INSTRUMENTS) This heading includes all those assets that fulfil the following two criteria: • Business Model: The asset is included in the Group’s business model in order to pay or collect the contractual cash flows or for its sale. • Characteristics of the cash flows: the cash flows solely relate to principal and interest. Following initial recognition, financial assets classified under this heading are valued at fair value, recognising the profit or loss under Equity. When this type of financial asset is partially or totally disposed of, or the profit or loss recognised under Equity is impaired, they are carried to results for the year. In the same way as financial assets at amortised cost, interest, exchange rate adjustments and impairment are recognised in the income statement. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS The following assets are included under this heading: • Available-for-sale financial assets • Non-hedge derivatives • Equity instruments not valued at fair value through other comprehensive income. IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS At the end of each reporting period the Group assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment regarding its financial assets not valued at fair value through profit or loss. The Group recognises impairment for expected losses, i.e. for the difference between the cash flows according to the contract and those which the Group expects to receive. There are two policies for the recognition of expected losses: • Credit losses expected within 12 months: losses arising from possible events of default within 12 months. This policy can be applied to financial instruments with a low credit risk. • Credit losses expected over the instruments life term: losses that arise from possible events of default over the instrument’s life term. Applicable to finance instruments with a high credit risk or a risk that has increased since initial recognition. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LIABILITIES Financial instruments are classified as liabilities in four categories: • Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss • Loans and credits • Hedge derivatives Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and for loans, credits and accounts payable, the directly attributable transaction costs are netted. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS This heading only includes cash flow derivatives (SWAPs) contracted by the Group, which do not fulfil the requirements to be considered as hedging instruments and the fair value of which does not favour the Group. As indicated in the heading’s title, the financial liabilities are measured at closing for their fair value through profit or loss. 24 LOANS, BORROWINGS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE Loans, borrowings and accounts payable relate to payment obligations of a determinable amount and date. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The accrued interest from the loans is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the effective rate. HEDGING DERIVATIVES The Group has hedging derivatives, primarily in relation to interest rates (interest rate swaps), to hedge fluctuations in Euribor/Libor with regard to a number of variable rate loans. These derivatives contracted by the Group are cash flow hedges. In addition, the Group contracts derivatives to hedge exchange rates and jet fuel prices for its airline and travel business. These derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value. Derivatives are recognised as financial assets if their value is positive and as financial liabilities if their value is negative. The Group initially formally designates and documents the hedging relationship. Hedge accounting is only applicable when the hedge is expected to be highly effective at the inception of the hedge and in subsequent years. The Group recognises the portion of the gain or loss on the measurement at fair value of a hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge in equity. The ineffective portion and the specific component of the gain or loss or cash flows on the hedging instrument, excluding the measurement of the hedge effectiveness, are recognised with a debit or credit to finance costs or finance income. Hedge accounting criteria ceases to be applied when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, cancelled or settled, or when the hedging relationship no longer complies with the criteria to be accounted for as such, or the instrument is no longer designated as a hedging instrument. In these cases, the cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument that have been recognised in equity are not taken to profit or loss until the forecast transaction or transaction to which the Group has committed affects results. However, if the transaction is no longer considered probable, the accumulated gains or losses recognised in equity are immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE The Group classifies measurements at fair value using a hierarchy which reflects the significance of the inputs used in measurement, in accordance with the following levels: • Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: Variables other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). • Level 3: Variables for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). The techniques used to measure interest rate, exchange rate and fuel hedges include future price models, using actual value calculations. The models include various data such as spot and forward exchange rates, yield curves and differentials between the various currencies, interest rate curves and future exchange rate curves for fuel. The fair value of all current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be the same as the amortised cost, as the maturity date of the assets and liabilities is close to year end. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 25 3.11. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE The Group classifies assets as non-current assets held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use, and when the following requirements are met: • They are available for immediate sale in their current condition. • Their sale is highly probable. Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. These assets are not depreciated, and if necessary the required impairment is recognised so that the carrying amount does not exceed the fair value less costs to sell. A non-current asset that ceases to be classified as held for sale is valued at the lower of the carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation or revaluations that would have been recognised had the asset not been classified as held for sale, and its recoverable amount at the date of reclassification. Any required adjustment to the carrying amount of a non-current asset that ceases to be classified as held-for-sale is included in profit or loss from continuing operations. 3.12. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In accordance with IFRS 5, the activity or asset held for sale is considered to be a discontinued operation if it: • Represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; • Is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or • Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The revenues and expenses deriving from this activity are included as a single amount under profit/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax, after deducting the tax effect. This item also includes the profit after tax recognised for the measurement at fair value less costs to sell of the assets or disposal groups of items constituting the discontinued operation. If the Group ceases to classify a component as a discontinued operation, the results previously disclosed as discontinued operations are reclassified to continuing operations for all years presented. In the case of Ávoris, the conditions established in IFRS 5 are not fulfilled. 3.13. INVENTORIES These are the assets which are consumed or sold during the hotels’ ordinary activities (food and beverages, gift shops, maintenance) or which are related to gift items or the sales of the Travel division or replacement parts for the airline business. Inventories are measured at the lower of the average weighted price or realisable value. 3.14. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS All those investments with an original maturity of three months or less and which do not have any risk of change in value are considered by the Group to be cash equivalents. 3.15. CAPITAL GRANTS Monetary grants are measured at the fair value of the amount awarded. They are taken to the income statement in accordance with the estimated useful life of the asset for which the grant is received. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 26 3.16. PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of Group resources will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. PROVISIONS FOR ONEROUS CONTRACTS An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract. Before a separate provision for an onerous contract is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets dedicated to that contract. If the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract are recognised and measured as a provision. Note 21 shows details of the main contingencies provided for in the balance sheet. 3.17. REMUNERATION AND OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYMENT LIABILITIES DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS Defined benefit liabilities reflect the present value of defined benefit obligations at the reporting date, less the fair value at that date of plan assets. In Spain, these defined benefit plans correspond to long-service benefits and retirement benefits related to a number of collective labour agreements in the hospitality sector and the national collective labour agreement for travel agencies. These commitments are defined benefits and are quantified based on actuarial calculations. Income or expense related to defined benefit plans is recognised as employee benefits expense and is the sum of the net current service cost and the net interest cost of the net defined benefit asset or liability. The remeasurement of the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognised in equity and comprises actuarial gains and losses, the net return on plan assets and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding any amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset. TERMINATION BENEFIT Termination benefits are recognised when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer and when the cost of restructuring result in the payment of termination benefits. For termination benefits payable as a result of an employee’s decision to accept an offer, the Group cannot withdraw the offer as of the moment it is accepted by the employees. In the case of involuntary termination benefits, the Group can no longer withdraw the offer when it has communicated the plan to the affected employees or trade union representatives. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 27 3.18. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Group’s revenue recognition policies for each revenue area are as follows: a. Revenues from rendering of services relating to the activity of operating owned and leased hotels: These revenues are recognised on an accrual basis. The Group recognises sales and operating expenses from its owned hotels and from hotels leased from third parties in profit or loss, and assumes the rights and obligations inherent to the hotel business in its own name. b. Revenues from rendering services in the hotel management activity: These revenues from management fees charged are recognised on an accrual basis. c. Revenues from rendering services in the activity of operating casinos: These revenues are recognised as the difference between the amount played and the player’s winnings, on an accrual basis. d. Revenues from the travel agency activity: The Travel division primarily carries out an intermediation activity in the sale of travel-related products. Revenue is presented as the margin between the selling price and the cost to sell and is recognised on the date travel documents are handed over, at which point the risks and rewards are transferred to the customer, irrespective of the date of travel or the date from which the contracted services will be rendered. e. Revenues from the tour operator activity: Sales and costs of supplies are recognised on the initial date of travel. f. Revenues from the airline activity: Revenues from air transport services rendered are recognised when the flight takes place. g. Revenue from the sale of rights of use (Time Share): From January 1, 2018 (date of entry into force of IFRS 15), the sale of rights of use is recognised as revenue throughout the average estimated life of the contract. The amount of the sale is recognised as deferred income under “Long-term prepayments and accruals” on the liabilities side of the consolidated statements of financial position, in the year in which it is contracted, and is carried to results on a straight-line basis over the contract’s average term. The incremental expenses incurred to obtain a contract and the other expenses necessary in order to begin the contracted service are capitalised as intangible assets and are carried to results through amortisation, also over the contract’s average life. Contracts which have been signed and cancelled in the same year are recognised as revenue for the year for the amount collected in cash. Moreover, only those contracts which have been signed but not cancelled in the same year are recognised as deferred income. 3.19. INCOME TAX The income tax expense and tax income for the year comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax reflects the income tax amounts payable in the year. Current tax assets or liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted at the reporting date. In general, deferred tax liabilities are recognised due to taxable temporary differences, which are differences that will give rise to larger amounts of tax payable or smaller amounts of tax recoverable in future years. A deferred tax asset is recognised when there are deductible temporary differences, tax loss carryforwards or available tax deductions that the Company expects to be able to offset against future taxable profit. For this purpose, a temporary difference is understood to be the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities and their amount for tax purposes, giving rise to smaller amounts of tax payable or larger amounts recoverable in future years. Deferred liabilities arising from taxable temporary differences are recognised in all cases, except when: • They arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. • They are associated with investments in subsidiaries for which the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 28 Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences to the extent that: • It is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised, unless the differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable income; • The temporary differences are associated with investments in subsidiaries that will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when they are reversed, based on prevailing legislation and tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted and reflecting the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Current and deferred income tax expense and tax income is recognised in profit or loss. However, if the expense or income is related to items recognised directly in equity, it is also recognised in equity and not in the income statement. 3.20. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Transactions in foreign currency are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other than each company’s functional currency, have been translated into the corresponding functional currency at the closing rate, while non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost have been translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction date. Exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of foreign currency transactions and the translation into Euros of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 29 4. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES The Group is exposed to credit risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and liquidity risk in the normal course of business. The main financial risks to which the Group is exposed are interest rate risk and currency risk. Group management reviews and authorises the risk management policies, as explained below: CREDIT RISK Most of the financial instruments exposed to credit risk are trade receivables. Such receivables are generated by the sale of services to customers. The Group’s policies aim to mitigate this risk by setting a credit limit based on the customer’s volume and creditworthiness. The approval of the managers of each hotel and each travel agency is required in order to increase the initially established credit limit. Each hotel regularly reviews the ageing of trade receivables and balances which could be doubtful. The Group provides for potential losses based on an assessment by management of the customer’s financial position, payment history and debt ageing, in accordance with the loss expected due to bad debt. Historically, losses deriving from this risk are within the range expected by management, which is immaterial. Moreover, in order to minimise a possible negative influence from the payment behaviour of our debtors, the Group has entered into credit insurance policies which render prevention services. In order to grant such insurance, the insurance company performs a solvency study of the customers and if the cover is accepted, it guarantees the collection of the insured credit in the event of non-payment. The insurance company manages collection and if the process is unsuccessful it will pay the indemnity within a predetermined period. Currently, there are no unusually high risk concentrations. The Group’s maximum exposure to risk is the carrying amount, as detailed by heading in Notes 10, 12, 13 and 14. Note 12 includes information regarding clients by age of balance. Credit risk deriving from other financial assets, which include cash balances and current deposits, arises from the failure of a counterparty (financial institutions) to respond to these balances, with a maximum risk equivalent to the carrying amount of these instruments included in “Cash and cash equivalents” and “Other current financial assets”. The Group has granted loans to third parties which are included under the heading “Other non-current financial assets”. The possible impairment of these loans is being assessed taking into account the credit situation of each debtor individually and, where applicable, of the value of the underlying guarantee related to the credit. MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE RISK The risk of changes in market interest rates mainly has an effect on variable interest rate debt. All debt is remunerated at a variable interest rate, with the exception of a bank debt amounting to 199.4 million euros and other liabilities amounting to 133.7 million euros At December 31, 2018, if the interest rates during the period had been 50 basis points lower, with all other variables held constant, consolidated profit before taxes for the year would have been increased by 1,245 thousand euros. On the contrary, if the variable interest rate had been 50 basis points above the existing rates, with all other variables held constant, consolidated profit before taxes would have been decreased by 1,245 thousand euros. At December 31, 2017 if the interest rates during the period had been 50 basis points lower, with all other variables held constant, consolidated profit before taxes for the year would have been increased by 2,128 thousand euros. On the contrary, if the variable interest rate had been 50 basis points above the existing rates, with all other variables held constant, consolidated profit before taxes would have been decreased by 2,128 thousand euros. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 The Group has not signed interest rate hedge contracts at year end. 30 CURRENCY RISK – HOTELS DIVISION As the Group has a large volume of investments in hotels located abroad, its consolidated results could be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. Indebtedness is denominated in a currency which is similar to that generated by the cash flows of the hotel operations, in such way that it is considered a hedge. The income statements of the hotels located in countries where the local currency is not the euro are affected by the US dollar and euro exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis of the income statement for 2018 and 2017 is based on the profit/loss before taxes in the local currency of the most relevant countries by turnover, calculating the net effect of variations of 5% and 10% (both above and below) in each currency. The sensitivity analysis for 2018 is as follows: VARIATION % USA AND LATIN AMERICA OTHERS +10% 15,446,758 (127,433) +5% 7,316,885 (60,363) -5% (6,620,039) 54,614 -10% (12,638,256) 104,264 The sensitivity analysis for 2017 is as follows: VARIATION % USA AND LATIN AMERICA OTHERS +10% 11,297,159 177,705 +5% 5,351,286 84,176 -5% (4,841,639) (76,159) -10% (9,243,130) (145,395) RIESGO POR TIPOS DE CAMBIO Y COMBUSTIBLE DIVISIÓN VIAJES In the Travel division, primarily in the airline business, hedges are contracted for exchange rates with the US dollar and for fuel prices. These hedges are contracted based on the required coverage of future flights sold by season, based on the charter-based model applied by the Group, thus guaranteeing their effectiveness. The coverage of total requirements is 75% to 85%. Notes 16, 25 and 26 include detailed information on this matter. LIQUIDITY RISK The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring the availability of sufficient cash to meet its payment obligations in the normal course of business, without incurring unacceptable losses which could impair the Group’s reputation. The Group reviews its liquidity requirements according to cash budgets, taking into account the maturity dates of payables and receivables and projected cash flows. In general, the Group has sufficient liquidity to cover the operating expenses deriving from the customers’ hotel stays, including debt servicing; but excluding the impact caused by extreme circumstances which cannot be reasonably anticipated, such as natural disasters. The Group’s consolidated statement of financial position shows positive working capital at December 31, 2018 of 41.9 million euros (99.2 at December 31, 2017). CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Group manages its capital to maintain an adequate debt ratio which ensures financial stability, looking for investBarceló I Annual Report 2018 ments with optimal rates of return with the aim of generating a greater stability and profitability for the Group. As can be observed in the statement of financial position, most of the debt is non-current. These ratios show that capital management follows prudent criteria since the cash flows expected for the coming years and the Group’s equity position will cover the debt service. 31 5.

Withdrawals mainly related to the adjustment of the goodwill of Viajes Catai, S.A., due to the final business combination. The transfer related to the reclassification of Intangible Assets to Transfer Rights. Over the course of its history in the hotel and travel agency sectors, the Group has developed a Barceló management model and a set of “Best Practices”. This know-how is a significant accumulation of confidential knowledge, technical information, expertise, skills and procedures which enable the Group to improve the operating processes of its hotels, their information systems, resource management and quality and environmental systems, thus optimising their results. Recoverable value of the CGUs In order to calculate the recoverable value of the CGUs, the degree of economic development in the economy in which they operate is taken into account, together with other variables such as the market quota, in those markets in which the CGUs are present, etc. Discount rate variables (ke) and the perpetual growth rate (g) are also taken into account and are normally defined as follows: Discount rate (ke) = the country’s risk-free rate + (β * Equity risk premium). Perpetual growth rate (g): taking into account the long-term IMF inflation forecast. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 The cash flow projections for the first five years take into account growth rates based on historical experience, while in the subsequent years the residual value is calculated establishing a perpetual income based on the cash flows of the estimates’ last period, with a growth rate based on the inflation rate forecast for the geographical area in which each cash-generating unit operates. Projections are calculated in the currency in which they are generated. 35 The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate which, in general, relates to the effective profitability of the 10-year Spanish Government Bonds, on the country risk premium, on the sector’s risk premium, calculated using the Beta coefficient of comparable entities and the market risk premium. The cost of the debt is based on the debt’s real cost at the date of the impairment test equivalent to the interest rates of the credits that the cash-generating unit is obliged to return. The resulting discount rate applied was 10.03% and the perpetual growth rate was 1%. Sensitivity analysis Moreover, at least annually, the company evaluates the hypotheses used in the estimate of the future cash flows and updates them according to the actual results and past experience. If there are fair variations in any of the key hypotheses, the carrying value will not exceed the recoverable value of the CGUs. Specifically, the studies performed for the main CGUs analysed (Special Tours and Catai) show that with an increase of 1 p.p. in the discount rate or a reduction of 0.25 p.p. in the perpetual growth rate applicable to the CGU, in no case does this factor fall below the attributed carrying value of each CGU. 6.2 OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Details of movement in intangible assets during 2018 are as follows: BALANCE AT TRANSLATION BALANCE AT ADDITIONS DISPOSALS TRANSFERS 31/12/2017 DIFFERENCES 31/12/2018 ACQUISITION COST Start-up costs Patents, licences and similar rights 3,728,072 111,349 (172,681) 3,014 (156,333) 3,513,421 Leaseholds 31,887,071 65,000 104,985 32,057,056 Computer software 91,705,902 9,813,413 152,561 56,315 101,728,191 Time Share contracts 53,340,191 53,340,191 Other intangible assets 37,257,795 2,259,384 3,643 1,380,254 1,315,976 42,217,052 164,578,840 65,589,337 (169,038) 1,535,829 1,320,943 232,855,911 ACCUMULATED AMORTISATION Patents, licences and similar rights (2,668,042) (352,328) 156,542 (755) 156,333 (2,708,250) Leaseholds (11,606,012) (1,224,405) (104,985) (12,935,402) Computer software (66,938,289) (9,972,910) (111,266) (51,348) (77,073,813) Time Share contracts (3,205,127) (33,569) (3,238,696) Other intangible assets (7,738,517) (2,516,681) 239,962 (10,015,236) (88,950,860) (17,271,451) 156,542 94,372 (105,971,397) Carrying value 75,627,980 48,317,886 (12,496) 1,630,201 1,320,943 126,884,514 The main additions relate to incremental costs incurred to obtain time-share contracts and they have been capitalised due to the entry into force of IFRS 15 (See Note 2.1).

OTHER NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS At December 31 2018 and 2017 the breakdown of “Other no-current financial assets” is as follows: BALANCES AT BALANCES AT 31/12/2018 31/12/2017 Credits to associates 1,186,100 Non-current deposits and guarantees 19,607,151 18,324,965 Equity instruments 70,950 70,950 Derivatives (Note 16) 934,660 38,215 Assets related to labour liabilities (Note 21) 3,452,198 3,272,860 Loans to third parties 41,264,113 36,432,702 Balance receivable for Time Share contracts 30,969,090 30,366,455 Prepayments for non-current assets 8,243,136 8,636,296 Other non-current loans 3,965,952 1,028,637 109,693,350 98,171,080 NON-CURRENT DEPOSITS AND GUARANTEES This balance primarily comprises security deposits related to lease contracts for hotels and aircraft. Their fair value is similar to their carrying amount. EQUITY INSTRUMENTS This balance includes a 15% interest in Punta Umbría Turística, S.A., with registered office in Huelva, Spain, for an amount of 11.6 million euros, acquired in 2008. This company owns the Hotel Barceló Punta Umbría Resort. The Group does not have significant influence over this company. Said interest is completely impaired, as is the 19% interest in the company Royal Mediterránea, S.A., for an amount of 70 thousand euros. LOANS TO THIRD PARTIES The balance of loans to third parties mainly reflects a credit facility extended to Punta Umbría Turística, S.A., which owns a hotel subject to a management contract with the Group, including a commitment to cover the former’s cash shortfalls, with the hotel pledged as collateral, but junior to the bank debt of Punta Umbría Turística, S.A. The credit facility matures in 2035. The facility accrues interest at a market rate, and is accounted for at its amortised cost. At December 31, 2018 the gross value of the facility is 63.0 million euros (57.5 million euros in 2017), and accumulated impairment has been recognised for an amount of 28.4 million euros (27.4 million euros in 2017). BALANCES RECEIVABLE FOR THE SALE OF RIGHTS TO USE ROOMS (TIME SHARE) The Group extends financing to customers who purchase rights to use rooms, as explained in Note 3.18.g. NON-CURRENT PREPAYMENTS Barceló I Annual Report 2018 This amount mainly corresponds to hotel rental income paid in advance and which will be carried to results during the remaining life of said rental contracts which is 13 years. 42 11. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE In 2017, the Hotel Barceló Marbella was included under this heading. This hotel was sold at the beginning of 2018 for an amount of 19 million euros. The Group has granted a put option to the purchaser of the property, in the case that certain circumstances related to the hotel’s planning situation are fulfilled and for the same sale price. Since the Group considers it unlikely that the circumstances that will allow the put option to be exercised will arise, the sale has been recognised. 12.

SHARE PREMIUM The share premium is freely distributable. 19.3. RESERVES LEGAL RESERVE Spanish companies are obliged to transfer a minimum of 10% of the profits for the year to a legal reserve until this reserve reaches an amount equal to at least 20% of the share capital. This reserve is not distributable to shareholders and may only be used to offset losses if no other reserves are available. Under certain conditions it may be used to increase share capital provided that the balance left on the reserve is at least equal to 10% of the nominal value of the total share capital after the increase. OTHER NON-DISTRIBUTABLE RESERVES – CAPITALISATION RESERVE The capitalisation reserve. Income Tax Law 27/2014 introduced as of 2015, article 25 regulating the capitalisation reserve. This article stipulates the possibility of reducing taxable income to 10% of the increase in an entity’s capital and reserves, provided that a number of requirements, including the following, are met: • That the amount of the increase in the entity’s capital and reserves is maintained for a period of five years from the closing of the tax period to which this reduction pertains, unless the entity has incurred accounting losses. • That a reserve be allocated, equivalent to the amount of the decrease, which should be reflected on the balance sheet as a separate heading and will be non-distributable during the period forecast in the preceding point. The Group has a restricted reserve of 19 million euros for said concept (19 million euros in 2017 and 12 million euros in 2016). Moreover, the Group intends to make a provision for 14.0 million euros, when approving the 2018 accounts. VOLUNTARY RESERVES (OTHER RESERVES) The voluntary reserve is freely distributable.

It also includes commitments with employees in accordance with Mexican and Aruban labour legislation, as well as the pension plan of certain employees of the US company Crestline Hotels & Resorts, LLC, which was acquired in 2017. LONG-SERVICE BENEFITS IN SPAIN: Under prevailing employment legislation in Spain for hospitality companies, Group companies in Spain with this activity are obliged to pay employees who have completed a specific length of service, an amount equivalent to a number of monthly salary instalments in cash, in accordance with the worker’s length of service and age at the end of their employment relationship. These long-service benefits are calculated based on the basic salary and the worker’s personal supplements. The collective labour agreement for travel agents in Spain also regulates retirement benefits, subject to an agreement between the worker and the company. In 2018 and 2017 the required provisions have been recognised for this purpose, based on the terms of the corresponding collective labour agreements. The liabilities relating to defined benefit obligations are measured based on actuarial calculations. The method used for this calculation in 2018 and 2017 was the projected unit credit method using the PERMF2000P applying an interest rate of 1.75% and an employee turnover assumption of 9.25%. The provision for this commitment amounts to 8.5 million euros at the 2018 closing (8.1 million in 2017). LONG-TERM REMUNERATIONS IN MEXICO AND ARUBA: The prevailing labour legislation in Mexico also includes a number of commitments from companies to their employees. At closing, the liability recognised for said commitments amounts to 4.6 million euros (4.3 million euros in 2017), which has been calculated using the projected unit credit method. The actuarial hypotheses used for the calculation of the related liability are a discount rate of 10.08%, a salary increase rate of 5.04% and long-term inflation of 4%. Finally, Aruban labour law obliges the company to pay a minimum pension to its employees in the case that the pension contributions made by the workers do not reach the minimum legal limit. The Group has recognised a provision to cover this liability amounting to 1.7 million euros (1.5 million euros in 2017). The main hypotheses used in the calculation have been retirement at 65 years old, a discount rate of 4.6%, and a salary increase of 2% and a staff rotation hypothesis of 9.50%. In 2017, the hypothesis regarding the estimated retirement age changed from 60 to 65 years in accordance with changes in local legislation. The change of said actuarial assumption has resulted in a decrease in liabilities amounting to 0.8 million euros that have been directly recognised in equity (See the Statement of Comprehensive Income). Barceló I Annual Report 2018 49 PENSION PLAN EMPLOYEES UNITED STATES (CRESTLINE HOTELS & RESORT, LLC) The Company has an executive plan aimed to award additional retirement benefits to a select group of Management employees, allowing them to totally or partially defer their remuneration. The amounts contributed in these plans by both the company and the employees, together with the profit and loss attributed to these amounts are transferred to a Trust Fund. The Trust Fund is exclusively owned by the company, subject to the demand of Crestline’s creditors, until the payment is made to the participating employee or their beneficiary. At December 31 2018 the plan’s assets amount to 4.0 million USD and consists of cash and cash equivalents, shares and bonds. At December 31, 2018 the non-current liability for this concept amounts to 3.1 million USD and the short-term liability amounts to 0.9 million USD. The difference between the assets and liabilities is due to the temporary differences arising from the participants’ contributions which are still pending payment to the plan. PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES Provisions for liabilities cover miscellaneous risks and contingencies arising from the Group’s operations and litigations. In 2017 provisions were withdrawn for guarantees extended to Bay Hotels & Leisure, S.A. amounting to 24.6 million euros. ONEROUS CONTRACTS Provisions for onerous contracts are those derived from lease contracts. These provisions have been calculated by discounting the cash flows estimated by the Group at a rate of 8.90% and evaluating the lowest possible cost of the various alternative outflows relating to each of the contracts. PROVISIONS FOR OVERHAULS This provision includes the estimated cost for the overhauls to be undertaken in the forthcoming years, taking into account the regulatory commitments relating to maintenance of the aircraft operating under operating lease contracts. 21.2. CURRENT PROVISIONS At December 31, 2018 current provisions amount to 1.2 million euros (1.5 million euros at December 31, 2017). Barceló I Annual Report 2018 50 22.

The valuation technique has not varied from the previous year. 55 27. TAXES Companies file annual income tax returns. The profits of Spanish companies, determined in accordance with tax legislation, are subject to a tax rate of 25% in 2018. Other Group companies are subject to nominal income tax rates of 15% to 35%. Certain deductions may be made from the resulting tax amount. Certain Spanish Group companies have filed consolidated income tax returns. Under this tax regime, the taxable income of Group companies is not determined by the Group’s consolidated accounting profit, but by the taxable income of the Group companies, determined as for individual tax returns, eliminating those results that form part of the individual taxable income of each Group company originating from intragroup transactions and including results which were eliminated in prior periods which are understood to have been realised by the Group in the tax period. The Spanish Group companies have tax loss carryforwards available for offset against future taxable income in an amount of 237.7 million euros. Due to the tax reform which entered into force on January 1, 2015, these tax loss carryforwards will be available for offset for an indefinite period. At December 31, 2018, of the aforementioned amount, tax losses amounting to 73 million euros (75 million euros in 2017) resulting in a deferred tax asset of 18.3 million euros (18.7 million euros in 2017). In the case of the remaining tax losses, the accounting criteria necessary for their capitalisation are not fulfilled. Furthermore, Spanish Group companies have various unused deductions, generated in prior years and in the current year, for an amount of 1.4 million euros, corresponding to the deduction for technological innovation which expires in 2036. At December 31, 2018, of the total unused deductions, deferred tax assets have been recognised for an amount of 1.4 million euros (1 million euros in 2017). Details of the main characteristics of Corporate Tax in other countries which are significant for the Group are detailed below. In the Dominican Republic, Group companies are subject to the higher of one of the following two taxes: (i) Asset Tax, at 1% of total assets less investments in shares, prepaid tax and rural properties, or (ii) Income Tax on taxable income based on accounting profit with various tax and accounting adjustments, at a rate of 27%, with a minimum, in certain cases, of 2.4% of the period’s revenue. It should be noted that the companies located in said country have a total of 3.8 million euros of tax losses which have not been capitalised. Two companies domiciled in this country have taken advantage of the tax benefits regulated by Confotur for investments made in hotels they own and that imply the exemption from these taxes during 15 years as of 2018. Group companies resident in Mexico in 2017 are subject to Income Tax on accounting profit adjusted for fiscal inflationary effects on monetary assets and liabilities and amortisation, at a rate of 30%. It should be noted that the companies located in said country have a total of 22.6 million euros. In accordance with prevailing Spanish legislation, taxes cannot be considered definitive until they have been inspected and agreed by the taxation authorities or before the inspection period of four years has elapsed. At December 31, 2018, the Spanish Group companies are open to inspection by the tax authorities for all the main applicable taxes since January 1, 2015. In 2018, the general inspection for Corporate Tax for the financial years between 2011 and 2014 and VAT from 06/2012 until 2014 has been completed. At closing, the result of the inspection is included in the income statement and balance sheet of the consolidated annual accounts, with the exception of a small portion related to the VAT inspection, for which the assessment has been contested.

All commitments with financial institutions regarding the payment of interest and repayment of the principal were duly met in 2018. Additionally, the closing balance sheet has a positive cash position of 399.8 million euros (cash and cash equivalents). Based on this balance sheet position, and positive working capital of 41.9 million euros, we are confident of continuing to meet our financial commitments, enabling us to grow in all the divisions of the Barceló Group. The net financial debt (net balances with financial entities) has improved in comparison with the previous year and is less than once the EBITDA (consolidated result before taxes, excluding amortisation, impairment, finance expenses, finance income and exchange rate adjustments). 1. MILESTONES FOR 2018 1.1. HOTEL ACTIVITY Barceló Hotel Group is the hotel division of the Barceló Group. The Group’s brand architecture is made up of four main brands: Royal Hideaway Luxury Hotels & Resorts, Barceló Hotels & Resorts, Occidental Hotels & Resorts and Allegro Hotels. It is the 3rd largest hotel chain in Spain and the 29th in the world. In 2018 the Group managed a total of 55,017 rooms in 250 hotel establishments located in Latin America, Europe, the United States and North Africa. Of this total number 15,491 rooms are Group-owned, 15,035 are leased and 24,491 are under management. During the year new establishments have been incorporated in the United States, Madrid, Tenerife, Vigo, Ourense, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Dubai and Cuba. During the year, the Barceló Group has continued renovating hotels in order to raise our standards of quality and adapt the hotels to the standards of the new brands, thus offering our clients modern, comfortable and environmentally-friendly establishments.

Barceló I Annual Report 2018 1.2. TRAVEL ACTIVITY Ávoris is a global tour operator, with a Latin style when it comes to designing the travel experience, consolidated and providing added value to our clients. We have evolved towards vertical integration with specialised brands that offer a unique experience adapted to each client. A new structure intended to lead changes in the tourism market in five main areas of business: distribution, product, airline, incoming services and travel experiences. 72 The tour operators organise holiday packages (transport, accommodation, activities, etc.) for their sale through travel agencies and also through their own Group network, B the travel brand. The Group aims to offer the traveller values such as knowledge, security, style, flexibility, experience and a capacity for response, in all their products The air division is made up of the air broker ByPlane and the airline Evelop. ByPlane, offers intermediary services between tourist agencies and airlines all over the world. ByPlane manages the contracting of private flights in state-of-the-art aircraft, as well as the rental of aircraft for all types of groups, business groups, sports teams or incentive trips. Evelop, which is the airline of B the travel brand, gives autonomy to the company’s tour operators. With a fleet of 6 aircraft for long-distance (four A330, one A330-200 and one A350) and an A-320 aircraft for medium-haul flights. The airline offers services to both the Barceló Group’s tour operators and to other European tour operators, especially from the Scandinavian and British markets. In 2018, the Division has continued to grow with the purchase of Nortravel and Serhs. 2. THE GROUP’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS In 2018 Net Consolidated Profit for an amount of 180.3 million euros has been obtained, thus fulfilling the year’s budget. In the previous year net profit amounted to 243 million euros. The fall in the result is due to the non-recurring result in the previous year (extraordinary) arising from the sale of shares in BAY. In 2018 Gross Revenue has amounted to 4,383 million euros compared to 4,313 million euros in the previous year. Gross revenue is made up of the consolidated income from the owned and leased hotels, hotels under management contracts, and gross income without intercompany eliminations from the Travel Division. Highlights of 2018 include an investment and improvements made to our hotels, in excess of 100 million euros. The robustness of the consolidated balance sheet is reflected in the net cash position of 399.8 million euros (positive working capital of 41.9 million euros) which will allow the Group to meet its commitments without any difficulties in 2019 and reduce its net financial debt. 3. OUTLOOK FOR 2019 Our goal for 2019 is to obtain EBITDA of approximately 375 million euros and net profit of 200 million euros. This improvement will be the result of better management, growth and investments made in 2018. Barceló I Annual Report 2018 The robustness of our balance sheet will afford us access to attractive investment projects and to continue to grow in all the Group’s divisions. 73 4.
