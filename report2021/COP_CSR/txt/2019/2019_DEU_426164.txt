Supplementary to this, the Supervisory Board has reserved the right, in addition to the fixed annual Group Management Report salary and the variable compensation components, to grant at its own discretion a one-off payment for exceptional performance. The contracts also provide for normal fringe benefits (private use of company car, accident insurance, etc.). There is no cap on the amount of any one-off payment for exceptional performance or on the value of fringe benefits because it does not appear necessary for such amounts to be capped in accordance with the letter and spirit of the Code recommendation and, in our legal appraisal, the Code recommendation does not extend to this. For the same reason, such payments and benefits are not covered by any cap on the amount of overall compensation.

Dividend HOCHTIEF retains its policy of remunerating shareholders their commensurate share in the success of the Group Management Report business. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft are proposing to distribute an ordinary dividend of EUR 4.98 per share for 2018.

In order to ensure that the bridges continue to function long-term, local helpers are recruited on the ground.

Accounting policies General information The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). There have been no changes to the accounting policies during the reporting year. Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes. For purposes of understandability, various items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings. These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros. As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, Court of Registration: Essen District Court, HRB 279, publishes its own consolidated financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS). The consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft are published in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal Official Gazette); the consolidated financial statements of ACS are published in the register of Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores. The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the 2018 reporting year, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2018. The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 20, 2019. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 21, 2019. Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements generally include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as all German and foreign subsidiaries under its direct or indirect control. Control is defined as when HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and Notes holds the majority of voting rights in a company. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority shareholding. Thirteen companies are fully consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other parties are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations. Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that make use of these exemptions is included in Note 44. 156 Group Report 2018 The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 include HOCHTIEF Aktien­ gesellschaft and a total of 45 German and 379 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies decreased by 28 compared with the previous year. The number of special-purpose investment funds stayed the same. A total of 17 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (8), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (6), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (3). A total of six German and 39 foreign companies were removed from the consolidated group. The companies removed from the consolidated group related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (27), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (10), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (8). An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of. Thirty-three affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales. Seventeen domestic and 129 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by a total of six companies, with 19 companies added and 25 removed. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (8), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (6), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (4), and Corporate Headquarters (1). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (17), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (4), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (4). Due to their minor overall significance, a further 11 companies were not accounted for using the equity method. A total of 71 joint operations from the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in relation to the interest in these joint operations. In the reporting year, five entities were added and one removed. Acquisition of shareholding in toll road operator Abertis On October 18, 2017, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft (HOCHTIEF) submitted a takeover offer for the entire outstanding share capital of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (Abertis). Atlantia S.p.A (Atlantia), Italy, had submitted a takeover offer of its own for Abertis on May 15, 2017. Consolidated Financial Statements On March 14, 2018, HOCHTIEF, its parent company Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. (ACS), and ­Atlantia agreed on a joint acquisition of Abertis. The agreement stipulated that HOCHTIEF should amend the terms of the takeover offer it made to the shareholders of Abertis in the prior year in such a way as to remove the originally envisioned share component, with the result that the consideration under the offer amounted to EUR 18.36 and Notes per Abertis share (adjusted for the gross dividend paid out in the meantime) and was to be paid in cash. HOCHTIEF announced on May 14, 2018 that 78.8% of shareholders had accepted the offer. This was further raised to 98.7% by the purchase of shares on the stock exchange and the cancellation of treasury shares and by means of bilateral share purchase agreements. Abertis was delisted on August 6, 2018. HOCHTIEF, ACS, and Atlantia established a holding company, which they provided with EUR 6.91 billion in equity (HOCHTIEF EUR 1.38 billion, ACS EUR 2.07 billion, and Atlantia EUR 3.46 billion). On October 29, 2018, this holding company, named Abertis HoldCo, S.A. (Abertis HoldCo), via another holding company (Abertis Participaciones S.A.U.), then acquired all Abertis shares held by HOCHTIEF against payment of a purchase price that corresponded to the price paid by HOCHTIEF. In addition to the equity, Abertis HoldCo financed the takeover with debt in the amount of EUR 9.82 billion. Following the transaction, Atlantia holds 50% plus one share of Abertis HoldCo, ACS Group Report 2018 157 holds 30%, and HOCHTIEF holds 20% minus one share. HOCHTIEF’s shareholding in Abertis constitutes a significant influence and is therefore accounted for as an equity-method associate. To finance its shareholding in Abertis HoldCo (EUR 1.38 billion), HOCHTIEF carried out a capital increase from authorized capital and issued 6.35 million new shares at EUR 143.04 per share (corresponding to EUR 907.8 million) to ACS. ACS sold 16.85 million shares (corresponding to 23.86% of HOCHTIEF’s entire shareholding) to Atlantia in a further step and remains the majority shareholder in HOCHTIEF with 50.41%. On June 26, 2018, with a value date of July 3, 2018, HOCHTIEF completed a new corporate bond issue for EUR 500 million. The issue proceeds are for general business purposes and also for the Abertis acquisition. Consolidation policies The financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any minority interest. In accordance with the optional treatment under IFRS 3, non-controlling interest is measured at the acquisition date at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the reporting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive difference is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is not subjected to amortization, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that the value may be impaired. A remaining negative difference arising from the initial measurement is recognized in profit and loss. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when measuring disposal proceeds. Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies that are included in the consolidated financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are included in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 158 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Non-current assets held for sale In view of the intention to sell, assets of the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. Accordingly, the assets are presented separately in the balance sheet. The table below shows the major classes of assets held for sale. (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Property, plant and equipment 432 20,431 Inventories 488 552 Total assets 920 20,983 Currency translation For currency translation purposes, the following exchange rates have been used for the main Group companies outside the euro area: Annual average Daily average at reporting date (All rates in EUR) 2018 2017 2018 2017 1 U.S. dollar (USD) 0.85 0.88 0.87 0.83 1 Australian dollar (AUD) 0.63 0.68 0.62 0.65 1 British pound (GBP) 1.13 1.14 1.12 1.13 100 Polish złoty (PLN) 23.43 23.57 23.25 23.94 100 Qatari riyal (QAR) 23.22 23.88 23.91 22.73 100 Czech koruna (CZK) 3.89 3.80 3.89 3.92 100 Chilean pesos (CLP) 0.13 0.14 0.13 0.14 In their separate financial statements, Group companies disclose transactions denominated in foreign currency using the average exchange rate on the day of recording the transaction. Exchange gains or losses up to the ­reporting date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro zone operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official Consolidated Financial Statements requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. and Notes Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. Group Report 2018 159 Accounting policies Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straightline basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized to profit or loss over a maximum of seven years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Company names and goodwill are not subject to amortization. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intangible assets with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. Property, plant and equipment is carried at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives: No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Technical equipment and machinery; transportation equipment 3–10 Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Consolidated Financial Statements Items of property, plant and equipment classified as finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or over a shorter contract term if applicable. and Notes 160 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. The fair values are measured using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. As with property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is defined as fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, in relation to its interests in a joint operation, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint venture plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2018 161 The interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests accounted for under other financial assets come under the “at fair value through profit or loss“ measurement category. For equity instruments not held for trading, IFRS 9 provides the option of measurement at fair value through other comprehensive income. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is normally calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses on equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to retained earnings on disposal. Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and other receivables. Accounting provision is normally made for expected credit losses on receivables. For trade receivables, using the simplified approach, expected credit losses can be determined on the basis of loss rates calculated from historical and projected data taking into account the client and the regional economic environment. If there is objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired, the asset is tested separately for impairment. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. For financial receivables and other receivables, expected credit losses are determined according to credit risk on the basis of the losses expected either in the next twelve months or over the remaining term. Significant changes in credit risk are taken into account. Receivables may be derecognized in connection with factoring if substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Revenue from service agreements is recognized according to the percentage of completion. Revenue u ­ nder construction contracts is recognized as described in the following. Construction contracts are accounted for on the basis of percentage of completion. Cumulative performance to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is generally recognized as sales on a pro rata basis over time according to the percentage completed. Project progress is determined using the method that provides the best measure of progress toward completion. The input or output methods may be used consistently for similar perform­ ance obligations and in similar circumstances. The HOCHTIEF Group mainly uses input methods (such as the cost-to-cost method for revenue recognition on a percentage of completion basis) especially to determine construction revenue. For other types of project (especially in the services business), output methods such as the Consolidated Financial Statements units-of-delivery method are better suited as they provide a more precise estimate of project execution progress and of the associated costs. Projects are accounted for under contract assets and contract liabilities, as applicable. If cumulative performance (contract costs and contract earnings) exceeds progress payments in a given construction contract, the project is presented as a contract asset. Where the net amount after deduction of progress and Notes payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and presented under contract liabilities. Part-performance already invoiced is accounted for in trade receivables. Expected contract losses are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks and immediately included in full in contract earnings. Contract income is 162 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 as the income stipulated in the contract plus contract modifications, meaning any claims and variation orders. Contract assets are realized within one operating cycle at the HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even if the entire receivable is not expected to be realized in full within twelve months of the balance sheet date. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or tax group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including production-­ related depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. Should the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increase, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense. The marketable securities shown under current assets are classified in the “amortized cost“ measurement category or the “at fair value through other comprehensive income” measurement category, depending on business model and contractual cash flows. For marketable securities, IFRS 9 provides the option of measurement at fair value through profit or loss. These mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose funds and investment funds, as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses on debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. Accounting provision is made for expected credit losses on securities in the “amortized cost“ and “at fair value through other comprehensive income” measurement categories. Expected credit losses are calculated according to credit risk on the basis of the losses expected either in the next twelve months or over the remaining term. Significant changes in credit risk are taken into account. If Consolidated Financial Statements there is objective evidence that a financial asset may be impaired, the asset is tested separately for impairment. Selected marketable securities are adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the rules for use of the “overlay approach“. and Notes Group Report 2018 163 Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only. Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from discontinued operations. Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Incentive Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. Varying from one country to another, the individual benefit obligations are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pension-­ like nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as Consolidated Financial Statements defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred comand Notes 164 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements pensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and timing. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to reimbursement. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities are recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness in accordance with the HOCHTIEF Group’s risk management strategy. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassiConsolidated Financial Statements fied to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, gains or losses recogand Notes Group Report 2018 165 nized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are entered into. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied, and as call options. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liability as of the reporting date. Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following matters: • Construction and services – determination of stage of completion; – estimation of total contract costs; – estimation of total contract revenue, including recognizing revenue on contract variations and claims only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount recognized will not occur in the future; – estimation of project completion date; and – assumed levels of project execution productivity. • Estimation of allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets. • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Marketable securities may be grouped in different categories. • Application of the risk management strategy to hedges. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 166 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for contract modifications, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • The measurement of expected credit losses. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment. • Testing deferred tax assets for impairment. All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Financial reporting standards applied for the first time in 2018 Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) of new and revised IFRS and IFRIC pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2018. The changes relate to the following standards and interpretations: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: The HOCHTIEF Group applied IFRS 9 for the first time in 2018. Primarily, the new standard introduces major changes relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets as well as new rules on hedge accounting. The introduction of IFRS 9 also results in additional disclosure requirements. First-time application was retrospective, as required. All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are required to be measured subsequently at amortized cost or fair value on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The changes in classification are: Consolidated Financial Statements • Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured subsequently at amortized cost (AC); and Notes • Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is both to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the debt instruments, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and • All other debt investments and equity investments are measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Group Report 2018 167 Despite the foregoing, the HOCHTIEF Group may make the following irrevocable designation at initial recognition of a financial asset: • The Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration in connection with a business combination in other comprehensive income; and • The Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortized cost or FVOCI criteria as measured at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. IFRS 9 had the following impact on the relevant asset items in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2018. Balance sheet items IAS 39 measurement IAS 39 carrying IFRS 9 measurement category IFRS 9 adjusted category amount as of carrying amount as (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2017 of Jan. 1, 2018 Other financial assets Available-for-sale 73,528 Financial instruments at fair value 73,528 ­financial assets ­through profit or loss Financial receivables Loans and receivables 979,701 Debt instruments at amortized cost 589,475 Trade receivables Loans and receivables 2,698,995 Debt instruments at amortized cost 2,679,113 Other receivables Loans and receivables 273,585 Debt instruments at amortized cost 273,585 and other assets Financial assets at fair 45,832 Financial instruments at fair value 45,832 value through profit or ­through profit or loss loss Securities Available-for-sale 428,759 Debt instruments at fair value through 151,986 ­financial assets other comprehensive income Financial instruments at fair value 276,773 ­through profit or loss Cash and cash Loans and receivables 3,094,924 Debt instruments at amortized cost 3,094,924 ­equivalents Under IFRS 9, available-for-sale classification is no longer permitted. HOCHTIEF’s other financial assets under this category were transferred to fair value through profit or loss on transition as of January 1, 2018. These are all equity instruments and there was no impact on their carrying amount. HOCHTIEF’s securities have been reclassified either to the fair value through profit or loss category or to the fair value through other comprehensive income category. The securities reclassified to the fair value through profit or loss category are mostly a ­ ccounted for using the overlay approach. The carrying amount of financial receivables as well as trade receivables was adjusted for expected credit losses as of the transition date. Consolidated Financial Statements First-time application of IFRS 9 had no impact on financial liabilities. and Notes 168 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements A methodological change in measurement consisted of the switch from incurred credit losses to expected credit losses in the presentation of impairments of financial assets. Quantifying expected credit losses involves determining the probability of default on initial recognition of an asset and subsequently whether there has been any significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis at each reporting period. In making this assessment, the HOCHTIEF Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar organizations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the HOCHTIEF Group’s core operations. In particular, as far as available, the following information is taken into account when assessing significant movements in credit risk: • Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial, or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations. • Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower. • Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower. • External credit rating. • Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third-party guarantees or credit enhancements. • Significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the borrower, including changes in the payment status of borrowers in the Group and changes in the operating results of the borrower. • Macroeconomic information such as market interest rates and growth rates. The change in method from recognition of incurred losses to recognition of expected credit losses for impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9 has led to an adjustment reducing financial receivables and trade receivables. This adjustment mainly relates to a EUR 318 million reduction in financial receivables from a joint venture, BIC Contracting LLC (BICC)—formerly HLG Contracting LLC—which is part of the CIMIC Group. CIMIC engaged an independent advisory expert to obtain a credit rating and applied the relevant expected credit loss rate to the loan in line with rating agency published rates and methodology. An additional EUR 92 million expected credit loss has been recognized in relation to financial receivables and trade receivables. A new hedge accounting model has also been introduced that aims to bring hedge accounting more closely into line with an entity’s risk management activities. However these new hedge accounting requirements had no impact Consolidated Financial Statements on the results of the Group. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The HOCHTIEF Group applied IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers for the first time in 2018. and Notes This standard establishes a comprehensive framework for determining the timing and amount of revenue recognized. It primarily replaces IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognizes revenue when control of a good or service transfers to a customer. Group Report 2018 169 IFRS 15 has been applied in the HOCHTIEF Group as of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, the effects of applying the standard have been recognized in consolidated equity and the presentation of the comparison period remains unchanged. Significant judgments are used in determining the impact of IFRS 15, such as assessment of the probability a client will accept variations and claims, or estimation of progress and productivity in project execution. In making this assessment, the HOCHTIEF Group has considered, for applicable contracts, the individual status of legal proceedings, including litigation and arbitration. The significant effects of applying the standard were as follows: The contractual terms and the way in which the HOCHTIEF Group operates its construction contracts are predominantly derived from projects containing one performance obligation. Contracted revenue will continue to be recognized over time. IFRS 15 provides new requirements for variable consideration such as incentives, as well as accounting for claims and variations as contract modifications, which all impart a higher threshold of probability for recognition. Under IAS 11, revenue was recognized when it was probable that work performed would result in revenue, whereas under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur for such modifications. Where consideration in respect of a contract is variable, the expected value of revenue is recognized (constraint requirements). The Group assesses the constraint requirements on a periodic basis when estimating the variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. The estimate is based on all available information, including historic performance. Where modifications in design or contract requirements are entered into, the transaction price is updated to reflect them. Where the price of the modification has not been confirmed, an estimate is made of the amount of revenue to recognize whilst also considering the constraint requirement. The HOCHTIEF Group accounts for ongoing construction contracts in receivables as contract assets if cumulative performance (contract cost and contract earnings) exceeds progress payments received. Separate contract liabilities are recognized for all construction contracts where progress payments received exceed cumulative performance. Part-performance already invoiced is presented in trade receivables. Service revenue arises from maintenance and other services in the infrastructure business, which may involve a range of services and processes. Services combined as a single performance obligation are closely related and performed over time. Related revenues therefore continue to be recognized over time in the HOCHTIEF Group. As with construction revenue, service revenues also involve incentives, variations, and claims that are subject to the same strict requirement of only recognizing revenue to the extent it is highly probable that there will be no significant cancellations. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 170 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Under IAS 11, costs incurred during the tender process were capitalized within trade receivables when it was deemed probable the contract would be won. Under the new standard, costs are capitalized only if they are both expected to be recovered and either would not have been incurred if the contract had not been won or if they are intrinsic to the delivery of the project. Costs incurred prior to the commencement of a contract (contract fulfillment costs) may arise due to mobilization/site setup costs, feasibility studies, environmental impact studies, and preliminary design activities as these are costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Where these costs are expected to be recovered, they are capitalized and amortized over the duration of the contract consistent with the transfer of service to the customer. Where the costs, or a portion thereof, are reimbursed by the customer, the amount received is recognized as deferred revenue and allocated to the performance obligations within the contract and recognized as revenue over the course of the contract. The HOCHTIEF Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer represents a financing component. As a consequence, the Group normally does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money. Generally, construction and services contracts include defect and warranty periods following completion of the project. These obligations are not deemed to be separate performance obligations and are therefore estimated and included in the total costs of the contracts. Where required, amounts are recognized accordingly in line with IAS 37 under provisions. Concerning loss-making contracts, a provision is made for the difference between the expected cost of fulfilling a contract and the expected unearned portion of the transaction price where the forecast costs are greater than the forecast revenue. The adjustment reflects the consistent application of HOCHTIEF Group revenue recognition criteria as outlined above. The higher recognition threshold and constraint criteria under IFRS 15 have led mainly to a reduction in the investment in BICC by EUR 160 million. With regard to revenue recognition for fully consolidated companies, the increased revenue recognition requirements under IFRS 15 led to a reduction in equity by EUR 740 million (after tax) as of January 1, 2018. In the case of equity-method joint ventures, the carrying amount of the investment in a joint venture reflects the Group’s share of equity including the revenue from construction contracts (IFRS 15) recognized by the joint venture Consolidated Financial Statements and accounted for by the Group as its share of profit or loss. In this connection, equity was reduced by EUR 245 million (after tax) as of January 1, 2018. and Notes Group Report 2018 171 Overall effects of first-time application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 Impact on Consolidated Balance Sheet The impact of first-time application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on assets, liabilities and equity in the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 1, 2018 is as follows: Dec. 31, Restatement Restatement Total Jan. 1, 2018 (EUR thousand) 2017 IFRS 9 IFRS 15 restatements Assets Non-current assets Equity-method investments 577,171 – (271,632) (271,632) 305,539 Financial receivables 835,518 (351,212) – (351,212) 484,306 Deferred taxes 155,754 – 95,466 95,466 251,220 (351,212) (176,166) (527,378) Current assets Financial receivables 144,183 (39,014) – (39,014) 105,169 Trade receivables 4,818,231 (19,882) (791,494) (811,376) 4,006,855 (58,896) (791,494) (850,390) (410,108) (967,660) (1,377,768) Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity Shareholders’ equity Attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders 1,788,114 (323,066) (801,511) (1,124,577) 663,537 Non-controlling interest 745,988 (87,042) (182,876) (269,918) 476,070 2,534,102 (410,108) (984,387) (1,394,495) 1,139,607 Current liabilities Trade payables 6,266,960 – 16,727 16,727 6,283,687 – 16,727 16,727 (410,108) (967,660) (1,377,768) The equity adjustments on first-time application of the two standards led to a reduction in equity by EUR 1,394 million as of January 1, 2018, with the impact on equity attributable to non-controlling interests amounting to EUR 270 million. Adjustments under the two new standards must also take deferred taxes into account and, therefore, the net deferred tax position is also impacted by the adjustments discussed above, which are shown net of tax. Deferred tax assets increased by a net amount of EUR 95 million as of January 1, 2018. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 172 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Impact on cash flows First-time application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 has no impact on the HOCHTIEF Group’s cash flows. Further changes relate to the following standards and interpretations: • Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions • Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts • Amendments to IAS 40 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property • Amendments to IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration • Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2014–2016 Cycle The additional disclosure requirements resulting from the amendments to IFRS 2, IFRS 4, IAS 40 and IFRIC 22 and from the 2014–2016 cycle annual improvements had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements.

Deferred taxes are calculated for foreign companies using the applicable country-specific tax rate. The theoretical tax expense is determined as in the prior year by applying the Group tax rate of 31.5% to profit before tax. The following table shows the reconciliation of the theoretical tax expense to the effective tax charges: (EUR thousand) 2018 2017 Profit before tax 978,439 823,619 Theoretical tax expense, at 31.5% 308,208 259,440 Difference between the above and foreign tax rates (31,756) (21,249) Differences from tax base for German municipal trade tax (9,755) (1,235) Changes in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets without recognition of deferred ­taxes/utilization of loss carryforwards/tax credits 9,606 24,706 Tax effects on: Tax-exempt income (3,951) (6,367) Non-tax-allowable expenditure 20,667 32,267 Equity accounting of associates and joint ventures, including impairment of ­associates and joint ventures (32,284) 3,593 Other (847) (50,023) Effective tax charges 259,888 241,132 Effective rate of tax (percent) 26.6 29.3 As in the prior year, the tax-exempt income mostly relates to income from participating interests. In the prior year, the “Other” item mainly included effects of the U.S. tax reform, Public Law No. 115–97, of Decem­ ber 2017. The applicable corporate tax rate fell from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018. These prior-year effects related to non-cash remeasurements of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) introduced in the tax reform were found to have no signifi­ cant impact on HOCHTIEF’s effective tax rate. 11.

Development costs in the amount of EUR 550 thousand (2017: EUR 250 thousand) were capitalized in the reporting year. 180 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 43,751 thousand (2017: EUR 43,728 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, comprising EUR 41,707 thousand (2017: EUR 39,818 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas division and EUR 2,044 thousand (2017: EUR 3,910 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The company names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. The changes relative to the prior year relate to exchange rate adjustments and to a EUR 1,695 thousand impairment on the Devine name in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF as of December 31 in each reporting year. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. This is the present value of expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit. Value in use is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is applied on the basis of cash flow budgets derived as a rule from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years without applying a terminal value growth rate. A sustained cash flow is determined on the basis of free cash flow in the last budget year. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital figures. Value in use is first measured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures. The discount rates used in impairment testing for the cash-generating units HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe are 6.90% and 8.20% before tax (2017: 7.91% and 9.31%). The recoverable amount of the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on CIMIC’s stock market valuation. As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts did not reveal Consolidated Financial Statements any impairment of goodwill.

Profit from equity-method associates (EUR 70,415 thousand) include provisions of EUR 23,698 thousand (2017: EUR – thousand). Joint ventures As BIC Contracting LLC (BICC)—formerly HLG Contracting LLC—is accounted for as an equity-method joint venture, the book carrying value of the investment in BICC reflects the Group’s share of BICC’s operating results, including BICC’s recognition of construction revenue. The higher recognition threshold and constraint criteria in the new standard IFRS 15 have led to a reduction in the investment of EUR 160 million. The investment in BICC is now held at nil value and is therefore no longer material to the Group. A call option to purchase the remaining 55% shareholding in BICC is still in place. This option has no current impact on the control of the company. The fair value of the call option was unaltered at USD 54 million as of December 31, 2018, corresponding to EUR 46.9 million (2017: EUR 45.1 million). In accordance with IFRS 9 the option has been classified as a derivative asset measured at fair value through profit or loss. No gain or loss was recognized in the period.

Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 590,518 thousand (2017: EUR 574,057 thousand) are entirely due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliance with IFRS measurement principles. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset within each company or tax group. Within the amount of EUR 652,710 thousand (2017: EUR 696,963 thousand) of deferred tax assets, the following tax refund entitlements arising from the expected future use of tax loss carryforwards or tax credits are included: Consolidated Financial Statements (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Corporate income tax (or comparable foreign income tax) 73,750 109,798 German municipal trade tax – 18,084 73,750 127,882 and Notes Deferred tax assets are only recognized for tax loss carryforwards in as far as it is sufficiently certain that the tax loss carryforwards can be utilized. To the extent that no sufficient taxable temporary differences are available, expected taxable income for the purpose of measuring deferred taxes on deductible temporary differences and/or tax loss carryforwards is derived from budget figures, taking account of restrictions due to rules to be observed with regard to minimum taxation. Tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 1,644,236 thousand (2017: EUR 1,312,764 thousand) in respect of German and foreign corporate income tax and EUR 1,436,025 thousand (2017: EUR 1,182,408 thousand) in respect of German municipal trade tax. Group Report 2018 187 Deferred tax assets have not been recognized for EUR 62,271 thousand (2017: EUR 46,148 thousand) in tax loss carryforwards that are subject to a time limit. There are time limits of two and nine years. German and foreign Group companies that generated losses in 2018 or prior years have EUR 59,155 thousand (2017: EUR 63,128 thousand) in unimpaired deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards. No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR 356,591 thousand (2017: EUR 354,888 thousand). The change in the interest expense carryforward figures relates to adjustments made on the basis of tax audits and ongoing changes. No deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on temporary differences in the amount of EUR 17,049 thousand (2017: EUR 34,000 thousand) in connection with investments in subsidiaries because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. In the reporting year, minus EUR 20,122 thousand (2017: EUR 5,505 thousand) was recognized directly in equity in relation to currency translation of deferred taxes in foreign financial statements, and minus EUR 5,976 thousand (2017: EUR 13,637 thousand) was recognized directly in equity for the remeasurement through other comprehensive income of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.

Most marketable securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss are accounted for on the basis of the rules for use of the overlay approach. As before, the securities categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy were initially recognized as at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying amount decreased by EUR 15,017 thousand (2017: increased by EUR 2,984 thousand) due to fair value adjustments.

Share-based payment The following share-based payment plans were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliates in 2018: Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2012 also provided for grants of stock awards. The SARs could only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date, the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock was higher relative to the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (relative performance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated financial statements was at least 15% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold was waived if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeded the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period. Provided that the targets were met, the SARs could be exercised at any time after a four-year waiting period except during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs were exercised, the issuing entity paid out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The gain was limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR. The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period following a four-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain was limited to EUR 75.81 per stock award. The plan was exercised in full in 2018. Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differed from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point: The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number of SARs that could be exercised depended on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This value range was set in the business plan for each exercise year. Consolidated Financial Statements The gain was limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award. The plan was likewise exercised in full in 2018. and Notes Group Report 2018 195 Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP 2015) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2015 and is open to Executive Board members.

Long-term Incentive Plan 2016 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2016 (LTIP 2016) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2016 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2015 solely in that the waiting period was shortened from four to three years and a total term of the plans accordingly to six years (SARs) and five years (stock awards). The gain is limited to EUR 41.54 per SAR and EUR 124.62 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2017 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2017 (LTIP 2017) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2017 and is open to Executive Board members and selected managerial employees. The plan is based on performance stock awards. The conditions stipulate that for each performance stock award (PSA) exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals receive from the issuing entity a payment entitlement equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date, plus a performance bonus. The size of the performance bonus depends on the adjusted free cash flow of the last complete year before the exercise date. The gain is limited to EUR 514.62 per PSA. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 196 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-term Incentive Plan 2018 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2018 (LTIP 2018) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2018 and is open to Executive Board members and selected managerial employees. The plan is based on performance stock awards. The conditions stipulate that for each performance stock award (PSA) exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals receive from the issuing entity a payment entitlement equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date, plus a performance bonus.

For the members of the Executive Board and managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the performance bonus depends on adjusted free cash flow. The gain is limited to EUR 533.70 per PSA. The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is borne by the affiliated company concerned.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Defined benefit plans Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been ­offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a life-long annuity. Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF (UK) in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a life-long annuity and a lump-sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for retirees. HOCHTIEF (UK) has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2018 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 120,006 77,178 10,428 Final salary [21,204] – [10,428] Not final salary [98,802] [77,178] – Vested benefits 141,914 35,350 16,643 Retirees 501,274 87,212 15,413 Consolidated Financial Statements Similar obligations 92 52,413 – Total 763,286 252,153 42,484 Duration in years (weighted) 13.9 8.9 17.7 and Notes Dec. 31, 2017 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 119,864 80,884 10,822 Final salary [18,702] – [10,822] Not final salary [101,162] [80,884] – Vested benefits 157,757 39,090 17,467 Retirees 497,150 90,180 16,706 Similar obligations 96 53,383 – Total 774,867 263,537 44,995 Duration in years (weighted) 14.0 9.6 18.1 198 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Plan assets Germany There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets are administered by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are not made by the trustee but by an investment committee. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation offered up to December 31, 2013 were funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. as of December 31, 2018 is about 52% (2017: 56%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 58% (2017: 62%). It should be noted in this connection that pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio is expected to significantly increase again when interest rates recover. USA The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. The pension obligations being fully funded at Turner, Consolidated Financial Statements high-risk investments in equities were reduced and investments in bonds that are more stable in value were increased in 2018. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations and Notes covered by Turner’s pension fund as of December 31, 2018 is about 105% (2017: 100%); funding at Turner overall is about 82% (2017: 79%). Group Report 2018 199 UK Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF (UK) is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF (UK) is about 76% (2017: 74%). Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 53,587 – 54,552 – Partially covered by plan assets 739,156 402,730 961,696 648,497 Not fully covered by plan assets 792,743 402,730 1,016,248 648,497 Fully covered by plan assets 265,180 279,508 67,151 72,615 Total 1,057,923 682,238 1,083,399 721,112 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2018 2017 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK * Weighted average Discount factor* 2.00 4.45 2.90 2.00 3.68 2.55 Salary increases 2.75 – 2.05 2.75 – 2.00 Pension increases* 1.75 – 3.30 1.75 – 3.27 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into ­account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience.

Before deferred taxes, the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 462,105 thousand (2017: EUR 441,963 thousand). The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2018 came to EUR 52,413 thousand (2017: EUR 53,383 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,630 thousand (2017: EUR 1,642 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,076 thousand (2017: EUR 2,483 thousand) of the interest expense. Group Report 2018 203 Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to the following material risks: Interest rate risk For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly strong impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. Inflation risk By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan is frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. Longevity risk The granting of life-long pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pensioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally averages out across all pension plan members and only comes into play if life expectancy is greater than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

The main reason for this is an extraordinary contribution to the Turner pension fund which is included in the 2018 figures. Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accord­ ance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on most payments into the fund, although it is also possible to pay contributions from taxed income and receive the investment earnings free of tax; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are similar to 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. Since July 1, 2014, CIMIC in Australia has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions.

As in the prior year, there are no drawings on the credit facility tranche as of the reporting date. On April 13, 2018, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft signed a new syndicated credit facility amounting to approximately EUR 18.2 billion pursuant to the agreement entered into with ACS, Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A. and Atlantia S.p.A regarding the joint approach to be taken in the acquisition of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. of March 14, 2018. CNMV confirmed on May 14, 2018 that the voluntary takeover offer for Abertis had been accepted by a total of 78.79% of the share capital. Additional shares were subsequently purchased on the open market, at a Group Report 2018 207 maximum of the offer price. The credit facility was progressively drawn upon between May and October 2018 in order to finance the 98.7% total acquired shareholding in Abertis (taking into account treasury shares retired by Abertis). On October 29, 2018, this shareholding was transferred to Abertis Participaciones S.A.U., in return for which Abertis HoldCo, S.A. paid back the EUR 16,407,096 thousand drawings on the EUR 18.2 billion syndicated credit facility, which is thus cleared in full. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft consequently no longer has any financial ­liabilities under the acquisition facility as of the reporting date. In November 2018, a syndicated guarantee and credit facility in the amount of CAD 350 million in favor of Flatiron Constructors Canada Ltd., Flatiron Construction Corp., and E.E. Cruz & Company, Inc., which had an initial term ending December 2018, was extended by one year to November 2019. Drawings on the facility were CAD 75.7 million as of the reporting date (2017: CAD 107.1 million) as a result of guarantees issued. Financial liabilities to equity-accounted companies total EUR 16,129 thousand (2017: EUR 15,203 thousand).

The combined total of progress payments received and offset against the contract assets and contract liabilities in the reporting year stands at EUR 4,009,056 thousand (2017: EUR 3,796,667 thousand). Trade payables include payables to equity-accounted companies in the amount of EUR 10,906 thousand (2017: EUR 13,260 thousand). A distinction was made between non-current and current trade payables for the first time in 2018.

Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Group share of profit after tax attributable to the shares by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have any dilutive effect. Diluted and basic earnings per share are consequently identical. 2018 2017 Profit after tax attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR thousand) 541,096 420,736 Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 65,448 64,253 Earnings per share attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR) 8.27 6.55 Consolidated Financial Statements Dividend per share (EUR) 3.38 Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 4.98 and Notes Group Report 2018 209 34. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of financial assets classified in the at fair value through profit or loss category and in the at fair value through other comprehensive income category are determined with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, using accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for the hedging of existing transactions and in asset management. Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the Balance Sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with impairment losses or expected credit losses. Risk management strategy All finance activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial directive. This is complemented by function-specific operating work instructions on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down the risk management strategy and the principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. The primary objective of financial risk management is to safeguard Group liquidity at all times. For the HOCHTIEF Group, liquidity not only means solvency in the strict sense, but also the long-term availability of the financial headroom needed for the basic operating business (such as collateral management/bank guarantees). Safeguarding liquidity at all times therefore requires integrated management of all Group financial resources, including its credit standing and hence borrowing capacity. A further objective is to minimize financial risks affecting the value and profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group (currency, interest rate, exchange rate, and commodity price risks of all kinds, as well as counterparty risks). Consolidated Financial Statements The HOCHTIEF Group’s operating business gives rise to new or changing financial risk exposures all the time. Risk minimization therefore does not mean excluding all financial risk, but substantially reducing, within specified bounds, financial risk exposures quantifiable at any time. This serves to ensure rapid response and adaptation capability in the event of unforeseen situations. and Notes Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses largely centralized liquidity structures—notably cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid cash flow bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the marketable securities and loans portfolios. 210 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guarantees issued by the Group. The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst-case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash outflows shown. Maximum payments as of December 31, 2018 (EUR thousand) 2019 2020 2021–2022 after 2022 Total Non-derivative financial liabilities 7,058,120 999,157 408,174 869,290 9,334,741 Derivative financial instruments 747 – – – 747 Loan commitments and financial ­guarantees 73,358 – – – 73,358 7,132,225 999,157 408,174 869,290 9,408,846 Maximum payments as of December 31, 2017 (EUR thousand) 2018 2019 2020–2021 after 2021 Total Non-derivative financial liabilities 5,943,242 576,813 1,065,183 707,217 8,292,455 Derivative financial instruments 3,863 199 – 59 4,121 Loan commitments and financial ­guarantees 80,844 – – – 80,844 6,027,949 577,012 1,065,183 707,276 8,377,420 In addition, Group liquidity is adequately secured for the long term with cash in hand and on deposit, marketable securities holdings, and undrawn revolving credit facilities. The following table shows the main liquidity instruments: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Cash in hand and on deposit 2,489,689 2,127,418 Marketable securities 1,150,408 1,186,131 Consolidated Financial Statements Undrawn revolving credit facilities 2,682,008 2,519,134 6,322,105 5,832,683 Undrawn guarantee facilities 1,500,015 3,298,454 and Notes No refinancing risk is currently seen with regard to the long-term guarantee and credit facilities in light of the broad international syndication in each instance, the refinancing of the syndicated credit and guarantee facility ahead of schedule in August 2017, and the early extension to the term of the syndicated credit and guarantee facility in July 2018 until mid-2023. The authorized capital in the amount of up to EUR 65,752 thousand and conditional capital in the amount of up to EUR 46,080 thousand provide appropriate scope for raising additional capital as needed. Group Report 2018 211 Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts. There must also be an intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the amount of EUR 51,973 thousand (2017: EUR 31,664 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 19,297 thousand (2017: EUR 3,179 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of EUR 32,676 thousand (2017: EUR 28,485 thousand). Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (transaction risk) arising from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group company concerned in each instance. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk from foreign currency transactions. Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. A binding guideline clarifies their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide financial directive. As a matter of policy, the counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives, changes in their fair values, their nominal amounts, and maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Assets Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 5,476 5,938 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 4,134 321 9,610 6,259 Liabilities and s ­ harehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 670 1,451 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 77 2,647 747 4,098 Changes in fair value Consolidated Financial Statements of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income 319 7,530 of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 6,383 (6,109) and Notes Nominal amounts Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 303,106 307,078 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 262,504 151,912 Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 26 26 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 14 22 212 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate what material impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit would result from a 10% fluctuation in foreign currencies relative to each Group company’s functional currency.

Two approaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from non-derivative financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and a guideline, and derivatives Group Report 2018 213 are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. As a matter of policy, the counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives, changes in their fair values, their nominal amounts, and maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Assets Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – 397 – 397 Liabilities and s­ harehold­ers’ equity Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – 23 – 23 Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income – – of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss (374) 209 Nominal amounts – – Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – 363 The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and profit.

In addition, price risk stems from other financial assets, primarily participating interests. Such items are shown in the following table. (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Price risk exposure on non-current assets 73,481 65,683 Price risk exposure on current assets 242,164 229,076 HOCHTIEF actively manages price risk. Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital markets at an early stage and take appropriate action. The changes relative to the prior year result from ongoing active portfolio management as part of Group-wide risk management. Derivatives are used to control other price risk only in exceptional instances. The following table shows the fair values of equity options and stock forward contracts, changes in their fair values, their nominal amounts, and maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Assets Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 3,185 4,616 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 46,890 45,114 50,075 49,730 Liabilities and sharehold­ers’ equity – – Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income (1,431) (6,140) of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 1,776 (6,270) Nominal amounts Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – 3,398 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – – Consolidated Financial Statements Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 3 15 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 108 120 and Notes Group Report 2018 215 The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result from a 10% fluctuation in the market value of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.

The carrying amount of securities subject to the overlay approach as of December 31, 2018 amounts to EUR 242,164 thousand. Changes in fair value recognized through other comprehensive income in the reporting period amounted to a negative EUR 10,587 thousand. Management of credit risk The HOCHTIEF Group is exposed to credit risk from operations and from certain financing activities. HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. For trade receivables, using the simplified approach, expected credit losses can be determined in accord­ ance with IFRS 9 on the basis of loss rates calculated from historical and projected data, taking into account the client and the regional economic environment. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, minimizing the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maximum risk exposure on financial guarantees issued by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 73,358 thousand (2017: EUR 80,844 thousand). No recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF and, in light of the financial circumstances, none is currently anticipated for the future. Consolidated Financial Statements HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF work and Notes instruction. Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all 216 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (such as rating agencies) to assess credit standings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they generally cannot be measured reliably. The following table shows the gross carrying amounts of trade receivables past due and not past due as of December 31, 2018 that are impaired either on the basis of an impairment matrix (simplified approach) or via specific valuation allowances. Dec. 31, 2018 Impairment matrix Gross Impairment matrix not Not past Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 91 to 120 Over 120 carrying applied – specific valuadue days past days past days past days past days past due (EUR thousand) amount tion allowances due due due due Trade receivables 5,020,836 4,449,639 503,930 35,542 2,510 1,281 774 27,160 5,020,836 4,449,639 503,930 35,542 2,510 1,281 774 27,160 The age structure of trade receivables that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the trade receivables that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings, meaning that they are mostly subject to low credit risk. The adjustment to trade receivables on the date of first-time application of IFRS 9 amounted to EUR 19,882 thousand, resulting in an adjusted opening balance of EUR 178,536 thousand. Changes during the 2018 reporting year relate to additions, reversals, utilizations, exchange rate adjustments, and consolidation changes, and come to a total of EUR 9,227 thousand (2017: EUR 9,441 thousand), as a result of which impairments on trade receivables amounted to EUR 187,763 thousand as of December 31, 2018. The impairments (expected credit losses) on trade receivables mostly consist of impairments typical for the industry. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2018 217 The following table shows changes in the expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets that come under the general impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9: Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Total 12-month ECL lifetime ECL lifetime ECL gross carrying net carrying (EUR thousand) amount amount Financial receivables Dec. 31, 2017 33,785 Adjustment (expected credit loss) – – – 390,226 Jan. 1, 2018 21,270 25,313 377,428 424,011 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 2,252 2,337 45,302 49,891 Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets – – – – Repaid or derecognized financial assets (9,042) (3,197) – (12,239) Other changes* (8) – (50,003) (50,011) Dec. 31, 2018 14,472 24,453 372,727 411,652 Other current receivables and other current assets Dec. 31, 2017 177 Adjustment (expected credit loss) – – – – Jan. 1, 2018 177 – – 177 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 47 – – 47 Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets 1 – – 1 Repaid or derecognized financial assets (1) – – (1) Other changes* 1 – – 1 Dec. 31, 2018 225 – – 225 *The other changes relate to exchange rate adjustments and consolidation changes. The expected credit loss (ECL) stages are defined in further detail based on the following risk classes: Risk class Company definition of risk class Basis for recognition of expected credit loss provision Performing Customers have a low risk of default, no 12-month expected losses or lifetime past due amounts expected losses (simplified approach) Consolidated Financial Statements where asset life is less than 12 months Underperforming Amount is initially past due (unless there is Lifetime expected losses – not credit reasonable and supportable information to impaired; gross carrying amount prove otherwise) or there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. and Notes Non-performing Amount is significantly past due (unless Lifetime expected losses – credit imthere is reasonable and supportable inforpaired; net carrying amount mation to prove otherwise) and there is evidence indicating the asset is reasonable and supportable information to prove credit impaired. Write-off There is evidence indicating that the debtor Asset is written off is in severe financial difficulty and the Group has no realistic prospect of recovery. 218 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In order to enable an assessment of the HOCHTIEF Group’s credit risk exposure, the following table shows the gross carrying amounts of financial assets by risk class within the ECL stages.

The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder returns. The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (defined as current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and equity.

Non-current securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss at fair value; as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Where insufficient recent information is available for fair value measurement of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests, cost may be used as an appropriate estimate of fair value. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value as set out below, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The following three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3. In Level 3, the fair value of investments in unlisted entities is measured using generally recognized valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis. The unobservable inputs used for this purpose are an internal rate of return of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3.0%, and required discount rates of between 10% and 15%. Call options are measured using Monte Carlo simulation. Assumed inputs are an expected exercise period of one to ten years, an EBITDA multiplier of six to twelve times, and a 15% discount factor. Changes in the unobservable inputs have no material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and liabilities, or equity.

Contingencies, commitments, and other financial obligations (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Obligations under guarantees 369,785 409,486 Of this total, obligations in the amount of EUR 368,741 thousand (2017: EUR 405,136 thousand) relate to associates and joint ventures, of which the entire amount (2017: EUR 404,603 thousand) is accounted for by the CIMIC Group. The remaining commitments and potential obligations relate to HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and primarily serve as security for bank loans, contract performance, warranty obligations, and advance payments. Most guarantees given by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as of the reporting date related to participating interests and construction joint ventures. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft is also jointly and severally liable for all construction joint ventures in which it has an interest in Germany.

The commitment to CNMV was required under Spanish law, which stipulates that on announcement of a takeover offer, a guarantee must be furnished to cover the funds needed for the transaction in order to secure the cash tranche of the offer. Following approval of the offer by CNMV on March 12, 2018, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, ACS (Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A.), and Atlantia S.p.A agreed on March 14, 2018 to present a joint takeover offer for Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. This involved submitting to CNMV a modification to the characteristics of the takeover bid on March 23, 2018. Under the modified takeover offer, the share component was removed from the offer, meaning that the acquisition was to be settled in full in cash. As a result, additional guarantees in the amount of approximately EUR 3.2 billion were submitted to CNMV. On April 12, 2018, CNMV approved the joint takeover offer for Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. dated March 23, 2018. On April 13, 2018, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft signed a new credit facility amounting to approximately EUR 18.2 billion pursuant to the agreement entered into with ACS and Atlantia S.p.A on March 14, 2018 regarding the joint approach to be taken in the acquisition of Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. The bank guarantees provided by the lenders and originally submitted to CNMV in connection with submission of the offer were replaced by the bank guarantees provided by the lenders under the new syndicated credit facility. CNMV confirmed on May 14, 2018 that the voluntary takeover offer for Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. had been accepted by a total of 78.79% of the share capital. The ensuing drawing on the aforementioned credit facility on May 17, 2018 in order to settle the offer price of approximately EUR 14.3 billion resulted in expiration of the outstanding bank guarantees in the amount of EUR 18.2 billion. As of the December 31, 2018 reporting date, there were consequently no longer any bank guarantees in connection with the takeover offer. The EUR 1.7 billion syndicated credit facility continues to be a central long-term financing instrument for HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. The facility, with a term to August 2022 and extension options of up to two more years, was extended in July 2018 on the basis of the first of the two extension options by one year to August 2023. Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 106,331 thousand (2017: EUR 92,183 thousand) and mostly relates to the CIMIC Group in the amount of EUR 106,162 thousand (2017: EUR 91,881 thousand). In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, there were additionally cash call commitments to non-consolidated entities in the amount of EUR 9,433 thousand (2017: EUR 10,100 thousand). Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2018 225 The term breakdown of minimum lease payments under operating leases is as follows: Operating leases Dec. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 (EUR thousand) Nominal value Nominal value Due within 1 year 238,621 215,680 Due in 1–5 years 457,058 438,180 Due after 5 years 84,618 131,739 The obligations from operating leases mainly relate to plant and machinery leased by the CIMIC Group. Lease payments under operating leases came to EUR 292,772 thousand in 2018 (2017: EUR 262,085 thousand). Several companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division have a number of leasing arrangements. The companies concerned are financed by third parties. HOCHTIEF itself holds neither interests in their equity nor assets such as loans or receivables. Relevant activities are managed by third parties under contractual agreement and are therefore not consolidated. The minimum lease payments under operating leases come to EUR 190,751 thousand (2017: EUR 123,486 thousand). Amounts due under long-term tenancies are EUR 87,257 thousand (2017: EUR 116,716 thousand). The term for which such tenancies cannot be terminated is between two and nine years (2017: two and ten years). The amounts due under tenancies are partly offset by anticipated rental income of EUR 29,000 thousand (2017: EUR 48,937 thousand). Other financial obligations include EUR 38,526 thousand (2017: EUR 40,690 thousand) in commitments relating to shareholder loans and under long-term contracts for the supply of goods and services. Legal disputes HOCHTIEF Group companies are involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings in the context of their operating activities. As currently assessed, however, HOCHTIEF does not anticipate that the disputes and arbitration proceedings will have any material adverse impact on the Group’s business and financial situation.

They are transacted on an arm’s length basis. External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. The sum of external sales and intersegment sales adds up to total sales revenue for each division. Work done also includes the proportional share of work done in joint ventures. The definition of EBITDA was harmonized Group-wide in 2018 and the prior-year figures were restated accordingly. Profit from operating activities is derived from EBITDA as follows: 2018 2017 (EUR thousand) (restated) Profit from operating activities 772,667 764,887 – Depreciation and amortization 391,590 395,621 + Net income from joint ventures 161,427 110,943 + Gains/losses from disposals of participating interests 31,362 359 + Adjustment for non-operating net expenses 56,758 48,944 EBITDA 1,413,804 1,320,754 Ordinary depreciation and amortization relates to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and investment properties. The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures comprises income and expenses, including impairment losses, relating to equity-method investments. The non-cash expenses consist of additions to provisions. Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equity-­ method investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests.

Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under cash flow from investing activities. The EUR 28,118 thousand (2017: EUR – thousand) increase in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes in the prior year comprised EUR 28,702 thousand in cash and cash equivalents from acquisitions and EUR 584 thousand in cash and cash equivalents in disposals. The EUR 3,565,888 thousand (2017: EUR 3,094,924 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises EUR 556 thousand (2017: EUR 728 thousand) in cash in hand, EUR 2,846,961 thousand (2017: EUR 2,323,094 thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 718,371 thousand (2017: EUR 771,102 thousand) in marketable ­securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the value of EUR 357,828 thousand are subject to restrictions (2017: EUR 196,404 thousand). Cash flow from operations was EUR 1,374,654 thousand in 2018. The EUR 16,519,541 thousand in cash resources required by HOCHTIEF during the year for the acquisition of shares in Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. was raised through new borrowing. All Abertis shares acquired by HOCHTIEF were sold on to Abertis Participaciones S.A.U., the holding company established in the course of the takeover transaction, against payment of a purchase price that corresponded to the price paid by HOCHTIEF. The shares attributable to HOCHTIEF (20%)—corresponding to EUR 3,303,908 thousand—were accounted for during the year as equity-method investments and presented accordingly in cash flow from investing activities as disbursements and proceeds from the resale, respectively. The disbursements and proceeds for the shares attributable to Atlantia/ACS (80%)—corresponding to EUR 13,215,633 thousand—are likewise included in cash flow from investing activities. In the course of the takeover, HOCHTIEF, ACS, and Atlantia established a further holding company (Abertis HoldCo, S.A.). The acquisition of 20% of the shares in this company, which are included in equity-method investments as of December 31, 2018, resulted in a cash outflow of EUR 1,406,752 thousand. Total cash flow from investing activities was a negative EUR 1,804,187 thousand in 2018. Cash flow from financing activities in 2018 came to EUR 832,551 thousand. Factors here were the EUR 907,833 thousand capital increase at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and the issue of a HOCHTIEF corporate bond (for a principal amount of EUR 500 million). The proceeds were primarily used to acquire the shares in Abertis HoldCo, S.A. An amount of EUR 3,191,463 thousand related to new borrowing and the repayment of debt to finance the shareholding in Abertis Infraestructuras, S.A. (20%) acquired by HOCHTIEF during the year. Also included is an Consolidated Financial Statements amount of EUR 13,215,633 thousand in new borrowing/repayment of debt for the shares attributable to Atlantia/ ACS (80%). Including exchange rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 470,964 thousand. and Notes All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations included: • Interest income of EUR 47,853 thousand (2017: EUR 50,633 thousand) • Interest expenses of EUR 160,758 thousand (2017: EUR 158,166 thousand) • Income tax paid amounting to EUR 100,476 thousand (2017: EUR 86,613 thousand). Group Report 2018 231 After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as dividends) from such interests was EUR 105,544 thousand (2017: EUR 175,492 thousand). Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by EUR 1,967 thousand (2017: EUR 2,719 thousand) and current assets by EUR 69,195 thousand (2017: EUR 85,747 thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR – thousand (2017: EUR 2,248 thousand) and current liabilities by EUR 39,493 thousand (2017: EUR 38,298 thousand). Of the sale proceeds totaling EUR 15,396 thousand (2017: EUR 54,076 thousand), there was no amount settled in cash and cash equivalents as of the reporting date (2017: EUR 29,076 thousand). Dividends of EUR 217,184 thousand (2017: EUR 167,044 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the reporting year. Dividends paid to non-controlling interests totaled EUR 100,721 thousand (2017: EUR 93,808 thousand), of which EUR 81,133 thousand (2017: EUR 73,048 thousand) relates to the CIMIC Group.

New accounting pronouncements IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers If the 2018 Group Report had been prepared in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IAS 18 Revenues instead of in accordance with IFRS 15, this would have had the following impacts on the financial position and results of operations of the HOCHTIEF Group: • Equity would be EUR 984,387 thousand higher as of December 31, 2018 due to reversal of the restatements. For an analysis of the impact on the affected items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, please see the table on page 172 of the Group Report 2018. • The impacts on all items in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the reporting period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 would not have been material. Similarly, reversal of the aforementioned restatements for the reporting period would not have any further material impact on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018. 232 Group Report 2018 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) have issued new accounting pronouncements in the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2018 year and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from today’s accounting under IAS 17 and has no material impact on the Group. From a lessee perspective, at the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognize a liability to make lease payments (“lease liability”) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (“right-of-use asset”). Lessees will be required to separately recognize the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees will also be required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (such as a change in the lease term or lease payments). The amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability is recognized as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 using the full retrospective method, with the effect of initially applying this stand­ard recognized at the date of January 1, 2019. As a result, the Group will apply the requirements of IFRS 16 to the financial year ending December 31, 2019 and the comparative period presented. HOCHTIEF did apply the practical expedient not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application. It will apply the definition of a lease requirement only to contracts entered into (or changed) on or after the date of initial application. Based on the current assessment, the adoption of IFRS 16 will lead to an expected increase in lease liabilities of approximately EUR 800 million. The lease liabilities mainly relate to technical equipment and machinery as well as office leases. There will be a Consolidated Financial Statements corresponding but slightly smaller value of (long-term) right-of-use assets especially due to discounting effects. Operating lease expenses will continue to exist for short-term leases (up to 12 months) as well as for low-value assets. The remaining expenses for operating leases will be replaced by scheduled depreciation on the right-ofand Notes use assets and interest expenses for the lease liabilities. These changes will lead to an improved EBITDA but net operating profit will remain unchanged over the full lease term. Due to the changed disclosure of lease expenses for operating leases, cash flow from operating activities will increase and cash flow from financing activities will be correspondingly lower. Adjustments arising on application of IFRS 16 have no impact on cash and cash equivalents and HOCHTIEF’s net cash position. Group Report 2018 233 IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts This standard published by the IASB in May 2017 will supersede the current IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It provides for various approaches in accounting for insurance contracts. First-time application is expected for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022. EU endorsement is still pending. The implications of the new stand­ ard for the HOCHTIEF Group are currently still being analyzed. As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard in December 2017 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2015–2017). This involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The 2015–2017 cycle contains amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 12, and IAS 23. EU endorsement is expected for the first quarter of 2019. On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presen­ tation of the financial position or financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group. The remaining new pronouncements adopted by the IASB and the IFRS IC are not expected to have any major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group. Potential implications for the Consolidated Financial Statements are currently still being assessed and cannot be conclusively determined until transposed into European law: • Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement • Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures • Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Material • Amendments to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting: References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards • IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 39.

Essen, February 20, 2019 HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft The Executive Board Marcelino Fernández Verdes Peter Sassenfeld Consolidated Financial Statements José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka and Notes 242 Group Report 2018 Independent auditor‘s report To HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/ Germany Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report Audit opinions We have audited the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant ­accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, which was combined with management report of the Parent for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018. In accordance with the German national regulations, we have not audited the content of the consolidated statement on corporate governance pursuant to Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB), ­referred to in the section “Corporate Governance and Compliance” of the combined management report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, • the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018, and of its financial performance for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018, and • the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of the consolidated Konzernabschluss Consolidated Financial Statements statement on corporate governance referred to above. Pursuant to Section 322 (3) Sentence 1 German Commercial Code (HGB), we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined and Notes management report. Basis for the audit opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report in ­accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014; referred to subsequently as “EU Audit Regulation”) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for ­Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group companies in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) Point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have Group Report 2018 243 not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from January 1 to December 31, 2018. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 1. R  ecognition of revenue and recoverability of the receivables from customer-specific construction contracts, in particular the additional claims concerning the project Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures 2. Recoverability of goodwill 3. Valuation of the investment in Abertis HoldCo S.A. Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: a) Description of the fact (including reference to corresponding information within the consolidated financial statements) b) A  uditor’s response c) K  ey observations 1. R  ecognition of revenue and recoverability of the receivables from customer-specific construction contracts, in particular the additional claims concerning the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures” a) A material part of the business activity of HOCHTIEF Group refers to the handling of customer-specific construction contracts. These primarily relate to the classic construction business, construction project management and contract mining. Here, the rendered service, including the proportionate result, is disclosed under the revenue according to its degree of completion. The degree of completion is determined on each balance sheet date as ratio of rendered service to the entire service volume. Revenue is recognized as soon as management has assessed all of the respective relevant contract components, including – to the extent applicable in the single case – the following components: Consolidated Financial Statements • Determination of the degree of completion; • Estimation of the entire order performance and the total order costs including unforeseen cost rises; • Determination of contractual performance claims and assessment of the probability of the customer approval of variations and the acceptance of additional claims; and Notes • Estimation of the presumed date of completion. The construction contracts are disclosed under the trade receivables and/or trade payables. The components exceeding the contract price (additional claims and variations) may bear uncertainties with regard to their recognition and measurement. The recognition of the contract receivables is based on the executive directors’ assessments about the expected realizability of the amounts. In addition, discretionary powers arise when assessing the recoverability of outstanding receivables. 244 Group Report 2018 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The recognition of revenue and the recoverability of receivables from customer-specific construction contracts were classified by us as key audit matter since these are, on the one hand, complex facts that are strongly based on discretionary estimations and assessments of the Management and are, on the other hand, disclosed within the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018 with a material amount as additional claims. In November 2009, the group company CIMIC Group Limited (CIMIC), Sydney/Australia, and its business partners were selected by Chevron as preferred contractor for the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures”. The project was accepted on August 15, 2014. Significant contract modifications arose when realizing the project. The respective additional claims to the principal have been negotiated since 2015. In connection with the additional claims at the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures”, an amount of bAUD 1.15 (mEUR 712.1) was capitalized under the receivables within the statement of financial position at the end of the past financial year. Included therein are not only the additional claims but also the costs incurred in this context as well as interest (“total receivables”). The executive directors hold the opinion that CIMIC may claim these total receivables. In February 2016, CIMIC was initiating, together with its business partners, a private arbitration process according to the contractual rules to claim the open receivables from the principal Chevron. This process is still running and, since the contractual rules do not stipulate any time limit for a private arbitration process, the date of completion of these negotiations is not foreseeable at present. In addition to these private arbitration proceedings, CIMIC has initiated a litigation against Chevron within the U.S. in August 2016 to claim the amounts arisen from the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures” also by taking legal action. The information provided by the executive directors on the recognition of the revenue and recoverability of the ­receivables from customer-specific construction orders as well as on the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures”, are included in the section “Accounting and valuation principles” of the consolidated notes and in the section “Risks from projects, investments, litigations, authority proceedings and claims of third-parties” making part of the opportunity and risk reporting of the combined management report. b) O  ur audit procedures in particular comprised: • Recording of the material processes from project acceptance to project handling including the audit of the ­respective accounting-related controls, • Selection of a sample of projects – in parts for the inspection on-site in Germany and abroad – on the basis of a risk-orientated and random-based selection; material criteria here were in particular the project history, the amount of the order volume, the amount of recognized additional claims as well as the project result, • With regard to the projects selected as sample: Gaining of an understanding of the underlying contracts, audit of the incurred and forecasted costs by means of respective evidence, audit of the stricter requirements put on the Consolidated Financial Statements capitalization ability of additional claims and audit of the opening balance sheet values in this context, audit of the recoverability of additional claims, assessment of the risk of occurrence of penalized delays of the project progress as well as audit of the recoverability of outstanding receivables on the basis of the negotiation state as well as historical information, and Notes • With regard to the project “Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures”: Audit of the recoverability of the outstanding receivables through estimation of the probability and the date of receipt of payments on the basis of the ­negotiation state discussed with the executive directors as well as with internal and external jurists as well as historic information, c) The executive directors have determined the project-related degrees of completion required for the customer-­ specific construction contracts on the basis of detailed project calculations. When assessing the recoverability of additional claims, the executive directors have considered the project-related information gained from negotiations with the respective customers and discussions with internal or external jurists. Group Report 2018 245 2. Recoverability of goodwill a) The consolidated statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018 shows goodwill of bEUR 1.01 (i.e. 7.0% of the consolidated balance sheet total). Before, the executive directors have performed an impairment test. The realizable value is determined on the basis of a discounted-cash-flow model based on weighted capital cost. The impairment test is subject to a high estimation uncertainty in particular with regard to the applied discounting factors, the expected new projects and growth rates as well as the future cash flows. This estimation uncertainty goes hand in hand with a significant margin of discretion on part of the executive directors. In doing so, the recoverability of the goodwill disclosed within the consolidated statement of financial position was determined by us to be a key audit matter. The disclosures made by the executive directors with regard to the recoverability of the goodwill, disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position, are provided within the sections “intangible assets” and “Impairments” within the “Significant accounting policies” as well as within the section “Intangible assets” under the “explanations to the consolidated statement of financial position” in the consolidated notes. b) W  e performed the following audit procedures on the recoverability of the goodwill, disclosed within the consolidated statement of financial position, under involvement of experts from the Valuation Services segment. • Audit of the discounted cash flow model applied by the management of the respective division for the measurement of the realizable value, determined as value in use, of the goodwill, disclosed within the consolidated statement of financial position, including a critical assessment of the following assumptions: Discounting factor for the respective division; Forecast of the future cash flows of the respective division; Long-term growth rates. In doing so, we have validated single market-related assumptions with external data. • Sample-based audits of the arithmetic correctness of the discounted cash flow model used for the respective division, • Reconciliation with the plan figures of the divisions, • Assessment of the Group’s historic forecasts on the cash flows of single division with regard to their reliability (adherence to budget), • Performance of sensitivity analyses for material assumptions (e.g. as regards the revenue) for the respective division, Consolidated Financial Statements • Reconciliation of the market price used for the listed group company CIMIC with externally available data. c) T  he discounted future cash flows assigned to the goodwill of the respective cash-generating units considerably exceed the respective book values. The valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors and Notes are within the range of the industry-specific market expectations. 246 Group Report 2018 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 3. V  aluation of the investment in Abertis HoldCo S.A. a) The consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018 includes the investment in Abertis HoldCo S.A., Madrid/Spain, measured at equity with a book value of bEUR 1.47 (corresponding to 10.1% of the consolidated balance sheet total), which in turn indirectly participates with a share of 98.7% in the Spanish toll road operator Abertis Infraestructuras S.A., Madrid/ Spain (Abertis), that was acquired in the financial year. When using the at-equity method, the executive directors have considerable discretionary powers, in particular with regard to the purchase price allocation and here with regard to the assumptions to be taken, e.g. on the discounting rates, on the long-term growth rate and the future cash flows of the existing concessions under taking into account currency effects and synergies. For these reasons, we have classified the valuation of the investment as key audit matter. The disclosures of the executive directors on the equity method are included in the consolidated notes’ section “Financial assets measured at equity” and here in the sections “Accounting and valuation principles” as well as in “Explanations to the consolidated statement of financial position”. b) W  e have performed the following audit procedures on the investment in Abertis that is measured at equity: • Inspection and assessment of the set of agreements on the acquisition of the investment, • Audit of the acquisition cost in accordance with IAS 28 by means of adequate evidence, • Understanding of the preliminary expert opinion that was ordered by the executive directors on the purchase price allocation, including a critical assessment of the following assumptions: Discounting rates, Forecast of the future cash flows, Long-term growth rate. The critical assessment in particular included the sensitivity analysis of selected discounting rates as well as tax assumptions. • Understanding and assessment of the forward projection of the effects resulting from the purchase price allocation, under taking into account sensitivities • Audit of the result transfer by means of adequate evidence, c) T  he valuation parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors to account for the at equity investment in Abertis HoldCo S.A. as well as the effects on net profit are within the ranges usual in the market. Consolidated Financial Statements Other information The executive directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises: and Notes • the consolidated statement on corporate governance in accordance with Section 315d German Commercial Code (HGB) including a reference to section “Corporate Governance and Compliance” of the combined management report • the non-financial statement included in the combined financial and sustainability report in accordance with Sections 315b to 315c German Commercial Code (HGB), • the executive directors’ confirmation relating to the consolidated financial statements and to the combined management report pursuant to Section 297 (2) Sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) Sentence 5 German Commercial Code (HGB) respectively, and • the remaining parts of the combined financial and sustainability report, with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and combined management report and our auditor’s report. Group Report 2018 247 Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in so doing, to consider whether the other information • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or • otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board for the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the combined management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined manConsolidated Financial Statements agement report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of and Notes the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. 248 Group Report 2018 Konzernabschluss: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Auditor’s responsibility for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report. We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. • evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the executive directors. • conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the conConsolidated Financial Statements solidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. and Notes • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) German Commercial Code (HGB). Group Report 2018 249 • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions. • evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. • perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.

This responsibility of the Company’s executive directors includes the selection and application of appropriate methods for the sustainability reporting as well as making assumptions and estimates related to individual sustainability disclosures, which are reasonable in the circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability report that is free from material misstatements, whether intentional or unintentional.
