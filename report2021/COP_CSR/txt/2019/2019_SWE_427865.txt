After facing both challenges and strategic opportunities, we now look forward to harvesting the results of the work we have put in. 2018 was in many ways a year of consolidation for the expected rate, though with a strong finish of the ­Alimak Group. Amongst the financial highlights was year when it comes to order intake. a 13 per cent increase in order intake during the year while operationally, focus remained on the integration The Rental business area increased its fleet utilisation, of the acquired businesses. delivered above expectations on all parameters, and ended 2018 with a very strong backlog.

Construction Equipment faced an indecisive market In September, Tobias Lindquist officially joined the with projects in the pipeline that did not materialise at Group as CFO and member of the Group management A word from the CEO 3 Alimak Group, Annual Report 2018 After the acquisitions in 2017 it was clear that existing sustainability measurements would not be adequate or appropriate for the full, new Group and focus during 2018 has been to map the processes and maturity within the area of sustainability, align units and define what areas to spend more resources on. We then ­prioritised the establishment of tools and processes for ­measuring major KPIs selected as well as putting reporting routines in place to initiate follow-up and action on deviations. Alimak Group continues to be a signatory of the UN Global Compact and we reaffirm our support for the initiative’s Ten Principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. LOOKING AHEAD As I have stated in every quarterly report since the ­consolidation of the acquired businesses, the integration is running largely according to plan. 2019 will be another important year for the Group. We now wish to see further momentum from what we have executed on and put behind us. At the same time, we know that it will be tougher to get out savings at the same pace as before in some areas. At the end of 2018, it was ­evident that the low-hanging fruit is becoming scarcer as we pick them off, and as we move forward, further collaboration will be needed between procurement and R&D for the anticipated synergies to be realised. team which meant new energy and focus on the CFO Our Customers, Shareholders, Board of Directors, area and an increased ability for us to invest in both Management team and Employees are all vital to the people and tools. development of Alimak Group and I would like to thank all of you for your dedication, efforts and SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT achievements.

Operations 17 Alimak Group, Annual Report 2018 The Group in depth Alimak Group offers modern and cost-efficient vertical transport solutions for professional use in the premium and mid-market segments, targeted at both mature and emerging markets. The Group is active throughout the entire value chain and offers solutions with high levels of safety, quality and reliability. Safety, quality and reliability are important factors for all products and solutions sold under Alimak Group’s brands: Alimak, Avanti, CoxGomyl, Manntech and ­Alimak Service. The quality of products is one of the most important characteristics distinguishing the Group from its competitors and is the reason the Group has been a market leader ever since the start in 1948. THE NICHE AND OFFERING The Group has specialised in vertical access solutions for professional applications, using rack-and-pinion and traction-based technologies for elevator systems and platforms. The market is significantly smaller in size and technically more specialised than that of ­public lifts in residential and commercial areas. With the acquisition of Facade Access Group, the Group’s operations also include certain hydraulic technology. The global network provides rapid and efficient ­product support and service focusing primarily on the installed base. It is an important factor to the ­stability of the Group’s profitability and cash flow with a large part of the product’s life cycle revenue stemming from A Manntech BMU in operation at Central Market, Abu Dhabi, after-market services.

The US and Australia in particular maintained high momentum during the year. Demand from Central Europe, including the UK, remained solid, although there was a lack of new investments in ­solutions for large, complex projects compared to the ­previous year. In contrast, the Middle East, South America and South East Asia experienced slower demand ­following increased economical and political uncertainty. This led to the postponement of major construction projects, as a result of which growth was not achieved in either order intake or revenue. In autumn 2018, Alimak introduced a new t­ ransport platform, targeting the European market to ­comple­­ment the existing light platform portfolio with good initial demand from customers. Margin was strong due to favourable product mix, with an increased share of premium content being delivered. The growth strategy of the business area is to continue to grow faster than the market by strengthening its leading position in the high performance segments, further expansion into the mid-market segment and exploration of new markets through both direct sales and new distributors.

The Alimak Service brand was launched in September, an important milestone for future growth and a way to further elevate the customer experience. It will be used to promote After Sales, covering all product brands, and has been well received by customers. While orders and deliveries of high-margin spare parts and refurbishments were down in 2018, there has been increased activity in offshore due to the ­rising price of oil and the mobilisation of vessels for drilling and exploration. Growth in services for construction hoists and BMUs continues to provide good opportunities. Significant growth continues in Wind as new off-shore farms come on stream in Western Europe, with a high proportion sold with service agreements for maintenance and inspection. The focus for 2019 will be to continue driving revenue growth by capturing market share and bringing new innovative products and services to the market.

DEVELOPMENT IN 2018 All of the Group’s rental markets continued to develop strongly during 2018. The high demand resulted in increased fleet utilisation throughout the year, with improved operating profitability as a result. Investments were made, approximately in line with depreciation during the year, in replacing the ­platform fleet with the new mast climber and complementing the fleet with the first larger XL-hoists. The Group continues to revaluate its strategy for the business area and will continue to apply a restrictive approach to the expansion of the fleet. This will limit capacity for further growth in order intake as some markets are close to full utilisation. The business area ended 2018 with a full order backlog representing approximately a year’s revenue.

The Group classifies financial assets and liabilities measured at fair ­value in a fair value hierarchy based on the information used in the ­valuation of each asset and liability. Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities on an active market. Level 2 – Quoted prices on markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, ­information other than quoted prices that are observable directly or indirectly primarily for the ­instrument’s entire term and input data for valuation models obtained from observable market data. Level 3 – Information that is important for the asset’s or liability’s present value is not observable, unless the Group’s own assessments are applied. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by discounting the difference between the contracted forward rate and the forward rate that may be subscribed for on the balance sheet date for the remaining contract period. A risk-free interest rate based on government bonds is applied for discounting. Notes to the consolidated financial statements 94 Alimak Group, Annual Report 2018 Note 17 (cont.)
