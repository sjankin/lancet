Tariq Al-Amri be’ah, CEO 5 CEO's Message be'ah has been laying the foundation towards building a sustainable future. Towards this, be'ah has been working assiduously pursuing the company's strategic goals. The long-term objective being to create an infrastructure which is sustainable, transforming waste management and driving a conscious habit to nurture a sustainable future. One of the key agenda's in accordance with the company strategy was to partner with the private sector in providing waste management services in order to collaborate towards joint responsibility in conserving Oman's environment. In order to achieve this be' ah floated tenders during 2015 for the provision of waste management services and awarded operations tenders for some regions. In the backdrop of the economic downturn due to the fluctuating oil prices, be'ah had to extend its initial timeline while continuing to work towards its target in completing the infrastructure by mid-2017. Additionally, the company will also continue taking over the waste management sector as per the readiness of the infrastructure due to the importance of waste management and the need to provide higher level of service. be'ah had a successful year with its various accomplishments in 2015 with regard to sector development. Within the Municipal Waste Sector, be' ah completed the construction of a few engineered landfills, transfer stations and is currently in the final stages of completing others. Furthermore, the tenders to construct more engineered landfills and transfer station were floated and awarded within the same year. As for Hazardous Waste, be 'ah is working towards expediting the establishment of the treatment facilities, which will enable be 'ah in providing integrated services as per international environmental standards. The healthcare waste treatment facility in Thumrait will also be completed during the second quarter of 2016 where the company has already awarded the operations contract for 5 years to two companies for collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of healthcare waste. Tenders have been floated in accordance with the established plan to ensure that ability of Duqm Free Zone to handle and treat the current industrial waste generated from the area. Some of the other accomplishments includes the launch of its waste management services in two governorates. The completion of the expansion of the healthcare waste treatment facilities in AlMultaqa by installing an additional system; the Autoclave; which is the first of its kind in the Sultanate doubling the amount of treated waste from 5 tons a day to 10 tons a day. be'ah has set an ambitious target to reduce amount of waste going into landfills by diversion rate of 60% moving towards 80% by 2030. This strategy focused on supporting Oman s economy by providing no objection letters to the private sector initiatives for collecting and processing waste which can then by recycled such as construction and demolition waste (C&D), end of life tyres (ELT), lead acid batteries (LAB) and waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE). be 'ah has been collaborating with Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (MECA), to review the current laws and regulations for waste management and work towards establishing a new framework 6 of regulations for waste management as per the Government's vision for this sector. be'ah is also working towards setting up the Center of Excellence to utilize its expertise in waste management and become the pioneers with an integrated plan tackling all aspects of waste management in MENA region. This apart, be' ah reviewed and enhanced its main internal process and also carried out various clean up campaigns in North and South Al-Batinah Governorates and Dhofar. Additionally, be' ah has participated in various waste management conferences and endorsed OmanEco conference where 160 participants from different organizations participated. While building the infrastructure for a sustainable future, be' ah has been looking at ways to add incountry value. With regard to this, be 'ah has initiated various training programs to develop young Omani talent and also provide opportunities to local SMEs and investors. be 'ah faced extraordinary challenges due to financial constraints caused by declining oil prices which led the government to take measures to cut budgets across many sectors. However, the government has been extremely supportive and has been working in tandem to ensure plans move forward in spite of the challenging economic scenario. Owing to this, be' ah took certain measures without impacting its commitments toward sector take-over timelines and has been looking at innovative ways to stay on course towards building the integrated waste management system. Partnering with the government, private sector and citizens, be 'ah is committed to creating a waste management eco-system which will contribute to the nation, its people and serve as a benchmark in the region. 7 Executive Management 8 Location 9 About be’ah Oman Environmental Service Holding Company S.A.O.C (be’ah) was established in 2007. In 2009, a Royal Decree No. 46/2009 granted be’ah the mandate and the legal status as the entity responsible for solid waste management in Sultanate of Oman. Within this umbrella, be'ah works on moving towards sustainable waste management practices as per international standards by establishing the required infrastructure, restructure the municipal waste collection services, and improve public awareness of waste management. The National Strategy Report was developed to create one cohesive plan to address disparate solutions for various concerns which includes absence of policy and strategic master plan, a single responsible entity or an integrated waste management system, resources, and infrastructure. Inadequate data and records, laws and regulations, experienced workforce and lack of coordination among stakeholders were also a few reasons to formulate a National Strategy Report. The National Strategy Report Create an effective organizational structure and framework for waste management in Oman. ● Establish a holding company owned by the government with subsidiaries (Geographical). ● Implement the urgent recommended projects. ● Lay the foundation for an Integrated Waste Management System and the overall strategy with the frame time (Long & Short terms), budgets, tariffs, and required resources. ● Establish an independent National Authority to regulate Solid and Hazardous Waste. ● Establish a unified law for the sector (Regulatory Framework) with separate legislations including hazardous and non-hazardous waste. ● Implement an integrated Financial System for Solid waste Management and use this System for the tariffs. 10 Our vision “To Conserve the Environment of our Beautiful Oman for our Future Generations” 11 Our Mission We develop the Waste Management Sector in Oman by providing safe, efficient and most economically and environmentally sustainable services in innovative ways, thereby, contributing to the overall economy. 12 Corporate Values Safe Ensure minimal risk to the environment, service providers and the community. Innovative Harness new technologies and best practices for continuous improvement within the sector, associated industries and in the larger community. Efficient Identify, develop and implement optimal strategies and solutions in terms of effectiveness, cost and practicality. Sustainable Educate, enthuse and empower the sector, and society at large to reduce, reuse and recycle. 13 Cultural Values Honesty We believe in transparency.

These include 4 Core Strategic Goals: 1) Damage Control Current waste dumping practices in open dumpsites that result in continuous fires and which could harm the environment, and are a cause of regular complaints from the public, is of major concern to be’ah and as such controlling this damage is top priority for the company. Damage control involves building the basic required Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) infrastructure such as landfills and transfer stations as well as the infrastructure required for Hazardous Waste (HW) and Healthcare Waste (HCW). Once this infrastructure is in place old traditional dumpsites could be put out of service and planned for rehabilitation process. 15 2) Structure the Waste Management Services Once required infrastructure is in place, be’ah will start providing integrated municipal waste management services, governorate wise, which will include the collection, transportation and treatment of waste. be’ah aims to ensure high service level standards in providing these services and intends to outsource these services via experienced and specialized companies. Similar plans were put in place for hazardous waste and healthcare waste. In addition, be’ah developed a diversion strategy taking into mind the nature of waste produced in Oman and its sources. The diversion plan calls for recycling facilities for different waste streams and a major national project whereby MSW will be incinerated to generate energy and steam both of which will feed into a desalination plant that will generate substantial volumes of much needed sweetwater. 16 3) Develop the Waste Management Sector In order to raise the level of waste management services in the country and attract top international and local investors, the sector must be developed to be at par with other well developed sectors in the Sultanate such as the Oil & Gas, Banking, or the Telecom sector. In addition, a well-developed sector will be able to attract top talent resources that aspire to work for such sector. 4) Support Oman Economy Across its projects and operations, be'’ah is committed to support Oman’s economy by maximizing the in-country-value, whether it’s giving priority to experienced local contractors, offering investment opportunities to local investors and Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs), or creating job opportunities for Omanis. 17 Sustainability Legal Framework It is important to have a legislative framework that defines the collection, transportation, recovery and disposal of waste in order to build a sustainable integrated waste management ecosystem. These kind of legislations and directives ensure waste is recovered or disposed without endangering human health or the environment and permits, registration and regular inspections ensure that all adhere to the requirements. These legislations also ensure that appropriate steps are to be taken to prevent or reduce waste production, secondly recover waste by means of recycling or use waste as a source of energy. be'ah is collaborating with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (MECA) to review the current laws and regulations for waste management and is working towards establishing a new framework of regulations for waste management as per the Government's vision for this sector. Environmental Centre of Excellence be'ah believes that a robust waste management eco-system is intrinsically connected to protecting and preserving the environment. Committed to this belief, be' ah aims to establish an Environmental Centre of Excellence and position it as an industry-leader in the region. The Center will be dedicated to promoting research and development, innovation and knowledge-sharing pertaining to the environment and waste management in particular. In order to encourage a culture of fostering new ideas in these areas, the Centre will also include a training institute. Working closely with colleges and universities, the Research Council of Oman, MECA and other partners who share the same vision, the institute will become a knowledge Centre to develop the right practices towards creating a sustainable future. The plans and strategy to develop the Environmental Centre of Excellence has begun and it is envisaged to set a new benchmark in the region. 18 Projects Waste to Energy to Water Project: The waste to energy to water plant is designed to treat around 2,200 tonnes per day of MSW from the Muscat and South Al Batinah catchment area which otherwise will go to landfills and occupy the space. The plant will thermally treat the waste to generate steam which will turn a steam turbine to generate electricity. The generated electricity is used to run a desalination plant which will generate around 75 million cubic meter of potable waste per annum. The conventional fuel used for operating desalination plants in Oman is gas and production of water from thermal treatment of waste will help reduce Oman’s dependence on gas for water production. The saved gas can be exported and will be additional revenue for the Sultanate. Moreover, Oman has signed the Paris Agreement to reduce overall carbon emission from the country by 2030. The waste to energy to water plant will contribute significantly to Oman’s commitment and being the first of its kind concept, the plant will increase the country’s green reputation. Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) Project: MBT is a residual waste treatment process that involves both mechanical and biological treatment with the aim of reducing the environmental impact of landfilling residual waste. It combines a sorting facility with a form of biological treatment such as composting or anaerobic digestion. It stabilizes and separates waste which is not suited for recycling, extracts recyclable material and produces a Refuse Driven Fuel which is used for industrial applications. Biogas Project: The Biogas Project aims at producing biogas, a renewable energy source produced from raw materials such as agricultural waste, municipal waste, plant material, sewage, green waste or food waste. The breakdown of these organic matter in the absence of oxygen refers to a mixture of different gases which is Biogas. It is used as a fuel for any heating purpose, such as cooking. It can also be used in a gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat. 19 Community Outreach be’ah believes in reaching out to the larger community to build and contribute towards creating a waste management ecosystem that is collaborative. To achieve this, the first step is working hand in hand with local communities and partners by creating awareness that supports positive behavioral change and facilitate the implementation of the modern waste management hierarchy that emphasizes the three R’s; Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. be'ah is involved in varies type events such as clean up campaigns as part of “conserving our beautiful Oman” initiatives. Other event participations vary in terms of school visits, sponsorships or collaborations with other organizations. 20 21 Human Rights Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
