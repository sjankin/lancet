Finding our origin as a company that supported the modernization of Japan in the Meiji era through the development of a domestic papermaking industry, we are currently engaged in the Household and Industrial Materials business, centering on corrugated containers and household paper, as well as the Forest Resources and Environment Marketing business including pulp and electric power, and the Functional Materials business including thermal paper used for receipts, etc., in addition to the paper making business which accounts for about 20% of our sales. Looking ahead to 150 years and even further into the future, we will strive to be a business enterprise that achieves our management philosophy which is: “Creation of Innovative Value,” “Contribution to the Future and the World,” and “Harmony with Nature and Society.” Can you discuss the Oji In FY2017, consolidated net sales were up 3.2% year-on-year to ¥1,485.9 billion. Group’s business results in Operating profit, however, increased only 0.8% to ¥70.8 billion. Though the steep FY2017 and the outlook for rise in prices for raw materials and fuels in Japan was a cause of downward FY2018? pressure, particularly in the corrugated container and paper businesses, we were able to achieve a higher profit mainly as a result of higher pulp sales prices, cost reduction measures in each business, and other factors. Ordinary profit was ¥66.0 billion, an increase of 24.6% year-on-year, mainly due to a decline in foreign exchange losses, but profit attributable to owners of parent fell to ¥36.2 billion mainly due to a decrease in gains from the change in retirement scheme recorded in the prior fiscal year. In FY2018, a substantial increase in operating profit is expected. In addition to contributions from the pulp business, which is an area of focus for us, and steady progress in price adjustment of corrugated containers and other products, there will also be effects from cost reduction measures such as operational improvements at overseas businesses. As a result, we expect to achieve our medium-term management plan target of ¥100.0 billion in operating profit. Our projections for other indicators are ¥1,550.0 billion in net sales, ¥100.0 billion in ordinary profit, and ¥50.0 billion in net profit. OJI GROUP REPORT 2018 9 OJI GROUP REPORT 2018 Management Strategies FY2018 is the final year It is the final year of the medium-term management plan that we formulated in of the medium-term FY2015. Setting operating profit of ¥100.0 billion as a primary management management plan. What target, we have taken various measures to carry out our fundamental strategies: is your assessment of “Expansion of Overseas Businesses,” “Concentration and Advancement of progress so far? Domestic Businesses,” and “Enhancement of Financial Foundation.” Net Sales Operating Profit Ordinary Profit Profit Attributable to Owners of Parent (¥bil.) 1,550.0 (¥bil.) (¥bil.)

In the past three years in particular, we have focused on increasing the number of manufacturing sites, mainly of the packaging business, entering new business fields in Southeast Asia, and increasing both production capacity and efficiency at various sites. For example, the number of manufacturing sites of packaging products such as corrugated containers and folding cartons has increased from 24 at the end of FY2015, to 31, including sites under construction. In Malaysia, where we have accumulated successful results in the packaging field, we are working to reinforce the disposal diaper and label businesses. Meanwhile, in Indonesia where we have previously launched the disposable diaper business, we would now like to start a corrugated container business at an early stage. In Brazil, we are making investments to raise productivity and production capacity of our highly profitable pulp and thermal paper businesses so that the businesses can generate even greater profits to contribute to the Group. 10 Management Strategies Business Strategies Environment / Society Takeaways Governance Oji Group Information The target for the overseas sales ratio in FY2018 is 35%, but this figure is merely a waypoint as we look ahead to 50%. As I mentioned, we have focused on expanding overseas business, but the overseas sales ratio in FY2017 was 31.0% and the outlook for FY2018 is 32.4%. In order to achieve 35%, a large-scale M&A has to be implemented. Though any major change in the situation this fiscal year may be difficult, we will continuously look for projects in pursuit of the 50% target in the future. As the balance of interest-bearing debt steadily declines, we are now able to secure sufficient capital, and therefore, we intend to actively invest in large-scale projects if we were able to find appealing projects. Concentration/Advancement of Domestic Businesses While expanding business has been a major objective for our overseas business, our domestic business has promoted efforts focusing on securing profits rather than increasing sales. Optimizing the supply-demand balance of the paper business remains an issue, and we ceased operation of a printing paper machine with annual production capacity of 44,000 tons in FY2017 to reduce the scale of business. One business that has increased in size is the electric power business, which we began focusing on shortly before the start of the fiscal 2016–2018 medium-term management plan. The business has become a reliable source of earnings over the three years since the operation commencement of new biomass boilers and revamp of hydroelectric power facilities in various regions. In 2019, a joint venture biomass boiler project with Mitsubishi Paper Mills will start operating. We have engaged in an electric power and household paper joint venture with Mitsubishi Paper Mills, and in February 2018 we signed a capital alliance agreement to advance our capital and business alliance relationship even further. We will continue to secure profits through optimizing production structures and by searching for means of reducing costs, both independently and in collaboration with business partners. Enhancement of Fundamental Foundation Setting the balance of interest-bearing debt as one indicator of the Enhancement of Fundamental Foundation, we achieved the target early at the end of FY2016. Compared to our medium-term target of interest-bearing debt of ¥700.0 billion, we achieved ¥647.4 billion at the end of FY2017. These achievements were enabled by sales of shares held for strategic purposes and fixed assets such as company housing and idle land. Going forward, we are considering the new medium-term management plan. We will examine an optimal capital plan for the future taking into account the balance between strategic investment for expanding business and shareholder returns including dividend increases. OJI GROUP REPORT 2018 11 OJI GROUP REPORT 2018 Management Strategies What do you value as a I believe that it is the firm corporate fundamentals that are important when I wish corporate manager? for further growth and achievements of the Oji Group. Having manufacturing as our main businesses, a safe working environment for employees is a key requirement. It is necessary for the company to take responsibility for eliminating hazardous aspects of facilities and operations, and it is the responsibility of the top management to raise employee awareness if employees make light of safety. This also applies to environmental measures including compliance with environment regulations and preventing environmental accidents as well as how we address compliance. My position that “safety, the environment, and compliance” are the highest priority management issues remains unchanged. Human resource related matters are I believe that it is crucial to develop working environments where each individual can discussed starting on page 39. demonstrate their maximum capabilities, while also placing the absolute highest priority on human life and preventing occupational accidents. In the Oji Group, with diversified human resources both in Japan and overseas, the foundation of enhancing the corporate competitiveness can only be developed by each employee playing an active role in his/her work. 12 Management Strategies Business Strategies Environment / Society Takeaways Governance Oji Group Information Based on this idea, we have implemented a variety of initiatives to promote active participation of women and working style reforms As a result, we were selected for the highest level of “Eruboshi” certification, which is granted to companies that prioritize measures to promote women’s active participation, and we were also selected as a “Nadeshiko Brand” in 2017. While the scope of the assessment was Oji l. ’s d ivers ntia the head office regions including Oji Holdings, we plan to use these models to ity holds unlimited pote expand the initiatives throughout the Group and actively disclose the results to all stakeholders. Oji Group has numerous overseas sites in New Zealand, Malaysia, and other countries where active participation of women and ethnically diverse talent is even more prominent than in Japan. Therefore, we plan not only to expand initiatives from Japan to overseas sites, but also to actively incorporate points to be respected in each country we operate in. One of the key attributes of the Oji Group is its ownership of expansive forests. In Japan, the area of company-owned forests is 190,000 ha, which is equivalent to the area of Osaka Prefecture; and we own an additional 260,000 ha of overseas forest plantations. We use trees as a raw material in our papermaking business, and have long been responsibly nurturing forests so that they can be used. These forests cannot simply be held as they are. Appropriate management enables forests to steadily perform various functions such as trees absorbing carbon dioxide and Biei company-owned forest in Hokkaido soil regulating water volumes. Currently, overseas forest plantations are the main source for the supply of papermaking raw resources and majority of the trees used Forest management related matters are from overseas. However, we conduct business also in Japan based on the are discussed starting on page 30. idea of appropriately using trees that reached suitable harvesting age and nurturing new forests for future generations. Trees grown in Japan are used for construction materials and processed lumber products, and thinned woods are used for biomass fuels. By increasing higher value-added uses, we seek to maintain a good balance of business profit and loss. It is the responsibility of the Oji Group as an owner of forests to continue the cycle of harvesting and using properly managed and nurtured trees and planting new trees. Last, what is your message We will continue to conduct corporate activities that contribute to the future and to stakeholders? the world based on the belief that Oji Group’s sustainable growth will contribute to the development of the world. We are planning a two-yen dividend increase in the fiscal year ending March 2019 and aim to be a company that our shareholders find appealing. Our stakeholders have much to look forward to from Oji Group.

As a result, demand for plastic replacements is rising globally. While we have manufactured various types of base paper for food containers such as those for beverages and yogurt, etc. as well as containers and packaging paper used in fast food restaurants, the Packaging Promotion Center will play a central role in developing biodegradable plastics which can take the place of conventional plastics and also paper products with new functions, in the future. 1. Development of composites of biodegradable plastic and pulp Oji F-Tex is developing plastic pellets made from a combination of pulp with polylactic acid*, a biodegradable plastic. By combining plastic with pulp, the rigidity of molded products increases, heat resistance (temperature of thermal deformation) improves, and time required for injection molding can be reduced, leading to expectations for expanded application in molded products. * Polylactic acid is a plant-derived synthetic resin that can be recycled by composting. Plastic pellets Examples of molded items (Left: Polylactic acid only; right: polylactic acid combined with pulp) (Top: Polylactic acid only; bottom: polylactic acid combined with pulp) 2. Development of packaging material with barrier properties We developed a recyclable packaging material in order to replace packaging materials that have barrier properties and are made primarily from plastic with paper. The developed product is a multi-barrier paper that acts as a barrier against water vapor and oxygen. Compared to paper alone, the product provides barrier properties equivalent to those of general barrier film. Packaging materials with barrier properties 3. Development of paper cup products (traveler lids) and sample distribution of paper straw base paper Plastic lids for paper cups are the norm, so we developed a biodegradable paper lid made from recyclable pulp. This product has excellent water and thermal resistance and can be used to cover paper cups for both hot and cold products. Oji F-Tex has started providing samples of paper straw base paper suitable for manufacturing paper straws with functional water resistance produced by spiral processing.
