Declaration of ongoing support By signing the UN Global Compact on 25 November 2015, Defta made the commitment to comply with the ten founding principles grouped together in the following 4 fundamental topics:  Human rights;  Labour standards;  Environment;  Anti-corruption. During this third year, the Defta Group has continued to dedicate itself to promoting the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact within its organisation and among its stakeholders. Central to the Defta Group's strategic plan is its approach to corporate responsibility for the promotion of sustainable development. The entire community of men and women of the Defta Group is committed to implementing a series of clearly defined progress plans in order to ensure that its profitable growth is compatible with the promotion of social values and the quality of the environment. In order to promote the deployment of this strategy, the members of the board of directors and the group's central process coordinators have benefited from a programme to build awareness about sustainable purchasing, corporate social responsibility and the fight against corruption. This year, the group has established a code of conduct to guide all of its teams in the fight against corruption. By posting this third communication of progress online, we are reaffirming the commitment of the Defta Group to the Global Compact and we are dedicated to following the 10 founding principles. Chessy, 22 February 2019 Jean-Pierre KER RAULT Chairman Defta Group COP Page 3 of 31 2. Presentation of the group and its operations 2.1. History: A growing industrial group Founded in July 2007, DEFTA has expertise in the sectors related to the Découpe (cutting), Emboutissage (pressforming) of Fil (wires) and Tube (tubes) and the Assemblage (assembly process). It is this expertise that forms the initials of its name that enabled it to establish it factories near global car manufacturers. First in Europe (Spain France Slovakia Romania) then in Russia (Togliatti) and we are also present on the Asian continent in Korea. DEFTA is therefore pursuing its industrial strategy to support global car manufacturers. The group now employs 1,6001 people and generates a turnover of more than €200 m. Its critical size and recognised expertise in the areas of opening mechanisms, pressforming and cutting, have seen it acquire the status of a leading player in the automotive components sector. Chaired by Jean-Pierre Ker Rault, the group has become a local partner of multinational manufacturers thanks to its factories located in close proximity. Its strategic priority is to provide complete client satisfaction. DEFTA is also a strategic supplier to major industrial contractors such as Electrolux and Schneider Electric; In 2009, DEFTA bought the hinges division of WAGON AUTOMOTIVE, then in 2011 the French leader in gas springs, AIRAX. Assisted by the FAA (Fond Avenir Automobile) and by Naxicap Partner that provide it with the means to continue its growth, the Defta Group also designs products and mechanical systems and holds many patents in its areas of expertise. 1 including temporary personnel Defta Group COP Page 4 of 31 2.2.

Principle 1: Promoting and respecting the protection of international law pertaining to human rights The Defta Group complies with the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and particularly the conventions pertaining to the protection of workers and the prohibition of forced labour and child labour. The group helps to promote these principles by asking all of its suppliers to sign the Defta Supplier Guidelines. The guidelines formally document the commitments expected by the group in the area of ethics, anti-corruption, respect for human rights and labour standards, protection of the health and safety of people and the protection of the environment. Via its website, the group raises awareness about the principles of respect for human rights, most notably through its Defta supplier CSR charter. The Defta supplier charter has also been signed by the partners of Defta involved in the joint ventures in Russia, Korea and China. Defta Group COP Page 10 of 31 The signature of the Defta supplier charter forms an integral part of the group's buying procedures. In 2017, the group implemented performance indicators on the signed guidelines, including any exemptions to this charter and any related corrective measures. Defta Group COP Page 11 of 31 Over the last two years, this indicator showed marked progress, demonstrating the efforts made by the group to promote and raise awareness about the protection of human rights among its suppliers. Taux de signature de la charte fournisseurs 80% 75% 72% 69% 70% 63% 64% 61% 60% 50% 44% 40% 30% 22% 20% 10% 0% T1 17 T2 17 T3 17 T4 17 T1 18 T2 18 T3 18 T4 18 At the end of December 2018, the charter's signature rate reached 75% of open accounts payable, which represents 80% of purchases in volume. The Defta Group's medium term aim is to achieve a rate of 75% in the number of suppliers. This objective has already been achieved. The remaining 25% correspond to old suppliers with very low purchase volumes. 3.1.2. Principle 2: Ensuring they are not complicit in human rights abuses  Suppliers and partners The Defta supplier guidelines stipulate that any serious and deliberate infringement of the principles set out in the guidelines shall constitute a failure to comply with the contractual obligations and is liable, depending on the seriousness of the infringement, to entail the coercive measures set out in the contract, leading ultimately to the unconditional termination of the contract with costs payable by the supplier, without prejudice and without damages. A supplier can only reply to a quote request and consequently be included in the group's panel of suppliers if it signs and agrees to the supply guidelines Defta Group COP Page 12 of 31 It also stipulates that Defta may appoint internal or external auditors to check that the guidelines are being properly applied. During the 2018 calendar year, the Defta Group visited suppliers and partners representing 80% of its purchases to ensure that the provisions of the charter were being followed. In 2017, the rate was 70%. No human rights violations were identified during the audits conducted in 2018 and 2017. In 2018, a supplier audit schedule was drawn up and monitored in each of the group's factories during external supply committees. These audits were carried out with all the group's strategic or risk suppliers.  Product quality The Defta Group ensures that its products are designed and manufactured according to the highest standards of quality and qualification in order to minimise any human rights risks associated with its products. All Defta Group sites are certified in accordance with ISO 9001, ISO/TS 16949. The sites also know how to meet the specific requirements of clients such as VDA-6, QSB+, CQC/CCC, ASES, SAM, etc.  Safety in the workplace Committees have been set up in the different sites to identify the causes of the accidents and put together action plans to be implemented in order to minimise these risks. Defta Group COP Page 13 of 31 The group carries out monthly monitoring of the number of workplace accidents and their severity in each of its entities. Accidents de travail 2017 2018 Variation Nombre d'accident avec arrêt maladie 35 34 -2,86% Nombre d'accident sans arrêt maladie 43 41 -4,65% Nombre d'accident de trajet 3 3 Total 81 78 -3,70% Effectif moyen 1 113 1 214 9,07% % de l'effectif ayant subi un AT 7% 6% In 2018, the number of occupational accidents decreased by -4% with an average workforce increase of 9%.

Defta Group COP Page 14 of 31 3.2. International labour standards 3.2.1. Principle 3: Respecting the freedom of association and recognising the right to collective bargaining. Given its presence in France, Spain, Slovakia, Romania, Russia and Korea, which are member countries of the ILO, the group monitors compliance with the legislation applicable to the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining. In 2017, this commitment resulted in the implementation of a profit-sharing plan for Defta Services employees. 3.2.2. Principle 4: Contributing to the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour The Defta group functions in accordance with the law and does not use forced labour. In order to prevent forced labour from being used indirectly through our suppliers and sub-contractors, we ask them to commit to this principle by signing the supplier guidelines. Our guidelines explicitly stipulate that the supplier agrees not to used forced or compulsory labour, as it is defined in the C29 and C105 conventions of the ILO. The C29 Convention defines forced or compulsory labour as all works or services which are exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily. 3.2.3. Principle 5: Contributing to the effective abolition of child labour The Defta Group complies with the law pertaining to child labour in the countries in which it is present. In order to contribute to effectively abolishing child labour, we ask our suppliers, subcontractors and partners to sign our guidelines that stipulate the following: The supplier agrees to apply the provisions pertaining to the abolition of child labour and the protection of children and teenagers as defined by the conventions of the ILO. In particular, it agrees not to employ people under the minimum age required for working as stipulated in the C138 and C182 conventions of the ILO.

Principle 6: Contributing to the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation The Defta Group selects its employees based on their capacity to fulfil their role without distinction, exclusion or preference based on any other reason. The group's website publishes our HR policy and highlights in particular our desire to work to eliminate all cases of discrimination: Defta Group COP Page 16 of 31 The characteristics of the group's staff are as follows:  Staff by socio-professional category Effectif à périmètre constant fin déc. 2017 % 2018 % Variation Main d'œuvre directe 707 58% 681 56% -4% Main d'œuvre indirecte 342 28% 355 29% 4% Administratifs 168 14% 164 14% -2% Apprentis 6 0% 13 1% 117% Dont Stagiaires 2 0% 3 0% 50% Total 1 223 100% 1 213 100% -1%  Staff by location Effectif par entité à périmètre constant fin déc. 2017 % 2018 % Variation Defta Services 40 3% 38 3% -4% Defta Essômes 167 14% 161 13% -3% Defta Airax 123 10% 121 10% -2% Sous-total France 330 27% 321 26% -3% Espagne 111 9% 107 9% -4% Roumanie 528 43% 536 44% 1% Slovaquie 169 14% 160 13% -5% Russie 85 7% 90 7% 5% Total 1 223 100% 1 213 100% Defta Group COP Page 17 of 31  Average wage Salaire moyen 2017 2018 Variation Masse salariale en m€ 24 28 14% Effectif moyen 1 113 1 214 9% Salaire moyen en k€ 22,0 23,0 4% The average salary in the group increased by 4% between 2017 and 2018.  Breakdown of Defta Romania employees by age group  Breakdown of staff by gender Roumanie Effectif par CSP et par sexe au 31.12.2018 Homme Femme Total % femmes Main d'œuvre directe 348 138 486 28% Main d'œuvre indirecte 141 37 178 21% Administratifs 14 17 31 55% Total 503 192 695 28% Women are less represented than men in the workshops and particularly in direct labour. However, the proportion of women is slightly above average in the administrative workforce. Defta Group COP Page 18 of 31 All the group's board of directors include at least one woman.  Training The group invests significantly in the training of its teams. Training is one of the four pillars of the group's HR policy: The number of training hours increased considerably in 2018 but with a decreased budget of -20% between 2017 and 2018. Training therefore reached 51,482 hours in 2018, equal to 42 hours per employee and an average cost of €250 per employee, a decrease of -19%.

The proportion of fixed-term contracts therefore slightly decreased. Contrats à durée The proportion is high for direct 83% indéterminée labour (27% of the workforce), 84% particularly in Romania. Contrats à durée déterminée The group monitors the changes in staff levels with temporary contracts on a monthly basis in order to ensure that this proportion 17% 16% remains reasonable. 2017 2018 It cannot, however, arbitrarily limit the use of this type of contract given its need for temporary staff to fulfil occasional increases in its production plans. Defta Group COP Page 20 of 31 3.3. Environment 3.3.1. Principle 7: Supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges The Defta Group is committed to implementing a series of clearly defined progress plans in order to ensure that its profitable growth is compatible with the promotion of environmental quality. In this regard, the sites of Defta Essômes and Defta Airax in France and GIC Nosag Metal in Romania are ISO 14 001 certified. These entities cover more than 70% of the group's business. For your information, the ISO 14 001 standard is a framework that sets out rules for incorporating environmental concerns within the activities of an entity so that it can control the impacts on the environment and thereby reconcile the operational demands of the organisation with respect for the environment. It concerns the environmental aspects associated with the activities, products and services of the entity (interactions between the activities, products and services and the environmental components). This standard is internationally recognised. In order to comply with these requirements, an environmental management system must be implemented, including the following:  an environmental analysis that can be used to draw up an inventory of the activities, the regulations that apply to the latter and the environmental impacts that they entail;  an environmental policy that is made up of a commitment to continuously improve and prevent pollution, to comply with the law and the applicable environmental regulations and the other requirements to which the organisation is committed;  the organisational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures, processes and resources for developing, implementing, completing, reviewing and maintaining the company's environment policy. The implementation of an environmental management system in accordance with the reference document of the ISO 14 001 standard is based on a determined approach to enable the following:  better understanding the environmental impacts generated by the organisation's activities;  ensuring that the regulations are respected and being in a position to anticipate future changes to the latter;  being in a position to improve practices in keeping with the continuous improvement principle aimed at reducing environmental impacts. The environmental management system plays a direct role in integrating sustainable development principles within the company's operations. The certification, in accordance with the ISO 14 001 standard, of an environmental management system is obtained following an audit carried out by an independent approved body. In order to maintain the certification over time, the system's compliance Defta Group COP Page 21 of 31 with the standard must undergo regular verifications and the certification must be renewed (every 3 years) by an independent body. 3.3.2. Principle 8: Undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility In order to monitor their impact on the environment, the different sites of the group have set up indicators to identify the action plans and measures needed to reduce the negative consequences of their activity on the environment and measure their effectiveness. The indicators of each of the sites have not yet been standardised and cannot therefore be used to monitor the performance of the entire group using consolidated figures. Given this situation, the Defta Group decided to set up a specific reporting system containing the relevant environmental indicators and to set overall medium-term objectives for each of the relevant indicators that will be monitored. A first quarterly indicator (KwH ratio consumed per productive m2) was monitored during 2017. Since 2017, the group's actions have focused on the following points:  Reduction of electricity consumption by implementing machine stops  Reduction of oil consumption by better controlling production parameters  Reduced carbon impact by promoting carpooling and cycling. Below is a list of the monitored indicators and some of the actions implemented by Defta Essômes, Defta Airax and GIC Nosag Metal (Romania) to illustrate the initiatives taken by the group to promote greater responsibility in relation to the environment. Defta Essômes  Greenhouse gas emissions In 2018, Defta Essômes carried out an assessment of its greenhouse gas emissions to identify the main sources of emissions and be able to draw up action plans to be implemented to reduce these emissions. Defta Group COP Page 22 of 31 The results of this carbon assessment were as follows: Defta Essômes Emissions directes de GES (TeCO2) 2018 % Matière première Acier 579 44% Fret transport routier 301 23% Electricité consommée 289 22% Gaz naturel consommé 136 10% GPL chariot 14 1% Gaz de soudure Argon + 7 1% Total 1 326 100% Defta Essômes Emissions directes de GES 1% 0% 10% Matière première Acier 44% Fret transport routier 22% Electricité consommée Gaz naturel consommé 23% GPL chariot Gaz de soudure Argon + The main indicators monitored by Defta Essômes are as follows:  Electrical consumption per part The company has set itself the medium-term objective of attaining a consumption of 35Wh per part produced. This objective was not only reached but exceeded in 2017 and 2018: Defta Essômes 2016 2017 2018 Variation Consommation en KwH 3 099 344 3 049 181 3 212 376 5,4% Nombre de pièces produites 83 635 085 92 985 521 96 522 382 3,8% wH par pièce 37,06 32,79 33,28 1,5% Defta Group COP Page 23 of 31 The objective of reducing electricity consumption has been achieved thanks to several actions such as:  Investing in a variable-flow compressor that tailors the flow to the needs of the workshop  Installing motion-sensor systems that regulate the lighting in the administrative building  Communicating best practices for reducing electrical consumption (switching off machines, lights, etc.)  Gas consumption The consumption of gas is monitored and analysed on a monthly basis. The consumption observed in 2018 fell slightly compared to 2017: Defta Essômes 2016 2017 2018 Variation Consommation de gaz en KwH 2 968 736 3 886 339 3 677 593 -5,4% Defta Group COP Page 24 of 31 Consommation mensuelle de gaz en Kwh 1400000 1200000 1000000 800000 2016 600000 2017 400000 2018 200000 0  Oil consumption 2018 Suivi consommation huiles par secteur en litre /pièce 0,00140 0,00120 0,00100 0,00080 0,00060 0,00040 0,00020 0,00000 D FIN TOLE Obj d fin obj toles Linéaire (D FIN) Linéaire (TOLE) Defta Essomes gave itself the objective of reducing its oil consumption to 0.5ml per press stroke by 2020.

In 2018, the recycling rate achieved was below the target (33 compared to 39). Defta Group COP Page 27 of 31 The results recorded for water consumption per employee are very encouraging with an objective largely achieved (0.81 compared with a target of 1.2). The same is true for gas consumption, which averaged 2.32 in 2018 compared with a target of 3.33. Defta Group COP Page 28 of 31 3.3.3. Principle 9: Encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. The Defta Group seeks technological solutions to reduce the negative impact of its activities on the environment. For example, Defta Airax launched an ambitious project to prevent exposure to chemical products in its chrome-plating and QPQ workshops. The objective is to find a substitute to Cr VI. The feasibility studies have been completed. The shutdown of the chromeplating chain took effect at the end of 2016 and the process for substituting it with gas nitriding is in place. The new nitriding workshop will significantly reduce the environmental impact of Defta Airax. Furthermore, the group's buying guidance letter sets out the guidelines of the buying policy for the next three years, which includes encouraging innovation and sustainable development by minimising environmental impacts. Defta Group COP Page 29 of 31 Whether it relates to the product or the manufacturing process, technical, environmental or economic advances, Defta teams have an insatiable appetite for innovation and continuous improvement. Many of these innovations, both with and without patents, have now come to fruition:  Over-moulding of strike plate  Pedestrian impact lock  Commercial vehicle hinge  Lumbar adjustment on backrest cover  Automation and standardization of assembly methods: for large production lines, DEFTA designs and builds fully automatic assembly units. These units can be identically replicated across different sites, closer to the geographic need of customers, with the same performance and cost criteria.  Taking into account the working conditions (safety, ergonomics, prevention of RSI, etc.) and quality in the optimisation of production methods benefits all employees whichever site they work on 3.4. Anti-corruption 3.4.1. Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The Defta group complies with the regulations, including those that pertain to anti-corruption laws. This commitment is communicated to the suppliers and sub-contractors through the supply guidelines in particular. The group also makes regular commitments to its clients by adopting their codes of conduct, e.g. signature of the U-Shin Code of Ethic. The group's buying manager also signed the code of conduct of the Syndicat des Fabricants d’Equipements et de Pièces Automobiles (union of automotive components and parts manufacturers). The group had an objective to formalize its commitment to the fight against corruption. This was made formal when it required all group members to sign an anti-corruption code in March 2017.
