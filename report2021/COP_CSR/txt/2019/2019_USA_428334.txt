The conversion of degraded land into certified bamboo plantations is coupled with innovative technology development to provide bamboo based solutions for products and markets that currently contribute to the deforestation of our world’s natural forests. Mission To disrupt currently unsustainable industries by providing tree-free, deforestation-free seed to sale products that have the power to replace single use products in a manner that is environmentally, socially and financially lucrative. Vision We envision a world where millions of hectares of degraded land are restored into productive bamboo forests providing the raw resource to meet growing demand for consumer products, generating competitive and sustainable financial returns, while regenerating rural economies through the provision of secure and stable livelihoods, and reducing the deforestation pressure on our world’s remaining natural forests. Triple Bottom Line Philosophy EcoPlanet Bamboo is dedicated to creating triple FINANCIAL bottom line returns – economic, social, and environmental – through our bamboo plantations globally. Using strict land use criteria, our operations focus on the restoration of severely degraded land IAL ENVIR SOC where deforestation continues to create negative land ON use change. Our plantations are located in some of the world’s most remote areas with unprecedented levels NTAL of poverty, representing a high potential for positively ME impacting social change. 3 EcoPlanet Bamboo’s Global Operations EcoPlanet Bamboo has developed a globally strategic and sustainably managed resource base of alternative fiber. Bamboo, combined with innovative technology can provide a truly sustainable alternative for such products, from toilet paper to packaging. As a result, EcoPlanet Bamboo is poised to disrupt some of the largest industries globally. EcoPlanet Bamboo Central America EcoPlanet Bamboo Central America represents the first project globally to grow tropical clumping bamboo at commercial scale. More than 3,500 hectares of planting occurred with full integration into existing landscapes and the maintenance of native vegetation and remnant forest patches. The bamboo plantation operations have created long term and permanent jobs for more than 350 unskilled positions, as well as training of additional team members into highly skilled positions. This project is validated and verified for the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) for successful contribution to fighting global climate change. EcoPlanet Bamboo West Africa EcoPlanet Bamboo West Africa represents a Public Private Partnership with the Government of Ghana through the Ghana Forestry Commission targeting the industrialization of bamboo for the country’s timber and fiber needs. The project is in the planting stages, with an initial 1,000 hectares planted in the first year of operation. This project created more than 600 jobs during its first years of operation. The remaining 5,000 hectares will be planted from 2020. EcoPlanet Bamboo West Africa is currently developing manufacturing plans to serve pulp and paper, engineered timber, textile and bio-energy markets. As part of this development, EcoPlanet Bamboo sits on the Ghana Forest Investment Forum and the Ghana Land Neutrality Working Group. EcoPlanet Bamboo Southern Africa EcoPlanet Bamboo South Africa represents the African continent’s first successful commercial bamboo plantation. It is a showcase plantation of approximately 485 hectares that utilizes extremely degraded ex agricultural land and is the first large-scale tissue culture operation globally. Careful site species selection has been carried out to 4 secure suitable planting material and to date the plantation is fully planted with the first plantings approaching maturity. The bamboo grown on this plantation is sustainably certified. EcoPlanet Core Carbon manages a fully operational processing facility for a range of carbonized products located on site at the South African plantations. EcoPlanet is currently expanding this operation in conjunction with various Government institutions, to maximize the potential of bamboo as a source of industrialization for South Africa’s Eastern Cape. EcoPlanet Bamboo East Africa (Current Expansion) In 2017, EcoPlanet Bamboo, contracted by IUCN, conducted a Feasibility Assessment for the Development of a Bamboo Bio-Economy in Rwanda for the Rwanda Water and Forestry Authority. Through in-country research, analysis and field work looking at the socio-political environment in Rwanda, supply chains for key product sectors including pulp and paper and engineered timber and quantification of existing bamboo resources in Rwanda, this study concluded a robust argument in favor of the development of a Bamboo Bio-Economy. EcoPlanet Bamboo in conjunction with the Government of Rwanda and IUCN is currently working on the development of a Bamboo Bio-Economy in Rwanda, allowing EcoPlanet Bamboo to expand bamboo reforestation projects, which focus on riparian protection for improved water quality, and develop green industrial manufacturing for the bamboo resource in to pulp and paper, engineered timber and green charcoal. Thereby, EcoPlanet Bamboo is able to commercialize bamboo by providing long-term markets for raw bamboo that creates a secure value chain and income for farmers. 5 Area 1: Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. EcoPlanet Bamboo remains committed to upholding the human rights of all involved, both directly and indirectly, in our operations. We fully support the Universal Declarations of Human Rights and the principles of this declaration form the foundation of our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) procedures. EcoPlanet Bamboo has an adaptive management policy and continues to enhance its policies and procedures as needed to incorporate the Global Compact. Implementation EcoPlanet Bamboo has an integrated management system that includes EHS procedures, which form the minimum requirements that all operations must comply with to ensure that our strict social and environmental policies are carried out. Our EHS procedures are in line with both the IFC’s Performance Standards as well as the Forest Stewardship Council requirements and ensure comprehensive measures are taken to prevent human rights violations: • There is a documented grievance procedure that mandates all staff and stakeholders have the ability to raise complaints and that any complaint, grievance or dispute must be dealt with swiftly and in line with company culture. The policy includes the use of suggestion boxes, representatives and emails / phone calls as a means for complaints to be received by the company. This procedure is reviewed with staff and signs posted in accessible locations. • Regular stakeholder communications and consultations take place to convey company objectives and policies as well as give stakeholders a chance to raise questions or concerns. Minutes of these meetings are on file. • Whether certified or not, EcoPlanet Bamboo requires all operations to comply with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) principles and criteria, which find violation of human rights unacceptable. FSC also require compliance with international conventions. • Human Resource policies clearly state that EcoPlanet Bamboo is an equal opportunity employer. Procedures are provided to ensure non-discriminatory, fair labor practices as well as safe working environments. • Suppliers and contractors are also required to comply with the company’s EHS procedures. Non-compliance would mean termination of the relationship. Measurement of Outcomes General Managers are responsible for ensuring their operations comply with all EcoPlanet Bamboo EHS Procedures and thus Human Right Standards, which are verified through external audits as well as reviewed by the corporate office. There were no incidents of human rights related grievances or violations during the reporting period. 6 Area 2: Labor Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: The effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. All EcoPlanet Bamboo operations comply with the strictest labor and heath & safety standards, including compliance with the ILO. All operations must comply with local legislation but if international standards are stricter then international standards will be assumed. Labor rights include: • Freedom of Association • Collective Bargaining • Zero-Tolerance of Forced Labor or Child Labor • Elimination of Employment Discrimination EcoPlanet Bamboo has in place EHS procedures as well as a Social Impact Policy, see appendix A, which make labor rights a fundamental part of its operations. All staff receive contracts with their rights and responsibilities and their compensation and benefits clearly stated. Management also partake in regular assessments of health & safety risks and EcoPlanet Bamboo is dedicated to continuing to innovate new methods and standards for safety. Implementation All staff undertake an induction during their first days of employment and annually thereafter. The national and international labor legislation is transparently explained to staff. They also receive job-specific training, which focuses on safe procedures to effectively carryout their tasks. All inductions and trainings are recorded and placed in staff human resource files. Staff also have mechanisms to report to supervisors, managers or anonymously of any labor concerns or health & safety issues they may have. Staff have elected representatives who share concerns on behalf of a fellow employees. All issues are dealt with by management and recorded and filed. There are additional appeal procedures should the outcome not satisfy the complainant. Managers are required to regularly review health & safety risks. Should an incident occur, they are recorded, reported to the corporate office and mitigation measures taken to ensure a similar accident does not happen again. All operations have Human Resource policies, which comply with EcoPlanet Bamboo EHS procedures as well as country specific and ILO requirements. These policies are 7 freely available to employees and were established with local human resource professionals to ensure they are legally compliant with local laws. Systems are put in place to ensure accurate accounting for payroll and staff productivity. EcoPlanet Bamboo also continues to work with technology partners to utilize and enhance digital tools for operational management. These tools transfer skills and capacity building as these employees from rural communities learn to use digital technologies. Measurement of Outcomes EcoPlanet Bamboo staff are better informed of their rights then most laborers in the areas of our operations. Whether they are temporary or permanent staff, they all receive the same level of induction and thus labor rights training. EcoPlanet Bamboo has found this knowledge serves them later in their careers and empowers them to stand up for their rights. Plantations that undergo certification audits are reviewed for compliance of worker’s rights, which includes compliance with ILO conventions, interviews with the workers and review of human resource documents and staff contracts. EcoPlanet Bamboo plantations were audited with positive results as recently as 2018, upholding their certifications. EcoPlanet Bamboo corporate office also regularly reviews in-country operations to ensure compliance. Any non-compliance would mean issuance with a corrective action request to be corrected within 4 weeks. EcoPlanet Bamboo has hundreds of employees worldwide and aims to have 25% of its workforce as women, including in managerial positions. EcoPlanet Bamboo currently has 50% women in managerial positions. EcoPlanet Bamboo also aims to employ locally with 98% local staff and the remaining specialist expats who focus on skills development. EcoPlanet Bamboo currently has 1 expat permanently posted in its operations worldwide. 8 Highlighting Job Creation EcoPlanet Bamboo’s operations work closely with local communities, with social impact focused on the creation of stable, attractive and long-term employment opportunities, providing families and communities the security and ability to invest in their own development. EcoPlanet’s West African operations will ultimately provide more than 1,000 permanent jobs for men and women currently living on <$2 / day. Nana Akuoko Sarpong, the Paramount Chief of the Agogo Traditional Area highlights that employment is the most critical need of his people, “since EcoPlanet Bamboo West Africa entered the area we have already started to see the positive impact of the project on the surrounding villages. With further training and development, I believe that the area will soon be developed into a flourishing bio-economy”. Watch a short documentary on EcoPlanet’s operations in Ghana: “Transforming Communities, Landscapes & Industry” 9 Area 3: Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. EcoPlanet Bamboo is committed to utilizing only degraded land and its framework of sustainability for the development of commercial bamboo plantations. From its inception, EcoPlanet Bamboo has held strong environmental principles that are weaved into everyday operations. All stakeholder, managers and staff are aware and regularly trained on the company’s environmental policy and EHS procedures, with the aim to foster stewards of the environment. See Appendix B for the Environmental Policy. Implementation EcoPlanet Bamboo’s decision to plant bamboo was largely due to its green credentials. When bamboo is planted on degraded land and managed under EcoPlanet Bamboo’s framework of sustainability, its benefits are vast and include: • It grows rapidly and, if managed properly, this rapid growth makes it the most sustainable form of biomass on the planet. • Its extensive root system breaks up compacted soils. • Certain species can grow in depleted soils with their heavy leaf fall creating dense layers of organic humus and restoring degraded soils. • It contributes to climate change mitigation, removing up to 800 tons of CO2 / hectare / year. EcoPlanet Bamboo’s Central American plantations have been validated and verified under the VSC through methodologies to monitor, quantify and report on the sequestration and storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide by bamboo. EcoPlanet Bamboo’s EHS procedures provide operations with guidelines for natural resource management and reporting. This includes illegal activity monitoring (i.e. hunting, unauthorized harvesting), destruction of natural forests, waste and operation specific impacts. It also provides guidelines for best practice environmental management. During the due diligence phase of projects, environmental impact assessments are carried out and mitigation measures identified. These impacts are regularly monitored and reported on. EcoPlanet Bamboo is further expanding its positive environmental impact through the addition of green manufacturing operations. In South Africa, a fully operational manufacturing facility is producing carbonized products. Additionally, various expansions are underway for the production of pulp and paper from bamboo. These operations help provide a sustainable alternative for products representing major drivers of unsustainable forest use and waste production globally. 10 Measurement of Outcomes EcoPlanet Bamboo has a total reforested area of over 10,000 acres of bamboo and established its initial green manufacturing facility with further expansion upcoming. EcoPlanet Bamboo is working on improving environmental education and bamboo awareness. At the plantation level, EcoPlanet Bamboo continues to hold environmental awareness activities and trainings with staff and stakeholders. It is also working internationally to raise awareness and mold a sustainable platform for the bamboo industry. For instance, EcoPlanet Bamboo CEO and Earth Day Network board member, Troy Wiseman was a keynote speaker at the World Bamboo Day Congress in 2018. EcoPlanet Bamboo is active in international policy with Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Co-Founder, Camille Rebelo, continuing to represent the private sector on the Global Restoration Council. The Council aims to harness the collective wisdom, influence and energy of its members to catalyze and sustain a global movement for restoration. In 2018, Camille was a private sector representative at the Food & Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) along with the Collaborative Partnership on Forests’ multi-sector conference on Halting Deforestation and Increasing Forest Area From Aspiration to Action in Rome. Here, she participated in a panel moderated by the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) and entitled Sustainable commodities and value chains: Forest products value chains in the bioeconomy . EcoPlanet Bamboo’s operations have been established on degraded lands from degraded forests to degraded agricultural land to vulnerable riparian areas. Compacted and nutrient depleted soils are common at establishment. Many sites were once forested but turned into remnant forest patches due to unsustainable human activities. The planting of bamboo has once again returned the forest canopy. See before and after image below. Due to bamboo’s selective harvesting of certain culms per clump, the canopy is permanent once established, creating a sustainable forest habitat and increasing biodiversity. It’s extensive root system also helps bind vulnerable soils, reducing soil erosion. 11 Area 4: Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. EcoPlanet Bamboo has a zero-tolerance policy for corruption. The policy states that “EcoPlanet Bamboo is a transparent and morally sound company. Bribery, extortion, fraud, collusion and any other corrupt behaviors are prohibited in any operation conducted by the company or any individual within the company.” The full policy can be found in Appendix C. Implementation All operations are required to post the signed policy in accessible locations for staff and visitors to see. The staff induction process includes a review of all EcoPlanet Bamboo policies, including the Anti-Corruption Policy. Staff must sign the induction record, which is placed in their Human Resource files. Staff, visitors and stakeholders are made aware of the company’s grievance procedure through inductions, stakeholder events as well as signs and leaflets. Any concerns about corrupt behavior can be reported through these channels and are dealt with swiftly. Whistleblowers are protected. The company is committed to full compliance with the laws of the countries in which it operates. Extensive research on the legal requirements of an area of operations is conducted during our due diligence phase. Permits and licensing are then carried out and all necessary approvals filed. This compliance continues into the operational phases with annual review of legislation changes. Any changes are recorded and necessary action taken to ensure compliance. These actions greatly reduce the risk of corrupt behavior and ensures managers understand the laws under which they must lawfully operate. Measurement of Outcomes In-country operations are monitored for compliance by the corporate office as well as by external auditors. EcoPlanet Bamboo’s integrated management systems require all operations to regularly report on operational and financial information, which provides sound checks and balances. This data is translated to tables and graphs, which allow managers as well as the COO and CEO to see any potential irregularities. There have been no complaints reported during this period. Furthermore, EcoPlanet Bamboo has not been involved in any legal cases, rulings or other events related to corruption or bribery. 12 Appendix A: Social Policy ECOPLANET)BAMBOO)GROUP) ) SOCIAL)IMPACT)POLICY) ) EcoPlanet* Bamboo* aims* to* catalyze* positive* socio4economic* development* in* the* Company’s* areas*of*operations.*EcoPlanet*Bamboo’s*mission*is*to*show*that*business,*through*the*concept* of*conscious*capitalism,*can,*both*directly*and*indirectly*have*long*term*social*impact.* * To*achieve*this*EcoPlanet*Bamboo*is*committed*to:* * • Develop*bamboo*plantations*and*associated*manufacturing*operations*in*rural*areas*that* suffer*from*high*unemployment*with*few*opportunities*for*economic*development.* * • Carry*out*socio4economic*baseline*studies*in*order*to*identify*the*current*status*of*key* development*variables,*and*enable*the*quantification*and*monitoring*of*such*variables* over*time.* * • Achieve*Forest*Stewardship*Council*certification*for*the*external*verification*of*such* impact.* * • Commit* to* preferentially* hire* local* residents* from* the* communities* and* municipalities* closest*to*each*Company*site*of*operation.** * • Commit* to* ensuring* that* equal* opportunity* exists* for* employment,* regardless* of* gender,* religion,*physical/mentally*disabled,*or*political*inclination.* * • Commit*to*empowering*women*in*all*operations*through*the*provision*of*equal* opportunities.* * • Ensure*that*all*laborers*are*paid*through*legitimate*sources,*thereby*ensuring*each* individual*is*recognized*by*local*and*central*governments,*and*therefore*eligible*for*social* security*(if*applicable).* * • Provide*training*and*education*opportunities*for*all*employees*and*ensure*that*promotion* opportunities*exist*for*qualified*individuals.* * • Apply*Company*procedures*for*all*employees*and*stakeholders*to*express*views,*concerns* or*issues.*All*such*issues*raised*will*be*dealt*with*by*the*Company*on*a*case*by*case*basis* until*resolved*satisfactorily.* * * Troy*Wiseman,*CEO www.ecoplanetbamboo.com Main Office: 303 E.
