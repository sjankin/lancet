On the road, many of our delivery trucks proudly displayed Indigenous artwork and celebrations were held around Australia. We also marked Reconciliation Week, from 27 May – 3 June 2019, by hosting events, breakfasts and morning teas and providing an opportunity for our people to come together and reflect on the significant milestones in the reconciliation journey. We support the Indigenous Reading Project, which aims to improve the reading ability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students through their E-Reading project. Tablets and e-books are provided to children to encourage them to read and measure their progress. Our support of this project in 2018 included packing and delivering 150 parcels, delivered to 51 school communities across Australia.

This network is for everyone, LGBTI+ employees and allies. We have recently established state-based PostPride teams to ensure we support our people across the country, including facilitating connections to reach out to our regional teammates. We supported a diverse program of activities during the year, including pride marches in Melbourne, Sydney, Geelong and Perth; sponsoring the Midsumma and Australia Post Art Prize; and OUR PEOPLE launching the Rainbow Peer support group. Gender balance We measure pay parity with reference to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) guidance by aggregating and comparing annualised full time equivalent base salaries for male and female permanent and fixed term employees. We define gender pay parity as within a +/-2 per cent band. In recent years, however, we have noticed an increase in the number of women leaving our workforce, particularly in operational areas, so we have developed a Women@Post strategy to improve how we attract, grow and retain our female employees.

After several years of very strong growth in our international parcel volumes, our total international volumes declined by 21.4 per cent in 2018/19 due to the impact of a range of factors, including the fall in the value of the Australian Dollar; the introduction of the GST on imported low-value goods; and an increase in the price of untracked packets in China. Despite these challenges, overall international revenue declined only 2.3 per cent on last year, due to price increases on inbound untracked packets and upselling on outbound products. 33 OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR COMMUNITIES FASTER DELIVERY PROVIDES COMPETITIVE EDGE Fashion makes up more than a quarter of online Anna Lee, THE ICONIC Chief Operating Officer purchases and the category is continuing to grow, said “At THE ICONIC, we have been on a mission with double-digit growth in 2018 for the seventh to redefine the future of retail by providing consecutive year. the most seamless and inspiring shopping experience possible.

Changes to remuneration for FY20 REMUNERATION REPORT The approach to remuneration in FY20 will follow similar principles to FY19. Additionally, two gateways for eligibility for Australia Post Corporate Incentive Plan (APCIP) will be introduced. 1. Incentives will only be paid to the Australia Post Corporate Incentive Plan (APCIP) population if a Profit Before Tax (PBT) of greater that 1 cent is made. 2. If the PBT stretch is not achieved but a PBT of greater than or equal to 1 cent is made then only target incentives will be paid against each KPI, no stretch incentives. Australia Post Corporate Incentive Plan (APCIP) continues to have minimum expectations set, aligned to Australia Post’s values and behaviours. These will remain the same as FY19 and will require participants to meet the following minimum expectations:  living our values and meeting minimum behaviour expectations;  meeting Our Ethics;  completion of all relevant compliance training; and  minimum performance rating of at least 3 (or a minimum performance rating of 2 for new starters or new to role employees). 83 Financial and statutory reports Contents Signed reports Statement by Directors, Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer 85 Annual performance statement 86 Financial statement audit report 88 Financial statements Consolidated statement of comprehensive income 92 Consolidated balance sheet 93 Consolidated statement of changes in equity 94 Consolidated statement of cash flows 95 Notes to the financial statements About the financial statements 96 Our business A1 Revenue and other income A4 Cash flows performance A2 Expenses A5 Dividends A3 Taxation Our asset platform B1 Receivables B5 Impairment of non‑financial assets B2 Assets held for sale B6 Investment property B3 Property, plant and equipment B7 Payables B4 Intangible assets B8 Other provisions Our people C1 Employee provisions C3 Post employment benefits C2 Key management personnel remuneration and retirement benefits Our funding structure D1 Capital management D3 Using derivatives to hedge risks and management of D2 Managing our financial risks D4 Fair value measurement our financial risks Other information E1 Our subsidiaries E4 Auditor’s remuneration E2 Leases E5 Contingencies E3 Australian Postal Corporation E6 Other accounting policies Other important information Community service obligations 138 Auditor-General’s report – performance standards 139 Domestic letter service monitor 141 Survey certification 143 Letters/non-letters services 146 Statutory reporting requirements index 147 Australia Post Annual Report 2019 Statement by Directors, Group Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director and Group Chief Financial Officer 2018/19 Financial Statements FINANCIAL AND STATUTORY REPORTS In our opinion: (a) the accompanying financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2019: (i) present fairly the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows; (ii) comply with the accounting standards and any other requirements prescribed by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015; and (iii) have been prepared based on properly maintained financial records.

The APSS provides employer-financed defined benefits to all employees who are members. The APSS also enables members to open an accumulation account for personal contributions only, as well as accounts for their spouse and maintain the account on leaving employment. Balances in the accumulation section at 30 June 2019 totalled $3,653.3 million (2018: $3,563.2 million) and have been excluded from the disclosures.

In addition, the Corporation benefits from the surplus through reduction in future superannuation expense and contributions. 120 Australia Post Annual Report 2019 Management of the plan risks FINANCIAL AND STATUTORY REPORTS The funding of the plan is dependent upon future experience.

Application Application date of date for Reference Title Nature of change to accounting policy standard Group AASB 16, Leases AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) will replace AASB 117 Leases (AASB 117), 1 January 1 July and relevant Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, 2019 2019 amending Interpretation 115 Operating Leases –Incentives and Interpretation standards 127 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The Standard provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatment in the financial statements. The standard introduces a new lease accounting model for lessees that requires lessees to recognise all leases on balance sheet, except shortterm leases and leases of low value assets. Under AASB 16, the present value of operating lease commitments would be shown as a liability on the balance sheet together with an asset representing the right-of-use. In addition, the current operating lease expense recognised in profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income will be replaced with amortisation and interest expense. The approach to lessor accounting remains largely unchanged. AASB 16 also requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under AASB 117. The Group will adopt AASB 16 for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 July 2019, with the project to assess the impact of adopting the new standard nearing completion at the reporting date. The standard will be initially applied using a modified retrospective approach, meaning that any cumulative impacts of initial application will be recognised against retained earnings, and there will be no restatement of comparatives. At the end of the reporting period ended 30 June 2019, the Group has non-discounted operating lease commitments of $980.0 million. At transition date, the Group expects to recognise a discounted lease liability containing these non-cancellable commitments and option periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease arrangements embedded in supply agreements will also be recognised where the definition of a lease per the standard has been met.
