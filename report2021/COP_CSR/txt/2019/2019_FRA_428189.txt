It represents 2 55% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed at long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount is unchanged on 2013 when it was increased by 10% to reflect the change in Mr. Paul Hermelin’s role who became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the end of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 24, 2012, the extension of his responsibilities and the evolution and internationalization of the Group since 2008, when his compensation was last modified. The annualized increase in his theoretical compensation since 2008 and therefore in his fixed compensation is 0.9% per annum. This theoretical compensation falls within the median of CAC 40 executives. Annual variable €1,337,226 During the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 20, 2019, the Board, based on the audited and compensation (paid in 2019) approved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the amount of Mr. Paul Hermelin’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2018, of a target amount if objectives are attained of €1,200,000, i.e. 45% of his total theoretical compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary between 0% and 200% of the theoretical amount. V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the following respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to an ambition decided by the Board: 1) % attainment of the revenue: 30% weighting; 2) % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting; 3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; 4) 2018 organic free cash flow: 20% weighting. These objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ Meeting of February 14, 2018. Attainment rates for these four objectives were 101.1%, 97.69%, 102.42% and 110.48% respectively, 91 which taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment rate of 102.22%. The Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards and downwards such that for 2018: — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to 75%, the V1 component will be nil; — if this weighted performance is greater than or equal to 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount. Accordingly, with this formula, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases the variable component by 4%. Therefore, application of the formula to the weighted attainment rate of 102.22% in 2018 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable component by 108.87%, giving an amount of 1,200,000/2*108.87% = €653,226. V2 component: The evaluation and the associated proposal have been prepared on the basis of the work done by the Compensation Committee which reviewed the various personal objectives grouped into two categories: “shared objectives” for 60% and specific objectives for 40% For the shared objectives, the Board defined two sets of indicators evenly spread with an overall 60% weight around i) the effective implementation of the new Group governance and managerial transition with a reinforced collaboration between market units and service lines, positioning the Group on the path to achieve its growth ambition in the Digital and Cloud and its 2020 ambition (out of which 10% are quantifiable) and ii) the operational transformation of the Group with a renewed leadership structure (all based on quantitative indicators). In regard to the first part of shared objectives, through a specific and regular follow up process the Board is evaluating the effective implementation of the Group governance and managerial transition CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 and has evaluated the effective and efficient transformation program by validating the achievement of the 2018 market guidance and an ambitious 2019 budget. For the quantitative part, the Board has validated the fact that the growth of the Digital and Cloud offerings has been published at above 20% and exceeded the growth target set by the Board. On this basis the Board has evaluated the objectives of the first part of shared objectives to be attained at 115%. For the second part of shared objectives related to the successful implementation of the transformation pogram, the Board has validated the new organization in place since July first on one side and has reviewed the expected leadership renewal associated with this new organization noting that 25% of the key business units leaders have changed roles mid year, that from an attractivity standpoint more than 50% of external VP hires in 2018 have been in targeted domains and that the change organization Corporate Governance Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation has not generated a leadership disruption with a voluntary attrition of our high performing VPs aligned to our historical trends. On this basis the Board has evaluated the objectives of this second part of shared objectives to be attained at 123%. For the specific personal objectives, the Board defined three sets of objectives. The first specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the impact of M&A on the company growth (quantitative) and the successful post merger integration of acquired companies (qualitative).The disclosed perimeter impact of acquisitions on growth amounted to 2% and a post merger integration report on recently acquired companies has been presented to the Board which on this basis considered that the objectives set for this category have been achieved at 97%. The second specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy around 3 pillars (diversity and sustainability being quantitative and digital inclusion being qualitative). Diversity was measured through the % of women in Group Management of our key business units against a target significantly higher than the % of female VP in the VP population. This ambitious target was 96% achieved. On sustainability, the target was to decrease the Green House Gaz emissions per employee by 3% in 2018 and this target has been exceeded. For digital inclusion the strategy including actions already launched, implementation plan and targets have been presented to the December 2018 Board and approved by him. Given these achievements, the Board considered that the objectives set for this category have been achieved at 113%. The third specific objective (10% weighting) concerned the selection of strategic bets in disruptive technologies in order to favour the attainment of the Group growth ambition. A report was presented to the Board and associated bets have been incorporated into the 2019 plans. The Board considered that the objectives set for this category have been realized at 110%. The Board approved a weighted performance of 114% as per the table below: Target Proposal Objective type Computed Qualitative Computed Qualitative 92 New Group governance 10% 20% 11.5% 23.0% Successful transformation program implementation 30% n/a 37.0% n/a M&A impact on growth and post merger success 7.5% 7.5% 7.0% 7.5% Deployment of CSR strategy 10% 5% 12.0% 5.0% Strategic bets on disruptive technologies n/a 10% n/a 11.0% Total 57.5% 42.5% 67.5% 46.5% Target 100% Proposed 114% leading to a V2 calculation of €600,000*114% = €684,000. Accordingly, a variable compensation of €1,337,226 was approved by the Board for 2018, i.e. 92.1% of his fixed compensation for the same year and 111.4% of the theoretical variable compensation. Total fixed and variable compensation for 2018 is therefore €2,789,226, i.e. 105.2% of the theoretical compensation and may be summarized as follows: 2018 Variable compensation calculation for Mr. Paul Hermelin V1: quantitative part based on budgeted financial targets % of Indicators Weight achievement Weighted Total Revenue 30% 101.10% 30.33% Operational Margin % 30% 97.69% 29.31% CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Net results before tax 20% 102.42% 20.48% Organic free cash flow 20% 110.48% 22.10% Total weighted R/B before flex 102.22% Total weighted post 75/125 flex (4*weighted R/B-3) 108.87% Variable V1 on target 600,000 Computed V1 653,226 Corporate Governance Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation V2: qualitative part based on 2018 objectives Categories Weight Weighted total New Group governance 30% 2 Successful transformation program implementation 30% M&A impact on growth and post merger success 15% 114.0% Deployment of CSR strategy 15% Strategic bets on disruptive technologies 10% Variable V2 on target 600,000 Computed V2 684,000 TOTAL 2018 VARIABLE COMPENSATION 1,337,226 As a % of the total variable on target 111.4% As a % of fixed compensation 92.1% The variable compensation due in respect of a given year is calculated based on the audited accounts approved by the Board at the beginning of Y+1 and is paid after the submission of the compensation policy to the shareholders.

The external performance conditions accounts other form (IFRS accounting for 35% of the grant and is based on the comparative performance of the Capgemini share over three of long-term value on years against the average performance of a basket of 8 comparable companies in the same business compensation grant date) sector and from at least 5 countries (Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Steria/CGI Group/Infosys and Cognizant) the CAC 40 index and the Euro Stoxx 600 index. Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while it historically started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash flow generation over the three-year period from 2018 to 2020 accounts for 50% of the grant. The minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3 billion. Above this threshold, shares vest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the maximum grant requiring organic free cash flow of €3.25 billion or more. The internal performance condition on CSR performance indicators measured at the end of 2020 is based for 50% on the percentage of female executives (VPs) joining through promotions and external hiring over the period 2018 to 2020 and should be at 25% to get 100% of the grant with no grant if this % is below 20%. For the remaining 50%, it is based on the reduction of GHG/employee of a minimum 20% vs. the 2015 reference with 100% of the allocation if the reduction reaches 22%. The number of shares that may vest to the Executive Corporate Officer may not exceed 0.001% of the share capital.

This plan was reviewed by an external firm which confirmed that it complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations of October 6, 2009, as it complies with the revised AFEP-MEDEF Governance Code issued in June 2013. 94 The plan was closed to new beneficiaries in 2015 and rights of existing members have been frozen as of October 31, 2015. In order to receive benefits under this plan it is necessary to be with the Group at the time of retirement, to have at least 10 years of seniority, to have been a Group Executive Member for at least 5 years and to have a compensation level above 8 PASS (French annual social security ceiling) during 5 years at least. Benefits are based on reference earnings equal to the average of the three best years (fixed and variable part) from among the ten years preceding retirement. In addition, this supplementary pension is subject to three cumulative limits such that the pension amount cannot exceed: — 40% of reference earnings; — 50% of reference earnings, including pensions received under all other pension plans; and — reference earnings are capped at 60 times the French annual social security ceiling. Benefits are proportional to length of service (minimum of 10 years required and a maximum of 30 years), reflecting the required progressive acquisition of entitlement, which remains well below the threshold set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recent legal ceiling of 3% per annum. Entitlement is acquired at a rate of 1.5% per year for the first 10 years of seniority and for subsequent years only at rates of: — 1% up to 20 PASS; — 2% between 20 and 40 PASS; — 3% between 40 and 60 PASS. Therefore, the maximum possible annual entitlement is equal to 1.83% before potential impact of the cumulative limits. Due to the long seniority of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (frozen at 23 years in 2015) the value of the annual pension is estimated at a net amount after income tax and CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 employee social contribution of 300k€, corresponding to a gross amount of 901k€ or 34% of his 2018 theoretical compensation. The plan is financed through an external insurance company and as such the required funds to pay the pension support a contribution of 24%. 21 members have benefited from this regime since its launch with 8 presently active as of 31/12/2018.

It represents 60% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed at long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount was proposed following the nomination as of January 1, 2018 of Mr. Thierry Delaporte as Chief Operating Officer and this proposal has been approved by the shareholders at the May 23, 2018 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting. Annual variable €647,148 During the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 20, 2019, the Board, based on the audited and compensation (paid in 2019) approved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the amount of Mr. Thierry Delaporte’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2018, of a target amount if objectives are attained of €590,000, i.e. 40% of his total theoretical compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary between 0% and 200% of the theoretical amount. V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the following respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to an ambition decided by the Board: 1) % attainment of the revenue: 30% weighting; 2) % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting; 3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; 4) 2018 organic free cash flow: 20% weighting. These objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ Meeting of February 14, 2018. Attainment rates for these four objectives were 101.1%, 97.69%, 102.42% and 110.48% respectively, which taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment rate of 102.22%. The Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards and downwards 96 such that for 2018: — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to 75%, the V1 component will be nil; — if this weighted performance is greater than or equal to 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount. Accordingly, with this formula, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases the variable component by 4%. Therefore, application of the formula to the weighted attainment rate of 102.22% in 2018 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable component by 108.87%, giving an amount of 590,000/2*108.87% = €321,173. V2 component: The evaluation and the associated proposal have been prepared on the basis of the work done by the Compensation Committee which reviewed the various personal objectives grouped into two categories: “shared objectives” for 40% and specific objectives for 60% For the shared objectives, the Board defined two sets of indicators evenly spread with an overall 40% weight around i) the effective implementation of the new Group governance and managerial transition with a reinforced collaboration between market units and service lines, positioning the Group on the path to achieve its growth ambition in the Digital and Cloud and its 2020 ambition (out of which 5% are quantifiable) and ii) the operational transformation of the Group with a renewed leadership structure (all based on quantitative indicators). In regard to the first part of shared objectives, through a specific and regular follow up process the Board is evaluating the effective implementation of the Group governance and managerial transition and has evaluated the effective and efficient transformation program by validating the achievement of the 2018 market guidance and an ambitious 2019 budget. For the quantitative part, the Board has validated the fact that the growth of the Digital and Cloud offerings has been published at above 20% and exceeded the growth target set by the Board. On this basis the Board has evaluated the CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 first part of shared objectives to be attained at 117.5%. For the second part of shared objectives related to the successful implementation of the transformation pogram, the Board has validated the new organization in place since July first on one side and has reviewed the expected leadership renewal associated with this new organization noting that 25% of the key business units leaders have changed roles mid year, that from an attractivity standpoint more than 50% of external VP hires in 2018 have been in targeted domains and that the change organization has not generated a leadership disruption with a voluntary attrition of our high performing VPs aligned to our historical trends. On this basis the Board has evaluated the objectives of this second part of shared objectives to be attained at 117.5%. Corporate Governance Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation For the specific personal objectives, the Board defined four sets of objectives. The first specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the successful set up of Capgemini Invent and its positive interaction with the rest of the organization. Based on a CEO report explaining the significant growth both in volume and in the number of multi-discipline deals generated by Capgemini 2 Invent which was twice above the set target, the Board considered that the objectives set for this category have been achieved at 133%. The second specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the gross margin evolution versus the 2017 published rate. The 2018 published rate showed an improvement year on year but the set target has not been fully and therefore the Board considered that the objective set for this category has been achieved at 77%. The third specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the success of 4 selected bets within our partners offerings. All 4 bet have reached or exceeded their target and overall vs. the total consolidated bookings target, the performance has been achieved at 112%, percentage retained by the Board for this objective. At last the fourth specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the new strategic positioning of India within the revised organization. The Board considered that the objective set for this category has been realized at 100%.

Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while it historically started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash flow generation over the three-year period from 2018 to 2020 accounts for 50% of the grant. The minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3 billion. Above this threshold, shares vest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 maximum grant requiring organic free cash flow of €3.25 billion or more. The internal performance condition on CSR performance indicators measured at the end of 2020 is based for 50% on the percentage of female executives (VPs) joining through promotions and external hiring over the period 2018 to 2020 and should be at 25% to get 100% of the grant with no grant if this % is below 20%. For the remaining 50%, it is based on the reduction of GHG/employee of a minimum 20% vs. the 2015 reference with 100% of the allocation if the reduction reaches 22%. The number of shares that may vest to the executive corporate officer may not exceed 0.001% of the share capital.

However, no severance indemnity shall be due if the Chief Operating Officer leaves the company on his own initiative, changes functions within the Group, is entitled to assert in a near future his rights to retirement or in the event of a gross negligence or serious misconduct. 99 In compliance with the recommendations of the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code, the aggregate amount (i) of the severance indemnity effectively paid, (ii) of any indemnity likely to be paid in connection with the termination of an employment agreement, and (iii) of any indemnity likely to be paid in consideration for the non-compete undertaking, may not exceed a maximum amount equal to twice the applicable gross theoretical compensation (fixed plus variable) as at the date of termination of said functions. The granting and the amount of the severance indemnity depend on the percentage of achievement of the weighted performance of the financial indicators due to the Chief Operating Officer in regard to his V1 variable part during each of the last three completed financial years preceding the termination of his functions as Chief Operating Officer, being specified that the last year will count for 40%, while the two previous financial years will count for 30% each. The granting and the amount of the V1 variable part being subject to performance indicators and to the Group’s consolidated results, the severance indemnity is as a result subject to the satisfaction of these same performance conditions. The Board will have to ensure the effective achievement of these performance criteria.

It represents 60% of 2 the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed at long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount was proposed following the nomination as of January 1, 2018 of Mr. Aiman Ezzat as Chief Operating Officer and this proposal has been approved by the shareholders at the May 23, 2018 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting. Annual variable €687,562 During the Board of Directors’ Meeting of March 20, 2019, the Board, based on the audited and compensation (paid in 2019) approved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the amount of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2018, of a target amount if objectives are attained of €624,000, i.e. 40% of his total theoretical compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary between 0% and 200% of the theoretical amount. V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the following respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to an ambition decided by the Board: 1) % attainment of the revenue: 30% weighting; 2) % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting; 3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; 4) 2018 organic free cash flow: 20% weighting. These objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ Meeting of February 14, 2018. Attainment rates for these four objectives were 101.1%, 97.69%, 102.42% and 110.48% respectively, which taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment rate of 102.22%. The Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards and downwards 101 such that for 2018: — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to 75%, the V1 component will be nil; — if this weighted performance is greater than or equal to 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount. Accordingly, with this formula, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases the variable component by 4%. Therefore, application of the formula to the weighted attainment rate of 102.22% in 2018 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable component by 108.87%, giving an amount of 624,000/2*108.87% = €339,682. V2 component: The evaluation and the associated proposal have been prepared on the basis of the work done by the Compensation Committee which reviewed the various personal objectives grouped into two categories: “shared objectives” for 40% and specific objectives for 60%. For the shared objectives, the Board defined two sets of indicators evenly spread with an overall 40% weight around i) the effective implementation of the new Group governance and managerial transition with a reinforced collaboration between market units and service lines, positioning the Group on the path to achieve its growth ambition in the Digital and Cloud and its 2020 ambition (out of which 5% are quantifiable) and ii) the operational transformation of the Group with a renewed leadership structure (all based on quantitative indicators). In regard to the first part of shared objectives, through a specific and regular follow up process the Board is evaluating the effective implementation of the Group governance and managerial transition and has evaluated the effective and efficient transformation program by validating the achievement of the 2018 market guidance and an ambitious 2019 budget. For the quantitative part, the Board has validated the fact that the growth of the Digital and Cloud offerings has been published at above 20% and exceeded the growth target set by the Board. On this basis the Board has evaluated the CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 first part of shared objectives to be attained at 117.5%. For the second part of shared objectives related to the successful implementation of the transformation pogram, the Board has validated the new organization in place since July first on one side and has reviewed the expected leadership renewal associated with this new organization noting that 25% of the key business units leaders have changed roles mid year, that from an attractivity standpoint more than 50% of external VP hires in 2018 have been in targeted domains and that the change organization has not generated a leadership disruption with a voluntary attrition of our high performing VPs aligned to our historical trends. On this basis the Board has evaluated the objectives of this second part of shared objectives to be attained at 117.5%. Corporate Governance Structure Compensation composition of ExecutiveetCorporate de Gouvernance Officers du Conseil d’Administration Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation For the specific personal objectives, the Board defined four sets of objectives. The first specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the higher contribution to Group growth of the top 100 accounts. The actual growth of our top 100 accounts has been higher than the Group organic growth but just behind the preset ambitious target which drove the Board to assess the performance for this objective to be achieved at 83%. The second specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the gross margin evolution versus the 2017 published rate. The 2018 published rate showed an improvement year on year but the set target has not been fully met and therefore the Board considered that the objective for this category has been achieved at 77%. The third specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the return to growth year on year during the fourth qurter of 2018 of a selected geography. Thanks to a strong focus the return to growth started already in the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth one to end more than twice the target given year on year. Therefore, the Board considered that the objective set for this category has been realized at 150%. At last the fourth specific objective (15% weighting) concerned the management of the CFO role transition from the former one to the newly appointed one. Based on the evaluation made of this transition process by the CEO and considering the fact that Mr. Ezzat had the CFO position for 6 months before transitioning the role and with feedback from various members, the Board has considered that the objective set for this category has been realized at 120%. The Board approved a weighted performance of 111.5% as per the table below: Target Proposal Objective type Computed Qualitative Computed Qualitative New Group governance 5% 15% 6.0% 17.5% Successful transformation program implementation 20% n/a 23.5% n/a 102 Growth of top 100 accounts 15% n/a 12.5% n/a Gross margin % protection / improvement vs. 2017 15% n/a 11.5% n/a Return to YoY growth in Q4 in a selected geography 15% n/a 22.5% n/a CFO role transition n/a 15% n/a 18.0% Total 70% 30% 76.0% 35.5% Target 100% Proposed 111.5% leading to a V2 calculation of €312,000*111.5% = €347,880. Accordingly, a variable compensation of €687,562 was approved by the Board for 2018, i.e. 73.5% of his fixed compensation for the same year and 110.2% of the theoretical variable compensation. Total fixed and variable compensation for 2018 is therefore €1,623,562, i.e. 104.1% of the theoretical compensation and may be summarized as follows: 2018 Variable compensation calculation for Mr. Aiman Ezzat V1: quantitative part based on budgeted financial targets % of Indicators Weight achievement Weighted Total Revenue 30% 101.10% 30.33% Operational Margin % 30% 97.69% 29.31% Net results before tax 20% 102.42% 20.48% CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Organic free cash flow 20% 110.48% 22.10% Total weighted R/B before flex 102.22% Total weighted after 75/125 flex (4*weighted R/B-3) 108.87% Variable V1 on target 312,000 Computed V1 339,682 Corporate Governance Compensation Structure de Gouvernance et composition du Conseil of Executive Corporate d’Administration Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation V2: qualitative part based on 2018 objectives Categories Weight Weighted total New Group governance 20% 2 Successful transformation program implementation 20% Growth of top 100 accounts 15% Gross margin % protection/improvement vs. 2017 15% 111.5% Return to YoY growth in Q4 in a selected geography 15% CFO role transition 15% Variable V2 on target 312,000 Computed V2 347,880 TOTAL 2018 VARIABLE COMPENSATION 687,562 As a % of the total variable on target 110.2% As a % of fixed compensation 73.5% The variable compensation due in respect of a given year is calculated based on the audited accounts approved by the Board at the beginning of Y+1 and is paid after the submission of the compensation policy to the shareholders.

Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while it historically started at 90%.

The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. Basis for Opinion Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1st January 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) 234 No 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Emphasis of Matter Without qualifying our conclusion, we draw your attention to Note 1B “New Standards and interpretations applicable in 2018” to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the impact of the application as of January 1, 2018 of IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” and IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”. Justification of Assessments – Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Financial information Consolidated accounts Recognition of revenue and costs related to long-term service contracts Risks identified Our audit approach Capgemini is present in the professional IT services market and We gained an understanding of the process related to recognizing notably provides long-term services. various revenue flows. As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, Our approach took into account the information systems used in the method used to recognize revenue and costs related to long-term recognizing revenue and related costs by testing, with the assistance contracts depends on the nature of the services rendered, as of our IT specialists, the effectiveness of the automatic controls for follows: systems impacting revenue recognition. — revenue from deliverable-based contracts is recognized over Our work notably involved: time by using the “cost-to-cost” method to measure progress — assessing internal control procedures, identifying the most to completion. The percentage of completion is based on costs manual or automatic relevant controls for our audit and testing incurred to date relative to the total estimate of cost at their design and operational efficiency; completion of the contract; — based on a sample of contracts: — revenue from Resources-based contracts is recognized as the Group earns the right to bill the customer as the amount – assessing the performance obligations identified within the invoiced corresponds directly to the value to the customer of context of the contract, the performance completed to date; – assessing the method used to recognize revenue and related costs for each identified performance obligations, — revenue on services-based contracts is recognized as rights to – comparing the accounting data against the operational bill arise, except in specific cases where invoicing terms do not monitoring of projects and assessing the reasonableness of reflect the value to the customer of services rendered to date the estimates used, particularly as regards to measuring costs relative to the value of the remaining services (for example, in case of significant front-loaded or back-loaded fees or discounts); — revenue on multi-deliverable contracts should be recognized to be incurred till the end of the contract; — carrying out analytical audit procedures, and notably analyzing 5 material changes in revenue and margin from one period to applying the appropriate method as specified above, depending another; on the performance obligations identified. — assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in Costs incurred to fulfill the contracts are expensed as incurred with the notes to the consolidated financial statements. the exception of certain initial set-up costs, such as transition and transformation costs that do not represent a separate performance obligation, which are capitalized if they create a resource that the Group will use to perform the promised service. 235 A provision for onerous contract is recorded if the unavoidable costs of fulfilling the contract exceed the related benefits. The amount of revenue and the costs to be recognized for the period, and of any provisions for loss at completion at the closing date, depends upon the Group’s ability to: — identify all the performance obligations in the long-term multi-service contracts and determine their related accounting treatment; — measure the costs incurred for deliverable-based contracts or the total services rendered for resourcesbased and services-based contracts; — estimate the costs to be incurred till the end of the contract. Considering the judgments and estimates made by the management to determine how revenue and related costs should be recognized, notably in the context of the first application of the new revenue standard, IFRS 15, we deemed the recognition of revenue and costs related to long-term service contracts to be a key matter in our audit.

The review primarily focused on the assumptions’ consistency with the long-term growth 237 rates used and the information gathered during our meetings with members of management. We also considered the impact of the US tax reform on the measurement of the US deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2018. Our firms’ tax specialists were involved in this work. CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Financial information Consolidated accounts Tax Audit Risks identified Our audit approach The Group is present in a large number of tax jurisdictions. The tax Through discussions with Management, we have gained an authorities in the countries in which the Group operates regularly understanding of the procedures implemented by the Group to ask questions relating to the Group’s position on subjects relating identify uncertain tax positions and, where appropriate, provision to its ordinary business. for tax risk. Tax audits may lead to re-assessments and disputes with the tax In addition, we have assessed the judgments made by Management authorities. Estimates of risk relating to tax disputes are reviewed to measure the probability of tax payable and the amount of regularly for each subsidiary and by the Group’s Tax Department, potential exposures, and the reasonableness of the estimates made with the assistance of external counsel for the most significant and for providing tax risk. complex disputes. We focused in particular on the effect of changes in local tax As stated in Note 29 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements regulations and ongoing disputes with local tax authorities. for the year ended 31 December 2018, these reassessments have To assess whether tax disputes have been correctly accounted for, not been accrued in the financial statements, as the Group has with the assistance of our tax experts we: justified its position and believes that it is probable that it will prevail.

Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits Risks identified Our audit approach As stated in the Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements We were informed of the procedures implemented by the Group for the year ended 31 December 2018, the Group contributes to for measuring post-employment net benefit obligations resulting several post-employment defined benefit plans. The main pension from defined benefit plans. plans in the United Kingdom, Canada and France represent an With the support of our actuaries, our work involved: actuarial value of cumulative benefit obligations of €4,048 million out of a total of €4,466 million at 31 December 2018.

Financial information Consolidated accounts Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the Management Report As required by law we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement provided for by article L. 2251021 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the Management Report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 82310 of said Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the financial statements of the information contained in this statement which has to be subject to a report by an independent third party. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory auditors We were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2002 for KPMG audit and on 24 May 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers audit. As at 31 December 2018, KPMG audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers audit were in the 17th year and 23rd year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going 5 concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved the Board of Directors. 239 Statutory auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: — identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; — evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; — assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; Financial information Consolidated accounts — evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; — obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory auditors We were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2002 for KPMG audit and on 24 May 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers audit. As at 31 December 2018, KPMG audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers audit were in the 17th year and 23rd year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 268 As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: — identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; — evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; — assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; — evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Financial information 2018 financial statements Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Agreements and commitments already approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting Agreements and commitments approved in previous years but not implemented during the year We were informed that the following agreements and commitments, approved by the General Meeting in previous years, remained in force during the year ended 31 December 2018 but not implemented. — Supplementary collective pension plan of Paul Hermelin, Chief Executive Officer 270 Type of agreement: A supplementary collective defined benefit pension plan was set up by the Company for certain senior executives regarded as having made a significant and lasting contribution to the development of the Capgemini group. Paul Hermelin was listed as a beneficiary of this plan by decision of the Shareholders’ Meeting of 26 April 2007. Purpose and terms and conditions: On 13 December 2006, the Board of Directors authorised the establishment of a supplementary collective defined benefit pension plan for certain senior executives, enabling them to receive, at retirement, a maximum supplementary pension of 40% of their benchmark remuneration. The total pension collected by the beneficiary may not exceed 50% of this benchmark remuneration, which is itself limited to 60 times the maximum annual salary limit defined by French Social Security. On 29 July 2015, the Board of Directors decided to freeze Paul Hermelin’s rights under this supplementary pension plan with effect from 31 October 2015, without consideration, thus leading to a change in the rules in the Company’s favour. On 5 December 2018, the Board of Directors noted that the agreement was submitted for review. Paul Hermelin received no compensation under this agreement in 2018. Agreements and commitments authorised during the year Furthermore, we were informed that the following agreements and commitments, already approved by the General Meeting on 23 May 2018 upon Statutory auditors’ special report dated 26 February 2018, were not implemented during the year ended 31 December 2018. — Severance pay for Chief Operating Officers Thierry Delaporte and Aiman Ezzat Type and purpose of agreement: The agreement sets out the severance pay entitlement of Thierry Delaporte and Aiman Ezzat in the event of their departure from their position as Chief Operating Officer. CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Terms and conditions: The severance pay will depend on the percentage of fulfilment of the financial performance objectives applicable to the Chief Operating Officer in question for the V1 variable portion of his remuneration calculated for each of the three complete financial years preceding the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer, based on a weighting of 40% for the financial year immediately preceding the termination and 30% for each of the remaining two years. Since the V1 part of the variable remuneration is subject to performance criteria, the severance pay will be conditional upon the fulfilment of these same criteria. In accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors set an upper limit on the aggregate amount that may be paid out to the Chief Operating Officer with respect to (i) the final calculated amount of severance pay, (ii) the compensation paid under the collective bargaining agreement in the event of termination of the employment contract, and (iii) any compensation that may be paid under a non-competition agreement. This amount is limited to twice the theoretical annual compensation (fixed plus variable) applicable on the date of termination of service. Financial information 2018 financial statements No severance pay would be paid if the Chief Operating Officer leaves of his own accord, if he changes roles within the Group, if he is able to take retirement at very short notice or if he leaves as a result of serious or gross misconduct. Pursuant to article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, these appointments are to be submitted for approval to the Shareholders’ Meeting on 23 May 2018, subject to two conditions precedent, namely (i) the adoption of the compensation policy for the Chief Operating Officers by the Shareholders’ Meeting of 23 May 2018, and (ii) the re-appointment of Thierry Delaporte and Aiman Ezzat as Chief Operating Officers by the Board of Directors at the meeting to be held following the Shareholders’ Meeting of 23 May 2018. The two conditions precedent were lifted on May 23, 2019. On 5 December 2018, the Board of Directors noted that the agreement was submitted for review. — Non-competition obligations concerning Chief Operating Officers Thierry Delaporte and Aiman Ezzat Type of agreement: The agreement provides for a non-competition obligation applicable to Thierry Delaporte and Aiman Ezzat, in exchange for which they may be entitled to a compensation payment. Terms and conditions: Subject to compliance with the non-competition obligation for a period of 12 months as from the date of termination of their employment contract further to the termination of their corporate office, the two Chief Operating Officers may be entitled to a compensation payment equal to half of their maximum theoretical gross compensation (fixed plus variable) applicable on the date of termination of their corporate office. The Board of Directors reserves the right to decide to release the Chief Operating Officers from the noncompetition obligation and thus to waive payment of the non-competition compensation payment. In accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors set an upper limit on the aggregate amount that may be paid out to the Chief Operating Officer with respect to (i) the final calculated amount of severance pay, (ii) the compensation paid under the collective bargaining agreement in the event of termination of the employment contract, and (iii) any compensation that may be paid under a non-competition agreement.

Report of the Board of Directors and draft resolutions to be presented at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 23, 2019 Supplementary report of the Board of Directors on the issuance of shares under the Capgemini group “ESOP 2018” employee shareholding plan 2. Further details regarding the transaction Framework of the transaction In a press release dated September 24, 2018, the Company specified that this fifth international share ownership plan, proposed to approximately 98% of the employees of the Group, aims to associate all employees to the Capgemini development and performance. The shares were subscribed to either directly or through a FCPE, in accordance with applicable regulatory and/or tax legislation in the various countries of residence of the beneficiaries of the capital increase. Employees subscribed to Capgemini shares within the framework of a unique subscription formula called leveraged and guaranteed, allowing the employees to benefit from a guarantee on their investments made into this plan. In certain countries, employees will be allocated Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”) by their employer, the amount of which will be indexed in accordance with a formula similar to the one offered under the leveraged formula; a specific subscription formula was also proposed in the United States of America to take into account the applicable regulatory and tax legislation. Subscribers to the offer shall hold either the shares subscribed to directly, or the corresponding units of the FCPEs, for a five-year period, except in the event of an authorized early exit. Other characteristics of the transaction The reservation period of the shares (at an unknown price), during which the employees and corporate officers of the Capgemini group could request to subscribe, was opened from September 24 to October 11, 2018. A subscription period, during which subscription requests made during the reservation period could be withdrawn, was opened from November 13 to 15, 2018 (inclusive), after communication to the beneficiaries of the subscription price established by the decision of the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer dated November 12, 2018. Having taken into account all subscription requests, a reduction of the subscription requests has been made. Thus, all of the shares that may be issued within the framework of the transaction, or 2,500,000 (two million five hundred thousand) shares will be subscribed to. The number of subscribers equaled to 33,579 employees, or 17.0% of the eligible population, and similarly to the previous ESOP plans, the transaction was oversubscribed to in the amount of 191%. The newly-issued shares will be fully assimilated with the existing ordinary shares comprising Capgemini’s share capital. These shares will bear benefit entitlement as of January 1, 2018. The request to list the newly-issued Capgemini shares to trading on the same line of Euronext Paris (ISIN code: FR0000125338) as the existing shares will be made as soon as possible following the completion of the capital increase scheduled to take place on December 18, 2018. 307 3. Impact of the issuance of 2,500,000 shares on the stake of holders of shares and securities, their shareholders’ equity per share and the theoretical impact on the market value of the share price 3.1 Impact on shareholders’ stake in the share capital of the Company 7 For illustrative purposes, on the basis of the share capital of the Company at June 30, 2018, or 168,817,033 shares, the impact of the issuance of new shares on the stake of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of the Company prior to, and not subscribing to, the issuance would be as follows: Shareholder stake Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase 1% 0.97% After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase 0.99% 0.96% (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,496,144 performance shares granted on June 30, 2018 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). 3.2 Impact of the issuance on the consolidated shareholders’ equity per share For illustrative purposes, the impact of the issuance on the consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of the Company per share (calculations based on consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of the Company at June 30, 2018, and the number of shares comprising the share capital at June 30, 2018 after deduction of treasury shares) would be as follows: Consolidated shareholders’ equity per share CAPGEMINI — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018 Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €42.02 €40.92 After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €42.77 €41.66 (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,496,144 performance shares granted on June 30, 2018 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). Report of the Board of Directors and draft resolutions to be presented at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 23, 2019 Supplementary report of the Board of Directors on the issuance of shares under the Capgemini group “ESOP 2018” employee shareholding plan 3.3 Impact of the issuance on the statutory shareholders’ equity per share For illustrative purposes, the impact of the issuance on the statutory shareholders’ equity per share of Capgemini SE (calculations based on statutory shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of Capgemini SE at June 30, 2018, and the number of shares comprising the share capital at June 30, 2018 after deduction of treasury shares) would be as follows: Statutory shareholders’ equity per share Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €82.99 €80.80 After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €83.12 €80.97 (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,496,144 performance shares granted on June 30, 2018 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). 3.4 Theoretical impact on the stock market value of the Capgemini share The theoretical impact of the issuance of 2,500,000 shares at the issuance price on the stock market valuation of the Capgemini share is calculated as follows: Share price before the transaction = the average of the listed closing prices of the Capgemini share during the 20 stock market trading days preceding the fixing of the issuance price (calculated as the average of the closing share price between October 15 and November 9, 2018, inclusive). This price amounts to 105.46 euros. Theoretical share price after the transaction = ((the average of the listed closing prices of the Capgemini share during the 20 stock market trading days preceding the fixing of the issuance price x the number of shares before the transaction) + (the issuance price x the number of newly-issued shares))/(the number of shares before the transaction + the number of newly-issued shares). The issuance price of the reserved capital increase is set at 92.28 euros. Accounting for these assumptions, the theoretical post-transaction stock market value of the Capgemini share amounts to 105.21 euros. It is recalled that this theoretical approach is provided for illustrative purposes and does not predict future evolutions in the share price. — This supplementary report and the Statutory auditors’ report may be consulted by shareholders at the Company’s head office and will be 308 brought to the attention of shareholders at the next Shareholders’ Meeting.
