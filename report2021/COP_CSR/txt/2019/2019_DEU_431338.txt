In our production we use numerous materials which, in terms of their procurement, transport, use, and disposal, affect people and the environment.

EMISSIONS CONTROL The conversion to 100 % renewable energies by our power provider at the Bamberg site allowed a reduction of the total emissions of CO2 by 60 % and of SO2, NOX, and dust by 80 %. WATER CONSUMPTION We feel obliged to use the resource water in a sustainable manner. We have therefore put a halt to the consumption of water for cooling purposes by switching to closed circulation cooling systems. LAND USE To keep as much falling rainwater in the natural water cycle as possible, our traffic areas and car parks are covered with grass pavers and paving with gaps. Despite increasing sales and production, we are using less land. WASTE AVOIDANCE The avoidance of waste is a top priority for Wieland. Where waste cannot be avoided, we look to recycle it using methods that are as high-quality as possible. The last resort is the disposal of waste in an environmentally sound manner. 32 .
