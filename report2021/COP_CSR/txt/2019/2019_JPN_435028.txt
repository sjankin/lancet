This product was launched in July 2019, marking our entry into the non-residential floor coverings market. Melamine Tile is a new floor material that combines the advantages of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) floor and melamine. With this entry into the non-residential floor market, we will increase our capacity to make total proposals for space design, from floors to furniture and household equipment to walls. Background to development We have the top market share in the Japanese high pressure laminate (HPL) market, Structure of Melamine Tile and we have sought to develop a floor material that takes advantage of the benefits of No chamfer or C-chamfer HPLs, namely its excellent scuff and dirt resistance and ease of maintenance. However, High pressure laminate because HPLs expand and contract, the task of developing a melamine floor material (HPL) layer was fraught with difficulties. Meanwhile, for the past several years, we had also been developing a variety of resin products in the specialty and performance materials business. 3 mm In that process, using a special acrylic resin developed for textiles, we were able to curb the expansion and contraction of HPLs and succeeded in developing a new floor material that offers both the strength of HPLs and the ease of construction of PVC core layer.

CELSUS, an HPL with advanced AICA’s Vision design and resistance to fingerprints and other dirt, and high value-added products that have been given functions such as non-combustibility and scratch resistance, have captured new-build and renovation demand in hotels and commercial facilities. All of these factors allowed us to increase sales in this segment. Sales also increased overseas, predominantly in Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam. In boards and films, the architectural films range, ALTYNO, which has seen an expansion of finished products, performed well, but general-purpose polyester decorative panels struggled, leading to a downturn in sales over the previous year. Sales of the noncombustible decorative panel, CERARL, fell in the medical and welfare sector due to a downturn in the number of new project starts, but it was able to capture demand from childcare centers, which are expanding in response to the problem of long waiting lists for childcare places, as well as in the buoyant Olympics-related sector of new builds and renovations of sports facilities, hotels, and other related facilities. Adoption of the CERARL Deodorant Type also increased for restrooms in railway stations, schools, and other facilities. All of these factors Foundations Supporting AICA allowed us to increase sales in this segment. In Noncombustible Decorative Panel (Except “Cerarl”), we saw growth in the use of the acrylic resincoated calcium silicate boads, LUNALITE, for sports facility, hotel, factory/warehouse, and educational facility applications, and adoption of the multifunctional building materials, MOISS, has expanded from residential applications to childcare centers and public facilities. As a result, sales in this segment increased, with a focus on synergy products with AICA-Tech Kenzai Co.,Ltd. In Counter/Postform products, handwashing benches and accompanying storage cabinets for small children, made with the artificial marble product, CORIAN, performed well in new and renovated childcare centers. Sales of FioreStone, our premium engineered stone, have grown for high-end kitchen counters, and we have also expanded our sales channels to include non-residential facilities such as hotels, allowing us to increase sales. In fittings, and interior housing materials, the MELAFUSION Series, which leverages the characteristics of HPL, performed well, but regular-grade ranges of fittings and the functional sliding door range, U.D. (Universal Design) Comfort Series, which targets medical and welfare facilities both underperformed, resulting in a year-on-year decline in sales for this segment. These results brought about net sales of 82,300 million yen (up 1.8% year-on-year). Operating profit (before deduction of unallocated operating expenses) was 16,169 million yen (up 3.5% year-on-year).

AICA Group CSR Report 2019 24 AICA’s CSR Activities We believe that fulfilling our corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an essential condition for our continued existence as a corporation and a mission that we must carry out toward broader society. We are striving to build frameworks for the promotion of CSR, to strengthen the foundations that will support our CSR activities and to make continuous improvements and enhancements to those foundations.

General Affairs Department Governance Research and Development Division Development and sales expansion of AS Products to solve Sales Administration Division social issues Overseas Business Group Extension of CSR to overseas Group companies 2 C&C Activities C&C activities are small-group activities in which all employees in all divisions participate. These groups discuss and implement specific action plans, using QC methods and other scientific approaches, to consider ways of achieving operational improvements and implement division policies. A C&C Convention is held every year, at which awards are presented to outstanding circles and case study presentations are given. In this way, effective ways of pursuing small-group activities and kaizen know-how are shared among the Group. At the FY2017 and FY2018 Conventions, some excellent case studies were presented by the sales and back-office divisions. Prior to that, neither of these divisions had been very advanced in their activities, but their performances at these two conventions gave people in a variety of positions the opportunity to make discoveries. These activities have a long history, with their predecessor, the ZD Campaign, starting in 1965 with the objective of raising productivity. The initial aim of that campaign was to achieve “zero mistakes” in the work through careful attention and innovative efforts by individual employees. From 1979, the C&C Campaign was rolled out, taking the initials of the present Corporate principle, Challenge & Creation. The campaign took on a broader meaning to include “promoting initiatives for the achievement of management goals,” which has been passed down to today’s C&C activities. 25 AICA Group CSR Report 2019 3 QEO Management System This is a management system that operates with a trinity of quality (Q: ISO 9001), environment (E: ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety (O: OHSAS 18001). As well as complying with laws and regulations, under this system, we conduct risk hedging and kaizen activities, promote the enhancement of quality, improvement of environmental indicators (reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and industrial waste, reinforcement of water management, etc.), and the creation of safe and comfortable workplaces, and strive to strengthen our management foundations from the perspectives of both risk and opportunity.

Foundations Supporting AICA Signing of United Nations Global Compact To promote and implement high-quality CSR activities as a company that operates its businesses on a global scale, in September 2018, the AICA Group signed the United Nations Global Compact, which declares voluntary action principles concerning human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. Response to SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. These international goals have a target year of 2030. They consist of 17 goals and 169 targets to realize a sustainable world, covering issues such as poverty, starvation, energy, climate change, and peaceful society. The AICA Group endorsed these goals and commenced initiatives to solve relevant issues.
