SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 PARTNERSHIPS FOR IMPACT On the Cover: Kalvebod Fælled School DEM participated in the building of this new school designed by Lundgaard & Tranberg Architects. DEM had the overall responsibility for Sustainability, energy consultancy, indoor climate as well as the technical inspections during the construction of the building. The overall focus on sustainability helped to create the fundamental design parameters, and was a primary focus throughout the different stages of the project. From working with urban space, to the geometry and physical appearance of the building, to installations, operations and use of the buildings resources, to the overall economy, this school building is a beacon for sustainability.

At DEM, we recognized this opportunity early on, and have been working actively to realize this link. Over the past year we have delivered a broad range of services related to the SDGs, including business strategies, sustainability plans, marketing strategies, as well as developing cases, action plans and road maps. And how does DEM achieve sustainable impact through these services? By working with partners who are actively engaged in providing increased sustainability in their communities – whether in USA, Asia or in Denmark. These partnerships generate revenue for DEM, but more than that, projects are achieving real, measurable, sustainable impact around the world. In addition to the sustainability services that we provide, and in order to walk-the-talk, we have also incorporated the SDGs into our own business strategy. Our motivation for incorporating these Goals into our business strategy has been supported by a firm belief that “what gets principles provide a clear way to evaluate our internal measured, gets done”. For this reason, and for the company sustainability, helping us to continually improve. third year in a row, we are measuring progress towards Together, the SDGs and the Global Compact help DEM achieving the SDGs across all projects in Denmark and to approach sustainability in a holistic way, the benefits of internationally, with thirty defined indicators in our online which are passed directly on to each of our partners. SDG reporting system.

While the SDGs provide a focus on the sustainable impact of our projects, the Global Compact and its ten Jørn Lykou CEO DEM SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 3 DEMs COMPANY IMPACT MEASUREMENT At DEM, we understand that the business case for sustainability is well established. Having identified the SDGs that are most closely related to our market areas, we are able to integrate these goals across our business in a holistic way. Since 2016, DEM has been using our online SDG Reporting System to measure sustainable impact and progress towards SDG 7, 11, 13 and 17 across all projects on an annual basis. Each relevant SDG, actionable SDG Target, and company specific indicator is connected to our financial system so that impact can be measured both in terms of monetary value, and in terms of hours worked. Aligning with the SDGs has enabled us to set more meaningful goals for ourselves and communicate more effectively with our partners about our commitment to sustainable development.

Just as the Sustainable Working Culture group is currently introducing new exercises into work routines, many of the standing traditions in the company also promote a work culture filled with participatory actives that bring employees together. Ski trip to Norway For example, each new year starts with a ski trip to together and fireworks over the sea to end the event.

The base year for reporting on verifiable emissions data is the 2015 reporting year. The operational boundary covers scope 1, scope 2, and part of scope 3 (business travel) with relation to all DEM offices in Denmark. Figures provided follow the Green House Gas (GHG) protocol, and the GHG calculation tool provided by the World Resources Institute. In addition to international offices, DEM owns 51 percent of the company DEEP A/S (Danish Energy Efficiency Partners Sdn. Bhd.). However, the activity of offices outside of Denmark is considered outside of the operational boundaries of this report. The DEM offices included in the 2018 reporting year are: • Aarhus • Sønderborg • Copenhagen To calculate results, emissions are categorized as either direct (Scope 1) or indirect (Scope 2 & Scope 3). Direct, Scope 1, emissions are those that are directly caused by a source that the company owns or controls. Indirect, Scope 2 and Scope 3, emissions are derived from the company’s consumption of energy products and services, where the company does not own or control the emissions source. In the case that these activities represent a combined 10 percent change in the base year emissions, DEM will conduct a recalculation and back-cast these data points. FOLLOWING THE GHG PROTOCOL CORPORATE STANDARD, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE SCOPES: SCOPE 1: All direct emissions caused by the company, e.g. SCOPE 3 emissions from company owned cars, or combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas in company-owned equipment Use of other transportation forms for business • Use of company cars for business purposes – managers purposes Domestic ﬂight • Use of company cars for business purposes – employees International ﬂight SCOPE 2: All indirect emissions caused by the company’s Employees own car purchase of energy Ferry Train • Electricity use in offices • District heating used in offices Electricity SCOPE 2 Bus Use of energy SCOPE 3: Other indirect emissions caused by consumption in oﬃces of products and services • Use of employee cars for business purposes (car allowance) Employees • Transportation by train • International air transport SCOPE 1 • Transportation by bus • Transportation by ferry Use of company • Transportation by ferry • Domestic air transport cars for business District heating Managers purposes • Domestic air transport • International air transport 16 TOTAL CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE 2016-2017 REPORTING YEAR % CO2 EMMISSIONS DISTRIBUTED ACTIVITIES DISTANCE ENERGY CON­SUMP­TION/ CO₂ EMISSIONS BY SCOPE (km) PRODUCTION (kWh) (tCO₂) SCOPE 1 7% SCOPE 1 Use of company cars for business 11,818 3.0 purposes – managers Use of company cars for business 54,131 8.1 purposes – employees 33% SCOPE 2 SCOPE 2 60% Electricity use in offices 101,447 29.6 District heating use in offices 147,887 23.2 SCOPE 3 SCOPE 3 Use of employee cars for business 118,633 17.1 purposes Transportation by train 30,373 1.5 Transportation by bus 1,408 0.1 Transportation by ferry 12,160 1.5 ENERGY USED BY DEM IS EQUIVALENT TO 8% OF THE RENEWABLE ENERGY Transportation by taxi 1,854 0.3 GENERATED BY OFFSETS Domestic air transport * 2.4 162 8% International air transport * 74.9 tCO₂ Total 230,377 249,334 161.9 OFFSETS Middelgrunden offshore wind farm 255,038 74.4 Hvidebæk biomass district heating 12,200,000 1,914.9 plant/ solar thermal Total 12,455,038 1,989.0 1,989 100 % * Number of kilometers flown is not provided because our calculation methodology takes point of departure in take-off and landing destinations. tCO₂ At DEM, there are no boilers etc. in buildings that could contribute to own oil/gas use.

As a leading consultancy working with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, DEM assists private companies and public institutions in Denmark and abroad in converting the Global Goals into new business opportunities. As first-movers in the area, we regularly arrange workshops and present at conferences in New York where the SDGs were launched, as well as in Denmark and around the world.
