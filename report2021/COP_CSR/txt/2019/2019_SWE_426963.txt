Our sustainable business model As a company in the environmental services sector, KAABS Nordic AB has an important role to play in terms of the circular economy, where the focus is on the effective use of resources and the recycling of materials. We collect, process and sell materials that are residual products, by-products or production waste in our customers’ manufacturing processes – products that have no place in these companies’ own operations, but which can constitute valuable recycled raw materials for other businesses. KAABS Nordic AB is committed to setting an example as a responsible entrepreneur. We recognise that business ethics are central to our operations and that transparency is the key to our success. Our business model is characterised by a firm commitment to the Global Compact principles, UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals as well as continuous improvement in environment, quality, social issues, health and safety, and technical development. When we established our new office facilities in Helsingborg, Sweden, we reused and renovated offices earlier used by one of the major construction companies. Our production processes will be further improved during 2019/2020 as we are constructing and building of our new production centre in Helsingborg.

Recycling to combat climate change Recycling of metals is not only relevant from a pure business perspective but also from a socialand environmental perspective i.e. from a sustainability perspective – people – planet – profit. World population According to UN the world population projected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion in 2100. This will of course increase the demand of all kind of resources including raw materials like metals. Resource scarcity The world’s consumption of raw materials is set to nearly double by 2060 as the global economy expands and living standards rise, placing twice the pressure on the environment that we are seeing today, according to a new OECD report. A preview of The Global Material Resources Outlook to 2060 sees global materials use rising to 167 Gigatons in 2060 from 90 Gigatons today as the average global income per capita rises to converge with the current OECD level of USD 40,000. Without concrete actions to address these challenges, the projected increase in the extraction and processing of raw materials such as metals and non-metallic minerals is likely to worsen pollution and contribute significantly to climate change. The increase comes despite a shift from manufacturing to service industries and continual improvements in manufacturing efficiency, which has lessened the amount of resources consumed for each unit of GDP. Without this, environmental pressures would be worse. The projection also takes account of flattening demand in China and other emerging economies as their infrastructure booms end. Metal recycling By recycling metals we’ll achieve substantial CO2 savings compared to using virgin materials. Approximately 90% of end-of-life stainless steel is collected and recycled into new products and almost 40% of the world’s steel production is made from scrap. Recycling one tonne of steel saves 1,100 kilogrammes of iron ore, 630 kilogrammes of coal, and 55 kilogrammes of limestone and CO2 emissions are reduced by 58% using ferrous scrap. Of an estimated total of 700 million tonnes of aluminium produced since commercial manufacturing began in the 1880s, about 75% of this is still being used as secondary raw material today. By using recycled aluminium CO2 emissions are reduced by 92%. Almost 33% of the world’s demand for aluminium is met using recycled material. By using recycled cupper CO2 emissions are reduced by 65%. Almost 40% of the world’s demand for copper is met using recycled material. KAABS Nordic takes an active role in supporting this development by recycling valuable resources in a sustainable way, thus contributing by working to achieve e.g. SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production) and SDG 13 (Climate Action). 2 Doc.owner: Thomas Bergmark Last updated: 190321 3. Principles for our Sustainability Report Our Sustainability Report complies with the structure and the principles laid down in the EU Directive for Sustainability Reporting and in the Swedish legislation for Annual Reporting. We have also chosen to link our undertakings and activities to those of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are relevant to our operations, and to link our key performance indicators to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). 4. Our policies Our policies establish important principles for our business operations and provide guidelines for the actions of all employees. Our Policy describe our principles on environment, business ethics, social& working conditions and quality. Since becoming a signatory to the UN’s Global Compact in 2016, we formally apply the Global Compact’s principles relating to human rights, working conditions, environment and anti-corruption in all our business operations. 5. Materiality analysis and risk management We have analysed the most significant risks to our business and this materiality analysis constitutes an important basis for the choices we have made regarding identifying the priorities for our sustainability work going forward. Our new office premises and production plant in Helsingborg, Sweden, create the right conditions for significant improvements in terms of the work environment and the efficient use of resources. They will also address several of the most important factors identified above. Another result of the materiality analysis is our decision to certify our operations to meet the demands of the international standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and SIS OHSAS 18001. 6. Our sustainability commitments Environment Through its work to recycle steel and metal scrap, KAABS is part of the circular economy and contributes to a more sustainable future for the wider community. Scrap metal is collected, inspected, sorted and processed to comply with the quality criteria stipulated by steel mills and metallurgical plants for the use of recycled metals as recycled raw materials for new production. KAABS rents approximately 35,000 square metres of land at the Vera Park sustainable business hub in Helsingborg, Sweden. Here the company has access to 3 Doc.owner: Thomas Bergmark Last updated: 190321 state-of-the-art technology and environmental permit that enables it to receive and process up to 80,000 tonnes of steel and metal scrap every year. In Sweden, the term slaggrus is used in the industry to describe the processed bottom ash that is left after the combustion of domestic or industrial waste in an incinerator. In its capacity as a contractor to Nordvästra Skånes Renhållnings AB (NSR), KAABS processes some 40,000 tonnes of bottom ash every year from the incinerators of the energy company Öresundskraft, at Vera Park. KAABS sifts and sorts the ash into its respective fractions, removing any metals with the help of magnetic and eddy-current separators. The residue – processed bottom ash – is currently used in NSR’s premises while the various metals that have been recovered are sent to steel mills and metallurgical plants as recycled raw materials for new production. KAABS is now certified according to ISO 14001. Social conditions and workforce We take an active role in creating a workplace that is characterised by an atmosphere of social, physical and psychological good health by taking measures to prevent the risk of work injuries and work-related ill health. The minimum requirement we impose on our operations is that they comply in full with all relevant legislation, ordinances and other regulatory requirements. The provisions of the Swedish Work Environment Authority contained in AFS 2001:1 Systematic Work Environment Management form the basis for our work in this field. Work environment management activities are conducted systematically, and regular precautionary checks are made to ensure compliance with laws and regulatory requirements, and to identify, evaluate, minimise and follow-up risks. Work environment activities are conducted in a spirit of full cooperation between management, co-workers and safety representatives. All co-workers are given the opportunity to influence their own work situation. Special attention is paid to the need for individual job adaptation to facilitate employment for workers with functional disabilities. Managers within the organisation are responsible for identifying hazards, for taking and following up precautionary measures, for ensuring that co-workers are aware of the risks and for continuously acquiring the competence and information that is required to create and maintain a safe work environment. KAABS is now certified according to SIS OHSAS 18001. 4 Doc.owner: Thomas Bergmark Last updated: 190321 Human rights and anti-corruption We are a signatory to the UN’s Global Compact and recognise and respect the UN’s conventions on human rights. We accept the responsibilities that we have towards employees and the local community in which we work. We comply with the laws and ordinances that apply in the countries in which we are active. Our terms and conditions of employment meet the requirements of national legislation and/or the appropriate collective bargaining agreements, as well as relevant ILO conventions. KAABS makes every effort to set fair salaries, rates of pay and levels of reimbursement in accordance with the respective local regulations in the markets in which we operate. KAABS has zero tolerance for all forms of corruption and works actively to prevent corrupt practices. Corruption is the abuse of a position of trust to gain an undue advantage for oneself or the company, for example through the payment of bribes. It is forbidden to offer, promise or give bribes and to accept a promise of a bribe or receive a bribe. Research and development KAABS is collaborating with NSR and Öresundskraft on a research and development project to devise solutions for sorting and processing bottom ash from incinerated waste to recycle it as environmentally adapted construction material. The aim is to develop the technology so that the purified and processed bottom ash is of sufficiently high quality to be used as a safe, practical and widely approved aggregate in the building and construction industry. 5 Doc.owner: Thomas Bergmark Last updated: 190321 Memberships We are a member of The Bureau of International Recycling (BIR) as well as The Swedish Recycling Industries Association which both promotes increased materials recycling through sustainable and ethical business initiatives. In 2016, we also became a signatory to the UN’s Global Compact and we apply the Compact’s principles for human rights, working conditions, environmental concern and anti-corruption activities in our day-to-day business operations. A Sustainable Tomorrow During 2018 KAABS was one of two main sponsors of the international conference A Sustainable Tomorrow hosted I Helsingborg, Sweden. More than 300 participants listened to key-note speakers like Fredrik Reinfeldt, Jacob Trollbäck and Hanna Stanton and participated in workshops focused on practical implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We’ll continue this engagement during 2019. Please find more information on; https://asustainabletomorrow.com.se/pages/asthelsingborg/ 7.
