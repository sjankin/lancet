Looking Ahead As we all know our core business over the years has Dr. Chris Obura, been logistics which we have greatly profited from but Chairman 6 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS’ REPORT For the year ended 31 December 2018 ‘‘Our ambition is to drive a high-performance culture, remaining true to our values and our purpose; by employing expert strategies to propel our company to deliver world-class products and services.” Hector DinizCEO Dear Shareholders, While the Kenyan economy has been rough on the financial side and seen several listed companies either delist or go under due to financial pressures, we have managed to remain listed on the stock exchange and survive the storms. The real estate division which our company had hoped to kick off was delayed due to the tough bank requirements on facilities and our company’s depreciated turnover and profitability. Profit After Tax Last year (2018) we realised that our shareholders strongly believe in our management and future as we failed a takeover bid from Diniz Holdings Limited. Despite this, we have consistently reduced costs in every aspect from rent to unnecessary spending to improve liquidity and optimise performance. This year (2019) we can see a much stronger company and are proud that our losses have reduced significantly due to cost cutting measures and repayment of old claims and debts. WAY FORWARD The way forward is to dispose some assets to create increased liquidity that will reduce existing loans and can be contributed towards the commencement of our Real Estate project. This we expect to improve on the share capital and retained earnings once we finalise a Debt to Equity for some of the major loans. Therefore, Express Kenya PLC will by the end of 2019 be fully focused on the Real Estate project and will reduce our liabilities on the logistic business that once was a lucrative sector but over the past years has been a root cause for poor performance. We aim to capitalise on the real estate division that has seen rapid growth due to increased demand in both the residential and commercial sector for world-class products due to Kenya’s growing middle class with increased purchasing power. Our location is also one of the most densely populated areas. Finally, I would like to thank all our employees, partners and customers for their continuous support. We look forward to being an integral part of the lucrative real estate division and ultimately deliver world-class products to deliver the highest asset value and drive performance whilst staying true to our values. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 7 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE For the year ended 31 December 2018 The Board of Express Kenya PLC recognizes the importance of ensure appropriate, fair and timely communication of corporate governance and as such it carries out its mandate with information concerning the Company. honesty, openness and integrity and is committed to applying Board size, composition and appointments and enforcing relevant corporate governance principles, policies and practices within the Group.

Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. When we read the corporate governance statement, chairman’s statement and managing director’s statement, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance. Responsibilities of Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements The directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015 and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s internal control. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 15 REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR TO THE MEMBERS OF EXPRESS KENYA PLC Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements (continued) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. Conclude on the appropriateness of directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and “where applicable, related safeguards. “From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements As required by the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015 we report to you, based on our audit, that in our opinion: i) the information given in the report of the directors on pages 10 and 11 is consistent with the financial statements; and ii) the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report on page 12 has been properly prepared in accordance with the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015.

Report of the independent auditor pages 14 to 16. 24 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. a) Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS), as modified by the revaluation of certain items of property, plant and equipment in line with the requirements of International Accounting Standard 16 (IAS 16) on Property, Plant and Equipment. The historical cost convention is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange of assets. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into consideration when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as ‘net realisable value’ or ‘value in use’. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The financial performance of the group is set out in the report of the directors and in the statement of profit or loss. The financial position of the group is set out in the statement of financial position. Disclosures in respect of risk management and capital management are set out in Notes 25 and 26 respectively to the financial statements. Going concern At the reporting date the group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by Shs. 46,508,525 (2017: Shs. 65,247,968). During the year ended 31 December 2018, the group recognised a net loss of Shs. 69,690,695 (2017: Shs. 90,349,262) and as at the reporting date the group had accumulated losses of Shs. 427,301,050 (2017: Shs. 367,477,475) and there was a deficiency in shareholders funds of Shs. 136,858,655 (Shs. 67,168,960). The principal shareholder has continuously provided financial support throughout the years and subsequent to the year end, injected Shs. 2.4 million to enable the group to meet its obligations. The directors are of the opinion that the continued support provided by the principal shareholder is adequate and therefore consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis which assumes that the group will be in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 25 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) a) Basis of preparation (continued) New and amended standards adopted by the group All new and amended standards and interpretations that have become effective for the first time in the financial year beginning 1 January 2018 have been adopted by the company. The following standard had no significant effect on the group’s financial statements: International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9): Financial Instruments IFRS 9 requires all financial assets to be measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost or fair value (through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income), depending on their classification by reference to the business model within which they are held and s “their contractual cash flow characteristics.“ For financial liabilities, the most significant effect of IFRS 9 relates to cases where the fair value option is taken: the amount of change in fair value of a financial liability designated as at fair value through profit or loss that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is recognised in other comprehensive income (rather than in profit or loss), unless this creates an accounting mismatch. For the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 introduces an “expected credit loss” (ECL) model based on the concept of providing for expected losses at the inception of a contract; this will require judgement in quantifying the impact of forecast economic factors. For financial assets for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the loss allowance should represent ECLs that would result from probable default events within 12 months from the reporting date (12-month ECLs). For financial assets for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the loss allowance should represent lifetime ECLs. A simplified approach is allowed for trade receivables and lease receivables, whereby lifetime ECLs can be recognised from inception. The group has adopted IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The group did not early adopt IFRS 9 in previous years. Consequently, for notes and disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures have also only been applied to the current year. The comparative years notes and disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in the accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. Set out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the company. Further details of the specific IFRS 9 accounting policies applied in the current year are described in more detail in note 1(a) (i). 26 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) a) Basis of preparation (continued) (i) Classification and measurement of financial instruments The measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 and IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 are compared as follows: IAS 39 IFRS 9 Measurement Carrying Measurement Carrying category amount category amount Shs. Shs.

New Standards, amendments and Interpretations issued but not effective At the date of authorisation of these consolidated financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective for the year presented: Amendments to IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifying on the recognition of income tax consequences of dividends. Amendments to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifying the effects of a retirement benefit plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. Amendments to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing Costs’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifying that specific borrowings remaining unpaid at the time the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale will comprise general borrowings. Amendments to IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifying that IFRS 9 is only applicable to investments to which the equity method is not applied. Amendments to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ and IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 in relation to remeasurement of previously held interests on a joint operation on obtaining control. Amendments to IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifying that the existence of prepayment features with negative compensation will not in itself cause the instrument to fail the amortised cost classification. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 27 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) a) Basis of preparation (continued) New Standards, amendments and Interpretations issued but not effective (continued) IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ (issued in January 2017) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, replaces IAS 17 ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4 ‘Determining whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease’ and their interpretations (SIC-15 and SIC-27). IFRS 16 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, with the objective of ensuring that lessees and lessors provide relevant information that faithfully represents those transactions. IFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ (issued in May 2017) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. IFRIC 22 ‘Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’ (issued in December 2016) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, clarifies that the exchange rate to use in transactions that involve advance consideration paid or received in foreign currency is the one at the date of initial recognition of the non-monetary asset or liability. IFRIC 23 ‘Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments’ (issued in June 2017) effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes. The directors expect that the future adoption of IFRS 16 may have a material impact on the amounts reported. However, it is not practicable to provide a reliable estimate of the effects of the above until a detailed review has been completed. The directors do not expect that adoption of the other standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements in future periods. The group plans to apply the changes above from their effective dates. b) Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other relevant factors. Such estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively. The directors have made the following judgements that are considered to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets Management reviews the useful lives and residual values of the items of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets on a regular basis. During the financial year, the directors determined no significant changes in the useful lives and residual values. Fair value measurement and valuation process In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where level 1 inputs are not available, the group makes use of financial models or engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation techniques and inputs to the model. 28 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) b) Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) Measurement of expected credit losses (ECL): The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVTOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumption about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as: Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk; Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL; Establishing the number and relative weightings of forward-looking scenarios for each type of product/market and associated ECL; and Establishing company’s of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL. ECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. The measurement of ECLs are based primarily on the product of the instrument’s Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure At Default (EAD). Tax losses The group has not recognised deferred tax assets on tax losses. In determining whether these tax losses will be utilised, the management makes judgement as to whether these will be utilised before they are forfeited based on the requirement of the Income Tax Act. Leasehold land Land that is held under lease from the Government of Kenya has been classified as a finance lease. In forming this judgement, the directors have considered the fact that while the title to the land does not pass to the group and that the term of the current lease does not represent a major part of the economic useful life of the land, the group is expected to continually seek renewal of the lease on expiry and that such renewal will be forthcoming from the Government resulting in the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the land to accrue to the group. In addition the directors considered the prepaid lease rentals and incentives including rental commitments over the lease term to represent substantially all of the fair value of the land at the inception of the lease with any residual value accruing to the lessor being negligible thereby meeting the criteria for classificationas a finance lease under International Accounting Standard 17 on Leases. c) Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the group’s other components, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources allocated to each segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 29 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) d) Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the performance of services, in the ordinary course of business and is stated net of Value Added Tax (VAT), rebates and discounts, after eliminating sales within the group. The group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when the specific criteria have been met for each of the group's activities as described below. The amount of revenue is not considered to be reliably measured until all contingencies relating to the sale have been resolved. The group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, type of transaction and specifics of each arrangement. Sales of services are recognised upon performance of the services rendered. e) Investment in subsidiaries/consolidation Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. Control is achieved when the company; has power over the trustee; is exposed or has right to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. The group also assesses the existence of control where it does not have a majority of the voting rights power but is able to govern the financial and operating policies of a subsidiary. Control may arise in certain circumstances such as where the size of the group’s voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of other shareholders give the group the power to govern the financial and operating policies, where potential voting rights are held by the company and rights from other contractual arrangements etc. When the company has assessed and has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee. If facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of controls listed above. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss from the date the company gains control until the date the company ceases to control the subsidiary. Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Intra-group balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary adjustments are made to financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the groups accounting policy. 30 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) e) Investment in subsidiaries/consolidation (continued) Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of control Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions – that is, as transactions with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity. Disposal of subsidiaries When the group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. Business combinations The group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred to/by the group, liabilities incurred by the group to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are generally recognised in profit or loss as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ in profit or loss income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 31 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) f) Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost and thereafter stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost comprises expenditure initially incurred to bring the asset to its location and condition ready for its intended use. Buildings are subsequently shown at market value, based on periodic, but at least triennial valuations by external independent valuers, less subsequent depreciation. Any accumulated depreciation at the date of revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset, and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. Management classify the fair values of non-financial assets based on the qualitative characteristics of the fair valuation as at the financial year end. The three hierarchy levels used by management are: Level 1: where fair values are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2: where fair values are based on adjusted quoted prices and observable prices of similar assets. Level 3: where fair values are not based on observable market data and inputs. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred. Increases in the carrying amount arising on revaluation are credited to other comprehensive income. Decreases that offset previous increases of the same asset are charged to other comprehensive income; all other decreases are charged to profit or loss. Each year the difference between depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset (the depreciation charged to profit or loss) and depreciation based on the asset’s original cost is transferred from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings. Depreciation on all other assets is calculated on a straight line basis to write down the cost of each asset, or the revalued amount, to its residual value over their estimated useful life as follows: Rate Buildings over the remaining lease period Leasehold improvement over the remaining lease period Plant and machinery 8 years Furniture, fittings and equipment 8 years Motor vehicles 5 years Computer, faxes and copiers 3 1/3 years Beer containers 4 years Freehold and leasehold land are not depreciated. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. 32 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) f) Property, plant and equipment (continued) Gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are taken into account in determining operating (loss). On disposal of revalued assets, amounts in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset are transferred to retained earnings in the statement of changes in equity. g) Translation of foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies during the year are converted into Kenya Shillings (the functional currency), at the rates ruling at the transaction dates. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at Sthe rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. The resulting differences from conversion and translation are dealt with in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. h) Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Management determines the classification of financial instruments at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. The group’s financial assets which include trade and other receivables, unquoted investments and cash and cash equivalents fall into the following categories: i) Amortised cost: Financial assets that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and for which the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding and are not designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL), are classified and measured at amortised cost; The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted byany expected credit loss allowance recognised and measured. ii) Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL): Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measure at fair value through profit or loss Sand is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented in the profit or loss statement. Notwithstanding the above, the group may: on initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, irrevocably elect to classify and measure it at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition of a debt instrument, irrevocably designate it as classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 33 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) h) Financial instruments (continued) Financial assets (continued) At initial recognition of a financial asset, the group determines whether newly recognised financial assets are part of an existing business model or whether they reflect the commencement of a new business model. The group reassess its business models each reporting period to determine whether the business models have changed since the preceding period. For the current and prior reporting period the group has not identified a change in its business models. Derecognition/write off Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset have expired, when the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, or when the group has no reasonable expectations of recovering the asset. Financial instruments that are subsequently measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI are subject to impairment. Impairment The group recognises loss allowances for Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) on the following financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other compressive income (FVTOCI): cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables The loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses for trade and other receivables and for financial instruments for which: the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition; or there is observable evidence of impairment (a credit-impaired financial asset). If, at the reporting date, the credit risk on a financial asset other than a trade receivable has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the loss allowance is measured for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. All changes in the loss allowance are recognised in profit or loss as impairment gains or losses. Lifetime expected credit losses represent the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. 12-month expected credit losses represent the portion of lifetime expected credit losses that result from default events on a financial asset that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Expected credit losses are measured in a way that reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. All financial assets are classified as non-current except those that are held for trading, those with maturities of less than 12 months from the statement of financial position date, those which management has the express intention of holding for less than 12 months from the reporting date or those that are required to be sold to raise operating capital, in which case they are classified as current assets. 34 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) h) Financial instruments (continued) Financial liabilities All other financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortised cost. All financial liabilities are classified as non-current except those held for trading, those expected to be settled in the company’s normal operating cycle, those payable or expected to be paid within 12 months of the balance sheet date and those which the company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. i) Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks, net of bank overdrafts. In the statement of financial position, bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities. j) Intangible assets computer software Computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives which are estimated to be five years. k) Inventories work-in-progress Inventories work-in-progress comprise leasehold land and work in progress. These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of work-in-progress comprises all costs attributable to the real estate project. l) Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity. m) Taxation The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax Current tax is provided on the results for the year, adjusted in accordance with tax legislation. Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Currently enacted tax rates are used to determine deferred tax. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised. n) Accounting for leases The company as a lessee: Leases of assets under which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are effectively retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 35 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) n) Accounting for leases (continued) Leases of property, plant and equipment, where the group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at cost. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The interest element is charged to profit or loss over the lease period and is included under finance costs. Such property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. The company as lessor Assets leased to third parties under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position. Leased assets are recorded at historical cost less depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on the straight line basis to write down the cost of leased assets to their residual values over their estimated useful life using annual rates consistent with the normal depreciation policies for similar assets under property, plant and equipment. Gains and losses on disposal of leased assets are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are taken into account in determining operating (loss). o) Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a defined contribution staff retirement benefit scheme for its permanent and pensionable employees. The scheme is administered by an insurance company. The group’s contributions to the defined contribution retirement benefit scheme are charged to profit or loss in the year to which they relate. The group and its employees contribute to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), a statutory defined contribution scheme registered under the NSSF Act. The group’s contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to profit or loss in the year to which they relate. p) Comparatives Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year. 36 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 2. SEGMENT INFORMATION The group has three reportable segments which are the strategic business units offering different services and managed jointly. The operations of each reportable segment are as follows: Clearing and forwarding: includes distribution of products to various parts of the country on behalf of customers and handling of customers’ goods in and out of the country. Warehousing: includes storage of customers’ goods in the group’s warehousing facility. Real estate: includes the real estate development arm of the group. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The group evaluates performance based on each segment’s gross profit or (loss) before tax. For each of the strategic business units, the Managing Director (who is also the chief operating decision maker) reviews internal management reports. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is described below. Performance is measured based on each segment’s gross margin contribution as indicated in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Managing Director. As its geographic operations are confined to a single country, no disclosures by geography are applicable. All revenue, costs, assets and liabilities arise and are held in Kenya. During the year, the group made sales of Shs. 13,799,098 (2017: Shs. 19,953,213) to a single customer 13,799,097.53 that represents 52% (2017: 40% ) of total turnover. The group does not allocate tax expense to reportable segments.

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES Financial risk management The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the group's financial performance. Risk management is carried out by the management under policies approved by the board of directors. (a) Market risk Foreign exchange risk The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the United States Dollar. The risk arises from future transactions, assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. 52 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED) (a) Market risk (continued) Foreign exchange risk (continued) The table below summarises the effect on post-tax (loss) had the Kenya Shilling weakened by 10% against the United States Dollar, with all other variables held constant. If the Kenya Shilling strengthened against each currency, the effect would have been the opposite. Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 Shs Shs Shs Shs Effect on (loss) increase/(decrease) 23,031 (20,918) 23,031 (20,918) A 10% sensitivity rate is being used when reporting foreign exchange risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. Interest rate risk The group’s exposure to interest rate risk arises from borrowings. The table below summarises the effect on post-tax (loss) had interest rates been 1% higher, with all other variables held constant. If the interest rates were lower by 1%, the effect would have been the opposite. Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 Shs Shs Shs Shs Effect on (loss) increase 745,410 869,391 745,410 869,391 (b) Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables. If customers are independently rated, these ratings are used. Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors. Individual limits are set based on internal or external information in accordance with limits set by the management. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. In assessing whether the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly, the group compares the risk of default occurring on the financial asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default occurring on that financial asset as at the date of initial recognition. In doing so, the group considers reasonable and supportable information that is indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition and that is available without undue cost or effort. There is a rebuttable assumption that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 53 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED) (b) Credit risk (continued) For these purpose default is defined as having occurred if the debtor is in breach of contractual obligations, or if information is available internally or externally that suggests that the debtor is unlikely to be able to meet its obligations. However, there is a rebuttable assumption that that default does not occur later than when a financial asset is 90 days past due. If the group does not have reasonable and supportable information to identify significant increases in credit risk and/or to measure lifetime credit losses when there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an individual instrument basis, lifetime expected credit losses are recognised on a collective basis. For such purposes, the group financial assets on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics, such a s : type of instrument; industry in which the debtor operates; and “nature of collateral.“ A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired include observable data about the following events: significant financial difficulty of the debtor; a breach of contract; it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy; and the disappearance of an active market for the financial asset because of financial difficulties. The gross carrying amount of financial assets with exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was as follows: Lifetime expected credit losses Basis for measurement of loss allowance Shs Total As at 31 December 2018 Shs Shs Trade receivables 82,690,832 82,690,832 Cash at bank 2,439,873 2,439,873 Gross carrying amount 85,130,705 Loss allowance (82,409,917) (82,409,917) Exposure to credit risk 2,720,788 2,720,788 Financial assets for which the loss allowance has been measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses have been analysed above based on their credit risk ratings as follows: a) financial assets for which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition but that are not credit impaired; b) trade receivables for which the loss allowance is always measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, based, as a practical expedient, on provision matrices. 54 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED) (b) Credit risk (continued) The age analysis of the trade receivables at the end of each year was as follows: Not past 30 to 90 90 to 180 Over 180 Total due days past days past days past Shs Shs Shs Shs Shs As at 31 December 2018 1,621,420 1,026,894 524,067 79,518,451 82,690,832 As at 31 December 2017 2,585,460 3,336,207 99,055 80,034,271 86,054,993 The changes in the loss allowance during the year were as follows: Lifetime expected credit losses Basis for measurement of loss allowance Cash and Trade and Total cash equivother realents ceivables Year ended 31 December 2018 Shs Shs Shs At start of year 73,691,431 73,691,431 Changes relating to assets 41,006 8,677,480 8,718,487 At end of year 41,006 82,368,911 82,409,918 Lifetime expected credit losses Basis for measurement of loss allowance Cash and Trade and Total cash equivother realents ceivables As at 31 December 2017 Shs Shs Shs At start of year Changes relating to assets 73,691,431 73,691,431 At end of year 73,691,431 73,691,431 The company does not hold any collateral against the past due or impaired receivables. The management continues to actively follow up past due receivables. Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the group's management maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines. Notes 12 and 20 disclose the maturity analysis of borrowings and trade and other payables respectively. The following table details the group's remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have been drawn up based on undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay. 2018 Annual Report & Consolidated Financial Statements 55 NOTES Continued For the year ended 31 December 2018 25. RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED) The key assumptions made in the maturity profile are: changes in interest rates have not been accounted for as these cannot be predicted; changes in foreign exchange rates have not been accounted for as these cannot be predicted; the borrowings will be repaid based on the repayment schedule agreed with the lenders.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The group's objectives when managing capital are: to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk; to safeguard the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; to maintain a strong asset base to support the development of business; and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk. The group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, bonuses paid to directors or issue new shares. Consistently with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt : capital. Net debt is calculated as total debt (as shown in the statement of financial position) less cash and cash equivalents. Capital comprises all components of equity. The gearing ratios at 31 December 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Group Company 2018 2017 2018 2017 Shs Shs Shs Shs Total borrowings (Note 12) 325,525,334 247,478,466 325,525,334 247,478,466 Less cash and cash equivalents (Note 19) (2,439,873) (3,022,425) (2,439,873) (3,022,425) Net debt 323,085,461 244,456,041 323,085,461 244,456,041 Total equity (136,859,655) (67,168,960) (138,977,678) (66,861,222) The company is entirely funded by its lenders. 27. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The company is a defendant in various legal actions. After seeking appropriate legal advice, the directors are of the opinion that the outcomes of such actions are not expected to give rise to any significant losses other than as provided for in the financial statements (Note 21). The company has an ongoing in-depth examination by the Kenya Revenue Authority. The examination has not been concluded as at the reporting date.
