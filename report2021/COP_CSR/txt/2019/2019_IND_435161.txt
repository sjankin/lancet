Our progress in implementation has been recorded across listed verticals and locations. This report is prepared based on following three guidelines. 1. Applicable SDG’s Applicable Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) 2. Applicable Protocol The Green House Gas (GHG) Protocol  Scope 1  Scope 2  Scope 3 3. Applicable Standard ISO 14064 – 1  Direct GHG emissions & removals  Energy indirect GHG emissions  Other indirect GHG emissions www.csscorp.com Page 6 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined KEY STRATEGIC AREAS Environment Recycling & Business Travel Waste Reduction Printing IT Paper Operations GHG Emissions E-Waste www.csscorp.com Page 7 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Labour Disclosure policy Responsible Sourcing Training & Development Employee Safety Human Rights Work Culture Sustainability Anti-Corruption Anti-Bribery & Corruption www.csscorp.com Page 8 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined ENVIRONMENT Energy Efficiency & Environment Management www.csscorp.com Page 9 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Assessment, Policy and Goals: Consistent and continuing emphasis on reducing energy levels, including monitoring of energy consumption trends, identification of reduction opportunities, technology upgradation and awareness programs for staff continue to be on the priority list. We have a well articulated overarching sustainability policy to help us integrate our sustainability goals into our business processes. Implementation: Electricity – Usage of light emitting diodes (LED) and optimization of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) across facilities have resulted in significant power reduction. Printing Paper Reduction – Automated process like paperless performance appraisals, digital signatures, E-resignations and pay slips and a centralized printer management system, best in class hardware ensure lower energy and paper consumption. Introduction of lower GSM papers and mobile bill digitization has also resulted in reduction of paper consumption. Recycling & Waste Generation – Reduction in consumption of hand rolled towels (HRT) at restrooms, paper cups have resulted in reduction of waste generation. Recycling of used papers and paper products are also adopted. Business Travel – Internal process ensures travel in Kilometers (KM) are monitored accurately for all three modes of travel i.e., road, rail and air (cab bookings organized by CSS Corp alone are considered for calculation). IT Operations – Datacenter equipment’s consumes significant amount of power to keep running. With digitization adoption, the datacenter resource demand is always on an upward trajectory resulting in ever increasing power requirement. Hence it is very important to ensure datacenter systems are deployed and maintained by adopting new technologies to optimize power consumption. E-Waste – Responsible disposal of electrical and electronic wastes through authorized re-cyclers. www.csscorp.com Page 10 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Outcome: Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions There has been an overall reduction in Scope 2 global GHG emissions DECREASE IN GLOBAL of 4,26,550 KGCO2e (Kilogram of Carbon di Oxide equivalent). SCOPE 2FYEMISSIONS 19 Heating and cooling energy for Poland facility, fixed electricity Vs(%) FY 10.0 18 -, at both the Bangalore facilities are now considered and compared for 5.6 0.0 the immediate last two financial years.

CSS Corp operated vehicles are now 25719 considered and reported for two preceding financial years. FY' 18 FY' 19 7639188 SCOPE II / ENERGY INDIRECT GHG EMISSIONS (KGCO2e) 7212637 FY' 18 FY' 19 Electricity: Electricity is accounted from usage as follows: GLOBAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION REDUCTION 1. Electricity generated by respective electricity board FY (%)18 Vs FY 10.0 2. Electricity generated through diesel generator and owned by facility 17' -, 6.6 provider 0.0 FY 18 Vs FY 17' 3. Electricity generated through diesel generator owned by CSS Corp Global Electricity consumption stands at 91,66,884 Kilo Watt hour (KWhr) during the reporting period. Total reduction in electricity consumption is 6,44,553 KWhr during this period. www.csscorp.com Page 11 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Printing Paper: Reduced paper consumption through introduction of lower GSM paper, digitization of mobile bills and frequent optimization of global human resource management system, travel management system, employee transport system and transport navigation system. This also includes total rims obtained through recycling of waste paper and paper products. The reduction was equivalent to 765 KG of paper; prevented axing of 13 fully grown trees. Recycling & Waste Generation Reduction: (I) Reduction in consumption of hand rolled towels (HRT) commonly referred to as hand tissue paper used for drying of hands. This has prevented axing of 7 fully grown trees. (II) Recycling of waste paper and paper products has:  Prevented axing of 250 fully grown trees  Reduced consumption of 3,01,493 liters of water  Reduced electricity consumption of 5,120 KWhr  Reduced occupation of 12.52 cubic meter of landfill space  Reduced 10.2 metric ton of carbon dioxide that contributes to climatic changes.

SCOPE III / OTHER Cabs self-arranged by employees for business needs, vehicles provided INDIRECT GHG EMISSIONS by CSS Corp for employee daily commutation from home and office are (KGCO2e) not captured under scope III or other indirect GHG emissions. 2205386 FY' 18 FY' 19 IT Operations: We have been consciously making effort to optimize datacenter power usage by investing in various technologies. One of the important ways we handled this, was by adopting server virtualization. Instead of deploying several physical servers, we utilize server virtualization technology to meet compute demand. By adopting this virtualization technology, several hundreds of servers are virtually run on few physical servers by sharing underlying compute resources. This ensure optimal utilization of physical resources, thus reducing physical server estate and power requirements. Virtualizing server as resulted in: 1. Reduce physical server footprint and hence minimal date center space is needed 2. Reduction in power supply requirements 3. Optimal utilization of physical server resources by multiple virtual servers 4. Reduced cooling system requirement www.csscorp.com Page 13 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Electronic-Waste: E-Waste generated globally is rigorously monitored and handed over to authorized recyclers instead of handing them to the informal recyclers which then ends up in landfills. E-Waste includes CPU, laptops, monitors, scanners, etc. This leads to reduction in environment hazards & improvement of health of those employed in unorganized recycling at landfills. In total 12638 Kilo Gram (KG) of E-Waste was recycled through authorized recyclers. Electrical-Waste: Wastes such as bulbs, capacitors, coils, etc., are disposed through authorized destructors instead of disposing in landfills. This leads to reduction in environment hazards and occupying space in landfills. www.csscorp.com Page 14 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined HUMAN RIGHTS Work Culture Sustainability www.csscorp.com Page 15 of 33 Customer Engagement Reimagined Assessment, policy and goals: CSS Corp upholds Human Rights principles and applies them uniformly across the organization.
