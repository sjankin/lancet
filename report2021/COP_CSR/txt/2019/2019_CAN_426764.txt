PARTNERSHIP WITH BERKELEY LAB The memorandum of understanding signed in October with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) covers the establishment of a Québec–Berkeley (QUBE) joint research center.

Meeting people’s electricity needs in a sustainable way is of prime importance. It is also crucial to use resources wisely and preserve the quality of the environment for future generations. Québec long ago opted for hydroelectricity, a clean, renewable energy source with known, wellcontrolled environmental impacts. Today, Québec is actively involved in the fight against climate change in North America. Hydro-Québec has a sustainability vision that goes well beyond the environment. We endeavor to see that stakeholders participate in our decisions. We are also determined to contribute to the province’s economic vitality. Rivière Manicouagan.

Developments in the global energy industry were long related primarily to competition between the different energy sources—fossil fuels, hydropower, nuclear, wind and solar power, etc.—and the introduction of significant energy efficiency measures. In recent decades, hydrocarbons have benefited from the relatively lost cost of tapping shale, but the part they play in climate change makes them a decidedly less attractive option in the long term. Conversely, renewable energies are steadily growing in popularity, and they are proving to be more and more cost-effective to use. Northeastern North America has made a clear commitment to an energy transition in which clean, Éric Martel, renewable energies are assuming an increasingly important role. For many years, our electricity exports President and Chief Executive Officer have been instrumental in substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the Northeast. Today, we have large quantities of clean, flexible and reliable energy to offer and we can contribute even more to the collective effort to achieve a low-carbon economy. We did just that this past year when our hydropower offer enabled us to win the Massachusetts request for proposals for the purchase of renewable energy. VALUE-ADDED ENERGY SERVICES The current energy transition, which goes further yet, stems from two entirely new phenomena. First, it seems clear that electricity is on its way to becoming a dominant energy form at the end-use stage: the arrival of electric vehicles is an excellent example of this trend. Second, the rollout of new technologies now makes it possible to integrate multiple energy sources—intermittent, of various intensities and spread over a vast territory—into a large power grid. This was unthinkable a few years ago.

From the very beginning, Hydro-Québec’s major accomplishments have rested on technological expertise, and we will continue to attach tremendous value to innovation. However, the energy transition currently under way will utterly transform the perception of the products we offer. Our customers don’t only buy electricity; they buy a label of reliability, fairness, social responsibility and respect for the environment. In other words, they buy value-added energy services. This is the business model that is the goal of our management team’s efforts. OUR PRIME FOCUS: EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND STAKEHOLDERS To achieve our objectives and become an even better company, we have to make people our prime focus. The safety of our employees and all those who work in our facilities is our priority, and we do our utmost to ensure this safety at all times. At year-end, we published the report by an outside firm that analyzed our occupational health and safety practices and recommended ways to improve them. We are now making sure we implement the necessary changes. When it comes to our customers, we must adopt a consumer-friendly, understanding attitude. What services do they want to receive? Under what conditions? How can we improve their experience of doing business with Hydro-Québec? We are already deploying extensive resources in this area to improve the reliability of our facilities, enhance our online offer and speed up our response when outages occur. We must also listen to the people we come into contact with every day all across Québec. Our generating stations, lines, substations and administrative buildings are located in communities— both large and small—where our employees contribute to local vitality.

Our well-defined stakeholder consultation and public participation process for our projects is the product of over 30 years of experience. OUR EMPLOYEES: A KEY RESOURCE This approach of openness to the expectations of our customers and fellow citizens cannot take tangible form without our employees’ contribution. We must therefore not only recognize the fundamental role our employees play in the company’s success, but also provide them with the necessary tools so that they can negotiate the change in direction we are taking. Our employees are the company’s key resource. Whether lending a hand to their American colleagues dealing with emergencies or coming to the aid of Québec victims of spring flooding, they unhesitatingly roll up their sleeves and share their pride in belonging to the Hydro-Québec family. This openness and pride are our chief assets in implementing our new business model. I thank them for their exceptional commitment and their contribution to the company’s successes.

In the experimental component, we use the TxSS, a seismic simulator apparatus designed to study liquefaction, to define the dynamic characteristics of soils and examine their relation to soil liquefaction. It can also be applied to examine the effectiveness of the conventional method, its limits and its relevance to seismic conditions in Québec. Using the TxSS, we were able to establish a prognosis of non-liquefaction for the soils underlying the foundations of five transmission substations, contrary to the previously established prognosis of liquefaction. These new results allowed us to abandon work such as the installation of piles to straighten and stabilize foundations, and thus reduce costs and GHG emissions.

Hydro-Québec has a number of processes that show its commitment to dialogue with its stakeholders, regarding both projects and more general issues. As planned, Hydro-Québec held consultations with stakeholders in fall 2017 to determine how much information they expected to receive about the 34 sustainability issues covered. Materiality: Does Hydro-Québec provide material information on the significant issues relating to its stakeholders’ interests? The process used to determine the aspects to report appears to be consistent with the organization’s significant issues and its stakeholders’ interests. It is based on the Materiality Analysis conducted in fall 2017. It also considers the results of the recent responsiveness survey conducted after the Sustainability Report 2016 was released. Responsiveness: Does Hydro-Québec have a system for responding to its stakeholders’ concerns? In general, Hydro-Québec considers and responds to its stakeholders’ concerns. The Report content has been reviewed to consider the results of the materiality matrix presented in this Report and the conclusions of the surveys and consultations. Quantitative information and conclusion According to our assurance process, the following items were observed: [[ Hydro-Québec’s performance information matched specific indicators drawn from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards disclosures. [[ The systems and underlying processes used for managing and reporting sustainability information are reliable. [[ The data selected for verification were on the whole obtainable and traceable, and the employees responsible at HydroQuébec were able to demonstrate data origin, control methods and interpretation in a satisfactory and transparent manner. [[ The sustainability performance disclosures in the Report appropriately reflect the environmental, social and economic performance of Hydro-Québec over the period covered by the Report. In conclusion, the assurance team considers that, based on the approach used, the information contained in the Sustainability Report 2017 appears fair in all material respects and presents a reliable account of Hydro-Québec’s sustainability performance during the period.
