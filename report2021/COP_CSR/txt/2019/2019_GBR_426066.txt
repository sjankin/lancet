Consumptions: a. In 2018 TGS, despite an increase in growth, was able to reduce its fuel consumption by 6% with the introduction of Hybrid cars at the SMT level, a reduction of 6% on paper consumption through its “paperless” processes and also reduced its electricity consumption by improving the efficiency of its operations. These actions reduced the consumption of resources, thus reducing the quantity of CO2 released into the atmosphere. ii. Plastic-free policy a. TGS is fully aware that plastics and their by-products are littering our cities, oceans, waterways, and contributing to health problems in humans and animals. As a result, TGS launched a plastic-free policy in 2018 to eliminate the big amount of plastic bottle waste generated by its employees. Within its measures, TGS introduced filtration machines around the company, water jugs for meetings and provided reusable metal bottles to staff. iii. Heritage: a. As part of the new company allocation, TGS worked together with the Gibraltar Heritage trust to preserve and enhance our listed dockyard premises. iv. Design & Operational Improvements a. During the construction and design of our new premises, every effort was made to reduce our environmental impact and improving efficiencies. The new workshops and warehouses will house new and improved equipment, a solar farm, high levels of natural lighting and the introduction of improved operational processes. TGS continues with the environmental practices implemented in the company since 2014 such as: i) reuse of packaging for TGS own processes, ii) use of recycling facilities next to our own premises, reducing waste transport distances (reduced pollution/carbon footprint) and continued staff training & presentations on best practice and waste handling. 10 Toyota Gibraltar Stockholdings Ltd Communication on Progress ‘18 Feb 2019 20192015 Principle 10 Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
