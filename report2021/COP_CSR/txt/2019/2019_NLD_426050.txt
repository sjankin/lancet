Kendrion is an expert in actuation. All sensor data input and subsequent analyses and calculations are almost always translated into an action in the car or truck. And that’s where we come in. The opportunities in this segment, with developments such as autonomous and predictive driving, build on our ability to offer new solutions in the field of actuation. Every car will have numerous actuators, for opening and closing, comfort, safety, autonomous driving and climate control.’ Focus on growth ‘While we are well positioned in the traditional combustion engines market that will remain in existence for years to come, our growth will be achieved in electromagnetic, computer-controlled and smart actuation. Our markets are in the midst of a radical transformation. OEMs are developing new platforms and models and our challenge is to develop a new understanding of the requirements and demands with which our systems must comply. Not only technically, but also from an organisational point of view. The future in automotive calls for speed, co-creation, cutting-edge technology, innovation, competitive pricing and an agile, global approach. Kendrion is ready to take up that challenge. 2019 marks the beginning of new projects and opportunities, which will as always be carried out in close collaboration with our customers. In addition to our traditional projects, we will work on new dynamic and agile projects that will form the foundation for our future growth in an automotive world that is being disrupted as never before.’ 17 17 18 18 INTERVIEW FOCUS ON ROBOTICS Annual Report 2018 15 ‘Lightweight cobots call for Kendrion’ Ralf Wieland ‘Robotics are hot. Particularly developments relating to cobots, which Business Unit Manager are lightweight collaborative robots that interact with people, provide Kendrion Industrial exciting opportunities for Kendrion. We have always held a very strong Drive Systems position in the heavyweight robots field and are now actively building a position in the lightweight segment. These robots have up to eight axes of movement. Each axis has a drive and usually a brake. These are the electromagnetic brakes that are at the heart of our expertise.’ Excellent opportunities ‘In order to save space, brakes for robots must have a hollow shaft design for routing the cables inside the robot. We have succeeded in developing three new brake sizes within a very short timeframe by using our existing technology and employing agile processes. Speed is of the utmost importance in this market, which is dominated by startups. China is the main market for robots with up to a 70% share. Europe lags behind at around 30% of the market and the US is not yet a prominent market. This is why our European robot team spends a lot of time in Asia where everything is happening. Most of the start-ups are very good at programming and software development, but less experienced in motors and brakes. We help them develop their markets through our state-of-the-art brake technology, expertise and local production facilities. While our R&D is in Europe, our production and industrialisation are located in Europe and China. I expect continued growth in robotics in 2019 and foresee excellent opportunities in the years ahead.’ 17 17 18 18 INTERVIEW FOCUS ON CHINA Annual Report 2018 16 ‘Focus on growth in world’s largest industrial country’ Telly Kuo ‘China has become the world’s largest industrial country and this President clearly opens up outstanding opportunities for Kendrion given our Kendrion Asia current relatively small presence in China. Market research has revealed that China represents about a quarter of our combined markets in terms of size. With China currently accounting for only 5% of our revenue, it is obvious that we are currently underrepresented in China. We have already identified considerable market opportunities for Industrial Magnetic Systems, Industrial Drive Systems and Automotive, which point to extensive room for growth. We can potentially grow to become 5 to 7 times larger than we are now. In line with Kendrion’s focus worldwide, we concentrate in China on achieving growth in automotive and robotics.’ Largest automotive market ‘China is the largest automotive market in the world with annual sales of 24 million passenger cars and 3.5 million commercial vehicles. Kendrion excels at energy saving and emission reduction and offers winning products such as the OPF (particle filters), parklock and external sound products. We’re investing in a permanent magnet brake production line for Chinese robotics. The energy and transportation markets in China recognise Kendrion as the solenoid expert. After passing through the ‘Simplify and Focus’ strategic stages, we are now entering the ‘Grow’ stage. Our focus in 2019 will be on R&D investments, sales expansion and supply chain enhancements. Here in China, Kendrion promotes the combination of German technology and Chinese manufacturing, with Germany standing for leading technology and reliable quality and China for fast response and competitive pricing. We are convinced that we offer the market the perfect match and are confident we will rapidly gain market share in China.’ 17 17 18 18 WORLD MAP Annual Report 2018 17 Revenue (in EUR million) segmented by customer location FTE segmented by region EUROPE 49% 51% 2,071 333.7 THE AMERICAS 74% ASIA1 75.3 39.6 55% 45% 60% 40% 17% 9% 160 234 Kendrion business location FINANCIAL RESULTS EUR million Revenue EBITA2 Net profit2 EBITA %2 ROI2 Total FTE 448.6 35.4 22.6 7.9% 12.4% 2,465 1 Including other countries with revenue of EUR 2.7 million. 2 Excluding one-off costs.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 86 Reporting entity Kendrion N.V. (the ‘Company’) is domiciled in the Netherlands. The Company’s registered office is at Utrechtseweg 33, 3704 HA Zeist. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2018 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together also referred to as the ‘Group’). The Group is involved in the design, manufacture and sale of high-quality electromagnetic systems and components. Basis of preparation (a) Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations of the standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter referred to as EU-IFRS). The Company financial statements are integrated part of the 2018 financial statements of Kendrion N.V. The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Executive Board on 18 February 2019. Application of new and revised EU-IFRS In the current year, the Group has applied a number of new EU-IFRS standards (IFRS 9, 15 and 16) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union with permission to early adopt those standards. The Group decided to adopt those new standards as per 1 January 2018 in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Financial instruments (IFRS 9) IFRS 9 sets out requirements for recognising and measuring financial assets, financial liabilities and some contracts to buy or sell non-financial items. This standard replaces IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Additionally, the Group has adopted consequential amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures that are applied to disclosures about 2018 but have not been generally applied to comparative information. The transition to IFRS 9 had no impact on the opening balance of reserves and retained earnings. IFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) and Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flow characteristics. IFRS 9 eliminates the previous IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available for sale. Under IFRS 9, derivatives embedded in contracts where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never separated. Instead, the hybrid financial instrument as a whole is assessed for classification. IFRS 9 largely retains the existing requirements in IAS 39 for the classification and measurement of financial liabilities. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 87 The adoption of IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s accounting policies related to financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments. For an explanation of how the Group classifies and measures financial instruments and accounts for related gains and losses under IFRS 9, see note (e). IFRS 9 replaces the ‘incurred loss’ model in IAS 39 with an ‘expected credit loss’ (ECL) model. The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost, contract assets and debt investments at FVOCI, but not to investments in equity instruments. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognised earlier than under IAS 39. For assets in the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment model, impairment losses are generally expected to increase and become more volatile. The Group has determined that the application of IFRS 9’s impairment requirements at 1 January 2018 results in no additional allowance for impairment. The Group has elected to adopt the new general hedge accounting model in IFRS 9. This requires the Group to ensure that hedge accounting relationships are aligned with its risk management objectives and strategy and to apply a more qualitative and forward-looking approach to assessing hedge effectiveness. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the variability in cash flows arising from changes in foreign exchange rates relating to foreign currency borrowings, receivables and sales. The Group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of the forward exchange contract as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships. The effective portion of changes in fair value of hedging instruments is accumulated in a cash flow hedge reserve as a separate component of equity. Under IAS 39, the change in fair value of the forward element of the forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) was recognized immediately in profit or loss. However, under IFRS 9 the forward points are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. For an explanation of how the Group applies hedge accounting under IFRS 9, see note (e). Revenue (IFRS 15) The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below and will replace accounting policy as per note (k)(i) of the Group's 2017 consolidated financial statements. IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much and when revenue is recognised. It replaced IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control – at a point in time or over time – requires judgement. Costs of obtaining a contract: Under IAS 18 capitalised costs of obtaining a contract were part of trade and other receivables. Under IFRS 15 these assets are presented separately on the balance sheet. The impact of this change is a decrease in trade and other receivables and a new contract asset. Contract liabilities: Under IAS 18 contract liabilities were part of trade and other payables. Under IFRS 15 these liabilities are presented separately on the balance sheet. The impact of this change is a decrease in trade and other payables and a new contract liability. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 88 The Group recognises revenue at any time so that it reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This involves five steps for recognition of revenue: I. Identification of the contract with the customer (I); II. Identification of performance obligations (II); III. Determination of transaction price; IV. Allocation of transaction prices to performance obligations; and V. Recognition revenue over time or at one point in time for each performance obligation in the amount of the allocated portion of the transaction price as soon as the agreed-upon good or service has been provided or the customer receives control over it. The Group applied IFRS 15 as per 1 January 2018 using the retrospective approach applying two practical expedients. This means that the Group does not restate revenue for completed contracts that begin and end within the same reporting period or are completed contracts at the beginning of the earliest period presented. Leases (IFRS 16) The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below and will replace accounting policy as per note (c)(ii) of the Group's 2017 consolidated financial statements. As per 1 January 2018 the Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on the definition of a lease as explained in note (c)(ii). Under IFRIC 4, the Group assessed a lease based on the assessment whether: ■■ Fulfilment of the arrangement was dependent on the use of a specific asset(s); and – The arrangement had conveyed the right to use the asset. An arrangement conveyed the right to use the asset if one of the following was met: – The purchaser had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or – The purchaser had the ability or right to control the physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or – Facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insignificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the current market price per unit of output. On transition to IFRS 16, the Group elected to apply the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. The Group applied the definition of a lease under IFRS 16 to contracts entered into or changed on or after 1 January 2018. The Group previously classified leases as operating or finance leases based on its assessment of whether the lease transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset to the Group. Under IFRS 16, the Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases: ■■ ‘Right-of-use of assets’ are part of financial statement caption ‘Property, plant and equipment’. Depreciation and impairment is similar to measurement of owned assets; and ■■ ‘Lease liabilities’ are part of financial statement captions non-current ‘Loans and borrowings’ and current ‘Loans and borrowings’. Interest is part of financial statement caption ‘Finance expense’. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 89 If individual leases have similar characteristics (e.g. vehicles leased in one location from one lessor) the Group may apply the portfolio application as a practical expedient. The Group elects not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease component as a single lease component for only the following class of underlying asset: plant and equipment, other fixed assets. The Group shall combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same counterparty, and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met: ■■ The contracts are negotiated as a package with an overall commercial objective that cannot be understood without considering the contracts together; or ■■ The amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or The rights to use underlying assets conveyed in the contracts (or some rights to use underlying assets conveyed in each of the contracts) form a single lease component. The Group decided to apply the recognition exemptions to short-term leases and low-value lease assets. ■■ Short-term lease exemption will be assessed and applied on individual lease asset basis if the lease term (non-cancellable period plus reasonably certain lease term modifications) is equal to or less than 12 months and the lease arrangement does not contain a purchase option; and ■■ Individual lease assets with a new value of EUR 5,000 or less (or any other foreign exchange equivalent) are considered to be low value assets. Therefore these assets are not recognised on-balance. Accordingly, the Group shall recognise lease payments associated with those leases as an expense. Under IFRS 16, the Group continues to account for the sale-and-leaseback transactions occurred for properties in Prostejov (Czech Republic) and Engelswies (Germany). The Group recognised a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for the leaseback in the same way as for the other right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Group applied IFRS 16 using full retrospective approach. Financial statements are drafted as if IFRS 16 had always been applied. This means that the Group applies the standard to all leases in which it is a lessee and restates its comparative information. Restated consolidated financial statements For the purpose of comparison the tables on the next pages show the line items affected on the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2017 by adopting IFRS 9 (retrospective), IFRS 15 (modified retrospective) and IFRS 16 (fully retrospective) as per 1 January 2018. Adoption of IFRS 9 had no material impact. All adjustments as presented below refer to adoption of IFRS 16 except for those on financial statement captions contract costs and contract liabilties due to adoption of IFRS 15. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 90 Consolidated statement of financial position Impact of changes in accounting policies 1 January 2017 31 December 2017 As previously As previously EUR million reported Adjustments As restated reported Adjustments As restated Property, plant and equipment 85.5 14.5 100.0 90.4 15.2 105.6 Deferred tax assets 16.0 0.2 16.2 12.3 0.2 12.5 Contract costs – – – – 0.5 0.5 Trade and other receivables 54.5 – 54.5 58.1 (0.5) 57.6 Other 191.1 – 191.1 184.0 – 184.0 Total assets 347.1 14.7 361.8 344.8 15.4 360.2 Retained earnings 14.9 0.0 14.9 19.5 0.0 19.5 Other 163.2 (0.7) 162.5 160.8 (0.7) 160.1 Total equity 178.1 (0.7) 177.4 180.3 (0.7) 179.6 Loans and borrowings 63.7 15.4 79.1 50.4 16.1 66.5 Deferred tax liabilities 10.9 0.0 10.9 8.8 0.0 8.8 Contract liabilities – 5.8 5.8 – 8.5 8.5 Trade and other payables 68.4 (5.8) 62.6 72.3 (8.5) 63.8 Other 26.0 – 26.0 33.0 – 33.0 Total liabilities 169.0 15.4 184.4 164.5 16.1 180.6 Total equity and liabilities 347.1 14.7 361.8 344.8 15.4 360.2 The adjustments regarding ‘Contract costs’, ‘Trade and other receivables’, ‘Contract liabilities’ and ‘Trade and other payables’ all relate to IFRS 15 Revenue.

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except that: ■■ derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value; ■■ liabilities arising from cash-settled share-based payments arrangements are stated at fair value; ■■ the defined benefit liability is recognised as net total of plan assets and present value of the defined benefit obligations; ■■ the contingent consideration is stated at fair value. The methods used to measure the fair values are disclosed in note q. The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS requires the Executive Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgements about carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which an estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Changes in estimation methods and the impact of such changes are outlined in the notes to the relevant item. The Executive Board discussed the selection and disclosure of the critical accounting policies for financial reporting and estimates, as well as the application of these policies and estimates, with the Supervisory Board. In preparing the financial statements, the management is required under IFRS to make various judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the implementation of policy and the amounts disclosed in relation to assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions are based on experience and factors deemed reasonable in the circumstances. Estimates and assumptions are constantly reappraised. Changes in the accounting estimates used are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed if the change affects only that period, or in the period in which the estimate is changed and in future periods if the change affects both the reporting period and future periods. Executive Board made critical judgements in the process of applying Group's accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements, see notes: ■■ note 4 – tax losses not recognised ■■ note 12 – measurement of defined benefit obligations ■■ note 19 – contingent assets and liabilities ■■ note 20 – applying aggregation criteria with reference to operating segments 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 94 Executive Board made estimations concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. ■■ note 1 – assessment of useful life and residual value of assets with a definite useful life ■■ note 2 – assessment of useful life and residual value of assets with a definite useful life ■■ note 2 – management forecast and growth rate of each cash-generating unit to determine whether goodwill is impaired ■■ note 4 – utilisation of tax losses ■■ note 6 – valuation of inventories ■■ note 12 – salary and pension growth of defined benefit obligations ■■ note 14 – provisions ■■ note 17 – valuation of financial instruments Reference is made to those notes for steps taken by the Executive Board to make judgements, estimates and assumptions. Significant accounting policies The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements and by the Group entities. (a) Basis of consolidation (i) Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control refers to the authority to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its activities. When assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: ■■ the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus ■■ the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus ■■ if the business combination is realised in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree; less ■■ the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in comprehensive income (hereafter also referred to as ‘profit or loss’). The consideration transferred does not include amounts relating to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 95 Transactions costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, then all or part of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement awards is included when measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination. This determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards as compared to the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or future service. (ii) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. The Company controls an entity if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences, until the date that control ceases. The shares of third parties in shareholders’ equity and results are stated separately. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed, where necessary, to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. (iii) Composition of the Group On 4 October 2018, the Group reached an agreement to sell all shares in Kendrion Mechatronics Center GmbH to management of Kendrion Mechatronics Center GmbH for an amount of EUR 1.00. From that date on, the financial statements of Kendrion Mechatronics Center GmbH have been deconsolidated by the Group. (iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, as well as any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements. (b) Foreign currency (i) Foreign currency transactions Transactions expressed in non-euro zone currencies are translated into euros at exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies at the reporting date are translated into euros at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-euro zone currencies that are measured at fair value 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 96 are translated in euros at the exchange rates when the fair value was determined. Currency differences on foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss, except loans considered to be part of the net investment, or qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedges are effective. (ii) Translation of foreign currency financial statements Translation of foreign currency financial statements depends on the functional currency of the company concerned. The closing rate method is applied if the functional currency of the company is other than the euro. With this method, assets and liabilities of non-euro zone operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising at the time of acquisition, are translated into euros at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of non-euro zone operations are translated into euros at rates approximating the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve, which is a component of equity. On the partial or complete sale of a foreign operation, the related amount is transferred from the translation reserve to profit or loss. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from or payable to a non-euro zone operation, of which the settlement is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of a net investment in a non-euro zone operation and are recognised directly in equity, in the translation reserve. (c) Property, plant and equipment (i) Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or assumed cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses (see accounting policy g). The cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, the initial estimate, where relevant, of the costs of dismantling and removing the items and reinstating the site on which they are located, a reasonable proportion of production overheads, and capitalised borrowing costs. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. (ii) Lease At inception of a contract, the Group assess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified assets for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: ■■ the contract involves the use of an identified asset, either implicitly or explicitly specified in a contract. A capacity or other portion of an asset that is not physically distinct is not an identified asset, unless it represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset and thereby provides the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset. If the supplier has a substantive substation right, then the asset is not identified. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 97 ■■ the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of use; and ■■ the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset as the Group has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use; or relevant decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined. Predetermination means that the Group has the right to operate the asset (or to direct others to operate the asset in a manner that it determines) throughout the period of use, without the supplier having the right to change those operating instructions; or the Group designed the asset (or specific aspects of the asset) in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone process. However, the Group elects not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated non-lease component as a single lease component for only the following class of underlying asset: plant and equipment and other fixed assets. If individual leases have similar characteristics (e.g. vehicles leased in one location from one lessor) the Group may apply the portfolio application as a practical expedient. The Group shall combine two or more contracts entered into at or near the same time with the same counterparty, and account for the contracts as a single contract if one or more of the following criteria are met: ■■ The contracts are negotiated as a package with an overall commercial objective that cannot be understood without considering the contracts together; or ■■ The amount of consideration to be paid in one contract depends on the price or performance of the other contract; or ■■ The rights to use underlying assets conveyed in the contracts (or some rights to use underlying assets conveyed in each of the contracts) form a single lease component. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprise the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement data, plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same bases as those of owned assets. The right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 98 Lease liability might include: ■■ Fixed lease payments ■■ Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee ■■ Exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method representing the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate at inception date of the contract. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or in the Group’s assessment of exercising a purchase, extension or termination option. When there is a change in the scope of a lease, or the consideration for a lease, that was not part of the original terms and conditions of the lease, this is considered to be a lease modification and can result in a separate lease or a change in an existing lease. If a lease modification qualifies as a change in the accounting for the existing lease then the Group shall remeasure the lease liability based on the present value of the revised lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of the modification. When lease modifications fully or partially decrease the scope of the lease, the Group decreases the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset to reflect partial or full termination of the lease. Any difference is recognised in profit or loss at the effective date of the modification. (iii) Subsequent costs The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised as an incurred charge in profit or loss. (iv) Depreciation Depreciation is charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each component of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. Leased assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life or the end of the lease term. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 99 (v) Recognition of transaction results Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are accounted for in other operating income/other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. (d) Intangible assets (i) Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon acquisition of a subsidiary is included in intangible assets. For the measurement of goodwill at initial recognition, see note a. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment (see note g). Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in profit or loss. (ii) Research and development Research and development expenses comprise expenditure on research and development and expenses for customer-specific applications, prototypes and testing. Reimbursements from customers are offset against expenses. In addition, the expenses are reduced by the amount relating to the application of research results in the development of new or substantially improved products if the related activity meets the recognition criteria for internally generated intangible assets as laid down in IAS 38. Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalised only if the development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour, overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use, and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss when incurred. Research and development expenses incurred by the Industrial activities primarily relate to pre-production prototypes or tests for products already being marketed (application engineering). These expenses do not qualify as development expenditure, but may be recognised as an intangible asset. Research and development expenses incurred by the Automotive activities are not recognised as marketable until Kendrion has been nominated as the supplier for the particular vehicle platform or model and has also successfully completed the pre-production release stages. These release stages also serve as the prerequisite for the demonstration of the technical feasibility of the product, especially in view of the stringent demands imposed on comfort and safety technology. For this reason, development costs are recognised as an asset solely on the date of Kendrion’s nomination as the supplier and the completion of a specific pre-production release stage. The development is deemed 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 100 to have been completed once final approval for series production has been granted. As a result, only a very few of the Automotive research and development projects meet the recognition criteria. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. (iii) Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group and have finite useful lives are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and accumulated impairment losses (see note g). Based on the purchase price allocation of acquisitions, intangible assets that are part of the other intangible assets and relate to, for example, valued customer relations, trade names and technologies are also recognised. (iv) Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only if it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. (v) Amortisation Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each reporting date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. (e) Financial instuments and other investments Financial instuments Non-derivative financial instuments Recognition and initial measurement Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price. Classification and subsequent measurement Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model. A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL: ■■ it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and ■■ its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 101 All financial assets not classified as measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin. In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers: ■■ contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows; ■■ terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable-rate features; ■■ prepayment and extension features; and ■■ terms that limit the Group’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features). Financial liabilities The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in profit or loss. Offsetting Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Other investments Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. Interests in associates and the joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and OCI of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases. The associate Newton CFV is an equityaccounted investee. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 102 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional. Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less impairment losses (see note g). Recognised interest-bearing loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are carried at amortised cost with any difference between the initial carrying amount and the redemption amount, based on the effective interest method, taken to profit or loss over the respective terms of the loans. Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances and other call deposits payable on demand. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. They are measured at fair value. Other non-derivative financial instruments Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Derivative financial instruments, including hedge accounting The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met. At 31 December 2018, no embedded derivatives existed. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value, with attributable transaction costs recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are carried at fair value. Any changes are taken to profit or loss. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and certain derivatives and non-derivative financial liabilities as hedges of foreign exchange risk on a net investment in a foreign operation. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other. Changes in the fair value of a derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 103 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in OCI is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group designates only the change in fair value of the spot element of forward exchange contracts as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedging relationships. The change in fair value of the forward element of forward exchange contracts (‘forward points’) is separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. When the hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item such as inventory, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve is included directly in the initial cost of the non-financial item when it is recognised. For all other hedged forecast transactions, the amount accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve remains in equity until, for a hedge of a transaction resulting in the recognition of a non-financial item, it is included in the non-financial item’s cost on its initial recognition or, for other cash flow hedges, it is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. (f) Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs to sell. The cost of inventories of the Group is based on the weighted average cost, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their current location and condition. The cost of inventories includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. (g) Impairment (i) Financial assets The Group recognises impairments for financial assets based on the ‘expected credit loss’ model. When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating expected credit losses, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and including forward-looking information. The Group measures loss allowances at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 104 Expected credit losses are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls, being the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance to the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. The expected credit losses for significant financial assets are determined on an individual basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups of assets that have similar credit risk characteristics. All impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the reversal is recognised in profit or loss. (ii) Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the ‘cash-generating unit’). For the purpose of impairment testing, the goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. (iii) Reversal of impairment losses An impairment in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed, if the subsequent increase in the recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses in respect of other assets are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 105 (iv) Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed on initial recognition of these financial assets). Receivables with a short remaining term are not discounted. The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In determining value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. (h) Share capital (i) Ordinary shares Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effect. (ii) Repurchase, disposal and reissue of share capital (treasury shares) When own shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs and net of any tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. If treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred respectively to or from other reserves. (iii) Dividends The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as determined from time to time by the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Executive Board has the authority to decide, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, what portion of the profit will be allocated to the reserves. If applicable, the declared but unpaid dividends are recognised as a liability. (i) Employee benefits (i) Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when incurred. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or reduction in future payments will occur. (ii) Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 106 service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability (asset). The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group. An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities. Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest). The Group recognises them immediately in other comprehensive income, and all other expenses related to defined benefit plans as employee benefit expenses in profit or loss. When the benefits of a plan are changed, or when a plan is curtailed, the portion of the changed benefit relating to past service by employees, or the gain or loss on curtailment, is recognised immediately in profit or loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. The Group recognises gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs. The gain or loss on a settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settled as determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any payments made directly by the Group in connection with the settlement. (iii) Other long-term service benefits The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits other than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value and net of the fair value of any related assets. The discount rate is the yield at the financial position date on AA-credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. (iv) Share-based payment transactions The fair value on the grant date of share-based payment awards made to employees and the Executive Board is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, so that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non vesting conditions, the fair value on the grant date of the share-based payment is measured to reflect such conditions, with no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 107 (v) Short-term employee benefits A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. (vi) Termination benefits Termination benefits are expensed at the earlier of when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits and when the Group recognised costs for a restructuring. If benefits are not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date, then they are discounted. (j) Provisions A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can be measured reliably and it is probable that settlement of the obligation will involve an outflow of funds. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost. (k) Revenue (i) Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration (net of discounts, rebates, returns and excluding VAT) to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements, except for the agency services below, because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. Sale of goods and services Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods. The normal credit term is 15 up to 90 days upon delivery. The Group considers whether there are other promises in the contract that are separate performance obligations to which a portion of the transaction price needs to be allocated (e.g., warranties). In determining the transaction price for the sale of equipment, the Group considers the effects of variable consideration (e.g. early payment discount, volume rebates), the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any). If the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, the Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Some contracts for the sale of goods provide customers with a right of return and or volume rebates and or early payment discount. These conditions might give rise to variable consideration. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 108 Certain contracts provide a customer the right to apply an early payment discount when the consideration to which the Group is entitled is transferred to the Group before the contractual agreed credit terms. Those rebates are offset against amounts payable by the customer. To estimate the variable consideration for the expected future early payment rebates, the Group applies the most likely amount method for contracts with a single-volume threshold and the expected value method for contracts with more than one volume threshold. The selected method that best predicts the amount of variable consideration is primarily driven by the payment behaviour in the past and or any agreement with the customer when the consideration will be transferred. Revenue from services is recognised over time based on the cost-to-cost method. The related costs are recognised in profit or loss when they are incurred. Advances received are included in contract liabilities. Contract costs The Group recognises incremental costs of obtaining a contract and certain costs to fulfil a contract as an asset if the Group expects to recover those costs. Any capitalised contract costs assets must be amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the entity’s transfer of the related goods or services to the customer. Contract liabilities A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract. (ii) Government grants Grants are initially recognised at fair value in statement of financial position as deferred income. Grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as operating income on a systematic basis over the periods that the related costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. When the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset. When the Group receives grants of non-monetary assets, the asset and the grant are recorded at nominal amounts and released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the asset, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits of the underlying asset by equal annual instalments. (l) Expenses (i) Lease expenses The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease terms of 12 months or less and lease of low-value assets. Individual lease assets with a new value of EUR 5,000 or less (or any other foreign exchange equivalent) are considered to be low value assets. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on straight-line basis over the lease term. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 109 (ii) Net finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, and financial assets held to maturity. Interest income is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, commitment fees, accrued interest on provisions, interest on pension liabilities, impairment losses recognised on financial assets and losses on interest rate hedge instruments to the extent they are recognised in profit or loss. All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. Realised and unrealised foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities, including changes in fair value of currency hedge instruments that are not qualified as cash flow hedges, are reported on a net basis. (m) Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in profit or loss unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax, payable or receivable, on the taxable income for the year, using applicable tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the financial position date, and any adjustment to tax calculated in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: ■■ the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; ■■ relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not be reversed in the foreseeable future; ■■ arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they are reversed, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity; or on different tax entities, but the intention is to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be applied. Deferred tax assets are reduced if it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of a dividend are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend is recognised. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 110 (n) Earnings per share The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share data for its ordinary shares. Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is determined by adjusting profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. (o) Segment reporting The Group defines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Executive Board, the Group’s chief operating decision-maker. This is in conformity with IFRS 8 – Operating segments. On the basis of the criteria of IFRS 8, Kendrion’s business units are the Group’s operating segments. An operating segment is a part of the Group engaging in business activities that may result in revenue and expenses, including the revenue and expenses relating to transactions with any of the Group’s other segments. The Executive Board conducts regular reviews of the operating segment’s results to reach decisions on the resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, whereby separate financial information for each operating segment is available. However, and on the basis of the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8.12, these operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments: Automotive and Industrial. In accordance with IFRS 8, the Company also discloses general and entity-wide information, including information about geographical areas and major customers of the Group as a whole. More information on the reportable segments is provided in note 20. (p) New standards and interpretations A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective, and have been endorsed by the European Union, for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and therefore apply to the year ended 31 December 2018: ■■ IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with Customers ■■ IFRS 9: Financial instruments The standards or interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) that are not effective at 31 December 2018 however are early adopted as per 1 January 2018 are as follows: ■■ IFRS 16 Leases: The European Union has endorsed on 31 October 2017 a new accounting standard, IFRS 16 Leases. This standard eliminates the current accounting model for lessees under IAS 17: on-balance sheet finance leases and off-balance sheet operating leases. This standard applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Group decided to adopt full retrospective IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 111 The following standards or interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are not effective at 31 December 2018 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements: ■■ IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Tax Treatments (current accounting for tax treatments is in accordance with IFRIC 23) ■■ Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (Amendments to IFRS 9) ■■ Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (Amendments to IAS 28) ■■ Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (Amendments to IAS 19) ■■ Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015–2017 Cycle – various standards ■■ Amendments to References to Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards ■■ IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (q) Fair values (i) Measurement of fair value Several of the Group’s accounting policies, as well as the information supplied by the Group, require the fair value of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be determined. For valuation and information supplied, the fair value is measured using the methods below. Where applicable, more detailed information on the basis of the fair value measurement is disclosed in the specific notes on the asset or liability in question. The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of financial instruments included in the summary are given below. (ii) Property, plant and equipment The fair value of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on market value in use. The market value of property is the estimated amount for which the property in question could be exchanged on the valuation date between a buyer and seller in an arm’s length transaction, in which both parties have acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion. The market value of other items of property, plant and equipment is based on the quoted market prices of comparable assets and goods. (iii) Intangible assets The fair value of patents and trademarks acquired as part of a business combination is measured on the basis of the discounted estimated royalties that have been avoided through ownership of the patent or trademark. The fair value of customer relationships acquired in a business combination is based on the excess earnings method over multiple periods, valuing the asset in question by deducting a real return on all other assets which in total create the related cash flows. The fair value of other intangible assets is based on the expected discounted value of the cash flows from the use and ultimate sale of these assets. (iv) Lease liabilities The fair value is estimated on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the interest rate for lease contracts of a similar nature. The estimated fair value reflects movements in interest rates. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 112 (v) Inventories The fair value of inventories acquired as part of a business combination is determined on the basis of the estimated selling price as part of normal business operations, less the estimated costs of completion and the selling costs, plus a reasonable profit margin that reflects the completion and sales effort. (vi) Trade and other receivables/trade and other payables The face value of receivables and liabilities falling due within one year is regarded as a reflection of their fair value. The fair value of all other receivables and liabilities is measured on the basis of present value. The discount factor is based on the risk-free interest rate of the same duration as the receivable and/or payable, plus a credit mark up reflecting the credit worthiness of the Group. (vii) Interest-bearing loans The fair value is calculated on the basis of the present value of future repayments of principal and interest at the prevailing market rate of interest, supplemented by a credit mark-up reflecting the credit worthiness of the Group. (viii) Derivatives The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on the present value of the contractual cash flows for the remaining term based on a risk-free interest rate. (ix) Non-derivative financial liabilities The fair value of non-derivative financial liabilities is determined from information supplied and is based on the present value of future repayments of principal and interest, discounted at a risk-free rate, and a margin based on the credit worthiness of the Group on the reporting date. (x) Contingent consideration The fair value of contingent considerations arising in a business combination is calculated using the income approach based on the expected payment amounts and their associated probabilities. If appropriate, it is discounted to present value. (r) Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: ■■ credit risk; ■■ liquidity risk; ■■ market risk. This section provides general information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks in the course of its normal business operations, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included in the financial instrument section in these consolidated financial statements. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 113 The Executive Board bears the ultimate responsibility for the organisation and control of the Group’s risk management framework. The Group’s risk policy is designed to identify and analyse the risks confronting the Group, implement appropriate risk limits and control measures, and monitor the risks and compliance with the limits. The risk management policy and systems are evaluated at regular intervals and, if necessary, adapted to accommodate changes in market conditions and the Group’s operations. The Company’s Supervisory Board supervises compliance with the Group’s risk management policy and procedures. For a more detailed description of risk management and the position of financial risk management in the Group’s framework, see the Report of the Executive Board. (i) Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. Credit risks arise primarily from accounts receivable, derivative transactions concluded with banks, and cash positions and deposits held with banks. The Group continually monitors the credit risk within the Group. The Group does not normally require collateral for trade and other receivables or financial assets. The credit policy includes an assessment of the creditworthiness of every new major customer before offering payment and delivery terms. This assessment includes external credit ratings or reports if they are available. The creditworthiness of major customers is actively monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group recognises impairment provisions of an amount equal to the estimated losses on trade and other receivables and other investments. The main component of this provision comprises specific provisions for losses on individual accounts of material significance. (ii) Credit risk concentration The customer with the largest receivable outstanding accounted for 7% of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2018. In 2017, the largest customer outstanding at 31 December 2017 accounted for 6% of total trade and other receivables. Other customers individually accounted for 6% or less of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2018. The geographical credit risk from the Group’s direct customers is largely concentrated in Germany. However, as the Group’s most important customers in the various segments of the German market are multinational or global players, this reduces the Group’s dependency on the German market. (iii) Investments and financial instruments The Group currently does not invest in debt securities. Cash positions and exposure to the financial instruments of financial counterparties are monitored actively. The Group’s main financial counterparties are well-established banks with good creditworthiness. The cash in bank accounts at other than the core-relationship banks is maintained at the minimum level required for the operations of the Group’s companies. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 114 (iv) Liquidity risk The liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations at the required time. Liquidity risk management is based on the maintenance of sufficient liquidity in the form of unused (committed) credit facilities or cash to meet present and future financial obligations in normal and adverse circumstances. A summary of the credit lines available to the Group is disclosed in note 11 of these consolidated financial statements. The majority of the available facilities are provided by a syndicate of lenders consisting of HSBC, Deutsche Bank and ING Bank on an equal basis. The Group had approximately EUR 76 million available within its existing revolving credit facility on the financial position date. (v) Market risk The market risk is the risk of the deterioration of the Group’s income due to movements in market prices, such as those relating to exchange rates and interest rates. The management of market risk exposure is intended to keep the market risk position within acceptable limits. Derivatives are used to manage specific market risks. These transactions are carried out within the treasury framework adopted by the Executive Board. If necessary, the Group uses hedge accounting to manage volatility in the statement of comprehensive income. (vi) Interest rate risk Pursuant to the Group’s policy more than 50% of the exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is maintained on a fixed rate basis, taking into account any assets with exposure to changes in interest rates and expected short-term free cash flows. The policy is implemented by making use of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The Group has currently outstanding interest swap contracts with a total underlying notional value of EUR 55 million in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure to increasing market rates. EUR 20 million matures in 2020, EUR 15 million in 2021 and EUR 20 million matures in 2022. (vii) Currency risk The Group is exposed to exchange rate risks on sales, purchases, equity positions and loans expressed in currencies other than the euro. The Group companies are primarily financed in their own currency. The majority of the revenues and costs of the Group companies are realised in the euro zone. Approximately 75% of the cost base and revenues are realised in euros. Sales outside the euro zone are partly generated locally and partly through exports from the euro zone. Most of these exports are realised in euros. The Group’s activities in the Czech Republic have the most significant currency exposure, since the majority of revenue is generated in euros and part of the costs are in Czech korunas. Pursuant to the Group’s policy this currency exposure is hedged to a level of at least 70% for the next four quarters and at least 35% for the next four quarters thereafter. Exchange rate risks are hedged with derivatives. The Group also actively hedges intercompany loans in foreign currencies with currency forwards, swaps or back-to-back loans in the same foreign currency. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 115 Pursuant to the Group’s policy for other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, net exposure is maintained at an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates as required to correct short-term imbalances. The Group’s policy stipulates that, in principle, equity investments and other translation exposures are not hedged. (viii) Other price risks Steel, copper and rare earth metals used in permanent magnets are the most important commodities for the Group. Copper constitutes the Group’s main direct exposure to raw material price risks, since copper wire is an important component of electromagnets. Pursuant to the Group’s policy, the sensitivity to copper prices is actively reduced both by concluding fixed-price purchase contracts in the normal course of business with copper wire suppliers and by including raw material clauses in sales contracts. As the need arises the Group can also conclude derivative financial instrument contracts with financial counterparties to hedge the copper risk. No financial derivative contracts for raw materials were outstanding at the balance sheet date. The Group is also exposed to risks associated with rare earth metals such as neodymium, a component of permanent magnets, which are used in some of the Group’s products. Prices of these commodities have shown significant volatility in the past. The Group closely monitors developments in this market and has increased stock levels and the number of supply sources for these permanent magnets. Furthermore, agreements have been made with customers representing the majority of the sales volume in this context, to link sales prices to movements in permanent magnet prices. The Group is mainly indirectly exposed to raw material price risks relating to oil and steel, primarily as part of the purchase prices of machined components. This exposure is monitored and, if feasible, reduced by means of raw material clauses with customers and by concluding fixedprice agreements with suppliers for periods of between six and twelve months. The Kendrion steel contracts also partly govern the purchasing from component suppliers. Raw materials are purchased separately by each business unit, but in accordance with the group policy reviewed periodically with the objective of further increasing and sharing knowledge on commodities and commodity markets between business units, reducing risks and/or prices. (ix) Capital management The Executive Board’s policy is designed to maintain a strong capital gearing to retain the confidence of investors, creditors and the markets, and to safeguard the future development of the business activities. The Executive Board monitors the return on equity, which the Group defines as the net operating result divided by shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests. The Executive Board also monitors the level of dividend distributed to ordinary shareholders. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 116 The Executive Board seeks to strike a balance between a higher return that would be achievable with a higher level of borrowed capital and the benefits and security of sound capital gearing. Kendrion intends to distribute an annual dividend of between 35% and 50% of the net profit, taking into consideration the amount of net profit to be retained to support the medium and long-term strategic plans of the company and to maintain a minimum solvency of 35%. Neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are subject to any externally imposed capital requirements beyond those stipulated by law. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 117 1 Property, plant and equipment 2018 2017* Property, plant and equipment owned 100.5 90.4 Property, plant and equipment right-of-use assets 13.1 15.2 Total 113.6 105.6 Property, plant and equipment owned Land and Plant and Other fixed Under EUR million buildings equipment assets construction Total Cost Balance as at 1 January 2017 49.8 116.2 46.9 8.2 221.1 Acquired, other 3.1 11.2 5.9 11.1 31.3 Disposals (0.6) (3.3) (2.1) (6.7) (12.7) Currency translation differences (0.4) (0.6) (0.1) (0.2) (1.3) Balance as at 31 December 2017 51.9 123.5 50.6 12.4 238.4 Balance as at 1 January 2018 51.9 123.5 50.6 12.4 238.4 Acquired, other 4.0 14.1 5.7 10.7 34.5 Disposals (0.0) (3.0) (2.2) (6.8) (12.0) Currency translation differences 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.2 Balance as at 31 December 2018 56.0 134.7 54.1 16.3 261.1 * Restated due to application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 118 Property, plant and equipment owned Land and Plant and Other fixed Under EUR million buildings equipment assets construction Total Depreciation and impairment losses Balance as at 1 January 2017 23.3 76.9 35.3 0.1 135.6 Depreciation for the year 1.9 10.4 4.5 0.0 16.8 Impairment 0.1 0.9 0.0 0.0 1.0 Disposals (0.5) (2.9) (2.0) – (5.4) Balance as at 31 December 2017 24.8 85.3 37.8 0.1 148.0 Balance as at 1 January 2018 24.8 85.3 37.8 0.1 148.0 Depreciation for the year 2.1 10.0 4.9 – 17.0 Impairment – 0.2 0.1 – 0.3 Disposals (0.0) (2.7) (2.0) – (4.7) Balance as at 31 December 2018 26.9 92.8 40.8 0.1 160.6 Carrying amounts As at 1 January 2017 26.5 39.3 11.6 8.1 85.5 As at 31 December 2017 27.1 38.2 12.8 12.3 90.4 As at 1 January 2018 27.1 38.2 12.8 12.3 90.4 As at 31 December 2018 29.1 41.9 13.3 16.2 100.5 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 119 Right-of-use assets Land and Plant and Other fixed Under EUR million buildings equipment assets construction Total Cost Balance as at 1 January 2017 13.0 0.1 1.4 – 14.5 Acquired, other 2.4 0.1 0.4 – 2.9 Disposals – – – – – Currency translation differences – – – – – Balance as at 31 December 2017 15.4 0.2 1.8 – 17.4 Balance as at 1 January 2018 15.4 0.2 1.8 – 17.4 Acquired, other – 0.0 0.4 – 0.4 Disposals (0.1) (0.1) (0.0) – (0.2) Currency translation differences (0.0) (0.0) (0.0) – (0.0) Balance as at 31 December 2018 15.3 0.1 2.2 – 17.6 Depreciation and impairment losses Balance as at 1 January 2017 – – – – – Depreciation for the year 1.5 0.1 0.6 – 2.2 Impairment – – – – – Disposals – – – – – Balance as at 31 December 2017 1.5 0.1 0.6 – 2.2 Balance as at 1 January 2018 1.5 0.1 0.6 – 2.2 Depreciation for the year 1.6 0.0 0.7 – 2.3 Impairment – – – – – Disposals – – – – – Balance as at 31 December 2018 3.1 0.1 1.3 – 4.5 Carrying amounts As at 1 January 2017 13.0 0.1 1.4 – 14.5 As at 31 December 2017 13.9 0.1 1.2 – 15.2 As at 1 January 2018 13.9 0.1 1.2 – 15.2 As at 31 December 2018 12.2 0.0 0.9 – 13.1 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 120 Translation differences are calculated on the carrying amount and reflected in the related item in the cost.

The investments in software during 2018 of EUR 1.5 million (2017: EUR 2.9 million), mainly relate to upgrades of the ERP system. The other intangible assets comprise the carrying amount of customer relationships amounting to EUR 12.8 million (2017: EUR 15.2 million). These customer relationships were acquired through business combinations. Depreciation and amortisation Depreciation and amortisation are recognised in the following items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income: EUR million 2018 2017* Depreciation and amortisation 25.4 25.7 The estimated useful life of software is between three and eight years. The estimated useful life of other intangible assets is approximately between eight and fifteen years. The Executive Board reviews at each reporting period the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset with a definite useful life. * Restated due to application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 122 Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill As part of the strategy announced on 3 May 2016 'Simplify, Focus, Grow' Kendrion eliminated the divisional management layer and reduced the number of business units from seven to five. Managements' approach to manage the company from a business unit perspective has been further enforced and became fully effective as from 1 January 2017. Goodwill as recognised on the balance sheet as on 1 January 2017 is reallocated to the five business units applying the relative value approach (IAS 36.87). Goodwill EUR million 2018 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 6.7 6.4 Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 17.7 17.1 Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 7.1 7.1 Business Unit Passenger Cars 25.0 24.5 Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 35.6 35.2 Key assumptions and method of quantification The Group recognises its intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38 and IFRS 3. Pursuant to IAS 36, the Group has performed an impairment test with reference to the goodwill allocated to each individual cash-generating unit. This test was carried out by discounting future cash flows (‘value in use’) to be generated from the continuing use of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill applies and on the assumption of an indefinite life. The cash flows for the next five years were based on mid-term plans and budgets drawn up by the local management and approved by the Executive Board. The Group did not recognise any impairment of goodwill in this reporting period. For the subsequent years, the residual value was calculated on the basis of the results in the last year of relevant forecasts, with a terminal growth rate of 2% taken into account. The forecasts took no account of tax considerations, i.e. were based on pre-tax cash flow. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model was also pre-tax. Expansion investments were excluded from the calculations in the residual value. The expected growth in cash flows as a result of these expansion investments was also excluded. Key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amounts concern discount rates, terminal value growth rates and EBITA growth. Key assumptions are based on past experience and source from external sources. Discounted cash flow projections Discount rate Terminal value growth rate 2018 2017 2018 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 7.3% 7.4% 2.0% 2.0% Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 7.0% 7.1% 2.0% 2.0% Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 7.3% 7.0% 2.0% 2.0% Business Unit Passenger Cars 7.3% 7.3% 2.0% 2.0% Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 8.1% 8.1% 2.0% 2.0% 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 123 Discount rate In determining the pre-tax discount rate, first the post-tax average costs of capital were calculated for all cash generating units containing goodwill. The post-tax rate is based on debt leveraging compared to the market value of equity of 20%. All the post-tax weighted average cost of capital rates of cash generating units approximated 5.7% to 6.4%, and these rates were used for calculating the post-tax cash flows. Terminal value growth rate All cash generating units with goodwill have five years of cash flows included in their discounted cash flow models. A long-term growth rate in perpetuity has been determined on the basis of a growth rate of 2%. Sensitivity to changes in assumptions The recoverable amounts of all cash-generating units with goodwill exceed their carrying amounts. Management has carried out an analysis of sensitivity to changes in the key assumptions. The following table shows the percentage by which either discount rate (post tax) or forecasted EBITA would need to change for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount: Change required for recoverable amount to equal carrying amount Discount rate (post tax) Forecasted EBITA 2018 2017 2018 2017 Business Unit Industrial Magnetic Systems 20.7% 24.7% (82%) (83%) Business Unit Industrial Control Systems 18.0% 17.6% (83%) (82%) Business Unit Industrial Drive Systems 21.9% 19.1% (82%) (80%) Business Unit Passenger Cars 9.8% 21.3% (71%) (87%) Business Unit Commercial Vehicles 5.2% 6.7% (55%) (60%) This table shows that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions would not cause the value in use to fall to the level of the carrying value. 3 Other investments, including derivatives On 3 August 2018 Kendrion Holding USA Inc. acquired 30% of all issued shares in Newton CFV, Inc. for an amount of USD 3,000,000. Newton CFV is a US based company for flow control valves for the food and beverage industry. This minority share of 30% enables the Group to enter a strategic partnership for the development and manufacturing of innovative constant flow valves for the food and beverages industry. All acquired shares are preferred shares whereas Kendrion Holding USA Inc. is entitled to receive dividend in preference to holders of ordinary shares. The proportion voting rights held by Kendrion Holding USA Inc. is 30%. Kendrion Holding USA Inc. is entitled to convert the preferred shares into ordinary shares at an agreed upon conversion rate. Other investments in 2018 include financial derivatives and recognised upfront and legal fees related to the facility agreement (see note 11). Kendrion amortises these costs over the remaining maturity of the facility. As these costs relate to the facility agreement as a whole and not to individual loans, these costs are not part of the effective interest rate of outstanding loans. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 124 4 Deferred tax assets and liabilities The Group has recognised deferred tax assets for tax loss carry-forwards in the following jurisdictions: Germany Tax assessments have been submitted for the German companies up to and including 2016. In 2017 tax audits started with regard to the assessment periods 2012-2014 with reference to our Northern Germany operating companies (years up to and 2011 are final) and assessment periods 2010-2014 with respect to our Southern Germany operating companies (years up to and 2009 are final). Only the tax audit of the assessment period 2010-2014 at Kendrion Markdorf is closed. Our operating company in Central Germany, Kendrion Aerzen, has been audited up to and including 2008 and the tax audit started in 2017 relates to assessment periods 2009-2014. At 31 December 2018 tax loss carry forwards amounted to EUR 9.5 million (‘Gewerbesteuer’) and EUR 14.9 million (‘Körperschaftsteuer’). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 3.1 million (2017: EUR 3.5 million). United States of America Tax assessments have been submitted up to and including 2017. The years 2015 up to 2017 are open for tax audits. At 31 December 2018 the tax loss carry forwards amounted to EUR 2.6 million (2017: EUR 2.7 million). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 0.5 million (2017: EUR 0.6 million). The Netherlands Tax assessments have been submitted up to and including 2016. The years 2012 up to 2018 are still open for potential tax audits. At 31 December 2018 the tax loss carry-forwards amounted to EUR 1.6 million (2017: EUR 3.4 million). These are recognised in full, resulting in deferred tax assets of EUR 0.4 million (2017: EUR 0.8 million). These tax loss carry-forwards originated in 2012. The Dutch corporate income tax rate will decrease from 25% in 2018 to 24.3% in 2019, 23.9% in 2020 and 22.25% in 2021. This new legislation means that deferred tax positons as per 31 December 2018 are revalued and had a negative impact of EUR 0.5 million on net deferred taxes as per 31 December 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 125 Deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the financial position The deferred tax assets and liabilities can be specified as follows: EUR million Assets Liabilities Net 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Property, plant and equipment 1.8 0.3 5.0 3.1 (3.2) (2.8) Intangible assets 3.1 3.6 4.8 5.2 (1.7) (1.6) Inventories 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 (0.0) Employee benefits 1.6 1.6 0.0 – 1.6 1.6 Provisions 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.2 0.2 (0.0) Other items 2.1 1.7 0.1 0.1 2.0 1.6 Tax value of recognised loss carry-forwards 4.0 4.9 – – 4.0 4.9 Deferred tax assets/liabilities 13.2 12.5 10.2 8.8 3.0 3.7 The deferred tax liabilities relate almost entirely to temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax base of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. These are of a relatively long-term nature, mostly longer than five years. Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be set off. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed if the probability of future taxable profits improves. Tax loss carry forward limitation rules apply in certain jurisdictions in which Kendrion has carry forward tax losses. These rules might under certain circumstances lead to a (proportional) forfeiture of recognised and unrecognised carry forward tax losses in case of a direct or indirect change in ownership. The tax losses carry forward for which no deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position are reviewed each reporting date. These tax losses carry forward for which no deferred tax assets are recognised in the statement of financial position amount to EUR 2.7 million (expires in period 2024-2029). 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 126 Movement in temporary differences during the financial year Net, EUR million 2018 Recognised in other Recognised comprehensive At 31 At 1 January in profit or loss income December Property, plant and equipment (2.8) (0.4) – (3.2) Intangible assets (1.6) (0.1) – (1.7) Inventories (0.0) 0.1 – 0.1 Employee benefits 1.6 (0.1) 0.1 1.6 Provisions (0.0) 0.2 – 0.2 Other items 1.6 0.4 – 2.0 Tax value of loss carry-forwards used 4.9 (0.9) – 4.0 3.7 (0.8) 0.1 3.0 Net, EUR million 2017 Recognised in other Recognised comprehensive At 31 At 1 January in profit or loss income December Property, plant and equipment (3.3) 0.5 – (2.8) Intangible assets (2.5) 0.9 – (1.6) Inventories 0.2 (0.2) – (0.0) Employee benefits 2.2 (0.4) (0.2) 1.6 Provisions (0.1) 0.1 – (0.0) Other items 1.8 (0.2) – 1.6 Tax value of loss carry-forwards used 7.0 (2.1) – 4.9 5.3 (1.4) (0.2) 3.7 In 2018, the net amount from the movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities, presented as tax in the statement of comprehensive income, is negative EUR 0.8 million (2017: negative EUR 1.4 million). 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 127 5 Contract costs EUR million 2018 2017 Balance at 1 January 0.5 – Costs to obtain a contract with customers – 0.5 Amortisation 0.1 – Other changes – – Balance at 31 December 0.4 0.5 In 2017 the Group acquired a contract with a customer for which costs are made to acquire this contract.

During 2018, the Company delivered 10,533 shares to the Executive Board and senior management as part of its share plan and remuneration packages (2017: 8,272). The Company purchased 178,852 of its own shares in 2018 (2017: 123,429). 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 129 Ordinary shares The authorised share capital consists of: EUR million 2018 2017 40,000,000 ordinary shares of EUR 2.00 80.0 80.0 Issued share capital Balance at 1 January 2018: 13,517,620 ordinary shares (2017: 13,396,034) 27.0 26.8 Balance at 31 December 2018: 13,574,865 ordinary shares (2017: 13,517,620) 27.1 27.0 Share premium EUR million 2018 2017 Balance as at 1 January 49.6 56.4 Dividend payment (11.6) (10.5) Share premium on issued shares 1.8 3.7 Balance as at 31 December 39.8 49.6 Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of associates in the non-euro zone. Gains and losses relating to the translation risk are recognised in equity. The build-up of the cumulative figure commenced on 1 January 2004. Hedge reserve The hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net movement in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, net of tax. The net movement was EUR 0.7 million negative (2017: EUR 0.6 million, positive). The hedge reserve increased by EUR 0.1 million due to the realisation of hedged transactions (2017: EUR 0.4 million increase). The hedge reserve decreased by EUR 0.8 million due to valuation effects (2017: EUR 0.2 million increase). There was no hedge ineffectiveness in 2018 (2017: EUR 0.0 million). Reserve for own shares (treasury shares) The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the shares held by the Company for issueance of share dividend and the remuneration packages for the Executive Board. At 31 December 2018, the Company held 178,852 of its own shares (2017: 121,586). 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 130 Other reserves Other reserves are all the reserves other than those shown separately and primarily represent the accumulated, undistributed profits from previous financial years. Retained earnings In 2018, the result for 2017 was fully transferred to other reserves. Retained earnings in the 2018 financial statements consequently consist solely of the result for 2018. 10 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of the basic earnings per share at 31 December 2018 is based on the profit for the period of EUR 13.8 million (2017: EUR 19.5 million) attributable to the holders of ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year 2018: 13,396,000 (2017: 13,446,000).

The Credit Facility is committed until 27 July 2023 and includes an option (accordion option) to increase the facility by a maximum of EUR 75.0 million and the possibility to attract additional alternative sources of debt funding; ■■ EUR 14.0 million in leases for buildings, various equipment and vehicles; ■■ EUR 3.1 million mortgage loan for the premises of the Kuhnke facilities in Malente, Germany. The loan ultimately matures in 2022; ■■ EUR 0.3 million in subsidised term loans with final maturity in 2019; ■■ EUR 1.0 million in other overdraft facilities. At 31 December 2018, the total unutilised amount of the facilities was approximately EUR 76 million. Banking syndicate credit facility Pursuant to the terms of the credit facility with the banking syndicate, the Group has agreed to a financial covenant relating to the leverage ratio (interest bearing debt / EBITDA). In accordance with this covenant, the leverage ratio should remain below 3.0, which can under certain circumstances be temporarily increased to a maximum of 3.5. This covenant is tested quarterly on a 12-month rolling basis. The actual leverage ratio at year-end was 1.1 (2017: 1.0). Security provided The Group has provided a mortgage on its premises in Malente, Germany for a EUR 3.1 million loan. No security is provided in relation to the EUR 150 million revolving Credit Facility. Interest-rate sensitivity Interest on the EUR 3.4 million other loans is based on fixed-term interest rates. Interest amounts payable on the EUR 150 million revolving Credit Facility are based on short-term interest rate (mainly three months). See note 17 and accounting policy r for further details. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 133 Lease liabilities The lease liabilities are payable as follows: EUR million 2018 2017* ‹ 1 year 2.1 2.4 1 – 5 years 7.9 9.1 › 5 years 4.0 4.7 14.0 16.2 The lease liabilities mostly relate to leases for various buildings, vehicles and equipment. For the right-of-use lease assets see note 1. For short-term leases and leases of low-value see note 24. For interest expenses related to lease liabilities see note 25. Buildings The Group leases properties for its offices and manufacturing facilities. Some lease arrangements contain conditions to revise the rentals based on changes of indices. The leases run for a period between 3 and 15 years. Majority of the leases include an option to renew the lease for an additional period after the contract term. Key assumption as applied by the Group is that all renewal options, which can be exercised within the mid-term plan period of five years and very likely to be exercised, are taken into consideration on top of the non-cancellable period of the lease. Vehicles and equipment The Group leases equipment with terms of two to five years. Based on experience the likelyhood that these lease arrangements are extended for a substantial period (> three months) is remote. Due to this no periods after the non-cancellable period of the lease are taken into consideration. 12 Employee benefits EUR million 2018 2017 Present value of unfunded obligations 14.5 14.6 Present value of funded obligations 1.4 1.5 Fair value of plan assets (0.9) (0.9) Recognised net liability for defined benefit obligations 15.0 15.2 Liability for long-service leave and anniversaries 4.2 3.9 Total employee benefits 19.2 19.1 * Restated due to application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 134 Movement in net liability for defined benefit obligations recognised in the statement of financial position EUR million 2018 2017 Recognised net liability for defined benefit obligations at 1 January 15.2 18.2 Expense recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 0.3 (1.0) Benefits paid (1.0) (1.0) Other movements (including currency differences and employer contributions paid) – (0.2) Actuarial (gains) losses in other comprehensive income 0.5 (0.8) Recognised net liability for defined benefit obligations at 31 December 15.0 15.2 Movement in plan assets EUR million 2018 2017 Fair value of plan assets at 1 January 0.9 4.4 Contributions paid employer – 0.1 Contributions paid participants – 0.0 Benefits paid (0.0) (0.1) Assets distributed on settlements and curtailments – (3.5) Return on plan assets 0.0 0.0 Actuarial gains (losses) in other comprehensive income (0.0) 0.0 Fair value of plan assets at 31 December 0.9 0.9 Expense recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income regarding defined benefit arrangements EUR million 2018 2017 Current service costs 0.1 0.2 Past service costs including losses/(gains) on settlements and curtailments – (1.4) Net interest 0.2 0.2 0.3 (1.0) Effective return on plan assets 0.0 0.0 The expenses relating to the defined benefit pension arrangements are included in the following line items of the statement of comprehensive income: EUR million 2018 2017 Staff costs 0.1 (1.2) Net finance costs 0.2 0.2 0.3 (1.0) 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 135 Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages) 2018 2017 Discount rate at 31 December 1.5% 1.5% Future salary increases 0.1% 0.2% Future pension increases 1.7% 1.7% Historical information EUR million 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Net liability for defined benefit obligations 15.9 16.1 22.6 22.9 22.3 Fair value of plan assets 0.9 0.9 4.4 5.6 5.0 Deficit in plan 15.0 15.2 18.2 17.3 17.3 Actuarial calculations of employee benefits have not been materially influenced by amendments based on historical experience or by variable assumptions.

In the case of defined contribution plans, the contribution is charged to the year to which it relates. With defined benefit plans, benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Calculations are made by qualified actuaries. The pension liability shown in the statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the financial position date minus the fair value of the plan assets at this date. The discount rate methodology for accounting long-term employee benefits in accordance with IAS 19 is determined by the Executive Board. Significant judgement is required when setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation is based on the yield on AA-rated high-quality corporate bonds issued in Euros. Since the pension arrangements involve long-term obligations and uncertainties, it is necessary to make assumptions in order to estimate the amount that the Group needs to invest to fund its pension obligations. External actuaries calculate the obligation for defined benefit plans partly on the basis of information provided by the Executive Board, such as future pay rises, the return on plan assets, mortality tables and the probable extent to which pension scheme members will leave the scheme because they have reached retirement age, become incapacitated or left the Group. The greater part of the defined benefit obligation at year-end 2018 relates to post employment arrangements in Germany. The group companies account individually for the pension schemes. The individual group company is fully liable for its benefit obligation. A portion for the German group companies is reinsured. All pension arrangements accounted for as defined benefit obligations are not open for new participants (< 15% active participants) except for the pension arrangement of Kendrion Switzerland. This pension arrangement is a contribution-based plan and pension premiums paid to the multi-employer fund are vested rights for plan participants. Kendrion Switzerland is liable for any shortfall (if any) of the multi-employer fund in which Kendrion Switzerland participates. In 2016 the Group decided to close the manufacturing facility in Switzerland. In 2017 the pension arrangement of Kendrion Switzerland is settled and resulted in a settlement gain of EUR 1.4 million. This settlement gain is recognised as service cost credit in 2017, see also note 23. Liabilities arising from employee benefits also include liabilities relating to long-service, early retirement and service anniversaries of EUR 4.2 million (2017: EUR 3.9 million) in Germany and Austria. 13 Share-based payments At 31 December 2018, the Group had the following share-based payment arrangements. Share plan for the Executive Board (equity settled) Details of the remuneration of the Executive Board are provided in note 28. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 137 Loyalty bonus (equity settled) The Group had a share incentive programme, which entitled certain managers to purchase shares in the Company for an amount up to 50% of their respective net cash bonuses. Employees who retain these shares for three years and remain in service for three years become entitled to a number of shares equal to the number of shares they individually purchased. Pursuant to this incentive programme, a total of 2,160 shares was issued in 2018, resulting from shares granted in 2015. Expenses recognised in profit or loss for the shares amount to EUR 0.2 million (2017: EUR 0.2 million).

The remainder of the restructuring provision is expected to be used in the course of 2019, however the exact timing is not known yet. The amounts and timing of the outflows related to the tax audits are expected to be finalised in 2019 however they are still uncertain. The provisions used during the period include the usage of restructuring provisions of EUR 3.3 million and the usage of other provisions of EUR 0.2 million. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 138 15 Contract liabilities EUR million 2018 2017 Balance at 1 January 8.5 5.8 Consideration received – 2.7 Recognised as revenue in the period 0.3 – Other changes – – Balance at 31 December 8.2 8.5 The contract liabilities relate to long-term advance consideration received from customers for investments made in equipment in order to fulfil the obligations according to the contract. Considerations are received and based on a mark-up on top of contractual agreed piece price during a certain period of time. Recognition is consistent with the Group’s transfer of the related goods to the customer and released to profit or loss on a systematic basis that is consistent with depreciation and amortisation of related equipment. 16 Trade and other payables EUR million 2018 2017* Trade payables 41.7 43.8 Other taxes and social security contributions 0.9 0.9 Derivatives used for hedging 0.5 0.1 Non-trade payables and accrued expenses 16.1 19.0 59.2 63.8 17 Financial instruments Credit risk The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit risk.

At 31 December 2018 the provision for impairment losses on trade and other receivables relates to several customer invoices that the Group believes to be non-collectible, in whole or in part. Based on historic payment behaviour and financial information currently known all receivables that are not impaired at 31 December 2018 are collectible. EUR 4.7 million of trade receivables are 30 days overdue, of which EUR 0.5 million is provided for. The Group has written off less than EUR 0.1 million receivables in 2018 (2017: less than EUR 0.1 million), which are recognised under other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income. The customer with the largest trade receivables outstanding accounted for 7% of the trade and other receivables at 31 December 2018. At 31 December 2017 the largest customer accounted for 6% of total receivables. The geographical credit risk from the Group’s direct customers is largely concentrated in Germany. However, as the Group’s most important customers in the various segments of the German market are multinational or global players this reduces the Group’s dependency on the German market. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 140 Credit risk rating grades The credit quality of the Group’s financial assets, contract assets and financial guarantee contracts, as well as the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk by credit riks rating grades on the reporting date was as follows: 31 December 2018 2017 External Internal 12-month Gross carrying Loss Net carrying Note credit rating credit rating or lifetime ECL amount allowance amount Trade receivables 7 N/A Low risk Doubtful Lifetime ECL 48.5 (0.5) 48.0 Contract costs 5 N/A Low risk Lifetime ECL 0.4 – 0.4 Equity-accounted investee 3 N/A Low risk Lifetime ECL 2.6 – 2.6 Other investments 3 N/A Low risk Lifetime ECL 0.7 – 0.7 52.2 (0.5) 51.7 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 141 Liquidity risk The contractual terms of the financial obligations, including the estimated interest payments and repayment obligations, are set out below. 31 December 2018 Contractual EUR million Carrying amount cash flows 0 – 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 2 years 2 – 5 years › 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank syndicate loans 64.0 (66.4) (0.3) (0.3) (0.5) (65.3) – Lease liabilities 14.0 (16.3) (1.3) (1.3) (2.4) (7.1) (4.2) Bank overdrafts 9.3 (9.3) (9.3) – – – – Other loans and borrowings 3.4 (3.6) (0.6) (0.6) (0.8) (1.6) – Trade and other payables 67.4 (67.4) (67.4) – – – – Tax liabilities 1.6 (1.6) (1.6) – – – – Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swap contracts 0.3 (0.4) (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) (0.1) – Forward exchange contracts 0.3 (0.3) (0.2) (0.1) – – – Total 160.3 (165.3) (80.8) (2.4) (3.8) (74.1) (4.2) 31 December 2017 Contractual EUR million Carrying amount cash flows 0 – 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 2 years 2 – 5 years › 5 years Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank syndicate loans 46.0 (47.2) (0.3) (0.3) (46.6) – – Lease liabilities* 16.2 (19.0) (1.4) (1.4) (2.8) (6.0) (7.4) Bank overdrafts 11.7 (11.7) (11.7) – – – – Other loans and borrowings 4.3 (4.9) (0.6) (0.6) (1.2) (2.5) – Trade and other payables 72.3 (72.3) (72.3) – – – – Tax liabilities 1.4 (1.4) (1.4) – – – – Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swap contracts 0.1 (0.1) (0.0) (0.0) (0.1) (0.0) – Forward exchange contracts – – – – – – – Total 152.0 (156.6) (87.7) (2.3) (50.7) (8.5) (7.4) * Prior year (2017) restated due to adoption of IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 142 It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis should occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts. Within the scope of the Group’s risk management the Group has hedged the currency and interest risks with derivatives, whereby the hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges.

In view of the Treasury Policy, the Group hedges at least 50% of the floating interest rate exposure. To this extent the Group has outstanding interest rate swaps with a notional amount of in total EUR 55 million. The aggregate fair value of the outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 December 2018 was EUR 0.3 million negative (2017: EUR 0.1 million negative). The following table shows the interest rates prevailing at the financial position date for interest-bearing financial liabilities. The majority of all interest expenses relate to senior bank loans. The effective interest rate of these loans equalise the nominal interest rate. The EUR 3.1 million mortgage loan was acquired through business combinations in 2013 and initially recorded at fair value. The effective interest rate of the loan is 3.7%. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 144 Other loans are not provided at an upcount or discount and no incremental transaction costs were incurred when the loans were drawn. 2018 2017* Nominal Year of Carrying Carrying Currency interest redemption Fair value amount Fair value amount Banking syndicate loans EUR IBOR + 0.8% 2023 64.0 64.0 46.0 46.0 Mortgage loan EUR 6.4% 2022 3.2 3.1 3.9 3.7 Other loans EUR 3.5% 2019 0.3 0.3 0.6 0.6 Bank overdrafts Various IBOR + 0.8% 2019 9.3 9.3 11.7 11.7 Lease liabilities* Various 2.0% 7.8% Various 14.0 14.0 16.2 16.2 Total interest-bearing debt 90.8 90.7 78.4 78.2 * Restated due to application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018. Sensitivity analysis interest Financial assets and liabilities with a fixed interest rate are not recognised at fair value by processing the value changes in profit or loss. For this reason a movement in interest rates across the yield curve at 1 January 2018 would not have had a material effect on the 2018 profit for the period. The Group has hedged a considerable part of the floating interest rate exposure by means of interest rate swaps. When taking into account these swaps and the loans with a fixed rate, in total EUR 58.3 million of the EUR 76.7 million long-term and short-term loans, excluding lease liabilities, at financial year-end have an interest rate which is fixed for one year or longer. Based on the interest bearing debt levels at year-end and expected cash flow development, a 1% point increase in the interest rate across the yield curve as from 1 January 2019, will have an increasing effect on interest expenses in 2019 of maximum EUR 0.2 million. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 145 Exchange rate risk The aggregate fair value of the outstanding forward exchange rate contracts concluded to hedge anticipated transactions was negative EUR 0.2 million at 31 December 2018 (2017: positive EUR 0.4 million). A 10% point appreciation of the currencies listed hereafter against the euro would increase shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2018 and the result for 2018 by the amounts shown in the following table. A 10% point depreciation of the listed currencies against the euro would have had the opposite effect. The same test was done for the profit or loss, where the sensitivities for a 10% appreciation or depreciation on 31 December would have had an impact as is shown below. 31 December 2018 Equity Result US dollar 5.0 0.0 Czech koruna 0.5 (0.1) Chinese yuan 1.7 0.3 Romanian lei 1.0 0.3 31 December 2017 Equity Result US dollar 4.7 (0.0) Czech koruna 0.2 (0.2) Chinese yuan 0.4 0.1 Romanian lei 1.2 0.5 Principal exchange rates during the reporting period were as follows: Applicable currency rates Value of EUR At 31 December 2018 At 31 December 2017 Average over 2018 Pound sterling 0.8945 0.8872 0.8858 Czech koruna 25.7241 25.5350 25.6581 Chinese yuan 7.8751 7.8044 7.8148 US dollar 1.1450 1.1993 1.1803 Romanian lei 4.6635 4.6585 4.6556 Swedish krona 10.2548 9.8438 10.2541 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 146 Fair values of financial instruments The following table shows the fair values and carrying amounts of the financial instruments: EUR million 2018 2017* Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value Assets carried at amortised costs Receivables (including current tax assets) 55.2 55.2 58.6 58.6 Cash and cash equivalents 10.2 10.2 7.6 7.6 Held to maturity investments 3.1 3.1 0.2 0.2 68.5 68.5 66.4 66.4 Liabilities carried at amortised costs Banking syndicate loans (64.0) (64.0) (46.0) (46.0) Mortgage loan (3.1) (3.2) (3.7) (3.9) Other loans (0.3) (0.3) (0.6) (0.6) Lease liabilities (14.0) (14.0) (16.2) (16.2) Bank overdraft (9.3) (9.3) (11.7) (11.7) Trade and other payables (including current tax liabilities) (69.0) (69.0) (73.7) (73.7) (159.7) (159.8) (151.9) (152.1) Liabilities carried at fair value Interest derivatives (0.3) (0.3) (0.1) (0.1) Forward exchange contracts (0.2) (0.2) 0.4 0.4 (0.5) (0.5) 0.3 0.3 * Restated due to application of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS 16 as per 1 January 2018.

The forward exchange contracts and interest derivatives are included in the trade and other payables in the statement of financial position. 17 18 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report 2018 147 Interest rate used in measuring fair value The interest rate used for discounting estimated cash flows, where applicable, is based on the swap curve at 31 December, augmented by the prevailing credit mark-up, and is as follows: 2018 2017 Derivatives 0.0% 0.0% Leases 0.8% 1.4% Banking syndicate loans 0.8% 1.4% Mortgage loans 1.1% 1.8% Other loans 1.1% 1.8% Fair value hierarchy In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. The fair value calculation method of all assets and liabilities carried at amortised costs is categorised in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows: level 1 quoted prices (unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities); level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Kendrion denies all claims and has issued a counterclaim. The facts and circumstances known to date do not justify that a provision is taken. Contingent liabilties The Group had guarantees in particular with regard to rentals, financing facilties and post employee benefits totalling to EUR 1.5 million (2017: EUR 1.5 million). The Group has divested itself of a number of companies in the past. The customary representations and warranties for transactions of this nature are included in the relevant share or asset purchase agreements. The Group, as is customary for transactions of this nature, also issued representations and warranties for potential (tax) claims relating to periods prior to the various divestment dates. 20 Operating segments The Group, in accordance with IFRS 8, has included general and entity-wide disclosures in these consolidated financial statements.

The CEO’s gross variable remuneration amounts to EUR 117,816 (2017: EUR 170,748) which will be paid in cash. Members of the Executive Board have to invest at least 20% of the net amount of the payout of the short-term incentive earned until the required ownership level has been reached as prescribed under Kendrion’s ‘Share ownership guideline’. The achievement of the performance criteria set for 2018 was 40% for the CFO (2017: 90%). CFO will, based on this performance, receive a variable remuneration of 14% of his gross fixed remuneration. The CFO’s gross variable remuneration amounts to EUR 47.035 (2017: EUR 102,251) which will be paid in cash. The CFO resigned voluntarily as per 1 January 2019.

Based on actual performance for the periods 2016-2018 (40%) and 2017-2019 (40% time pro-rated), CFO receives 3,057 shares as long-term variable remuneration. These share grants will be paid out in cash against the average share price in the fourth quarter up to and including 4 December 2018. This results in a cash settlement amount of EUR 189,931. The amount charged to the profit or loss regarding the long-term variable remuneration policy was EUR 1,018 (2017: EUR 241,570). Any applicable holding period for shares held by the CFO expires per 1 January 2019 as a consequence of his resignation per the same date.

The profit remaining after transfer to the reserves is available to the General Meeting of Shareholders. The Company can only make payments to the shareholders and other parties entitled to the distributable profit insofar as the shareholders’ equity exceeds the paid-up and called-up part of the capital plus the statutory reserves and exceeds the amounts resulting from the distribution test, performed by the Executive Board at the date of each dividend payment. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 165 To the Shareholders and the Supervisory Board of Kendrion N.V. Independent auditor’s report Report on the audit of the financial statements 2018 included in the annual report Our opinion We have audited the accompanying financial statements 2018 of Kendrion N.V., based in Zeist. The financial statements include the consolidated financial statements and the company financial statements. In our opinion: ■■ The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Kendrion N.V. as at December 31, 2018, and of its result and its cash flows for 2018 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. ■■ The accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Kendrion N.V. as at December 31, 2018, and of its result for 2018 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The consolidated financial statements comprise: ■■ The consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2018. ■■ The following statements for 2018: the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows. ■■ The notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. The company financial statements comprise: ■■ The company balance sheet as at December 31, 2018. ■■ The company profit and loss account for 2018. ■■ The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for our opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements” section of our report. We are independent of Kendrion N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding the statutory audit of publicinterest entities, the ‘Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties’ (Wta, Audit Firms Supervision Act), the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 166 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Materiality Based on our professional judgment we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at EUR 1,900,000 (2017: EUR 1,400,000). The materiality is based on 7.5% of the 2017 profit before tax. We have also taken into account misstatements and/or possible misstatements that in our opinion are material to the users of the financial statements for qualitative reasons. Based on the actual 2018 profit before tax, which was 18% lower than in 2017, we have reassessed our materiality level considering several factors including the range of the benchmark and alternative bases such as EBITDA (reported and normalized) and the effect of non-recurring gains and losses. We also considered the component materiality applied on audit procedures performed at component level, which does not exceed 60% of group materiality. We concluded that the materiality is appropriate. We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements in excess of EUR 95 thousand, which are identified during the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller misstatements that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds. Scope of the group audit Kendrion N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements of Kendrion N.V.. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect, we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. Kendrion N.V. is divided into two reportable segments, as disclosed in note 20 of the consolidated financial statements. These two reportable segments encompass 35 reporting entities (‘components’). The most significant components are Kendrion (Eibiswald) GmbH, Kendrion (Villingen) GmbH, Kendrion (Donaueschingen/Engelswies) GmbH, Kendrion Kuhnke Automotive GmbH and Kendrion (Shelby) Inc. which on a combined basis contribute approximately 61% of the consolidated revenue. Our group audit mainly focused on significant components in terms of size and financial interest or where significant risks or complex activities were present, leading to full scope audits performed for 13 components. At group level, we have performed audit procedures regarding the corporate entities and we also performed full scope audit procedures on Kendrion (Shelby) Inc. Furthermore, we performed audit procedures at group level in areas such as consolidation, reporting, goodwill and taxation. Specialists were involved, amongst others, in the areas of information technology, tax and valuation. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 167 For all relevant foreign components, the group audit team provided detailed written instructions, which – in addition to communicating the requirements of component audit teams – detailed significant audit areas and information obtained centrally relevant to the audit of individual components including awareness of risk related to management override. Furthermore, we developed a plan for overseeing each component audit team based on its relative significance to the Company and certain other risk characteristics. This included procedures such as visiting components and/or component teams in Germany and the United States, performing file reviews, holding conference calls, attending meetings and reviewing component audit team deliverables in order to gain sufficient understanding of the work performed. For smaller components we have performed review procedures or specific audit procedures. Considering their share in consolidated revenue, 96% of the components is subject to audit procedures. Analytical review procedures have been performed in respect of the components that have not been audited. By performing the procedures mentioned above at group entities, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the Group’s financial information to provide an opinion about the consolidated financial statements. Our key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In prior years, we included the decentralization of the Group as a separate key audit matter. In 2018, we continue to consider audit attention areas relating to the decentralized group and our group audit, which we describe in the “Scope of our group audit” paragraph. As such, we do not consider it necessary to include a separate key audit matter. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 168 Key audit matter – Valuation of goodwill How the key audit matter was addressed in the audit Goodwill represents 25% of the balance sheet and 51% of total equity.

We will follow up on these observations as part of our 2019 audit. In 2018, we were not able to rely on the general IT controls for our audit approach. Alternatively, we gained the required level of assurance from additional substantive audit procedures. Based on our audit procedures performed, we concluded that the risks of material misstatement are sufficiently addressed. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 170 Report on the other information included in the Annual Report In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon, the annual report contains other information that consists of: ■■ Report of the Executive Board; ■■ Report of the Supervisory Board; ■■ Other Information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code; and ■■ Other Information included in the Annual Report. Based on the following procedures performed, we conclude that the other information: ■■ Is consistent with the financial statements and does not contain material misstatements. ■■ Contains the information as required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. We have read the other information. Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements. Management is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the report of the Executive Board in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information pursuant to Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Engagement We were appointed during the Annual General Meeting as auditor of Kendrion N.V. on April 13, 2015, for the audit for the year 2015 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that financial year. No prohibited non-audit services We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. Description of responsibilities regarding the Financial Statements Responsibilities of management and the Supervisory Board for the financial statements The Executive Board is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Furthermore, the Executive Board is responsible for such internal control as management deems necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. As part of the preparation of the financial statements, the Executive Board is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, the Executive Board should prepare the financial statements using 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 171 the going concern basis of accounting unless the Executive Board either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Executive Board should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objective is to plan and perform the audit assignment in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion. We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our audit included e.g.: ■■ Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ■■ Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. ■■ Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ■■ Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 172 ■■ Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures. ■■ Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items. We communicate with the Executive Board and Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identified during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report. We provide the Supervisory Board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Supervisory Board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest. Amsterdam, February 18, 2019 Deloitte Accountants B.V. B.E. Savert 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 173 To: the Shareholders and Supervisory Board of Kendrion N.V. Assurance report of the independent auditor with respect to the 2018 Sustainability Information of Kendrion N.V. Our conclusion We have reviewed the Sustainability Information in the 2018 Annual Report of Kendrion N.V. at Zeist. A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Based on our procedures performed nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information does not present, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of: ■■ the policy and business operations with regard to corporate social responsibility; and ■■ the thereto related events and achievements for the year 2018 in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) ‘Core’ option and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2018 Annual Report. The sustainability information consists of performance information regarding Energy consumption, Absoluteand Relative CO2-emissions, Accidents and Lost Time Injuries, Acceptance of Supplier Code of Conduct and Number of Supplier audits in the sections ‘Facts and Figures’ on page 9 and ‘Sustainability’ on page 33 – 46 of the 2018 Annual Report (hereafter: “the KPIs”). Basis for our conclusion We have performed our review on the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N ‘Assuranceopdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen’ (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports) which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’. This assurance engagement is aimed at obtaining limited assurance. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information’ of our report. We are independent of Kendrion N.V. in accordance with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedragsen beroepsregels accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Reporting criteria The sustainability information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria. Kendrion NV is solely responsible for selecting and applying these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable laws and regulations related to reporting. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 174 The reporting criteria used for the preparation of the sustainability information are the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2018 Annual Report. Responsibilities of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board for the sustainability information The Management Board is responsible for the preparation of the sustainability information in accordance with the GRI Standards ‘Core’ option and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2018 Annual Report, including the identification of stakeholders and the definition of material matters. The choices made by the Management Board regarding the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are summarized in the chapter ‘About the CSR review’ of the 2018 Annual Report. The Management Board is also responsible for such internal controls as the Management Board deems necessary to enable the preparation of the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of Kendrion N.V. Our responsibilities for the review of the sustainability information Our responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusion. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed at determining the plausibility of information, and vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in assurance engagements with a limited level of assurance is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errors and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users taken on the basis of the sustainability information. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our review procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusion. We apply the ‘Nadere voorschriften accountantskantoren ter zake van assurance opdrachten (RA/AA)’ (Regulations for professional accountants practices on assurance engagements) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional skepticism throughout the review, in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical requirements and independence requirements. 17 18 OTHER INFORMATION Annual Report 2018 175 Our review engagement included: ■■ Performing an analysis and obtaining insight into relevant environmental and social themes and issues, and the characteristics of the organization. ■■ Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting policy and its consistent application, including the evaluation of the results of the stakeholders’ dialog and the reasonableness of management’s estimates. ■■ Evaluating the design and implementation of the reporting systems and processes related to the information in the report. ■■ Reviewing internal and external documentation to determine whether the information as included in the KPIs, including the presentation and assertions made in the report, is adequately supported. ■■ Interviewing management and relevant staff at group level responsible for the sustainability strategy and policy. ■■ Interviewing relevant staff responsible for providing the information in the report, carrying out internal control procedures on the data and consolidating the data in the report. ■■ An analytical review of the data and trends submitted for consolidation at corporate level. ■■ Assessing whether the report has been prepared in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) ‘Core’ option. We communicate with the Supervisory Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope, timing and outcome of the review. Amsterdam, February 18, 2019 Deloitte Accountants B.V. B. E.

A lost day counts No significant changes with regard to our own operation as one full day regardless of whether the employee has locations and/or suppliers have taken place in 2018. a part-time or a full-time contract. Kendrion does not specify LTI data per region, worker type or gender as Kendrion considers this information not relevant to its current operations. Kendrion evaluated the definition of the LTI rate to enable better benchmarking. For reporting on the number of signed Supplier Codes of Conduct documents and the number of supplier implementation audits, Kendrion makes use of its own indicator. The supplier implementation audits are internal audits by Kendrion employees based on standardised questionnaires. For more information about the Supplier Code of Conduct, Kendrion refers to its website. The percentage of top 30 suppliers that signed the Supplier Code of Conduct is based on the most significant suppliers in terms of procurement value (in euros) in 2018. During 2018, the internal management information system and internal controls for CSR reporting were further improved. They are designed to facilitate the collection and consolidation of relevant CSR information from all Kendrion’s operating facilities. This is required for the preparation of reliable periodic internal and external reports. Kendrion realises that the figures and data presented in this CSR Review are not always fully comparable with those of other companies. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, companies do not always select the same targets or apply 17 18 GRI CONTENT INDEX Annual Report 2018 182 GRI 102: GENERAL DISCLOSURES 2016 SRS Disclosure Reference Organizational profile 102-1 Name of the organization Cover page Back cover 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services Profile: 5 Organisation: 6 102-3 Location of the organization's headquarters Profile: 5 Corporate governance: 60 Back cover 102-4 Number of countries operating World map: 17 Industrial activities: 21 23 Automotive activities: 24 26 Principal subsidiaries: 177, 178 102-5 Nature of ownership and legal form Corporate governance: 60 102-6 Markets served Industrial activities: 21 23 Automotive activities: 24 26 Principal subsidiaries: 177, 178 We have a worldwide sales and distribution network. 102-7 Scale of the reporting organization Facts and figures: 8, 9 World map: 17 Industrial activities: 21 Automotive activities: 24 Financial review: 27 Principal subsidiaries: 177, 178 102-8 Information on employees and other workers World map: 17 People & Culture: 47 We only report information regarding the total Kendrion group.
