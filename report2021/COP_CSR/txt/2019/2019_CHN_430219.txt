The Company has made full efforts to increase production and supply of natural gas by acquiring more resources, supply in the heating season speeding up infrastructure construction, strengthening pipeline interconnection, exploring multimodal transport of LNG tank and Tianjin LNG has improved its natural gas supply capacity other measures, in order to contribute to guaranteeing the supply and protecting the environment. through infrastructure construction. By leasing a floating storage During the heating season of 2017-2018, CNOOC took many measures to effectively cope with the explosive demand growth. gasifier (FSRU), the gasification capacity of the terminal will be increased by 14 million cubic meters per day, and the total Through interconnection of pipelines and natural gas among swap, CNOOC increased the gas supply by about 1.1 billion m3, gasification capacity will reach 24 million cubic meters per day; accounting for 50% of the national increment supply, which effectively alleviated the shortage of gas supply in the whole country. by adding 11 loading pries, the loading capacity of the tank car During the heating season of 2018-2019, CNOOC optimized the overall allocation of resources ahead of schedule. According to Tianjin interconnection section of CNOOC Mengxi Pipeline will be increased to 600 tank cars per day, and the liquid supply plan, 24.6 billion m3 of natural gas would be supplied, an increase of 20% over the same period last year, of which 3 billion m3 would put into operation capacity will reach 18 million cubic meters per day (converted be supplied through interconnection, an increase of 173% over the same period last year. into gaseous state); by building the first LNG tank with fully Tianjin Interconnection Section of CNOOC Mengxi Pipeline Phase independent technology and design, the 160,000 cubic meters 1 Project was put into operation on November 15, 2018. During the large LNG tank designed and constructed has increased the A major breakthrough achieved in natural gas Natural gas output of Nanhai East oilfield heating season of 2018-2019, it could supply over 8 million m3 of natural gas storage capacity by nearly 80%. CNOOC Gas & exploration in the Bohai Sea exceeded 5 billion m3 per year natural gas per day to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Once the Phase Power Group leased 2 LNG vessels and let them wait at sea for 1 Project finishes, CNOOC can directly supply to Xiongan New further instructions, filling with LNG. A major breakthrough has been achieved in natural gas Area and Beijing to effectively alleviate the shortage of gas supply exploration in the Bohai Sea — “Bozhong 19-6” condensate in North China. gasfield in Bohai oilfield has more than 100 billion m3 of proven geological reserves of natural gas and more than 100 million m3 of proven geological reserves of condensate oil.
