DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2018 59 RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Effective identification and management of risks is crucial to our ability to generate the greatest possible value for our stakeholders. Risks can arise in other areas of the business and can be due to internal as well as external factors. Ultimate responsibility for the company’s risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The CEO and executive management are responsible for ensuring that the Board’s instructions are executed, and that procedures and processes exist and are complied with. Our risk universe is divided into three categories: strategic, operational and financial risks. STRATEGIC RISKS Strategic risks can affect our ability to implement our business strategies, achieve our long-term goals and create value for our stakeholders. Strategic risks include external as well as internal factors. These risks are identified and managed by the Board of Board members and executive management, and are normally discussed at Board meetings.

The financial policy defines mandates and limits for managing the financial risks, as well as the general division of responsibility. The financial operations must be conducted so that the costs for financial risk management are minimised. This means that financial transactions are based on an estimate of the Group’s requirements for funding, liquidity and interest rate risk. An inter-company transaction, such as an internal loan, does not therefore necessarily mean that an identical external loan transaction is also carried out. External loans are taken up once the Group’s aggregate borrowing requirements have been assessed. A group accounts system enables net management of the Group’s payment flows. The Group’s interest rate risk is managed cost‑effectively by assessing the interest rate risk that arises when an individual loan with a short fixed-rate term is raised. Interest-rate derivative transactions will subsequently be carried out as needed to achieve the desired fixed-rate term for the Group’s overall loan portfolio. 100 DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Hälsan 6, Sundsvall.

The conversion factor is 1.28. There is no dilutive effect, as no potential shares (such as convertibles) exist. OPERATING RESULTS The operations are governed based partly on the objective of generating capital growth by increasing the surplus ratio and thereby the cash flow from operating activities, i.e. increased income from property management. We also report the alternative performance indicators property management income and EPRA earnings, as these are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts, and provide additional information on the company’s operating results. The indicators provide a picture which excludes factors that are partly beyond the control of the company, such as changes in the value of properties and derivatives. 2018 2017 12 mths 12 mths Property management income Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Profit before tax 1,597 1,261 Reversal Change in value, properties -687 -412 Change in value, derivatives -16 -27 Property management income 894 822 EPRA earnings (property management income after tax) Property management income 894 822 Reversal, current tax property management income -77 -88 Minority share of earnings -3 -2 EPRA earnings 814 732 EPRA earnings per share, SEK 6.05 5.54 FINANCIAL RISK Our strategy is urban development. Diös seeks to run its business in a sustainable manner with a stable financial risk. This is expressed in the ambition to ensure that the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 60 per cent over extended periods and to maintain an equity ratio in excess of 30 per cent. The loan-to-value ratio and equity ratio show the company’s financial stability while the interest coverage ratio shows the company’s ability to pay interest. Net debt to EBITDA shows our ability to generate cash flow in relation to our liabilities. These key ratios are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts from a financial risk perspective. Our loan-to-value ratio, equity ratio and interest coverage ratio also constitute covenants from the company’s lenders and the Board has defined targets for these key ratios, which are used to govern the company’s activities. 2018 2017 12 mths 12 mths Loan-to-value ratio Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Interest-bearing liabilities 11,099 11,104 Investment properties 20,802 19,457 Loan-to-value ratio, % 53.4 57.1 Equity ratio Equity 7,839 6,887 Total assets 21,057 19,708 Equity ratio, % 37.2 34.9 Interest coverage ratio Property management income 894 822 Reversal Net financial items 183 191 Total 1,077 1,013 Financial costs 183 191 Interest coverage ratio, times 5.9 5.3 110 DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2018 KEY RATIOS AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KEY RATIOS CONT. 2018 2017 12 mths 12 mths Net debt to EBITDA Jan–Dec Jan–Dec Interest-bearing liabilities as per balance sheet 11,099 11,104 Cash and cash equivalents 0 -32 Overdraft facilities 198 0 Net debt 11,297 11,072 Operating surplus as per income statement 1,140 1,080 Central administration as per income statement -71 -73 Reversal Depreciation and amortisation 2 2 EBITDA 1,071 1,009 Net debt to EBITDA 10.5 11.0 NET ASSET VALUE Net asset value is the total capital which the company manages on behalf of its owners. Based on this capital, we aim to generate returns and growth while maintaining a low risk. Net asset value can also be calculated on a long-term and short-term basis. Long-term NAV is based on the balance sheet after adjusting for items which involve no near-term outgoing payments, which refers, for example, to the fair value of financial instruments (derivatives) and deferred tax on temporary differences. The current net asset value consists of equity according to the balance sheet after adjusting for the market value of the deferred tax liability. EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV are designed to show the size of the company’s equity in case of a liquidation in the short and long term. These performance indicators can be compared with the company’s share price to obtain a picture of how the shares are valued in relation to equity. 2018 2017 12 mths 12 mths Net asset value Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Equity as per balance sheet 7,839 6,887 Minority share of equity -49 -45 Reversal Fair value of financial instruments -1 16 Deferred tax on temporary differences 1,299 1,175 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) 9,088 8,033 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) per share, SEK 67.6 59.7 Deductions Fair value of financial instruments 1 -16 Estimated actual deferred tax on temporary differences, approx. 4%1 -242 -209 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) 8,847 7,808 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) per share, SEK 65.8 58.0 1 Estimated actual deferred tax has been calculated at approx. four per cent based on a discount rate of three per cent. The calculation is based on the assumption that the property portfolio will be realised over a period of 50 years, with ten per cent of the portfolio being sold directly subject to a nominal tax rate of 20.6 per cent, and the remaining 90 per cent being sold indirectly through companies subject to a nominal tax rate of six per cent. DIÖS FASTIGHETER ANNUAL REPORT 2018 111 KEY RATIOS AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KEY RATIOS CONT. OTHER KEY RATIOS Other key ratios refer to a number of measures of return which are used to describe various aspects of the statement of financial position and to give investors and analysts further information about the operations. We report return on equity, equity per share and cash flow per share, as these performance indicators show the company’s results and profitability, equity on a per share basis, and the company’s ability to fulfil its obligations and pay dividends to the shareholders. These alternative performance indicators supplement the picture given of Diös’ financial performance and enable investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the company’s return and results. Yield is a measure of the results generated by the properties in relation to their market value. It shows the profitability of the properties and is considered to provide supplementary information for investors and analysts concerning the risk in the portfolio. The debt/equity ratio is presented in order to supplement the picture of the company’s financial situation. It shows the ratio of interest-bearing liabilities to equity. The measure is considered to enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to assess the company’s financial stability. 2018 2017 12 mths 12 mths Jan–Dec Jan-Dec Return on equity, % 18.2 18.3 Equity per share, SEK 58.3 51.2 Cash flow per share, SEK Profit before tax 1,597 1,261 Reversal Unrealised change in value, properties -678 -402 Unrealised change in value, derivatives -16 -27 Depreciation and amortisation 2 2 CURRENT TAX -90 -43 Total 815 791 Average number of shares (‘000) 134,512 132,041 Cash flow per share, SEK 6.05 6.00 Earnings per share, SEK 9.94 7.78 Debt/equity ratio, times 1.4 1.6 OTHER INFORMATION We also report data for economic occupancy, surplus ratio and vacancy rate, as these performance indicators provide a more in-depth picture of the company’s financial performance with regard to revenues in the properties and thus also in the company.
