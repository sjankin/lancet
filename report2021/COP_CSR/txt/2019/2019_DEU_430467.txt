The Company is managed by the Executive Board, consisting of four (4) executive members in 2018. The Executive Board is responsible for all decisions regarding economic, environmental and social impacts. 102-46 Defining report content and topic boundaries In order to define the material aspects and boundaries of the report, we used as a foundation the quick check of the sustainability software 360report. In the first step, we evaluated the data base in the GRI stakeholder survey of the sector air transportation (primarily passenger air transportation), in order to take the size of FAI rent-a-jet AG into account. In the second step, we adapted the materiality matrix using an initial selection of indicators and aspects. This adaption as well as the selection of relevant indicators are based on the contribution of the Executive Assistant to Chairman and were carried out in consultation with Members of the Board. Once the materiality was defined, 360report answered and worked on the questionnaires. This was done in close collaboration with the staff of Human Resources, Operations, Accounting as well as other staff members and the experts from 360report. Aspects and indicators, whose materiality was classified as low or very low and were not taken into consideration in this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 17 102-47 List of essential topics (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 102-48 Restatements of information Our organization has previously reported on sustainability issues. Compared to the previous Sustainability Report there are changes in the statement of information. FAI-rent-a-jet AG has published a sustainability report in previous years. As this report becomes more detailed, 360report software gave us the opportunity to comply with this. 102-49 Changes in reporting In comparison to the previous Sustainability Report there have been no changes in the scope of report of material topics and topic boundaries. Please also refer to 102-48 102-50 Reporting period The information shown in the report covers the fiscal year from Jan 1, 2018 to Dec 31, 2018. 102-51 Date of most recent report The last Sustainability Report was published on 2018 for 2017. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 18 102-52 Reporting cycle Our report is published at periods of one year. 102-54 Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. 102-56 External assurance The sustainability report has not and will not been externally audited. . GRI 200: ECONOMIC GRI 201: Economic Performance (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed For determining taxable income our Company uses accruals-based accounting method recorded as revenue and expenditures in the income statement. As a result of the internal data management system previously used, the economic business figures required by GRI were not yet available in this format. We will adjust the system to be able to generate these business figures in the near future in the appropriate format. The EVG&D cannot be allocated by national, regional or market level. The reason being that the percentage of local supply options depend on routes flown in the air and therefore fluctuates significantly in order to be able to report fixed percentages. 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change We have not yet verified the risks of natural disasters due to climate change for our business activities. We assume no strong hazard due to our geographical location. Fai rent-a-jet AG does not operate in the classic energy-intensive industries, however, ranks among a growing sector with raising greenhouse gas emissions: Air-transport CO²-regulations apply for all aircraft operators according to European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for intra-European Economic Area (EEA) flights. Due to the Stopping the Clock-decision for international flights from/to the EEA, the EU-ETS is temporarily suspended until the international Civil Aviation Organization ICAO shall have developed and adopted a global model for the regulation of international aviation emissions. However, we are affected indirectly by climate changes, as we have to pay for higher energy and raw material prices, which in turn result in higher demands on energy management. Nevertheless, we have a CO² strategy, which is explained in more depth in the environment section of this report. We are unable to provide information on a systematic and database-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 19 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans Our organization does not have an occupational pension provision for employees. Currently there is no plan to introduce a scheme. All fixed employees are covered by the German Social Security System which includes a pension scheme. As provided by law, FAI rent-a-jet AG contributes 50 percent to all contributions of the employees into this pension scheme, up to the social security contribution ceiling. 201-4 Financial assistance received from government During the reporting period we have not received any financial assistance from governments.

GRI 202: Market Presence (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage FAI rent-a-jet AG wages are based on the employees' ability, engagement, job performance and commitment. There is no gender bias regarding pay scale and everyone is paid above minimum wage. 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community Employees in the senior management as well as all other employees are hired according to our requirements and their qualifications. We do not distinguish between geographic differences. Likewise, no geographic profiles are created. GRI 203: Indirect Economic Impacts (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported We have made no investment in infrastructure or services supported during the reporting period. 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts An indirect economic impact for third parties due to the activities of our organization is not known to us.

Even with such policy in place the main suppliers for aircraft parts and services are in the United States, France and the UK. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 20 GRI 205: Anti-corruption (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption Due to our zero-tolerance policy, the risk of corruption is very low. Description as such is found in the Company’s Code of Conduct. 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures Each new staff member receives a FAI rent-a-jet AG’s Code of Conduct for review and signature the day he/she starts working. It provides instructions, policies and procedures to combat corruption. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken During the reporting period there were no incidents of corruption in our organization.

We are achieving saving potentials already at the flight scheduling stage and the planning of the minimization of ground run-up of the engines. However, particularly during flights the flight crew optimizes operation of the aircraft with focus on fuel efficiency. Thanks to the great performance of our technicians, the flight crews and routing planners we were able to safe approximately 29.535 litres of fuel in the reporting period for 2018. 302-5 Reductions in energy requirements for products and services Savings by feeding green electricity into a national grid: The supply of the photovoltaic energy system from Hanger 7 and its performance in 2018 is used as references thereafter. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 24 GRI 303: Water (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 303-1 Water withdrawal by source The following standards were applied in the measurement: During the reporting period 2018 a total of 1.126 m³ of water usage was measured by the calibrated water meter supplied by Flughafen Nürnberg GmbH. 303-2 Water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water The withdrawal of water, by the organization, does not affect water sources significantly. 303-3 Water recycled and reused Our organization does not process service-and wastewater through a further cycle before its final treated or before it is redirected into the environment.

FAI rent-a-jet AG is one of the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide. The supply of services we offer is surely an exposure for the biodiversity in the nearby protected areas. Although we try our best to minimize the environmental damage, we will not be able to avoid it completely. We can't do much against the turbine exhausts our aircrafts produce, for patients must be brought home and pilots must absolve their training flights. But we do have other methods to save the environment like producing our own electricity, waste separation or investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. There are no apparent dangers to the biodiversity for the locations listed in Table 23. 304-3 Habitats protected or restored Our organization was not involved in rehabilitation, renaturalization or protection of areas.

The Hamzali Hydroelectric Power Plant climate protection project, which is under the responsibility of the General Directorate of State Hydrolic Works (DSI), is located in Kizilirmak, Turkey's longest river, in Ankara and Kirikkale provinces. As part of the climate protection project, a run-of-river hydropower plant was built which uses the difference in altitude of geography to generate electricity. There are two generators with a capacity of 16.7 megawatts, which generate about 127 gigawatt of electricity per year. This increases the share of hydro energy at the expense of electricity from fossil fuels. Previously projects in Mali and Turkey (Gold Standards as well), were chosen for our contribution from 2013 to 2017. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2018 28 305-6 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) We destroy ODS in our organization through recognized technologies.
