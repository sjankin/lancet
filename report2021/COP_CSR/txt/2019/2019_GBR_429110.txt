We have developed an environmental policy in order to drive forward our commitment to operating as a responsible business. This environmental policy covers every aspect of the Company’s operations, whether they are directly or indirectly involved in the design, engineering, manufacture, servicing or restoration of our products or the distribution of parts. E N V I R O N M E N TA L P O L I C Y We aim for continuous improvement in our environmental performance and are dedicated to our goal to eliminate pollution and waste at source in line with our business objectives, using recognised environmental best practices wherever possible. Our objectives and commitments to the environment and the community are to: −− Comply as a minimum with all relevant environmental legislation and regulation as well as other environmental requirements, whilst striving to over-achieve on that ambition wherever possible. −− Commit to ongoing reductions in energy and resource consumption in the manufacture and operation of our vehicles, and an ongoing reduction in our carbon footprint. −− Set, monitor and attain all objectives and targets for managing our environmental performance, to ensure control over the environmental impact of all products, processes and facilities. −− Minimise the impact of our activities, products and services through effective waste management. −− Give due consideration to environmental issues and energy performance in the acquisition, design, refurbishment, location and use of buildings. −− Promote sustainable product design and construction, using low carbon energy resources wherever possible. −− Operate and maintain an environmental system in line with ISO 14001: 2004. −− Pro-actively communicate internally and externally our environmental policy, working with our employees, suppliers and partners to promote improved environmental performance and encourage feedback. A S TON M ART IN L AG O N DA U N G L O BAL I M PAC T C O P R E P O RT | 11 ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES (continued) All Aston Martin Lagonda suppliers are expected to comply with the company’s Responsible Procurement Guide. This policy requires that our suppliers, where possible, are certified to ISO14001:2004 (and the transition to ISO14001:2015); and minimise resource consumption, waste and emissions. IMPLEMENTATION Annual targets are set by Aston Martin Lagonda and plans are put in place to reduce energy and water consumption as well as waste and solvent emissions from the manufacturing facility. In 2018 we started on the journey towards carbon neutrality for our business. The first step was a decision to purchase 100 per cent Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGO) backed electricity for our UK operations. This excluded our St Athan manufacturing site which is not yet operational and consequently, we are not yet in control of the provision of electricity to this site. Aston Martin Lagonda operates and maintains an environmental system in line with ISO14001:2004 and are actively working through the transition to ISO14001:2015. All Aston Martin Lagonda suppliers are expected to comply with the company’s Responsible Procurement Guide. MEASUREMENT Environmental targets are regularly assessed and results reported to the board of Aston Martin Lagonda and published annually through our Sustainability Report. Our production volume in 2018 saw a significant uplift on the previous year (from 5,346 to 6,432 units), leading to an increase in our total energy consumption (see below). The increase was partially mitigated by a number of energy-efficiency measures enacted across the business such as the installation of LED lighting in our manufacturing facility, the increased use of building management systems and employee awareness programmes.
