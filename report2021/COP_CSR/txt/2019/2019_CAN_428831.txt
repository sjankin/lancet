This report, which was subject to limited assurance, covers the reporting period from January to December 2017 and its UN Global Compact index is presented overleaf. The report demonstrates our sustainability performance across numerous indicators and highlights how we continue to integrate the Ten Principles and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. This includes our contributions to several SDGs, such as No Poverty (SDG1), Good Health and Well-being (SDG3), Quality Education (SDG4), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8), and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG16).
