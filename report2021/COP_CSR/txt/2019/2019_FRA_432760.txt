In 2018, the men and women of our Group worked tirelessly to bring an ever greater level of service and added value to our customers. The work performed by Arc researchers these last few years has paid off. Two new materials; coloured opal and borosilicate opal, were successfully developed, leading to the creation of a whole range of modern, practical and accessible collections, which very quickly became a big hit among a majority of consumers. While the Group’s top priority in 2019 is to boost operational performance, we also need to turn our attention towards the challenges of the future. Environmental and societal issues are a major concern for the company, and as a socially responsible Group, Arc seeks to limit the impact of its glass-making activities on the planet. Technological advances are needed to accomplish this goal, but they are not enough. Every employee must also do their part, by consuming as little energy as possible, reducing waste in all its forms, optimising transportation, and educating future generations who are set to join our ranks. In this report, you’ll find some examples of the progress we achieved in 2018. Congratulations to everyone who worked to make these initiatives a reality.

Arc France joined in with this movement and encouraged its employees to go out and pick up waste in the area around the composition zone.
