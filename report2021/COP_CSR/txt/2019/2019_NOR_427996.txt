KLP Annual Report 2018 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 KLP – on the side of the community Kommunal Landspensjonskasse (KLP) is the pension company for the Norwegian local government and healthcare sector, with 457,000 members, over 290,000 retirees and 229,000 former members with pension rights. We started out in 1949 as a partnership of small municipalities across the country to provide good pensions in a strong community. Today, KLP is the preferred pension provider for the Norwegian local government and healthcare sectors, one of Norway's largest finance companies and a mainstay of the Norwegian welfare system. We are an unusual finance company because we are owned by our customers. All of our wealth creation benefits our customers. As the pension provider for the Norwegian local government and healthcare sector, it is important for KLP to deliver good returns on the pension money that we manage, offer user-friendly solutions for both members and employers, as well as maintain our low cost level. KLP IS A PROFITABLE COMMUNITY When KLP makes a profit, we either use this to boost our financial strength, or we give it to our owners. In both cases, the result is that they have to pay less. We have the lowest possible costs, so they get as much as possible for schools and nursing homes or other priority tasks that our owners are responsible for. The way in which KLP runs its business therefore has a direct impact on how the owners discharge their social obligations. BENEFITS FOR THE PRESENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS KLP’s social responsibility is to provide secure and competitive pensions in a responsible and sustainable manner. Our work is based on international standards such as UN Conventions, and we are open about how we work and invest. Responsible business practice is the key to sustainable development. The aim is to make a difference. This means that as well as safeguarding the pension money for the future, we do so in a way that creates a secure future — for people living now and the coming generations.

These funds are subject to transitional rules, so that the total provisions for these funds at the end of the 2017 income year can be deposited in a separate account, where the account is first taxed on the liquidation of the non-life insurance business. The group presents the accounts during continued operations, and assumes that the present value of the liability will be 0. 2 In connection with new tax rules for common portfolios in life insurance, the taxable value had been adjusted up to the accounting value. In the case of shares owned by a parent company in a company that possesses a common portfolio, this involves an adjustment upwards of the taxable value to the fair value. This upward adjustment includes all shares in the property portfolio, in addition to those properties located abroad. The adjustment has been made against the carry-forward deficit in 2018, while the excess has been recognised against the profit and loss account (referred to above as ‘transitional rule 01/01/2018’). In order to avoid the provision for tax on the same added value twice, the element of the added value originating from properties abroad has been removed from the basis for deferred tax in the accounts.

KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS KLP’S JOINT PENSION SCHEME FOR LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND ENTERPRISES (“FELLESORDNINGEN”) An important part of the basis of pension costs and pension obligations is how mortality and disability develop amongst the members of the pension scheme. KLP has used the K2013BE mortality table based on Finance Norway’s analyses of mortality in life insurance populations in Norway and Statistics Norway’s extrapolations. WITHDRAWAL OF CONTRACTUAL EARLY RETIREMENT (AFP) (PER CENT IN RELATION TO REMAINING EMPLOYEES) KLP GROUP – ACCOUNTS The costs of AFP depend on how many in each year-group take AFP. On reaching 62 years there are 42.5 per cent who retire with an AFP pension. It is only those who are employed and working right up to retirement who are entitled to AFP. This is taken into account in the calculation of the AFP obligation.

KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Notes 207 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 To: Board of Directors in Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Independent statement regarding the sustainability metrics of Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap We have examined the sustainability metrics in the sustainability statement of Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap (KLP). The sustainability metrics include tables presenting sustainability indicators that KLP measure and monitor. The tables are available in KLP’s annual report for 2018 under the chapter “Sustainability statement”. KLP has developed the sustainability metrics and explained their methodology which is available in the table notes. These are the criteria which we used in our assessment. We have also assessed the basis of the measurements and verified the calculations. Tasks and Responsibility of Management Management is responsible for the sustainability metrics, and that it is prepared in accordance with the criteria. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control that maintains the sustainability metrics. Management is also responsible for the selection and collection of information presented. Our independence and quality control We are independent of the company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our independent statement, and we have fulfilled our ethical obligations in accordance with these requirements and IESBA Code. We use ISQC 1 [NORWEGIAN] Quality control for firms that perform auditing and simplified confirmations of financial statements, and other assurance and related services and maintains a comprehensive quality control system including documented policies and procedures of the ethical standards, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory claim. Tasks and Responsibility of Auditor Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the subject matter based on our control. We have performed controls and will issue our statement in accordance with the Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000: “Assurance engagements other than audits or review of historical financial information with limited assurance. Our work involves performing procedures to obtain evidence that the subject matter is prepared in accordance with the criteria. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including assessments of the risks that the subject matter contains information which is of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the preparation of the subject matter. Therefore, we design audit procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, but will not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. Our control also includes an assessment of whether the applied criteria are appropriate and an assessment of the overall presentation of the subject matter. PricewaterhouseCoopers AS, org.no.: NO 987 009 713 MVA, www.pwc.no Statsautoriserte revisorer, medlemmer av Den norske Revisorforening og autorisert regnskapsførerselskap KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Auditor’s Report 208 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Our work includes interviews with representatives responsible for the significant areas related to the sustainability report. This includes HR, compliance, responsible investments, bank and property management to assess internal controls and routines related to reporting of sustainability metrics. Additionally, this includes gathering and assessing relevant information supporting the presentation KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT of sustainability metrics as well as verify calculations of sustainability metrics based on risk of errors. In our opinion, sufficient evidence has been obtained, and we consider that our work provides an appropriate basis to conclude with a limited level of assurance on the sustainability report. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that gives us reason to believe that the sustainability metrics include material misstatements or that the sustainability metrics are not prepared in accordance with the criteria.

The assumptions are based on the market situation as at 31 December 2018 and are in accordance with the recommendations of the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board (NASB). ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS KLP’s joint pension scheme for local authorities and enterprises (“Fellesordningen”) An important part of the basis of pension costs and pension obligations is how mortality and disability develop amongst the members of the pension scheme. KLP has used the K2013BE mortality table based on Finance Norway’s analyses of mortality in life insurance populations in Norway and Statistics Norway’s extrapolations. KLP uses own disability table for actuarial assumptions related to disability, a table based on changes in disability figures in KLPs customer base. Withdrawal of contractual early retirement (AFP) (per cent in relation to remaining employees): The costs of AFP depend on how many in each year-group take AFP. On reaching 62 years there are 42.5 per cent who retire with an AFP pension. It is only those who are employed and working right up to retirement who are entitled to AFP. This is taken into account in the calculation of the AFP obligation.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The Group’s business activities has in general been unchanged compared to the previous year. There has not been any regulatory changes, transactions or other events with material impact on the 2018 financial statements. Therefore, the key audit matters relevant for our audit have been the same in 2018 as for the prior year audit. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter Valuation of investment properties We have focused on this area because it We have evaluated and tested the design and operating represents a substantial part of the assets effectiveness of the group’s internal controls over on the balance sheet and the lack of a valuation of investment properties.

We found rent, rehabilitation cost and discount rate. the valuation model used by management was reasonable and in accordance with market practice. The accuracy of the calculation also depends on internal information about the In order to conclude on the accuracy of the calculations, properties, e.g. space, expiration of we tested important internal assumptions on a sample existing lease contract and lease amounts. basis against lease contracts and other documentation without identifying significant deviations. We confirmed that the model calculation was appropriately reflecting Refer to note 3.2, 7 and 16 in the the valuation model and assumptions selected. consolidated financial statements for a further description of the valuation of investment properties. We tested that all investment properties had been subject to valuation by comparing the list of properties in the valuation model against the list of properties booked in the accounting system. We compared the output from the valuation model against the external valuations for a selection of the properties. Management explained significant deviations and we challenged the basis for their view of why the deviations did not warrant a change in book values. We also assessed and came to the conclusion that the information about investment properties were sufficient and adequate.

The recalculations do not show a significant deviation against the technical provisions calculated by the insurance systems. We have assessed the methodology and tested the significant assumptions applied e.g. risk of mortality, risk of disability, risk of survival and discount rates. In our view, the calculation of technical provisions in life insurance was subject to controls with appropriate design and operating effectiveness. The assumptions in the calculations were applied consistently and in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. We also considered and found that the information regarding the insurance liabilities in notes to the financial statements is sufficient and adequate.

Other information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information in the annual report, except the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, and is expected to be made available to us after the date of this audit opinion. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the Board of Directors. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the (4) KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONKASSE Auditor’s Report 333 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Auditors Report Kommunal Landspensjonskasse gjensidig forsikringsselskap preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE – ACCOUNTS In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the Company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The consolidated financial statements of the Group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control. • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. (5) KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONKASSE Auditor’s Report 334 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Auditors Report Kommunal Landspensjonskasse gjensidig forsikringsselskap • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE – ACCOUNTS statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposed allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company’s accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
