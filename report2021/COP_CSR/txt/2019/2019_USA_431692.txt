INTROD UC TION RESPON SIBLY REFRESHIN G SUSTAIN ABLY BREWIN G COLLECT IVELY CR A FTED 3 CHANGE IS BREWING BY MARK HUNTER, CEO We know today’s markets are changing, creating new challenges for a more sustainable future. Some issues – like access to clean water and resources – continue to be a big part of the global conversation. Others – like climate change and eliminating plastic waste – have reached a tipping point and demand meaningful action. As stakeholder expectations change and the urgency for corporate action intensifies, we are amplifying our commitment to sustainability, which we believe is a key driver to how we can be First Choice for our Consumers and Customers. Our former Coors Brewing chairman, Bill Coors, once said, “Waste is a resource that is out of place.” Eliminating waste has always been a part of how we operate. Molson Coors helped kickstart the recyclable aluminum can revolution decades ago, and this year we are stepping up our efforts to help solve this generation’s waste challenge by setting forth a set of ambitious goals to minimize the impact of our packaging. As part of our 2025 goals, we aim to drive down our packaging emissions, use more recycled content in our plastic packaging, improve recycling solutions in our priority markets and ensure 100% of our packaging is reusable, recyclable, compostable or biodegradable. We look forward to introducing more environmentally sustainable packaging across our portfolio of brands and working in collaboration with others to advance a circular economy. Beyond our environmental stewardship, we’re also meeting our responsibilities to our consumers. We recognize their desire to be more mindful about their alcohol consumption and to drink responsibly. We’ve responded with great-tasting moderate options globally. From nonalcoholic beer to fermented tea, we’re growing our lowand no-alcohol portfolio to meet the needs of today’s markets, leveraging the trust of brands consumers know to help them explore different tastes and experiences. Of course, none of this happens without people. I’m proud to say that “I’m proud to say that year after year, our people continue to be a testament to the value and success of Our Brew culture. As a company, we’ve made great strides on year after year, our our diversity and inclusion strategy, which is helping to identify the next people continue to be generation of diverse leaders within our organization and promoting womenand minority-owned businesses in our supply chain. I’m thrilled a testament to the value that several of our diverse global leaders have been recognized for the and success of Our talent and energy they bring to our communities. With every passing year, the impact of Our Beer Print grows and our Brew culture.” ambition to innovate, lead, protect and sustain becomes stronger. I am excited to lean into our innovations to help solve these global issues and am looking forward to tracking our progress in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I believe we have an opportunity – a responsibility – to rise up together to find solutions to society’s greatest challenges. I’m proud to say we’re already doing it.
