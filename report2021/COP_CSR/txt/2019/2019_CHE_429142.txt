Our social responsibility has formed the basis for 160 years of economic success and secures the long-term future of our company. Our employees spend every day working on simple and innovative solutions for our customers. Together, we make sure that business is conducted in a transparent and trustworthy manner. As a member of the UN Global Compact, we adhere to its ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and corruption. For this, our CR Strategy 20.20 offers a tried-and-tested framework, and I am pleased with the progress achieved: −−In our core business, the growth of sustainable insurance solutions shows that economic success can go hand-in-hand with a contribution to the environment and society. We are basing decisions in investment management and in the insurance business even more consistently on environmental, social and governance criteria. “Responsibility for the −−We do business in an environmentally friendly manner and compensate economy, environment the unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions via environmental protection and society is deeply projects with additional social benefits. In this way, we also assume responsibility where our entrepreneurial influence is limited. anchored in our everyday company life.” −−As an attractive employer, we, for example, offer our employees good opportunities to reconcile their professional career with their personal goals through flexible working time adjustments. −−Helvetia sees itself as a living and committed location partner in all of its country markets. The expansion of our protection forest commitment and the reinforcement of cooperation with proven partners in the educational, cultural and social area is a clear sign of this. With our second CR Report of the Helvetia Group, we would like to inform you as transparently and understandably as possible on what has been achieved so far. Simultaneously, it serves to spur us on to get even better. I would like to thank all employees for their great commitment and our customers and other strong stakeholders for their trust in the past year. Philipp Gmür Group CEO Helvetia Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 Helvetia Group﻿ 4 Helvetia Group Overview Helvetia is a Swiss insurance group with international operations. It provides services for GRI  02-2, 102-3, 102-4, 1 102-5, 102-6, 102-7 more than 5 million customers with 6,624 employees. Helvetia Holding AG with its registered office in St. Gallen is a Swiss limited company listed on the Swiss stock market (SIX). The main activities of Helvetia are to be found in the business activities Non-Life and Life and to a lesser extent in the reinsurance business. Helvetia subdivides its business activities into the three market areas Switzerland, Europe and Specialty Markets. The market area Europe combines the country markets Germany, Austria, Spain and Italy. In the Specialty Markets area, Helvetia provides tailor-made cover in the areas of marine/transport, art and technical insurance. Apart from Switzerland and France, Helvetia is also present here in Liechtenstein, Miami, Singapore and Malaysia. You can find more detailed information on our business model and our products in our Company brochure 2018. Business development in 2017 For the year under review, Helvetia recorded a gratifying business result with a profit of GRI 102-7 CHF 431 million. Total business volume increased by 3.9 per cent or CHF 9,073.3 million. The Swiss domestic market accounted for 56 per cent of this, the other European countries for 33 per cent and the Specialty Market area for 11 per cent. In the Life business, business volumes rose by 2.1 per cent. The Non-Life business makes up 48 per cent of the business volume of Helvetia and registered premium growth of 5.8 per cent, adjusted for currency fluctuations. The net combined ratio fell slightly to 91 per cent. Since the 2018 financial year, Helvetia has reported its results according to IFRS: Please consult the fi ­ nancial report for see Financial report, p. 51 ff. more details. We pursue clear targets and commit ourselves where we achieve the best effect on the environment and society.

Today, as then, we are a reliable partner for our customers, employees and business partners. Our GRI 102-16 mission and values are laid down in our Company policy. They apply to all country markets. We also live our corporate values “trust”, “drive” and “enthusiasm” in our commitment to corporate responsibility (CR). −−Trust: We act honestly and responsibly and stand for long-term, fair and balanced partnerships. In doing so, we pursue the ambition of being a trustworthy company and being perceived as such. −− Drive: We think in a way that is modern and future-oriented. We operate in a dynamic global environment, characterised by uncertainties, with new methods and innovative solutions. Thanks to the anchoring of our CR commitment in our core business, we respond as sustainable insurance to global challenges, such as climatic change, the observance of human rights, fair working conditions and the preservation of the natural environment. −− Enthusiasm: We approach our environment openly, with interest and in a committed manner and see ourselves in all country markets as a committed location partner and an attractive employer, which can rely on the joy and enthusiasm of its employees. Fit for the future: helvetia 20.20 Currently, the insurance business is confronted by great challenges: the capital markets are characterised by a long-lasting low-interest phase, which puts insurance companies in a difficult position. More and more national and international regulations are expected, especially in the fields of corporate governance, con­­sumer protection and also corporate responsibility (CR). Client structure and client expectations are changing in step with demographic change. Finally, digitalisation is affecting the entire value addition chain of insurance. On the one hand, this provides opportunities, such as more efficient processes, the development of new and individualised insurance solutions, and the opening-up of new distribution channels. On the other hand, we also have to face new challenges. For example, the demands on distribution are changing, data security is playing an increasingly important role, and the trend to individualisation has put the solidarity principle of the insured into question. Moreover, due to the market launch of providers with purely digital business models, the competitive pressure is increasing. As a reaction to this and other challenges, we developed the strategy helvetia 20.20 for the Helvetia Group. As a result, we will concentrate even more on our customers in the years to s ee Company brochure, p. 18 ff. come and will become more innovative, digital and agile as a company. This orientation is also expressed by our new group-wide brand positioning under the motto “simple. clear. helvetia”: we provide clear and simple solutions for our customers. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 Our focus 8 CR strategy 20.20 With the conclusion of the first CR programme at the end of 2015 and based on the helvetia GRI 102-46 20.20 strategy, we also reviewed the approach of the CR commitment at the level of the Helvetia Group and developed it further. For this purpose, we tested the major CR themes that had already been identified in 2012 for their current relevance and overhauled the strategic approach points and goals. The 20.20 CR strategy supports the goals of the helvetia 20.20 strategy as a functional strategy. It was approved by the Executive Management of the Helvetia Group in June 2016 and constitutes the framework for the CR commitment of the country markets. We hope to achieve four ambitions with it: −−As a “sustainable insurance”, we make provision for an attractive product range to secure environmentally friendly technologies and maintain service-oriented dealings with our customers as partners. −−As a “responsible company”, we are reducing our CO2 emissions and conduct business cautiously and with respect for our stakeholders. −−As an “attractive employer”, we take care of our employees and offer them interesting options to harmonise their professional career with their personal objectives. −−As a “committed location partner”, we play an active role in the preservation and reforesting of protection forests and support social projects in our area. Strategic starting points and goals by 2020 Based on these ambitions, the 20.20 CR strategy defines our top CR topics, starting points and goals for the years 2016 to 2020. They apply to the entire Helvetia Group. During this period, the main aims for the strategy should be the following: 1. Increased integration of ESG criteria in the core business 2. Implementation of measures to reduce CO2 emissions 3. Orientation to CR industry standards and compliance with national and international regulation on CR 4. Expansion of the stakeholder communication and reinforcement of the management system The targets deduced are in part quantitative and in part qualitative and thereby reflect the “degree of maturity” of our CR efforts: in all areas, we achieved good progress in recent years and set ourselves individual additional and supplementary targets.

This is why we reviewed our top themes. As a first step in this direction, we identified 15 potentially relevant aspects for CR at Helvetia. To do so, we analysed recognised national and international sustainability and industry standards, checked feedback on the previous materiality mix and conducted a screening of our most important stakeholder groups and their concerns. In autumn 2015, we discussed these 15 aspects with 29 representatives of internal and external stakeholder groups and tested or specified these in relation to their current and medium-term relevance. The materiality mix derived from this was finally approved for the entire Helvetia Group in June 2016 by the Executive Management. It applies to all country markets. Our top themes can be assigned to the four ambitions, which constitute the objectives for the GRI 102-47  20.20 CR strategy. The following diagram presents Helvetia’s current materiality mix. It illustrates the assessment of the relevance of the individual topics from the point of view of our external stakeholders and from the point of view of the internal stakeholders of Helvetia. Topics were regarded as relevant if they were important for achieving the goals of the respective stakeholders, if Helvetia was assigned a certain effect regarding this aspect and/ or if the stakeholders assumed that the topic would have a major influence on the environment or society. This is not yet associated with an objective impact assessment, which is to be made up for in the next strategy period.

Engagement with these issues is nothing new for us. For example, we have already established very solid foundations across the areas of risk management, investment policy, procurement and our employer strategy. By joining the UN Global Compact, we once again explicitly underscore our commitment to responsible corporate governance and to supporting worldwide efforts for a more sustainable form of development. In addition, we want our actions to make a positive contribution towards achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 and comprise a total of 17 goals with 169 targets that cover social, ecological and economic topics. With this, the United Nations calls on states, civil society and businesses to assume responsibility for global well-being. As a financial services company, we can promote sustainable development by making reference to SDGs in our core business. As a first step, we have identified five goals towards which Helvetia is already making a contribution. We will examine a closer integration of SDGs into our CR approach in the course of the next strategy period.

Attractive employer Among other things, this applies to the subgoal 8.5, which apart from productive full employment provides for the equal pay for equal work and decent working conditions for women, men, young employees and people with handicaps. With the awards “Friendy Workspace” and the “We pay fair” quality seal, this has also been externally confirmed. Sustainable cities and communities With our real estate portfolio worth CHF 7.4056 billion, we are responsible  also p. 23, see for the structural development of cities and communities. When developing and Sustainable investments renovating our real estate, we pay attention to design that is environmentally friendly and worth living. With the Helvetia Venture Fund, we support innovative mobility projects. In the year under review, Helvetia Germany has for example laid the foundation for the construction of 44 family-friendly and affordable family flat in Hamburg. With this pilot project, it in particular has made a contribution to subgoal 11.1, which aims to ensure access to safe and affordable residential space. Sustainable consumption and production patterns We are continually expanding the range of products with which we grant  also p. 20, see customers attractive conditions for sustainable behaviour. Consequently, they Sustainable offer benefit from 15 to 20 per cent premium discounts for vehicle types with more environmentally-friendly drive technologies. We provide environmentally friendly building technologies with good investment protection and as a result make their use even more attractive through photovoltaic or downhole heat exchanger insurances. For example, in this way we make a contribution to subgoal 12.2, which aims for efficient use of natural resources by 2030. Measures for climate protection see also p. 35, Since 2012, we have been regularly compiling our greenhouse gas balance Sustainable procurement sheet and continuously implementing measures to reduce our CO2 emissions. This way, we have already been able to achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions per employee of 29 per cent since 2012. As a member of the RE-100, we draw our power to 100 per cent from renewable sources. When compensating our remaining emissions, we rely on projects with an additional social benefit and a positive contribution to the SDGs. In our core business, we take climate risks into account in our investment decisions and safeguard our customers against the effects of natural hazards. This contributes in particular to subgoal 13.1, which is intended to increase the ability to withstand climate-related hazards. Partnerships  also p. 15, see We take an active part in industry associations and initiatives to reinforce Stakeholder commitment, personnel and institutional capacities for sustainable development. As a founding and see also p. 46, member of Swiss Sustainable Finance (SSF), a member of the UN Global Committed location Compact and by assuming responsibility, for example, in the presidium of öbu partner (association for sustainable economy in Switzerland) and in the “Climate and energy” working group of the Swiss Insurance Association (SIA), we are working for the exchange and further development of knowledge, strategies and standards for implementation-oriented, sustainable development. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 Our focus 14 How we work CR management Ultimate responsibility for the CR commitment of the Helvetia Group is held by Philipp Gmür, GRI 102-18  CEO of the Helvetia Group. The highest CR committee is the CR Advisory Board. As an ad­ visory and controlling committee, it steers and coordinates the strategic orientation of CR in the country markets and provides resources for national implementation. Each country market has one responsible Executive Management member in this committee. Switzerland is represented here by the Head of the Corporate Center. At Group level, the Corporate Responsibility department (CR department) conducts the further development of the CR strategy and CR programme and advises Executive Management at the country and Group level in CR questions. It is assigned to the Corporate Center and is supported by the CR agent of the country companies, which carry out this function with a load of at least 50 per cent. To better anchor CR in the Group, the CR department cooperates directly with experts from the relevant Group functions and country markets when implementing new projects and observing operational CR functions. They are the contacts for the CR department and participate in the adjustment of internal business processes in relation to sustainability. These ensure smooth information management and dialogue with stakeholders regarding sustainability topics. They provide support regarding the CR strategy, CR risk management, sustainability reporting and sustainability communication.

These include employees, customers, investors, competitors, business partners, supervisory authorities, NGOs, politics and society. In this regard, we pursue the following objectives: 1. Compare internal and external points of view 2. Receive critical feedback on location determination to see where there is potential for optimisation 3. Reinforce consensus formation and sensitisation on priority CR topics 4. Compare and validate the main sustainability topics of Helvetia 5. Facilitate further development of the CR programme and CR strategy The scope and form of the commitment differ according to the needs of the stakeholders. see also table p. 16–17 Employees, customers, shareholders and investors are regularly informed via benchmark studies and surveys and at events, investor conferences and at the Shareholders’ Meeting. They are also involved in dialogues in which CR topics are discussed. Moreover, by revising the CR web presentation in the Group and the country markets Germany, Austria, Italy and Spain in 2018, we have once again greatly improved the transparency and availability of relevant information. Exchange with NGOs, supervisory authorities, associations, politicians and business partners occurs on a subject-specific basis. Moreover, Helvetia commits itself in initiatives and ­associ­ations to compare its CR commitment with its environment and for internal industry and crossindustry bundling of forces.

The most important initial starting points were defined for this purpose in 2016 in the CR Advisory Board at the Helvetia Group level. Apart from the integration of ESG criteria in investment management, the CR managers of the Helvetia national companies see market opportunities for new insurance solutions in particular for the environmental area. To integrate CR aspects permanently in the core business processes, Helvetia is taking a bottom-up approach. This is based heavily on the cooperation between CR experts and line managers: based on an initial suggestion from the CR department, we have formulated ideas and starting points in dialogue with internal and external stakeholders. Together with the internal specialist and line man­agers, we have developed and are implementing (pilot) projects from this. Ideas which have proven themselves during the pilot implementation will then be introduced into our business processes by experts from the departments. In this way, we will establish the know-how transfer that ensures that CR aspects are permanently considered in the core business. Sustainable offer Varied product range GRI 103-1  As an all-lines insurer, we cushion the existential risks of our customers and in this way contribute to stable social and economic development. For example, simple and flexible insurance solutions permit young people with a small budget to protect against the most important risks. For small and medium-sized companies, we are a competent partner with innovative products, such as insuring cyber risks or protecting against risks in the added value chain. Moreover, as part of its entrepreneurial responsibility, Helvetia provides insurance that takes specific sustainability aspects into account. These products and services support the path to a low-carbon and inclusive economy and protect our environment and resources. In addition, they permit our customers to handle the consequences of climate change better. Sustainable insurance solutions GRI 103-2 We orient ourselves to the needs of our customers with our product range. This also includes investment protection for the use of environmentally friendly technologies for private and corporate customers. For example, in the technical insurance/Specialty Lines area, Helvetia provides artesian well, downhole heat exchanger and photovoltaic insurance and in this way supports the development of these forms of regenerative energy. Customers also benefit from Helvetia’s advanced know-how in the areas of construction, transport 27% and energy here. Moreover, Helvetia rewards the holders of energy-efficient vehicles with premium discounts between 15 and 20 per cent and develops tailor-made solutions for new vehicle types, like e-bikes. Growth in sustainable insurance solutions Due to the fact that the insurance coverage offered only has an indirect effect on the decision to purchase an energy-efficient vehicle or install a photovoltaic system, we can only provide very limited incentives for more sustainable behaviour by your customers. Nevertheless, where possible and economically viable, we want to offer our customers solutions that promote economically sustainable behaviour. s ee also p. 33, Risk management In the area of Speciality Lines, we also selectively insure major infrastructure projects, power stations and conveyor systems as well as goods transports, e.g. in container ships. In doing GRI 103-2 so, we pay heed to pursuing a selective and risk-conscious underwriting policy, which also includes aspects of social responsibility and environmental questions. As a member of the Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 21 UNEP Finance Initiative, we have committed ourselves to integrating relevant ecological, social and governance aspects (ESG) in our underwriting. 2018 review and progress GRI 103-3 In the year under review, the share of sustainable insurance products in the Helvetia Group was almost 1 per cent, measured by gross premiums in Non-Life. Very gratifying growth can be observed here in all country markets, which is also in particular attributable to an increase in vehicles with more ecological drive forms. In this area, we assume moderate growth in the coming years and would like to expand our product offers as well as their share in particular areas.

Our customers in the country market Austria now have the opportunity to invest in sustainable organisations and companies in the form of FairFuture Lane with their fund tied life insurance – without at the same time having to dispense with attractive yields. FairFuture Lane is supervised by Swiss Vontobel Asset Management Ltd. It takes solely socially responsible investment (SRI) funds into account, i.e. those that invest with clear environmental and social objectives. In addition, the first 1,000 customers benefit from a personal tree that will be planed in spring 2019 in a protected forest area in the Steiermark region. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 23 Sustainable investments Responsibility as an investor GRI 103-1  As a leading European insurance company with financial and real estate investments to the value of CHF 52.0 billion, Helvetia has a lot of leverage with regard to designing ecological, social and economic realities. We are convinced that taking the sustainability information into account improves the overall performance of an investment portfolio. For us, responsible handling of capital means taking the criteria of ecology, social issues and governance (ESG) into account. Associated with this, we take an active role in the topics climate change, environmental catastrophes and disregard of elementary labour and human rights or improper corporate management. In recent years, considering ESG criteria as part of investment analysis and deciding on investments has grown beyond being a niche. Requirement have also risen correspondingly on our transparency in reporting and cooperation with other investors. This is reflected in growing interest of our stakeholders, especially analysts, shareholders and customers. By contrast, in the greenhouse gas emissions area, the discussion is conducted more from the need to implement the Paris Agreement and a financial perspective: if many countries agree on strong environmental protection measures, large quantities of coal, oil and gas resources could lose greatly in value. Some investors have already reacted to this risk with a “decarbonisation” of their portfolio. ESG criteria in the investment process GRI 103-2 Investment management Helvetia invests the premiums of its customers in high-return, long-term instruments. As a responsible investor, in addition to financial criteria we also apply ESG criteria in making investment decisions. The aim is to meet the high return requirements of our pension customers while maintaining an average sustainability rating for the financial investment portfolio. We conduct semi-annual assessments of the sustainability of our portfolio, drawing upon the valuation of the independent provider MSCI, which rates more than 13,000 companies and governments on the basis of their sustainability. Issuers of investments are assessed relative to 37 key issues, ranging from greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency to occupational safety and corruption. With this analysis, we cover all of the financials for which a corresponding rating is available. These are above all government and corporate bonds and shares and fund products based on these securities, which make up about twothirds of our financial investment portfolio. No corresponding ESG rating can be obtained GRI FS11 for the remaining financial assets (mortgages, liquid funds and loans to policyholders and employees). Findings are discussed in Investment Management area meetings and by the national Investment Commissions, the CR Advisory Board and Group Executive Management. The Portfolio Management team also utilises monthly information updates on issuers which evidence low ESG quality and/or are the subject of serious controversy. When a security is put on this Portfolio Watchlist, an alternative investment is recommended. This ensures that negative ESG ratings are taken into account in the investment-making process without excluding specific investment vehicles based on predefined thresholds or industry affiliation. Systematic exclusions are allowed, however, in areas where this is required due to statutory provisions. For example, we do not invest in manufacturers of banned weapons under the Swiss War Material Act and the Oslo Convention. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 24 Portfolio emissions GRI 103-2 Forward-looking investment policy cannot ignore climate change. Based on the climate compatibility test voluntarily conducted in 2017, we took an active part in the year under review in the discussion of the “Climate and energy” working group of the Swiss Insurance Association (SIA). The results were included in the draft of the position paper “Responsible Investments” by the SIA Investment Committee, which is chaired by Helvetia. Every half-year, Helvetia reviews the portfolio emissions we finance for our own investment portfolio. In this regard, we only identified slight changes in relation to the data coverage and underlying metrics, such as carbon intensity key figures. Moreover, the available information on climate effectiveness tends to be past-oriented and incomplete. Consequently, the analyses only provide an initial assessment for shares and fixed-interest securities. However, in order nevertheless to move our investment management forwards, we decided to begin with climate stress tests and scenario analyses in 2019. These will also be integrated in our report on climate risks for the financial investment report in the context of Article 173 of the French Energy Transition Act. Real estate management Helvetia also has a major lever to optimise sustainability performance with a real estate portfolio amounting to CHF 7.41 billion. The focus here is on the Swiss domestic market in which almost 92 per cent of our real estate portfolio is located. We rely on the most environmentally friendly and attractive method of construction possible and in this respect rely on recognised labels, like Minergie. As a result of the high real estate prices and rents in many places and growing concentration in cities, social aspects in real estate development are becoming increasingly important. In major developments, such as the district “zur Weinlese” in Winterthur (CH) or “Vogelkamp” in Hamburg (DE), Helvetia is supporting concentrated and affordable residential space with innovative projects. Family-friendly and affordable residential space In Hamburg, the foundation was laid in August 2018 for the Vogelkamp Neugraben model project. Two multi-family dwellings are to be created here with 44 family flats, which in the end should only cost 8 euros per square metre. This price is well below the Hamburg average. As a result, Helvetia Germany is underlining its role as a long-term oriented investor, whose customers also care about ecological and social aspects. The buildings are constructed out of solid wood from prefabricated parts. This permits a short and efficient construction period, which means it will already be possible to move into the buildings in the first quarter of 2019. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 25 2018 review and progress GRI 103-3 Our CHF 52.0 billion investments are divided into 14 per cent real estate investments, 57 per GRI FS 11 cent bonds, 10 per cent mortgages, 4 per cent shares and money market securities and 15 per cent other, including funds, loans, etc. You can find more information on our investment strategy in the financial report. The financial investments portfolio of Helvetia has low ESG see also Financial report, p. 58 risks for all countries with an average A rating as of December 2018. The share of investments with a high ESG risk (letter rating B–CCC) has been reduced at the Group level from almost 2.5 per cent in the previous year to under 2.2 per cent. In some countries, it is even well below this at 0.25 to 1 per cent. Helvetia’s sustainability investment approach is to be further refined and the selection of sustainable individual securities supported with the introduction of a platform of MSCI ESG Research in the year under review. All porfolio managers have access to a monthly observation list with issuers for which especially sensitive, reputation-relevant information (controversy involvement, UNGC compliance) is available. This list was revised and supplemented. At the Group level, a team consisting of representatives from portfolio management, portfolio strategy, investment compliance and corporate responsibility drew up ESG guidelines, which will be included in the Group Investment Guidelines binding on all countries.

Fair and transparent consulting is just as important for this as responsible handling of customer data and offering attractive services. Since customers make a prepayment with the payment of their premiums, trust in the reliability of Helvetia is crucial for them. Drawing benefits in the event of losses is often associated with a negative experience, which can be of vital significance for the parties affected. Easily accessible and unbureaucratic claim management creates trust and is part of our benefit promise to our customers. Fair dealings with our customers have made a decisive contribution to our reputation. Customer orientation as a cornerstone of helvetia 20.20 GRI 103-2, 103-3 Customer orientation is one of the three pillars of the helvetia 20.20 strategy. Our goal is to optimise the customer journey and give our customers the easiest possible access to our services in the digital and analogue communication channels. In addition, we want to get to know the expectations, habits and needs of our customers as well as possible, and use them as the starting point for developing new products and services. These findings are integrated directly in the strategic considerations of the Corporate Development department. Customer satisfaction and consulting Irrespective of whether customers make direct contact with us through an advisor or via a website, social media channel or otherwise, they should be able to come to informed decisions regarding whether and to what extent they want to take advantage of a product or service. We ensure this through transparent and understandable product information and regular training of our sales force employees. For example, as part of the training programme Cicero (Certified Insurance Competence) launched by the Swiss Insurance Association (SIA) and recognised throughout the industry, all sales force employees in Switzerland must complete accredited training modules amounting to 60 Cicero credits within two years. This corresponds to about seven training days. Nevertheless, some customers find the information and documents on our insurance products to be in part difficult to understand. Since our contracts have to meet the applicable regulatory requirements, which involve a high number of rules, our insurance documents are indeed comprehensive. Within the bounds of what is legally permissible, we are constantly improving information on our product offers and inform customers as comprehensively and clearly as possible with detailed calculation and product documentation. Accordingly, there were no breaches against regulations or voluntary agreements with regard to product information in the year under review in the entire Helvetia Group. Customer service at Helvetia is decentralised in national companies in order to be able to address local customer needs and expectations optimally. We carry out these surveys and benchmark studies regularly to compare our image, consulting services and our services as well as the quality of our products with those of our competitors. Moreover, from the feedback from our customers after interactions with us, we continually deduce approaches for further improvements in customer relation management. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 28 2018 review and progress There were no breaches against regulations or voluntary agreements with regard to product GRI 417-2 information in the year under review in the entire Helvetia Group. Data protection GRI 103-2, 103-3 Apart from customer orientation, innovation, especially with regard to the continuing digitalisation of the insurance industry, is a central orientation of helvetia 20.20. This imposes special demands on data protection, on the one hand to make the best possible use of data, but on the other hand also to protect customers and employees’ privacy at all times. At the same time, we depend on the targeted evaluation and use of the information from and about our customers in order to continuously develop our product offers and exploit the potential of digitalisation. Only in this way can we preserve our competitiveness in a rapidly changing market. Our customers are provided with comprehensive information on the processing of their personal data and they decide which data they disclose and for what purpose. Trust and transparency are the guidelines of our data processing. In this respect, data protection at Helvetia prescribes the framework conditions for use of personal data and thereby ensures appropriate and proportionate use of the data. These data protection principles are integrated in the regular compliance process at Helvetia and are reviewed in this context for compliance. s ee also p. 30, Corporate Governance In organisational terms, data protection at Helvetia in Switzerland is embedded centrally in a competence centre (Data Protection department) and decentrally through many data protection specialists. Local compliance officers and specialists ensure data protection in the country markets. Our specialists exchange information with each other and in the national business line and specialist associ­ations on current developments and in this way ensure upto-date data protection. Management is responsible for effective data protection: it prescribes the requirements for the use of personal data and provides the resources required. Our employees, who in the context of their areas of responsibility have access to personnel data, are specially trained in handling them. Electronic learning programmes are available for their sensitisation. Moreover, data protection and the obligation to confidentiality is part of the terms and conditions of employment and of the Code of Compliance mandatory for all employees. Regular compliance mechanisms ensure observance of the data protection provisions at Helvetia. In this respect, specialists for various control functions (e.g. information security and risk management) engage in intensive cooperation. 2018 review and progress GRI 418-1, 103-3 In the year under review, there were a total of six complaints by customers regarding our handling of their personal data. In addition, internal reviews revealed individual cases of data protection breaches. We take these cases very seriously and have reacted with adjustments to IT systems, requirements and detailed processes as well as the retraining of employees. In two cases, we informed the responsible authorities via self-accusation. Of these, one case proved to be unfounded, feedback on the other is still unavailable. Against the background of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union, GRI 103-2 we have designed data protection in 2018 in all country companies and at the Group level even more effectively. For this purpose, we have edited new data protection declarations, issued or enhanced internal guidelines and introduced new, IT-supported processes. In adCorporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 29 dition, at Group level, twelve information events took place for especially relevant departGRI 103-2 ments, such as Specialty Markets or issuing mortgages. As before, both in theory and in practice, great uncertainty exist regarding the interpretation of the new legal requirements in European countries and also on the occasion of the ongoing review of the Federal Act on Data Protection in the Swiss domestic market. As a member of the Swiss Insurance Association (SIA) and various other interest associations, Helvetia takes an active part and is always up to date on discussions. Therefore, we are convinced we can do justice to the growing requirements and also show ourselves equal to digitalisation in the area of data protection. Digital accessibility GRI 103-2 With the increasing digitalisation of our services, it is becoming more and more important to make these accessible without restrictions to people with audiovisual disabilities as well. In addition, an accessible Internet also corresponds to the demands of the UNO Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Art. 9) ratified by Switzerland. Our internal guidelines for accessible web design entered into force in January 2016. The goal is the orientation of the web design of Helvetia to the guidelines for simplified Internet accessibility formulated by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The Internet presence of Helvetia will be made accessible in phases in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in their current version 2.0 conformity level A. In this way, we will improve the general usability of the Internet contents. 2018 review and progress In December 2018, the foundation “Access for all” comprehensively reviewed our website. GRI 103-3 Several weakpoints, such as inadequate contrasts or imprecise identification of headings became clear in this regard. These are now to be corrected in the course of next year in order to target conformity level A. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 30 Trustworthy company – Helvetia pursues sustainable management Trust is one of the most important resources in customer-oriented insurance and is reflected correspondingly in our corporate values. We would like to earn this trust not only with our services in our core business, but also in the manner we do business. For us, this includes observance of the applicable laws and voluntary standards that go further as well as attentive risk management and the deliberate handling of resources. This requires the cooperation of our company’s broad-ranging areas. The CR department is responsible in this respect for monitoring the main sustainability developments in international and national discussions. It cooperates with line managers to integrate these developments in the processes of corporate management, control and transparency. Corporate Governance Importance of corporate governance for Helvetia GRI 103-1 Credible and honest company management is the foundation for the integration of compulsory and voluntary standards in day-to-day business. As a result, good corporate governance is the prerequisite to proactively handle shortand long-term socially and environmentally relevant challenges. The expectations of our stakeholders regarding fair and transparent action often exceed the prevailing legal position. By contrast, breaches can have considerable negative consequences in the form of reputational damage, financial losses, sanctions and fines up to and including restrictions of business activities. Conversely, good corporate governance promotes the positive effects Helvetia has on its business environment, by supporting fair competitive conditions and hindering breaches of environmentally or socially relevant standards. Approach for reliable compliance GRI 103-2 In the configuration and division of labour of our management and controlling bodies, we have oriented ourselves to recognised frameworks and applicable regulatory codes, such as in particular the “swiss code of best practise for corporate governance”, the guidelines regarding information on corporate governance of the SIX Swiss Exchange (Directive Corporate Governance, DCG), the “Corporate governance – insurers” circular of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisor Authority (FINMA), the Ordinance against Excessive Remuner­ation in Listed Companies Limited by Shares (ERCO), and the FINMA circular “Remuneration schemes”. We report transparently on this in our financial report. see also Financial report, p. 10 ff. In addition, Helvetia has positioned itself as a reliable and compliance-conscious financial services company. We do all we can to support conduct in compliance with regulations and values, from the highest executive body to new recruits. The Code of Compliance serves us as a guideline here and is the expression of our corporate responsibility and corporate culture. We are reducing environmental, business and social risks with the help of our management systems and approaches. Apart from many other topics, we also focus in this regard on environmental standards, human rights and avoiding bribery and corruption. Group guidelines and directives ensure that the requirements are taken into account in our core business and also in projects. The principles and guidelines of compliance management are defined in the Compliance Regulations of the Helvetia Group, which were commissioned and approved by the Board of Directors. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 31 Organisation GRI 102-18, 103-3 The Strategy and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of the Helvetia Group takes care of the good corporate governance of the Helvetia Group at the highest level. The Group Compliance Officer is organisationally part of the Corporate Center and reports to the Group management and Board of Directors. The country markets have their own compliance officers, who in each case are supported by specialists for the subjects of money laundering, data protection, competition law and other subject fields, such as sanctions and embargoes. During the identification, evaluation, control, monitoring and documentation of the risks, the Group Compliance Officer cooperates closely with the qualitative risk management. Current developments are observed on an ongoing basis as part of the ICOR process (Internal Control System and Operational Risk Management) and are placed on the compliance agenda as required. Based on the regulatory requirements, we have defined thresholds for this purpose in relation to financial, operational or regulatory risks as well as reputational risk and made sure there is a corresponding reporting process. s ee also p. 33, Risk management Involvement of employees We have recorded the main regulations and basic principles for the most important compliance subjects in the Code of Compliance. Beginning with business behaviour in compliance with regulations, through to avoiding fraud, bribery and corruption, and including transparent communication, it formulates guidelines for our corporate actions. If necessary, these are specified through internal directives. It is binding on all business units and employees of the Helvetia Group. Regular courses at all levels promote an awareness for value-oriented conduct in accordance with the regulations. An e-learning basic training is compulsory for all employees on joining and is repeated subsequently every two years. For this purpose, specific courses occur regularly for especially exposed functional areas (such as awarding mortgages or with regard to money laundering) and we set special store by integrity in behaviour in management training. We are aware that breaches of regulations can 96% occur in day-to-day business and that an evaluation is not always unambiguous. For example, there is sometimes only a small difference between trivial and acceptable gifts and bribery or corruption to achieve underhand advantages. In the event of uncertainty, our employees can contact the correof our employees are familiar sponding compliance officers in their country markets with complaints or with the Code of Compliance observations. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 32 Our employees can contact the corresponding compliance officers in their country markets GRI 103-2  with complaints or observations. Information and contacts can be found easily on the intranet and are transparently communicated. For example, 88 per cent of Helvetia Group employees confirmed in the comprehensive employee survey Commit in 2016 that they knew which bodies they could contact in the case of identified or suspected breaches in their area. 2018 review and progress GRI 103-3 The compliance officers of the country markets submit reports to the Group Compliance Officer at least every-half year on important topics and any cases and breaches that have occurred. The latter inform the Group management and Board of Directors of the Helvetia Group of the compliance process, corresponding activities and the evaluation of the compliance risks. Moreover, the Group Compliance Officer submits a semi-annual and annual reGRI 205-3 port. In 2018, there were no significant breaches against laws and regulations in the social GRI 419-1 and economic sphere. The Code of Compliance is communicated to all new employees and can in addition be inspected at any time on the intranet. For technical reasons, there has not been any explicit evaluation of how many employees at which hierarchical level inspected the Code of Compliance in the year under review to date. Moreover, all newly recruited employees are called on to complete an e-learning module on the Code of Compliance. In the year under review, a refresher on the Code of Compliance was conducted in Switzerland on a broad front. For this purpose, 2,193 employees were called on, of whom 94 per cent successfully completed the course. In addition, 17 classroom compliance courses were carried out. Apart from introductions to GRI 205-2 compliance, these were above all courses on the subject of sanctions/embargoes and the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 33 Risk management Importance of sustainability risks for Helvetia GRI 103-1,  102-11 The observance of human and labour rights or environmental standards are part of reliable corporate behaviour for Helvetia. Their observance is assuming increasing importance in public opinion as are discussions of future energy use and water shortages. These developments have the potential to lead to great changes and global imbalances, which in the mediumand long-term could have financial consequences. For example, the potential effects of climate change are to date difficult to assess. Increasing natural catastrophes can influence the frequency and amounts of claims, but also have effects on real estate evaluations, reinsurance premiums and the stability of financial markets as a whole. Moreover, there are also reputational risks in this area for Helvetia. Perceptions regarding which circumstances or behaviours are classified as social, ecological or also economically legitimate or illegitimate are changing continually. For example, the reorientation of the UN Global Compact with greater binding force and discussions on the contribution of companies to the achievement of sustainable development goals show that companies are assigned an important role in boosting sustainability performance and their behaviour is therefore evaluated correspondingly critically. Comprehensive consideration of sustainability risks GRI 103-2 Professional handling of risks is part of everyday business for Helvetia. In this respect, we continuously include social developments in the preparation of our strategies for risk evaluation and avoidance. The consideration of ecological, social and governance risks is correspondingly part of our risk management processes. Our goal in this regard is to minimise see  also Financial report, p. 4 f. the risk of human rights violations or the disregard of environmental standards as far as possible in our area of influence. For example, in the annual Group-wide comprehensive risk profiling process (CRP), potential ESG risks are identified and evaluated on the basis of varied sources. We distinguish between four risk classes here – from marginal risks with low potential impact to critical risks which could massively impair our business activity. We take ESG risks into account in underwriting in a multilevel process. We observe all applicable economic sanctions in the countries in which we operate. FurtherGRI 103-2 more, our underwriting guidelines cover human rights and environmental aspects. These are checked as part of the due diligence process for insurance decisions. In addition, we identify countries in which there are systematic violations of human rights or where sanctions and embargoes have been imposed by the UN, the OECD or the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). There are specific rules governing transactions in these countries which provide for detailed review if material risks have been identified. In addition to area managers, additional units including CR and Compliance may be involved in such reviews as appropriate as well as the responsible member of Group management. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 34 In this regard, we make an effort to ensure that the risk is limited and preventive measures GRI 103-2 are taken. Should this not be possible, we rate the risks as “unacceptable” if appropriate. This decision can be based on the severity of the violation, the extent of potential harm to people or the environment and/or economic impact. This also applies to cases in which our influence is limited, since we are not the leading insurer, for example. In order to sensitise employees in underwriting for ESG risks, they receive a current evalu­ ation every quarter on high-risk sectors and a compilation of the most important emerging ESG risks. Moreover, we conduct regular information events. For example, in the year under review 2018, all employees in underwriting for major projects were provided with information regarding the integration of ESG aspects in transaction decisions and the status at ­Helvetia. In the course of several workshops, we worked out with all portfolio managers how we could implement our approach for sustainable financial assets in new investments even better and what processes we could optimise. Externally, we furthermore cooperate with other firms and stakeholders in civil society in such frameworks as the United Nations Financial Initiative and the UN Global Compact so as to raise awareness of risks connected with corporate social responsibility and develop effective responses to these risks. 2018 review and progress GRI 103-2, 103-3 We are continuing to develop the systematic integration of ESG risks in our risk management process. For this purpose, the CR department, Risk Management and Compliance have proposed adjustments and supplements that will be integrated in the underwriting guidelines in the year under review. The central aspect here is earlier consideration of ESG aspects in advance of decisions that could have long-term effects on risk structures. These include, for example, entering new business sectors or selecting technologies to be insured. The responsibilities for the identification, observation and evaluation of ESG risks is to be better documented, as well. Since this year, the employees in the Investment Management and Specialty Lines departments have been able to access their own intranet area for important information and an external ESG data portal. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 35 Sustainable procurement Responsibility for environment and company GRI 103-1, 102-9 Protection of the environment and the climate is one of the most important global challenges. Helvetia supports the development of a low CO2 and inclusive economy. However, compared to manufacturing companies, the flow of material and resources in a financial services company like Helvetia are limited. Our direct influence on the environment and society arises above all through the procurement and use of the infrastructure we need to render our services. This in particular includes the office buildings and corresponding building technology, business travel, the IT and office infrastructure, as well as office and marketing material. Both in their procurement as well as in use, we would like to avoid causing negative effects on the environment and society as far as possible. Sustainable and climatically responsible procurement GRI 103-2 Procurement guideline We highly value local, environmentally friendly and socially responsible procurement and use of our infrastructure and consumable materials. We define the guidelines for environmentally and socially compatible procurement with our basic principles for sustainable procurement. An internal procurement guideline specifies this for our purchasing managers. It defines clear minimum requirements and additional voluntary criteria, which are intended to promote environmentally friendly and socially compatible purchasing for 13 goods categories. The product categories extend from the food in the staff restaurant, the IT infrastructure and cleaning materials to customer gifts. The guideline is based on recognised labels and standards, such as Blue Angel, the energy label or the Business Social Compliance Initiative (BSCI). In addition, it provides those responsible for the procurement of goods and services with information on the relevant social or ecological aspects and provides advice on how they can address these in supplier discussions. Procurement is organised decentrally in the country markets with managers for individual product groups. IT infrastructure, which is procured Group-wide, is an exception. CO2 emissions and environmental management GRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-3 For our environmental management, we record all emissions arising from our building use, business travel, paper and water consumption and waste disposal. In 2015, we set ourselves the goal of lowering our absolute CO2 emissions by 2020 by 10 per cent compared to 2012. We would even like to cut the relative CO2 emissions per employee (in FTE) in the period 2012 to 2020 by 20 per cent. To calculate these greenhouse gas emissions, we will rely on the methodology of the VfU sustainability network for financial institutions in the version of the reference year 2012. We will also define our measures to reduce our emissions on the basis of this data. We would like to reduce greenhouse gas emissions above all through efficiency increases or the use of renewable energy sources. Following the switch to 100 per cent electricity from renewable sources at the level of the Helvetia Group in 2015, the CR Advisory Board decided to focus on the areas of heating and business travel up to 2020 and to identify and realise potential for reduction in a targeted manner. Since 2017, we have been compensating unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions through investments in climate protection projects. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 36 The specialist managers for the procurement and management of the corresponding product GRI 103-2 groups, installations and infrastructure are responsible for the optimisation of environmental management. In implementing individual measures, they are supported by the CR department at the Group level. A Group-wide CO2 plan of action bundles the planned measures. To render the results of our efforts transparent and credibly understandable for our stakeholders, the Helvetia Group has been reporting annually on its climate protection measures since 2012 as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). As a member of the RE 100 initiative of the Climate Group, we publicly affirm that we make exclusive use of electricity from renewable sources and in this way would also like to motivate other companies to convert to environmentally friendly electricity.

Apart from the substantive aspects, approaches were above all prepared to simplify application of the guidelines in regular procurement processes. An update of the procurement principles explained this clearly and was communicated throughout the Group. Development of CO2 emissions Compared to the previous year, absolute CO2 emissions at Helvetia fell by 3.5 per cent to 15,302 tons. The relative CO2 emissions per full-time equivalent also again fell by 7.2 per cent and now amount to just under 2.2 tons. Compared to the reference year 2012, they decreased as a whole by almost 32 per cent. We reduced absolute CO2 emissions despite our company growing by 9 per cent, compared to 2012. see also p. 57, Key figures environment Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 37 Development of CO2 emissions per employee (FTE) in kg 7000 6000 CO2 5000 4000 3000 Electricity 2.6% Heating 19.5% 2000 Business travel 70.5% Paper 5.3% 1000 Wasser 0.6% Waste 1.5% Share absolute CO2 emissions 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 CH DE IT ES AT FR Group Target value About 90 per cent of the decline in absolute emissions is attributable to a reduction in busiGRI 103-2, ness travel in the year under review. Thanks to further consolidation of the Helvetia Group, fewer trips for coordination were necessary in the country markets Switzerland, Italy and Austria. By contrast, in France business travel once again increased, since business with South-East Asia continued to expand. Our greenhouse gas emissions also declined slightly once again in most of the country markets due to more economical use of paper and water as well as a lower heating energy requirement as a result of a mild winter. In total, over 70 per cent of our CO2 emissions arise from business travel, followed by the heating energy used (about 20%). The electricity we used in the year under review was 100 per cent from renewable sources. We achieved this on the one hand through corresponding supplier agreements and on the other through the acquisition of certificates of origin for hydro power from Switzerland. Since the year under review, the country markets Austria and Germany obtain electricity exclusively from renewable sources from their suppliers. These have a green electricity mix with a somewhat poorer evaluation than the Group-wide sources of origin purchased for energy from Swiss run-of-river hydroelectricity plants (0.3% of total emissions). Since Germany and Austria are supporting the further development of sustainable electricity markets in Europe with the conversion, this effect appears to be insignificant. Our environmental key figures were independently reviewed at Group level for the 2018 financial year. s ee also p. 75, Assurance statement in the notes Compared to the reference year, we have clearly increased our energy efficiency with targeted measures. This potential has now largely been exploited and we have noticed a stabilisation in our CO2 footprint over the last three years. Reaching our absolute reduction target by 2020 is as a result endangered. Therefore, we have decided to support climate protection projects via ClimatePartner with which our remaining greenhouse gas emissions can be effectively “compensated”. We regard emission compensation admittedly only as a temporary solution; however, as a responsible company we already want to make as positive a contribution as possible today. Therefore, we take care that our donations flow into projects whose climate protection effect has been independently reviewed and which have positive economic and social effects. Under the ClimatePartner-ID of Helvetia 12937-1809-1001, the respective projects and quantities can be transparently understood. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 38 Attractive employer – for and with our employees As a financial service company, Helvetia is dependent to a high degree on capable and GRI 103-1 committed employees in order to maintain its position on the market in the long term. Helvetia can meet current challenges – such as digitalisation, changing customer needs and demographic developments – best with well-trained and agile employees. By means of the strategy helvetia 20.20, we consistently place customers at the centre of our actions and operate agilely and innovatively to exploit the opportunities of digitalisation for our company. This places high demands on our employees and our human resources management (HR). Requirement and job profiles are changing rapidly and require flexibility, networked thinking, and pragmatic and collaborative work sharing. Moreover, the expectations of our (future) employees are shifting. Apart from attractive compensation models, points deemed important in employer assessments include flexible lifeand-work models, enough room for one’s own ideas and creativity, and work which has an individual meaning. Helvetia weighs its role as attractive employer correspondingly highly. For us, this includes on the one hand good employment conditions, with which it is possible to acquire good employees and retain them with the company in the long term. On the other hand, this includes a working environment in which employees can fully develop their potential. An attractive working environment is the foundation for the physical and psychological well-being of our employees and as a result also for their commitment to the company and to society. Responsibility for HR at Helvetia resides with the Head Human Resources who reports directly to the CEO Philipp Gmür. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 39 Promotion of employees HR-Strategie GRI 103-2 Our goal is to employ satisfied and efficient employees in the long term, who have the ­capabilities and competences to master challenges in a constantly changing working world. We need employees with the right capabilities at the right time at the right place. In the last two years, we have carried out comprehensive analyses on the positioning of ­Helvetia as an employer. In this regard, it became clear that the attractiveness of our employment conditions, the development options as well as our culture may be regarded as sound both from internal and external perspectives. The relatively long duration of employment, especially among the managers, indicates great satisfaction with Helvetia as an employer. At the same time, there is still optimisation potential in terms of flexibility, agility, promotion of above-average performance, innovative energy and diversity. We have reacted to this with the preparation of a “Group HR strategy”, which from spring 2018 will formulate the direction of the HR management. At the core is the promotion of a heterogeneous employee structure in relation to origin, gender, education and capabilities. However, the duration of employment and loyalty as well as basic attitudes, modes of thinking and life concepts are also the subject of the strategy. To achieve this, we develop individual work models, which employees can make use of depending on their needs and expectations. With so-called life-phase-oriented employee services, our employees can adjust the conditions across their professional career according to their needs and in this way find thoroughly attractive conditions at Helvetia. At the same time, a heterogeneous employee structure also requires extensive scope for action and room to manoeuvre in order to make the best possible use of individual potential. For the managers in particular, this requires switching to a culture based more on setting individual guiding principles than on the identical treatment of all employees. The HR strategy includes the following four directions, which can be adjusted by the country markets in their individual HR strategies to the specific local needs. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 40 Active workforce management GRI 103-2 Helvetia pursues the aim of having the appropriate number and quality of employees at all times. In the 2017 year under review, we launched comprehensive talent and successor management. Based on annual standardised employee discussions, employees with potential are identified here, whose professional development receives targeted support. The goal is to expand the individual scope for action and make the best possible use of the employees’ potential. At the same time, managers are to be developed internally and open position should mainly be filled from our own ranks. Furthermore, we provide various sectors with targeted support in their business transformation. Internal key figures, such as the job occupation rate and data on internal mobility, permit us to monitor achievement of the objectives continually. Cultural transformation We are initiating a cultural transformation towards greater customer orientation, innovation and agility. The goal is to transform the understanding of work and management from within. For this purpose, we connect the many different initiatives within Helvetia and promote the exchange of ideas and joint learning. The aim in this regard is for employees to develop an understanding of what our strategic objectives really mean in day-to-day work and how they can support their implementation. We can determine whether we are on target here by means of customer and employee surveys and not least through our business result. Apart from an internal cultural identity, Helvetia will in addition be promoting greater diversity in its workforce in the coming years. A diverse employee structure will promote the exchange of knowledge and experience and favour the development of creative problem solving. For example, various measures aim to achieve a balanced generational relationship, boost the share of women in the sales force and increase the proportion of women in management positions. Employer of choice We have positioned ourselves as an attractive employer and in the long term, we would like to acquire the right employees. To this end, we have expanded the above-mentioned offering of life-phase-oriented employer services and have adopted new approaches in recruiting. For example, this permits our employees to configure their work load, payment and place of work according to their personal needs to some extent during their career at Helvetia. Furthermore, we are continuously investing in attractive framework conditions and promote an environment in which our employees can contribute their strengths and ideas. Helvetia also assigns a high priority to the health as well as the physical and spiritual well-being of its employees and promotes this as part of its company health management. We check whether we are on course with our measures with employer attractiveness studies and internal key figures, such as the length of time new entrants remain. Moreover, since 2016 we have been honoured in our domestic market Switzerland with the “Friendly Work Space” quality seal from Health Promotion Switzerland. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 41 Customer focus and efficiency GRI 103-2 We support our managers by providing them with strategically relevant HR key figures and straightforward HR processes and workflows. With processing options that are independent of time and place as well as improved means of communication, we help our managers and employees to complete their tasks and concerns smoothly. We continuously check our progress here with customer and employee surveys, internal key figures and by reviewing adherence to our service level agreements. 2018 review and progress GRI 103-3 Employee survey In order to examine the effect of our many different measures on employee satisfaction and commitment and if necessary deduce improvement measures, up to 2016 we conducted the Group-wide employee survey Commit every three years. In future, we would like to obtain the feedback from our employees faster and more flexibly to check regularly whether we are on course with our revised HR strategy and the measures deduced from it and where if applicable there is also a more short-term need for adjustments. Consequently, in the year under review we began to prepare so-called pulse surveys with which we consult our employees twice a year in a short survey. The focus continues to be on questions to assess framework conditions, such as organisation and processes, corporate culture, management behaviour, goals and performance incentives and the flow of information. In addition, focus subjects with varying content are surveyed. The results are analysed by the individual area, department and team managers in the country markets and by the Executive Management. They are supported here by the HR Leadership & Development department in interpreting the data correctly and deducing specific measures. The respective managers are responsible for implementing and controlling the measures. The progress of the measures is surveyed annually at the Group level. Leadership@helvetia In order to reinforce the agility and ability to change of our managers and improve their interdepartmental cooperation, a Group-wide development programme for managers was introduced in the year under review. About 200 managers from the country markets Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland have already taken part in it. The rollout in France and Spain is already planned for 2019. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 42 Employer campaign &go GRI 103-3 The new campaign for employer positioning began in Switzerland in September 2018. &go stands for our combination of proven strengths with an enterprising approach to tackling the challenges of tomorrow. It embodies a forgiving error culture, which allows innovative and unconventional solutions to be tested without fear. About 150 employees in different countries were involved in focus groups in the development and all employees were able to participate online in the discussion. The rollout in other country markets is planned for the coming year. Further education GRI 404-1 Helvetia invests in the further development of its employees with an average of nearly 20 training hours per employee. However, the prime focus for us is not the scope, but the orientation to the existing and future needs of both the employee and Helvetia. The fact that the average training period of internal service and sales force employees is converging is proof of our focus on life-long learning: a single course or degree is no longer enough in internal services either in order to permanently do justice to the changing requirements of the working environment. Helvetia promotes innovative approaches in further education and development and is also continually expanding the e-learning product range. Training in hours per FTE 2017 2018 GRI 404-1 Sales force 44.8 33.5 see also p. 54, Key figures Internal service 14.7 8.1 employees Women 19.4 17.3 Men 24.7 21.0 Executive Board members 14.7 20.4 Management 21.6 18.7 Specialists 11.8 8.6 Clerks 23.1 12.2 Total 22.8 19.6 WorkReallySmart@helvetia Currently, the proportion of female managers at Helvetia is stagnating at 19.4 per cent with an average female proportion of over 36 per cent. Whereas the gender proportion of the employees under 30 is approximately balanced, the female proportion falls markedly, calculated in full-time equivalents (FTE), in those over 30. This impedes the development of female managers. At the same time, increasing numbers of employees are seeking the opportunity to configure their working life flexibly for all sorts of reasons. We would like to meet these needs with flexible work-time models, part-time workloads and job sharing as well as the promotion of day care places for better compatibility of family and profession. These measures are part of the development of life-phase-oriented employer services titled “WorkReallySmart@helvetia”. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 43 A review of salaries by the Competence Center for Diversity & Inclusions of the University of GRI 103-3 St. Gallen in the year under review confirmed Helvetia paid fair salaries according to the principle “equal pay for equal work”. Moreover, in our domestic market Switzerland, we employ staff with psychological or physical handicaps and in this way enable them to continue to take part in working life. In 2018, this corresponded to 13 full-time equivalents. Talent management GRI 404-3 In the year under review, about 74 per cent of the employees received comprehensive feedback and evaluation of their performance and development options. At the same time, they were able to give their managers feedback on their current condition, cooperation in the team and with superiors, and propose improvements. The phased introduction of talent management in the Helvetia country markets since 2017 has resulted in marked fluctuations in the proportions of employees who received a performance evaluation. The target if possible is for all employees to receive annual feedback. In the year under review, 4 per cent of our employees far exceeded the expected performance and as many again demonstrated very high development potential. In order to promote this in a targeted manner in future and prepare for additional management functions, more than 20 talent conferences have been carried out in Switzerland since 2017. Another eight conferences took place in the other country markets in 2018.

They reinforce innovative energy and as a result also the resilience of Helvetia to react to challenges in the ESG area and beyond. Only in an open environment in which risks are taken and ideas can be contributed do employees Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 44 develop their potential and drive innovations. For this, official ports of call and means of GRI 103-2,  103-3 co-determination are necessary on the one hand, such as regular feedback discussions with superiors and the (legally provided for) co-determination opportunities or advice services for employees. Furthermore, regular campaigns and workshops target motivated employees and encourage them to take part in the further development of innovations, also across departments. Every three years, we use the employee survey Commit to find out how strongly our employGRI Own indicator ee identify themselves with Helvetia and how they see their room for manoeuvre at work. When last conducted in 2016, the commitment to Helvetia had a pleasing value of 76 (scale of 0 to 100), only two points under the value of 2013. Against the background of the mer­ ger with Nationale Suisse in 2015 and the associated uncertainty of various employees, this was a very stable value. By introducing the above-mentioned “pulse surveys”, we would like to receive feedback on the identification and commitment of our employees even more frequently and regularly review this. In 2019, a corresponding indicator will be prepared. Employee co-determination GRI 102-41 The legal conditions for employee co-determination at Helvetia differ considerably in part in the individual countries. Helvetia grants all of its employees the co-determination opportunities legally provided for and grants them the possibility to organise themselves in employee representative bodies. While representation of the rights of the employees in Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy and France through works councils and trade unions is traditionally very strong, co-determination in the Swiss domestic market has been regulated for 15 years through a voluntary agreement between the personnel commission PEKO and Helvetia as employer. Helvetia has set up a European forum to which representatives of the country companies belong for the international exchange of information and consultation of employees regarding issues with international implications. It meets at least once a year, chaired by Executive Management member for Europe, Markus Gemperle. The collective wage agreement structure differs considerably in the country markets, too. Whereas in Switzerland a collective labour agreement exists neither for the internal services nor for the sales force, in Spain, for example, all employees (with the exception of interns) are subject to a collective wage agreement. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 45 Share of employees with collective wage agreement Share Change compared to in % Share 2016 Share 2017 2018 previous year in % GRI 102-41 Switzerland 0.0 0.0 0.0 – Germany 86.2 86.5 87.2 0.8 Austria 97.4 96.7 95.9 –0.9 Italy 100.0 98.6 98.8 0.2 Spain 82.0 83.0 78.4 –5.6 France 99.9 100.0 100.0 0.0 Helvetia total 40.3 40.0 38.1 –4.7 Social commitment of employees GRI 103-2 Helvetia supports employees who devote themselves as volunteers for public affairs, society and environmental protection. Taking sabbaticals or unpaid leave is possible in consultation with their manager for a commitment in the private or personal area. Working time can also be made available for a corresponding commitment. The specific arrangements in this matter are made by the country markets. Skill-based volunteering Since September 2018 and as part of a pilot project, Helvetia employees in Switzerland have been able to volunteer their know-how to a charitable organisation for a period of up to five days. They support the partner organisations for example in personnel management, marketing, IT or also in strategy development. The organisations benefit here from the knowledge and experience of our employees. The latter in turn obtain insights into another environment and at the same time make a valuable contribution to civil society. As a result, the project combines two core ambitions of Helvetia as attractive employer and committed location partner. Selected employees participated at the locations Basel and St. Gallen. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 46 Committed location partner – Helvetia is active locally As a successful international insurance group, Helvetia maintains good and constructive relationships at the locations where it operates. It makes a contribution to the local community with its business through the occupational benefit scheme for individuals as well as investment protection for the investments and assets of small, medium and large companies. Furthermore, we meet our responsibilities as “good neighbour” and are actively committed to the environment and society. Public Policy Helvetia in political dialogue GRI 103-1  The environment is highly regulated for insurance companies and is constantly evolving as a result of technological change, demographic challenges and further regulations. In relation to these aspects, Helvetia is in constant dialogue with administration, politics, academia and civil society: in the first place, the regulations by international capital and solvency standards are central to our business. Secondly, digital innovations permit the development of new business models and at the same time engender new market participants in the form of fintech and insurtech companies. However, the formulation of the regulatory framework here is still in its infancy. Thirdly, we address topics that are gaining in importance, such as the challenges of old-age care as part of demographic developments in Europe, regulations in the area of data processing and protection and international cooperation in the field of cyber risks. In this complex situation, it is important for Helvetia and its business success to help configure the framework conditions in a committed and transparent manner and in this way represent the interests of our investors, customers and employees. Public Affairs Policy GRI 103-2 Helvetia has devoted itself to the most helpful political and regulatory framework conditions possible by means of an active, responsible and permanent dialogue with various social players and stakeholders. We would like to create an environment that permits us to adopt trends in our business activity proactively, minimise barriers and actively manage reputational risks. Anchoring in the Group and country markets In organisational terms, public policy is the remit of the Public Affairs department, which belongs to the Corporate Center. Helvetia is committed to the professional code regulations of the Swiss Public Affairs Society (SPAG) and the associated “Code de Lisbonne”. It coord­ inates the activities within the Group, is involved in the Swiss domestic market and observes the relevant developments at the European and international level. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 47 Public Affairs Policy GRI 103-2 To this end, our Public Affairs Policy formulates long-term normative guidelines for the Helvetia Group and its country markets. At its heart lies participation in the current political formation of opinion in relation to the core business. This occurs via cooperation in the local industry associations. In these, we coordinate positions and represent these transparently and reliably. The country markets commit themselves in stakeholder discussions, know-how transfers, studies, media contributions and events. The aim here is in particular the distribution of specialised knowledge as the basis for making informed decisions. Political sponsoring is only possible within clearly defined criteria, for example as event sponsoring for selected topics, support of politically committed employees and via party financing. The guidelines for this are laid down in the “Helvetia party financing” policy. In the country markets, we define medium-term public affairs strategies, which are coord­ inated with the strategic goals of the country market and the Group helvetia 20.20 strategy. Here, we define overriding themes of great relevance and detailed basic principles for operational implementation. At the operational level, the countries develop individual public affairs plans based on these GRI 103-2 framework conditions. Continuous monitoring of the relevant legislative and regulatory activities and regular reconciliation at the Group level guarantee a systematic evaluation of the effects and opportunities to be expected and permits the well-founded development of our own positions. 2018 review and progress GRI 103-3 Party financing GRI 415-1  Helvetia only supports political parties in the Swiss country market. Since 2016, Helvetia has been making an annual contribution of CHF 123,000 to constituency work. In the year under review, CHF 84,909 of these were in demand. All of the parties represented in the Swiss Federal Assembly and more than half of those active in Swiss cantons receive on request a contribution that they can dispose of freely, without a political quid pro quo. The contribution is based on the respective parliamentary mandates: the total sum is distributed in halves to the two chambers, National Council and Council of States, corresponding to a contribution of about CHF 308 per National Council and about CHF 1,337 per Council of States mandate. This transparency is in harmony with the recommendations of the European Council committee GRECO (Groupe d’Etats contre la Corruption). On request, Helvetia can also support candidatures of employees for political offices at cantonal and national level. In addition, Helvetia promotes the political commitment of its employees with an appropriate regulation of their working hours. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 48 Promotion of militia work In its domestic market Switzerland, Helvetia supports the political militia system and proGRI 103-2 motes the compatibility of career and commitment with public offices, among other things, through appropriate regulation of working hours. In preparation for the “Year of Militia Work” 2019, we launched an idea competition for a forward-looking and innovative militia system in the year under review together with competitors, the municipality association and other organisations. From the approximately 20 ideas received, the three most promising will receive prizes at a public ceremony. Moreover, our politically active and motivated employees can regularly exchange views in network events; in 2018, the focus was on the subject of shortage of experts. Focus day #jugend_diskutiert (youth discusses) Helvetia promotes the political commitment of young people in Switzerland. This commitment can be found at the interface between public policy and corporate citizenship. For example, as sponsor of the platform engage.ch, we promote a low-threshold participation in political planning and participation processes under the umbrella of the Swiss young people’s parliaments. Furthermore, at the Basel location, we invited our trainees together with those of other local insurance companies to the first focus day #jugend_diskutiert (youth discusses) in November 2018. The goal is to remove the inhibitions of non-academically educated young people in particular to become politically engaged and provide them with the means to participate in political discourse. The over 100 participants engaged in discussions with the politicians of the youth parties, took part in the art of political debate and learnt to put forward their knowledge on economic subjects as experts. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 49 Corporate Citizenship Helvetia as good neighbour GRI 103-1  Helvetia sees itself as part of society and as a result also as a protagonist at the locations where it operates. It makes a contribution to the positive development of the environment and society through contributions in the form of time, specialist knowledge and funding. Above all, in the country markets with a strong sales force network, the employees of Helvetia are in part strongly integrated in local communities and as a result have a good understanding of the needs of the population. Our commitments and progress in 2018 GRI 103-2, 103-3 With our Corporate Citizenship commitment, we would like to play an active role and make a social contribution, which extends beyond the occupational benefit scheme and the coverage activities of our core business. Helvetia and the people who work for it should have a positive influence primarily by means of their business services, but also through the voluntary work for customers and society. In contrast to classic sponsoring, where clearly defined quid pro quos are agreed, we understand public welfare management to mean promotion or support where our service goes clearly beyond any counterperformance (such as in the form of communication). We concentrated our commitment on the four core areas of protection forests, cooperation with the Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation, art, and promotion of health and popular sports. In addition, we support smaller local projects and initiatives, depending on the situation. These depend on local circumstances and permit the country markets and sales force units to set their own priorities. However, the basic principle is always the connection to our core business and close orientation to our central values of “drive”, trust” and enthusiasm”. Helvetia is also active in classical sponsoring, especially in sport sponsoring.

This did not include the expenditure for protection forest commitment and the Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation. Support of museums and the promotion of sporting events enjoyed targeted expansion in the country market France. Cooperation with the University St. Gallen was intensified through support of the HSG Learning Center in the country market Switzerland. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 50 The support of citizenship activities at Helvetia are primarily taken care of in organisational GRI 103-2, 103-3 terms by Branding, Corporate Responsibility, Communications and HR. More systematic recognition, coordination and impact measurement are to be developed in the coming years. Protection forest initiative Protection forests make a great contribution to the protection of settlements and infrastructure against falling rocks, landslides, mudflows or avalanches. We have been working for the (re-)forestation and care of these forests since 2011. Careful management of protection forests can alleviate the severity of natural events and protect life and property against damage. We develop and realise the protection forest projects in close cooperation with the local forest authorities. Helvetia finances the planting of about 10,000 trees per project. Through the acquisition of protection forest certificates, Helvetia customers can participate in the plantings and in this way contribute to the protection forests becoming bigger faster. In the year under review, we spent about CHF 450,000 for protection forest commitment and realised seven new protection forest projects in five country markets. As a result, Helvetia has to date implemented 35 protection forest projects and financed the planting of over 360,000 trees. Since 2014, we have been the main sponsor of the Alpine Protection Forest Award Helvetia, which is awarded by the Consortium of Alpine Forestry Associations to projects especially devoted to protection forests. Four projects from Switzerland and Austria were honoured in the year under review. This year, the award as protection forest sponsor went to Ruedi Walli from Grisons. The carpenter and builder of wooden houses has created a deep awareness for a sustainable and regionally functioning forest-timber added value chain and devotes himself to the meaningful use of forests that is close to nature. Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation We work together closely with the Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation, which has been supporting individual projects for children and adolescents since 1978. It focuses on the subject areas sport and leisure, music and theatre as well as the promotion of physically or mentally impaired adolescents. The Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation relies on versatility and provides innovative projects, which often do not fit into bigger support programmes, with the “realisation assistance” needed. The general agencies or sales force organisations of Helvetia act as a kind of connecting element between the foundation and local population. They inform individuals and institutions locally about the foundation and possibility of support. Apart from this, they support the foundation in the preliminary examination of requests and in the administrative processing and communication of projects. In 2018, the Helvetia Patria Jeunesse foundation supported 88 projects with CHF 291,058. After Italy, the commitment of the foundation was expanded in the year under review to the country market Austria. Here it was possible to finance a total of twelve projects, from summer camps and children’s bicycle days to games festivals. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 CR progress 51 Art commitment GRI 103-2, 103-3 Helvetia is active in the safeguarding of works of art in its core business with the Artas art insurance. In addition, it does a great deal for art and artists. Previously, the Swiss domestic market was the focus of this commitment, since it originated with the Nationale Suisse insurance company, which was integrated in Helvetia in 2015. Helvetia maintains a large art collection with about 1,700 works by about 400 artists and awards the Helvetia Art Prize to an up-and-coming Swiss artist every year, worth CHF 15,000. In 2018, the prize went to Gina Proenza, who presented her personal image world in Basel, which is based on anthropological research, ancestor stories, legends and the influence of South American authors. In addition, Helvetia is trying to lower the threshold and widen the audience for art appreciation. For example, digitalisation projects in cooperation with renowned museums facilitate the archiving and incorporation of selected portfolios. Based on this, participatory exhibition formats have been developed, which can then also be appreciated beyond the borders of Switzerland. Health and popular sports Helvetia takes an active part in sports sponsoring, focused on Alpine sports and football, above all in its Swiss domestic market and Austria. Apart from these classic sponsoring partnerships, Helvetia supports numerous popular sport activities in all of its country markets and projects to promote balanced nutrition or healthcare. We are guided here by our values “drive” and “enthusiasm”, which should be reflected in the projects supported. “We provide transparent information on the development of our key figures.” Overview of our key figures 54 Key figures employees 57 Key figures environment Key figures employees Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 Overview of our key figures 54 Group CH DE ES IT AT FR Change compared to previous year 2017 2018 in % 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 Personnel structure GRI 102-8 in full-time equivalents Executive Board members 46 51 10.9 16 21 6 6 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5 Management 1006 1060 5.4 578 635 95 105 80 84 116 113 76 65 61 58 Specialists 725 1059 46.1 571 874 74 69 29 22 12 11 31 75 8 8 Clerks 4537 4399 –3.0 2291 2190 600 587 448 446 353 355 614 590 230 231 Junior staff 280 319 13.7 204 233 24 24 8 7 16 21 19 16 10 18 Temporary employees 92 62 –32.4 80 54 12 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Employees total 6685 6949 1 3.9 3739 4007 810 798 572 566 504 507 745 751 315 320 Fluctuation ratio (departures in % of existing personnel) 9.1 9.5 4.5 9.6 7.7 12.6 15.1 6.6 11.5 3.1 8.9 11.5 7.8 11.8 16.7 Internal service 5166 5351 3.6 2797 2986 683 676 405 397 504 507 462 465 315 320 Sales force 1518 1597 5.2 942 1021 127 122 167 169 – – 283 286 – – Female temporary employees 229 239 4.3 151 158 17 16 33 25 7 14 5 8 17 18 Male temporary employees 209 190 –9.2 133 135 27 21 15 8 9 7 18 10 7 9 Total temporary employees 439 430 –2.1 284 293 45 37 48 33 16 21 23 19 24 27 Full-time female employees 2203 2303 4.6 1054 1142 287 289 212 221 201 206 283 277 166 167 Full-time male employees 4043 4216 4.3 2402 2572 478 472 312 312 287 279 439 456 125 126 Total full-time employees 6246 6519 4.4 3455 3715 766 761 524 533 488 486 722 733 291 293 1 Incl. junior staff and temporary workers, in contrast to the total number of 6,624 employees mentioned on p. 4 and in the Company brochure.

We have not assessed the following KPIs or information disclosed in the report:  Information other than marked  KPIs of prior reporting periods  Qualitative statements Responsibility of Helvetia Holding AG’s management The management of Helvetia Holding AG is responsible for the preparation of the disclosed KPIs marked with a in the Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 in accordance with the applicable criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant for the preparation of KPIs that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Applicable criteria Helvetia Holding AG defined as applicable criteria (hereafter “applicable criteria”):  GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016, Core Option We believe that these criteria are a suitable basis for our review. Independence and Quality Control We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. The firm applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Corporate Responsibility Report 2018 Notes 76 2 Our responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the above mentioned KPIs based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000”). This standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the KPIs in the report are free from material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements in the report with regard to the applicable criteria. Summary of work performed Our limited assurance procedures included, amongst others, the following work:  Assessment of the suitability of the underlying criteria and their consistent application  Inquiries of company’s representatives responsible for collecting, consolidating and calculating the KPIs marked with a in the report in order to assess the process of preparing the report, the reporting system, the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance engagement  Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and processes for compiling, analyzing, and aggregating sustainability data and testing such documentation on a sample of basis  Analytical procedures, inquiries and inspection of documents on a sample basis with respect to the compilation and reporting of quantitative data  Critical review of the report regarding plausibility and consistency of the information marked with a in the report The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the KPIs marked with a in the report have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria. Conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the KPIs marked with a in the report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.
