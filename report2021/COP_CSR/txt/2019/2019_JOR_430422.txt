and are audited internally and externally every year. ɐ We require our business partners and our staff to abide by the safety requirements: from enforcing safety gear on construction sites, to the safety measures to the public in the area. This is followed up by the Quality Department at project sites. ɐ We abide and require our business partners to work on an “Environment Assessment” for each project. This is part of our Project Quality Plan (PQP) which is also included in our Procedure Manual. ɐ Our Environment Policy has objectives, initiatives, measures and is reviewed on a yearly basis. The outcome of the review is a new action plan for the following year. ɐ The “Core Values Commitment Questionnaire has been conducted on a quarterly basis for several years now. The results are measured against their target and compared to the previous year. Preventive measures are taken for falling short of the target. ɐ While we give equal opportunity to candidates, we use the standard procedure for recruitment to ensure that we hire the most competent employee irrespective to gender, religion, or race. Our equality for hiring is seen in the fact that our male to female ratio is at 58 % and our hiring is posted on our website, social media and local newspapers. ɐ Neighborhood Questionnaires are made on a yearly basis to make sure that none of our staff have violated their parking spaces, privacy or have committed any other misconduct. ɐ Ergonomics Survey is conducted every two years to look into the needs and complaints of our staff. Recommendations are made and sent to the management for approval. It was noticed that the results of the survey that was conducted in 2017 was at 82.2 % compared to the result of 2015 which was at 76.1%, the result of 2019 is to be included in the next COP. ɐ Employee Satisfaction Survey is conducted on an annual basis covering issues such as: general working conditions, pay and promotion potential, use of skill & abilities. Actions are taken by our management to insure a high level of employee satisfaction. ɐ Reviewing CSR’s KPI’s at the end of each year brings about the new changes that need to be done in our next CSR action plan. ɐ The Social and Cultural Committee end of year evaluation by the staff through independent survey. ɐ See Appendix for our: 9 Environment Policy-Action Plan 9 Strategy Map 9 Core Values Page | 5 COP July, 2019 9 Commitment to Core Values Questionnaire sample. 9 Employee Satisfaction Survey 9 CSR Manual 9 Social and cultural committee survey 9 Ergonomic Survey form Labor Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our Manual Procedure covers not only the duties and responsibilities of each job at the company, but provides the employees’ labor rights as well. We have a dedicated resource that monitors and mandates labor laws. Our Strategic Objective of “Enhance Knowledge Management” under the learning and growth perspective engages the employees while providing them with a platform for freedom of association and collective bargaining. This goes hand in hand with the Social and Cultural Committee discussed earlier. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labor principles to our stakeholders and to maintain our compliance with labor laws and other official holidays. Implementation: ɐ Our Procedure Manual, as well as, the New Employee Handbook provide the knowledge of labor rightsamong other informationregarding the employee. ɐ Medical Insurance Coverage ɐ Social Security. ɐ Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. ɐ Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis to inform employees regarding new labor laws or health issues. One such presentation was “Ergonomics” presentation, another one was conducted in 6/2019 about safety at office. ɐ Continuous Human Resources and the Finance departments’ training and upto date knowledge on the local labor laws. They are the dedicated resource for labor rights. ɐ Based on our management’s belief of the importance of work-life balance, the working hours have been reduced one hour a day in 2011. The number of weekly working hours at SAJDI became 41.25 h versus 48h by labor law. ɐ SAJDI is committed to the official holidays announced by the government due to religious, national and other occasions. Page | 6 COP July, 2019 ɐ The Social and Cultural Committee provides a platform for employees to voice their opinions and thoughts. There are many activities made by SCC during the year. For an example, arranging outdoor lunches, celebrating national and religious occasions, arranging for the yearly picnic and many other activities. SCC members are elected each year by SAJDI employees. ɐ Our Incentive Program Fast Track is disclosed to our employees and is reviewed periodically. The Fast track program and career path were reviewed by SAJDI management, departments and relevant units. ɐ Our Information Management System is an open domain to our employees. It includes the official manuals on labor laws and the updated social security benefits. ɐ Tuesday Talk: A weekly meeting where an employee picks a random topic to talk about for 3 minutes in front of the attendees, giving the speaker the opportunity to train and experience public speaking. ɐ Celebrating our 45 years of dedication and relentless to our client has spread the spirt of excellence among our employees, the celebration took place at Amman Rotana towers in November, 2018. Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are currently in our third 5-year strategy cycle. Following is what is relevant to the Labor Principles issue: ɐ Quarterly review meetings are held to review the Balance Scorecard Strategy measures of outcomes or KPI’s. ɐ Age: we do not discriminate against age. (see figure below). ɐ Ethnicity percentages, we hire local individuals in our global branches.

Environment Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: We have an Environment Policy since 2006 which is also part of our Quality Management system. we have identified “Operational Excellence” as our customer value prospection in our Strategy. Increase Utilization of Staff and Resources, and Enhance Project Quality Plan implementation are two strategic objectives, among others, that enable us to achieve Operational Excellence. Our goal is to decrease our recyclable waste and to shift to renewable energy whenever possible. Implementation: ɐ We do and require our business partners to do an Environment Impact Assessment as part of our procedures within each Project Quality Plan to insure that the projects are in alignment with our Environment policy. ɐ The energy saving installations from Solar panels LED’s light bulbs have decreased consumption of energy. ɐ The “Go Green” initiative by the Corporate Image Management Unit in 2014 has led to: Paper recycling in association with Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute. Provided awareness prompts on energy saving and recycling, Planted trees by SAJDI employees wherever they were in the world in 2017 and 2018. SAJDI has supported an environmental initiative related to waste recycling and reduction of plastic usage to preserve the environment by a group of 12-yearold students in 2018. They aimed at spreading awareness and to deliver their message to the decision-makers. ɐ The Creativity and Development Committee has embarked on installing solar panels at SAJDI’s HQ in Jordan as a renewable energy while substituting diesel consumption and CO2 emissions. ɐ We develop an Environment Policy Action Plan on a yearly basis. Page | 8 COP July, 2019 ɐ SAJDI is a member at the JES (Jordan Environment Society) and always contribute to its activities related to the Environment. Measurement of Outcomes: ɐ Yearly external audits by the ISO insuring the implementation of our Environment Policy action plan. ɐ Yearly review of the Environment Policy results or KPI’s by upper management. ɐ Yearly reporting by Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute re our recycled paper. Outcomes of our achievement in recycling paper for the year is shared with our employees by giving the CO2 emissions and mature trees saved. ɐ See Appendix for our: 9 Environment Policy Action KPI’s for the last 3 years. 9 Sample of the Recycled Poster. 9 Figures regarding the Solar Panels. Anti-Corruption principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our core values in a statement is: “We are committed to our clients-through excellenceto provide our services with Integrity and Respect.” Integrity is where we state that we do our services without favoritism. Implementation: ɐ We ensure that our engineering services are provided to clients following our Quality Management System (QMS) which, in turn, is regularly audited by internal auditors. This system insures that every employee is doing his/her duties according to the QMS standards without bias or favoritism. This system ensures verification and validation by staff in independent departments to prove that all decisions are correctly taken. ɐ One of our initiatives within the Corporate Social Responsibility action plan-under the Clients & Business Partners beneficiary is to “Emphasize SAJDI’s Governance, Credibility and Transparency.” ɐ We have participated in the CGNJ activities and events of 2016-2017. One such event was entitled, “Our Renaissance in Our Partnership”: a session about the 10th principle of the UNGC (Anti-corruption) and how it relates in the MENA region Page | 9   &23  -XO\   0HDVXUHPHQWRI2XWFRPHV  7KH PHDVXUHV RI WKH LQLWLDWLYH ³(PSKDVL]H 6$-',¶V *RYHUQDQFH &UHGLELOLW\ DQG 7UDQVSDUHQF\´DUH  ɐ 0HDVXULQJWKHQXPEHURIQRQFRPSOLDQFHWR6$-', V4XDOLW\0DQDJHPHQW6\VWHP 406 GXULQJWKHLQWHUQDODXGLWV ɐ 0HDVXULQJWKHHPSOR\HHV¶FRPPLWPHQWWRFRUHYDOXHVZLWKDWDUJHWRI ɐ ,PSOHPHQWDWLRQ RI 6$-',¶V *RYHUQDQFH &RPSOLDQFH 3URFHGXUHV ZLWK D WDUJHW RI  ɐ 'LVFORVXUH RI 6$-',¶V &23 RU 6XVWDLQDEOH 5HSRUW RQ WKH 81 *OREDO &RPSDFW :HEVLWH ɐ 6HH$SSHQGL[IRURXU 9 &65$FWLRQ3ODQIRU 9 &RUH9DOXHV  1RWH6$-',KDV-RLQHGWKH*OREDO&RPSDFW/RFDO1HWZRUNLQ-RUGDQLQDQG UHQHZHGWKHPHPEHUVKLSLQDQGLQ  3DJH_  ENVIRONMENT POLICY ACTION PLAN ENVIRONMENT POLICY To conduct all business activities in an acceptable manner free from recognized hazards while respecting the environment.
