The word tradition can only be used when a company has advanced and become recognized by society. To pass down good traditions, it is necessary to have an enterprise spirit in which all employees think positively and take actions. It is also important to effort on a daily basis and to study with each other. Furthermore, Trust can only be created by contacting faithfully with customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the local communities in which we operate. A passage from our company song that conveys these meanings can be called a Spirit of establishing the company and I feel it represents Rubycon's corporate culture that has been handed down from generation to generation. We have been providing products under the spirit over 67 years since the foundation in 1952. Also in the future, we will continue to hold the spirit as our origin, so as to provide reliable and satisfactory products with our experience on technology and quality, and to contribute to creation of affluent society. Aiming at contribution to better and sustainable society Social environments in our country are radically changing such as the falling birthrate and the aging population, information-oriented society and globalization. In this era of rapid environmental change, we value our ties with local communities, and will work diligently and steadily to move forward with local communities, so that each of Rubycon group companies can be proud of in each region. We are also promoting CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities by setting compliance, environmental initiatives, reform of working style, rasing employees' awareness of occupational health & safety, participation in communities, support for the development of the next generation, human rights and labor practices as priority areas. We will continue to create new value necessary for society, to develop products that make people happier, and to contribute to a sustainable society, so that customers and local communities always talk to us. We appreciate your continued great support and cooperation to Rubycon Group Companies.

Thousands of flowers on the ground brilliant Big Dipper in the sky swear to Home Town Ina faith and trust, Oh! Rubycon advance together hand in hand 3 Overview of Rubycon Group Companies Japan Production Bases Overseas Production Bases Japan Sales Bases Overseas Sales Offices 4 CSR policy and System Consumer Safety and Protection Rubycon products contribution to society << Rubycon products contribute to society through lectronics technologies >> Today, various devices around us are computerized, and electronic devices are indispensable to the world.Capacitors are also indispensable in the electronics field, and Rubycon contributes to society through electronics technology by proposing and supplying capacitors, which are its main products, to various electronic devices. << Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Electrolytic Capacitor >> Conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors have a wider temperature range, are more compact, have lower ESR, and higher resistance to ripple current than other aluminum electrolytic capacitors. These features enable high-efficiency power supply design and can contribute to the reduced number of parts. The net result of this capacitor technology is energy savings improved efficiency. 5 << Example of parts reduction with conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitor >> << Thin film Polymer Mult-Layer Capacitors, PMLCAP >> PMLCAP, developed with our proprietary technology, achieves extremely ideal characteristics and contributes to the high performance of electronic devices. PMLCAP is a surface-mounted film capacitor that achieves a significant reduction in size compared to conventional film capacitors by adopting a revolutionary technology in which electrodes and dielectrics are formed by vacuum evaporation. Compared with high dielectric constant multilayer ceramic capacitors, which have excellent frequency characteristics and temperature characteristics, they have superior bias characteristics , beat sound characteristics , harmonic distortion ratio , etc. Its characteristics were found among developers and adopted for Mars exploration / seismograph. Currently (2018/11 ~), we are contributing to seismic exploration on Mars. 6 << Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors for Automotive Use >> With C (Connectivity) A (Autonomous) S (Shared & Service) E (Electric), the number of electronic parts installed in vehicles is increasing year by year. The electronic parts cost ratio of vehicles was about 3% in the 1980s, but increased to about 40% in 2015. At Rubycon, in addition to conductive polymer aluminum solid electrolytic capacitors, we are promoting development of products for automotive aluminum electrolytic capacitors. 7 << Electric Double Layer Capacitor >> Electric double layer capacitors use electric double layer produced on the boundary between the electrode and electrolyte (as dielectric) for storing electric charges. This capacitor realizes quick charge-discharge cycles as well as long life since there aren't chemical reactions to store charges. This capacitor is ideal for applications requiring momentary large current such as power assist and energy regeneration. If the capacitor is used as the main power for rechargeable equipment, maintenance is reduced. 8 Fair Business Practices We are compliant regarding relevant statutes, internal regulations, social norms and ethics, and excluding relations with antisocial forces, so as to promote business activities through fair and good competition and to secure safe and ease of customers in consideration of views and positions of ordinary citizens. Compliance We are observing all statutes relating to business (labor, environment, public welfare, trade, industry, commerce, national tax and civil affairs), and as well as conducting fair business and transactions. On the basis of our internal regulations, we are developing such activities to our group companies through mutual improvement. We have published Rubycon Group Code of Conduct conforming to EICC (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition), and are providing it to all employees and group companies. If any compliance violation is found, we will seek accurate facts to determine the cause followed by strict action to prevent recurrence. Internal Audit We have a designated audit department under the president's direct supervision to audit fair and proper performance of internal activities in accordance with relevant statutes, operation policy and internal regulations. The department will further provide advice to improve and correct our business as well as the risks for compliance in organizational activities. This audit covers all organizations in each company group. Risk Management In addition to Risk Management Activities conducted since 2012, we are strengthening internal systems and reviewing relevant internal regulation since inquiries from customers on code of conduct and ethical risk management are increasing. We will also assess effectiveness of disaster contingency plan as well as reviewing BCP (Business Continuity Plan) for disaster and unexpected contingency. Protection of Intellectual Properties (Measures against Counterfeit Products) We are promoting the appropriate intellectual property formation such as acquisition of patent rights and trademark right to contribute to sound development of business activities. We are also working to protect our customers' interests by enhancing brand value through activities of eradication of counterfeit products. Furthermore, we strive to respect and not to interfere intellectual property of other companies, as well as to protect our own intellectual property. Protection and Control of Information Misuse of information important to corporate management will have significant impact on relations of trust with partners and their management. We have established security policy and privacy policy recognizing importance of information assets. We give the first priority in risk management and BCP to the policies. We are protecting and controlling information assets through education of employees and various security measures and activities. Protection of Personal Information Recognizing that the protection of personal information in today's advanced information society is an urgent issue, our company has developed a management system to comply with Japanese Personal Information Protection Act. In the meantime, the European General Information Protection Regulation (GDPR), that has come into effect in May 2018, imposes strict requirements for the transfer the personal information located in Europe outside the region. In response to the requirements of the GDPR, we have implemented various measures. At the same time we have used this opportunity to conduct a general review of our management system with the aim of further enhancement. 9 Organization Governance CSR Policy Rubycon's CSR System to accomplish corporate social responsibility is shown at the right.
