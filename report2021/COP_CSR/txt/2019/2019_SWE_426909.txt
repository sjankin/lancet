Lighter vehicle weight also means higher payload capacity and improved fuel economy. The SSAB EcoUpgraded concept highlights the equipment, and construction machinery.

SSAB has set an objective Structural redesign can also reduce production related to customers upgrading to high-strength costs, e.g., through less welding and improved steels; SSAB is aiming at 10 million tonnes in usability. Lower vehicle weight leads to increased annual customer CO2 savings by 2020. The payload capacity and lower fuel consumption savings will be reached by two initiatives: 8.0 and emissions. For example, the weight of trailer million tonnes savings from SSAB EcoUpgraded bodies made with SSAB’s high-strength steels deliveries and 2.0 million tonnes savings from can be reduced by up to 30% compared to using 10 Automotive Premium Upgrade deliveries. traditional steel grades.

This reduces the CO2 emissions from including highsteel production. “Moving applications,” such as vehicles, excavators and cranes made of strength steels high-strength steels, have less weight, which in turn cuts fuel consumption or increases their payload. Stronger steel also means extended product lifetime, thereby also reducing CO2 emissions. Customer Customer satisfaction is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company satisfaction meet or exceed customer expectations. In a competitive marketplace, customer satisfaction is a key differentiator and a key element of business strategy.

Control activities, both manual and automated, take place both at general and more detailed levels within the group. Routines and activities have been designed to manage and rectify significant risks associated with financial reporting as identified in the risk analysis. Corrective measures, implementation, documentation and quality assurance take place at a Group, subsidiary or process level, depending on the nature and affiliation of the control activity.

The controls are adapted to each unit’s work processes and systems structure, and communication Internal these are evaluated through self-assessment supplemented with monitoring and review by internal control process audit. This way of working has been implemented in a system covering the entire Group which is used when verifying the reliability of financial reporting.

This is how major fluctuations and deviations are followed up to minimize the risk of errors in financial reporting. Work on closing the accounts and on the annual report involves processes in which additional risks of error in financial reporting arise. This work is less repetitive by nature and contains several elements of an assessment nature. Important control activities include ensuring the existence of a well-functioning reporting structure where the divisions report in accordance with standardized reporting templates and where important income statement and balance sheet items are specified and commented on.

There is also great diversity in the company’s suppliers. However, this is not the case with SSAB’s most important raw materials, namely coal and iron ore, where the number of potential suppliers is limited. Coking coal is purchased from a number of major suppliers around the world, such as Australia, US and Canada. When purchasing coking coal, annual supply contracts with monthly pricing are usually signed. Iron ore is currently purchased from LKAB in Sweden and from Severstal in Russia. However, since the price of iron ore is set on the world market, it is in principle the same regardless of supplier. SSAB has signed longterm supply agreements with both LKAB and Severstal, where prices vary depending on the market index, in order to ensure physical supplies, while proximity to iron ore reduces the risk of long-term delivery problems.

Risks relating to personal injury, damage to which disruptions in one part of the chain can rapidly have serious property and the environment (insurable risks), work on preventing injury and damage from occurring at all, and work on consequences on other parts.

In the work of procuring group-wide insurances, the divisions and subsidaries’ explosions and other types of accidents, may be costly. Risk Managers assist the insurance function of the group. The group has a common guide, “Property Loss Control Guideline”, which is a support in the daily ongoing risk management work in the business. The Risk management work is conducted in accordance with a risk management policy which emphasizes the following: • proactive work to prevent injury and damage (initiate, coordinate and manage) • risk and cost optimization (insurance management). In order to minimize costs, if this kind of risk still occurs, there are both continuity plans as well as property damage insurance and business disruption insurance in place. The risk of disruptions in one part of the process having an impact on other parts of the process is minimized by maintaining stocks of crucial raw materials, products in progress and finished products as well as analyzing our vendors and incoming flows and looking at alternative process flows. Within the divisions and subsidiaries’ Risk Management, ongoing risk analyzes are carried out together with SSAB’s production managers and risk surveys of the company’s facilities and processes together with risk engineers from our insurance brokers and risk engineers from insurance companies in cooperation with the insurance function of the group. This is done in order to identify and manage the emerging risks and to serve as a basis for our insurers. The results of the surveys and risk analyzes are presented continuously for the production managers and measures to improve processes and our protection are monitored carefully. SSAB also subscribes to other group-wide insurance programs such as, for example, liability insurance and transport insurance and the divisions and subsidiaries’ Risk Management function also works to prevent damage in these areas, which is also a prerequisite for signing insurance.

SEGMENT REPORTING Operating segments The group is organized in five reportable operating segments with clear profit responsibility. The operating segments are the three steel divisions; SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe, SSAB Americas and the subsidiaries Tibnor and Ruukki Construction. Tibnor and Ruukki Construction are operated as independent subsidiaries by their respective Boards. In addition, there are other operating segments which are not reportable since they do not reach the threshold values in IFRS 8 and they are not monitored separately by the Group Executive Committee. The segment reporting takes place in such a manner that it corresponds to the internal reporting which is submitted to the Group Executive Committee. The Group Executive Committee is the highest executive decision-making body which is responsible for the allocation of resources and assessment of the results of operating segments, and takes strategic decisions. A more detailed description of the reportable segments and their operations is provided on page 128 and in Note 28. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Significant non-current assets (or divestments groups) are classified as Non-current assets held for sale when their reported value will primarily be recovered through a sales transaction and a sale is deemed to be very likely. They are reported at reported value or fair value less selling expenses, whichever is lower, if their book value is primarily recovered through a sales transaction and not through permanent use.

On level 2, observable market data regarding assets and liabilities, other than listed prices, is used, e.g. interest rates and return curves. On Long-term interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of loans that are not subject to hedge accounting and are level 3, the fair value is determined based on an assessment technique which is based on assumptions that are valued at amortized cost.
