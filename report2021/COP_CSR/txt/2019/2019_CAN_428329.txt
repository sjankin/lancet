GSOPP promotes the development of oil palm plantations amongst our catchment communities, using the smallholder concept, in partnership with the Traditional Authorities, affected farmers, and the agro-forestry industry. In 2018 Golden Star won the Ghana Mining Industry Award for Corporate Social Investment for GSOPP. Not only is this the second year in a row that we have won this coveted award, but it is one of many awards that GSOPP has now received. Through GSOPP, we continue to advance the businesses objectives of reducing poverty through employment generation, and promoting wealth creation through sustainable agri-business. As at the end of 2018, GSOPP involved 317 small-holder farmers and 434 contract workers over 1,133 Ha of plantation. Socioeconomic studies conducted in 2018 showed the powerful impact that GSOPP has had: • Farmers who were formerly on the poverty line, now enjoy significant farm revenues; • Consistent application of best farm management practices ensures yields are more than 3 times the small-holder average for Ghana; • A third of the farm workforce are female and youth (<45 yrs) – demonstrating diversity and inter-generational equity; • 80% of participant’s dependents are now in school. $6.6M in sustainable agribusiness to date 10 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 11 HEALTH AND SAFETY We recognize that our mining operations present a range of health and safety risks for our We regularly engage with team members to obtain input and feedback into the development workforce and host communities.

Our approach is guide leaders regarding their accountability for the safety of their teams. guided by the belief that all work-related injuries are unacceptable, and everyone should go home safely every day. Training is key to our approach to promoting a robust health and safety culture across our business. All employees are required to take general induction training when commencing Safety is a key part of our business culture. In 2018, we established a Safety Vision, Strategy, employment.

See our case study on malaria prevention for more information Simultaneously, we commenced a program to develop business wide safety standards. In on our performance in this important health concern. excess of 150 standards champions have been identified from amongst our workforce and these teams have determined the standards required to keep them safe. This is based on the We report our health and safety performance annually and set associated goals and targets recognition that nobody is better qualified to understand the risks in their work than the people to drive continual improvement. Key health and safety metrics for our operations are provided doing the work. in the highlight section of this report. The metrics cover both employees and contractors and are consolidated for the operations. The rates are calculated per million hours worked. Our safety, health and risk management systems are based on international standards and are integrated with our performance and contractor management processes. Our teams of In 2019, our primary targets will be zero fatalities, the ongoing implementation of our safety specialist health and safety personnel guide systems development to ensure they drive leadership program, and continual improvement in our safety performance. required behaviours and are implemented as per best practice, often exceeding regulatory requirements. In 2018, we employed 37 specialist health and safety personnel at our operations who are complemented by contract resources to support our programs in medical services and occupational medicine, as well as occupational hygiene and safety culture. During the year we commenced a comprehensive program to upgrade many of our key safety systems and have now implemented new proactive performance metrics to promote enhanced accountability and transparency on our performance. We have also enhanced our pre-task hazard assessment and near miss reporting tools and processes. Within the business we are promoting the belief that near misses are a ‘gift’ that warn us of a hazard that we are yet to control. These processes of upgrade followed routine system reviews and evaluation. To identify work-related hazards, we conduct formal risk assessments, Job Hazard Analyses (JHAs), and pre-task hazard assessment (i.e. Take 5). All team members are empowered to identify, control and report hazards and incidents, through written or verbal reporting methods, including anonymous systems. We conduct quality incident investigations to identify root causes and corrective actions to avoid recurrence. If workers identify an unsafe working condition, they are required to make it safe or not undertake the activity. This is based on our cultural belief that “if it’s not safe, make it safe”. 12 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 13 PARTNERSHIPS Community health is one of the greatest development needs within our host communities. As a result, SDG 3: Good Health and Wellbeing is one of Ghana’s key development focus areas at the local and national levels. We recognize the important role we can play as a catalyst for enhanced health outcomes in local communities. To do so, we engage in regular partnerships with a variety of development organizations for targeted community health programming. Whilst Ghana has gradually reduced its neonatal mortality rate, as at 2016 it still remained more than two times higher than the SDG 3 target. Therefore, in 2018 we brought the Project C.U.R.E. Helping Babies Breathe neonatal resuscitation training program to our Bogoso/Prestea host communities, following its incredible success at Wassa. Under the program, 72 medical personnel were trained and equipped with enhanced skills to save newborn lives. For ongoing sustainability, six were trained as Master Trainers and by year end, they had trained a further 50 health professionals. The program impact was immediate with the Municipal Director of Health Services reporting a 25% reduction in neonatal mortality in less than 6 months post-program implementation. MALARIA Malaria is the single greatest cause of disease burden in Ghana and it disproportionately affects children and pregnant women. In our host communities, malaria represents around 60% of clinic attendance cases. In Golden Star, we implement a malaria prevention program that incorporates spraying of residential areas, provision of PPE and repellents and access to 24-hour testing and treatment at our mine site clinics. In 2018, with the support of program partners, we shared over 5,000 long-lasting insecticide treated mosquito nets with our families and host communities. As a result of our ongoing efforts, we were recognized as a Malaria Safe Organization by Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Our programs are paying off – in 2018 our malaria case rates were less than 5.5% of clinic attendance, translating to 0.35 malaria cases per capita, for less than 768 days lost to malaria illness. 14 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 15 COMMUNITY RELATIONS COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Maintaining the support of local communities is essential for our ongoing business success. We recognize that our operations are the primary economic drivers in our host communities. Therefore, we view community relations as a key strategic priority for our company. We generate a substantial number of jobs, business opportunities, and spin-off economic benefits. We also recognize that our operations have a finite life and that sustainable economic Our Policy on Community Relations outlines our approach to community relations and development requires diversification. stakeholder engagement including our commitment to building and maintaining strong relationships with local communities, including through active partnerships. We have a corporate Policy on Community Development and Support. The policy outlines our objective to develop long-term alternative economic development and capacity-building The policy states that we will make community relations an integral part our performance and projects to enable enduring social and economic benefits for host communities. contractor management systems. These systems include processes and procedures for fulfilling our consultation and engagement requirements. As part of the systems, we conduct All of our operations have community development programs that are based on the needs of stakeholder mapping to inform our stakeholder engagement processes. host communities. Community development needs are identified through a variety of means, including: ESIAs are conducted at all operations as part of project permitting. The ESIAs cover a variety of environmental and social issues, including potential impacts on vulnerable groups, including • Strategic needs assessments conducted as part of ongoing engagement; women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. • Alignment with needs identified in local, regional, and national development strategies; • Local, regional, and national priorities under the SDGs. We conduct extensive community engagement as part of all ESIAs to ensure a participatory process. All ESIAs contain extensive monitoring provisions for identified potential impacts. The Golden Star Development Foundation (GSDF) is one of the primary vehicles we use to Summary results of ESIAs are made publicly-available through public hearings and as part of invest in community development projects.

The CMCCs are comprised of local leaders who meet regularly with the company to establish dialogue and provide feedback to the company. We aim to have long-term sponsors for all projects to ensure ongoing sustainability beyond our involvement, which promotes local ownership and capacity-building. In addition, we Formal grievance mechanisms are in place at our operations to ensure grievances are dealt conduct post-implementation reviews of GSDF projects as part of our continual improvement with promptly, systematically, and strategically. cycle. We invest in a variety of economic diversification projects. By doing so, we can lessen the economic reliance of our local communities on our operation, whilst enabling sustainable, long-term economic opportunities. For example, we invest $1 per ounce of gold into the Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation (GSOPP), which is a multi-award-winning social enterprise project that integrates closure planning, economic development, and capacity-building. GSOPP is based on the smallholder farming concept to generate oil palm for biofuels. To date, we have invested $6.6M into the program. In 2018, GSOPP employed more than 700 farmers, which is more direct employees than both of our mines. For more information on the program, including its importance in our closure programs, see the ‘Mine Closure’ section of the report. As per our Policy on Community Development and Support, we regularly review and audit our community development activities relative to our policies and standards. In addition, we regularly review community projects we fund to help ensure they align with this policy and broader objectives for sustainable development. 16 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 17 PARTNERSHIPS FOR COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT Up until 2015, the local community of Prestea faced a longstanding problem of a large, uncontrolled garbage disposal site in the middle of the community. The site was a public health hazard and was a poor use of valuable land. To help solve this problem, we partnered with Traditional Leaders, LOCOMS, and Maintenance Sustainability Africa (MSA), the community’s first volunteer based organization, to rehabilitate the site. We were able to leverage our expertise in rehabilitation and reclamation to restore the site to a viable land use, which the community decided to use for a multi-purpose recreational facility. The facility is equipped with multi-purpose outdoor courts, a training centre, and changing facilities. Eventually, the site will also include a restaurant, kiosks and children’s play area. In In 2018, we partnered with another community development organization, Giants of Africa, an organization founded by the President of the Toronto Raptors basketball Team, Masai Ujiri. The organization is committed to providing opportunities for African youth through sport. We hosted the Giants of Africa basketball camp at the Prestea recreational facility, as part of the official inauguration of the facility. The camp ran from 12 October to 14 October, and was attended by 54 of Ghana’s most accomplished youth basketball players (aged 18 and under). In addition to basketball coaching and training, they received mentorship in life skills, such as leadership and selfdiscipline. To see more about Giants of Africa and the history of the recreational park, visit our website. 18 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 19 PARTNERSHIPS FOR VIBRANT LOCAL COMMUNITIES We recognize that the presence of our operations creates a wide range of local business opportunities, including direct and spin-off economic activity. By working in close partnership with local businesses, entrepreneurs, and industry associations we aim to maximize their ability to seize these opportunities and in doing so, increase local value retention and generate enduring social and economic benefits for our stakeholders. In turn, this helps create vibrant local economies and communities. In 2018, we continued to support an innovative local procurement initiative based on partnerships and capacity-building. In addition to our ongoing support of Local Companies in Mining Services (LOCOMS), we undertook a program to bring other small and micro enterprises (SMEs) together into relevant trade associations. Through our provision of enhanced business-related machinery in late 2017, these groups have broadened their service range and output for enhanced incomes. These enhancements are important preparatory steps towards establishing business cooperatives that together may be positioned to win further mine contracts. Another example of our targeted programming for local procurement is the Golden Star Learning and Earning Program (GSLEP). Trainees are trained in a variety of skills and simultaneously earn income through work on projects supported by Golden Star and our Development Foundation. The 2018 GSLEP pilot group constructed a second story classroom block for the Prestea Secondary School attracting great interest in the host community. These youth trainees are being supported towards the development of a business collaboration, with the view of deepening youth entrepreneurism in the locale. LOCOMS itself is going from strength to strength. Since its inception in 2015, LOCOMS has earnt over $27M in contracts from our operations and during the year not only were invited to bid on other contracts in the West African mining sector, demonstrating the growing capacity of the business, but were also recognised with an award in the category of Mining Supplies and Services at the Ghana Mining Industry Awards for Best Performer in Local Content. We are proud of the economic contributions we make to the Ghanaian economy. In 2018, we spent $207M on procurement with Ghanaian firms and businesses including some $27M in procurement to businesses based in our host communities. 20 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 21 HUMAN RIGHTS EMPLOYEES Our business activities have the potential to impact – both positively and negatively – on a We recognize that our success is dependent on the hard work and dedication of our people wide range of human rights of our stakeholders.

Gender diversity is a particular focus given that mining has historically been a male-dominated industry. We have a policy that outlines our approach to diversity on our Board of Directors and within our executive leadership. In 2018, 30% of our executive management team is female. To advance our business objectives with regards to diversity, in 2018 we started collating data on gender representation, parity, and systems. The program will help us better understand our diversity performance and identify supporting initiatives for inclusion, parity, and resilience. In 2019, we will consider the adoption of a Diversity Policy for the broader business. 22 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 23 LEADERSHIP Following the tragic incidents in our business in 2017, we commenced a major program of safety improvement in partnership with our workforce. To lead our culture change efforts, senior leadership developed for the first time a company-wide Safety Vision, Safety Strategy, and four-year Safety Plan. Focussing on culture change through enhanced systems, behaviours, and leadership, the Strategy sets a road map built on our values. To synchronise our leadership team, more than 300 leaders, representing 87%, at all levels in our business undertook safety orientated leadership training and competency assessments in 2018. To support these efforts, our workforce subject matter experts have been engaged as champions to define the standards needed to prevent major incidents. In excess of 187 champions in specialisations such as ground control, cranes, heavy equipment operations, work at height, and drilling and electrical have been mobilised so far. Within the business, management have set new proactive safety metrics and targets and are poised in 2019 to embed these approaches further through the development of department-specific safety plans. 24 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 25 WATER AND EFFLUENTS TAILINGS Water management is a key business driver for our company.

Just as the land could sustain our mining operations, we must rehabilitate so it can be used for a viable land use after mining. We take a holistic approach to mine closure by integrating environmental, social, and multiple land use objectives into planning and implementation. This helps ensure the sustainable development well beyond the life of our operations. We have a corporate mine closure and reclamation standard which outlines a framework for our operations to rehabilitate and close mine sites. As part of the standard, all operations develop mine closure plans. Closure plans are developed as part of our EIS’ for major projects. The objective is to establish post-mining landscapes that can sustain the next uses identified in consultation with landowners. We have been globally-recognized for our innovative approach to mine closure. The Golden Star Oil Palm Plantation (GSOPP) is a multi-award winning social enterprise initiative based on the smallholder farming concept. To date, we have established 1,133 hectares of sustainable plantations in place of former, low-yield subsistence farms. We have invested over $6.6 million to the project since 2006. GSOPP now employs over 700 farmers and farm workers, which represents more direct employees than either of our mines. In 2018, the project continued to evolve with the incorporation of a contribution-based micro-credit scheme. In addition, we began a farm succession planning program to improve the project’s sustainability. In support of our objectives for post-mining livelihoods we have over the last three seasons piloted an innovative aquaculture program in former mine pits. The pits, which have been engineered to integrate into the local hydrology, have yielded 5.2 tonnes of tilapia, sold to the workforce and our catering contractor for meals. In 2018 we began preparations to extend the pilot to a larger former mine pit and in parallel commence the development of a fish farming business plan. These two projects were highlighted as a key factor in winning the prestigious Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) Environment and Social Responsibility Award in 2018. 28 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 29 PARTNERSHIPS FOR INNOVATION IN MINE CLOSURE We are implementing a Ghanaian first in innovation by progressively converting our former tailings storage facilities (TSF) to productive and commercial scale oil palm plantation. In partnership with GSOPP, by mid-2018 we had planted over 3,000 oil palm seedlings in two former TSFs. Whilst it is common to reuse mined land for low level agriculture, commercial scale production and yield is uncommon. Over the last decade we have completed trials to ensure the success of this valuable next land use. We have also conducted an innovative program of pit lake engineering and aquaculture trials in former mine pits that are now a functioning part of the ecosystem. In a model approach, commercial scale fish cages have been used for three seasons of fish rearing and harvest, with a view to future commercial production. To complement these activities we have nurseries to grow native endemic trees. Since 2010 we have propagated over 178,000 indigenous plant seedlings, many of special conservation value, for planting in former mined areas. This was supported by replacement of topsoil and broadcasting of over 18,000 kg of plant seeds. 80% of participant's dependents are now in school $3.7M in development foundation projects to date $6.6M in sustainable agribusiness to date 30 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 GOLDEN STAR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT | 2018 31 ARTISANAL AND SMALL-SCALE MINING GOVERNANCE Artisanal and small-scale mining is a widespread phenomenon in the Western Region of We are committed to the highest levels of corporate governance.
