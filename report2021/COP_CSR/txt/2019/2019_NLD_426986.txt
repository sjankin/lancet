Energy: from green to self-sufficiency Using energy more efficiently and opting for renewable energy sources is essential for combating climate change and for lowering our overall environmental footprint. Since 2017 Stahl purchases renewable electricity for all its European manufacturing sites (34% of global energy consumption). Solar panels were installed in 2018 at Stahl’s manufacturing site in Portão, Brazil with a capacity of 840 kW. This investment into solar power represents a significant drop in CO2 emissions for the site in 2019, and will supply approximately 50% of the electricity consumed at that facility. During 2019 the company will monitor the success of this project and make plans to introduce solar energy at its other manufacturing sites. Energy sources Stahl 2.4% 2.8% Renewable briquettes 9.3% 10.5% Renewable electricity purchased Renewable electricity self-generated 16.3% 23.4% Gas Furnace Oil Grey electricity 35% 0.07% High Speed Diesel Steam Waste: circular economy Disposal of waste is considered a last resort for Stahl and it has begun to regard waste as a by-product, with potential value for other uses. The company is currently installing water treatment facilities at those remaining manufacturing sites that do not have them, effectively reducing the amount of wastewater (classified as hazardous waste) sent to third parties for treatment. Stahl globally tracks and reports on the many different types of waste that it generates (e.g. slow moving stock waste from our laboratories, packaging, cleaning water, glass, paper, plastic) and aims to reduce, reuse, recycle, restore and prolong where possible. Several initiatives designed to eliminate the use of single-use plastics have begun at Stahl locations around the world, and this will continue until all possibilities have been explored and acted upon. 23 Water Stahl consumed less water in 2018 due to more efficient consumption at its manufacturing sites. 2018 2017 2016 2015 Water consumption (m³) 344,922 370,855 355,041 325,864 Other water use (m³)* 456,820 561,788 506,056 491,021 Total Water Used (m³) 801,742 932,643 861,097 811,093 Total production volume 228,440 238,590 207,923 195,646 Water intensity** 1.510 1.554 1.708 1.666 These KPIs have been audited and verified by Ernst & Young. * Other Water use = Water in Palazzolo, in particular ground well water, is used for the processes but also as cooling water (for this reason we have high volumes of withdrawn water).
