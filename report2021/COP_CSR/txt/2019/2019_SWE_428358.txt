Strategy SEK has a key role in strengthening Sweden’s export industry and contributing to increased growth and employment in Sweden. Small and medium-sized enterprises are expected to be the prime drivers of future growth and employment in Sweden. Therefore, SEK’s growth ambitions have focused on reaching more clients in the medium-sized company segment. At the same time, SEK will broaden its business with existing clients. New technology and digitalization make it possible for SEK to offer greater advantage to more companies, and to do so with increased profitability. New clients will be processed regionally, through partnerships and through a raised presence in our local networks. One method of reaching more clients is to increase awareness of SEK. SEK will primarily utilize targeted marketing initiatives to this end. SEK’s business development will be achieved partly through new offerings that are based on identified client needs, and partly by modernizing and automating SEK’s internal processes. For SEK, close dialogues with clients are key to understanding their needs and challenges. Partnerships have been deepened and today, business Core values development is conducted together with the clients. SEK’s core values are a prerequisite for succeeding with the strategy. A sustainable workplace starts with healthy values. How employees of SEK behave and interact with one another and clients has an impact on the corporate culture. Together, SEK’s employees have prepared a set of core values that guide us in our various professional roles. This is based on employees in their occupational roles endeavoring to be solution-oriented and professional, as well as working to achieve results. 12 SEK Annual Report 2018 Partners and collaboration A large part of SEK’s transactions derive from collaboration with banks throughout the world. Collaboration with Swedish and international banks, development banks, Almi, Business Sweden and the EKN continues to be important. Swedish environmental expertise and Swedish exports have much to contribute to sustainable urban development in many parts of the world. Therefore, SEK has chosen to focus on UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities. To develop new business opportunities in sustainable urban development, SEK will focus on collaboration with a selection of international and Swedish EPC companies (Engineering, Procurement & Construction), international banks and exporters that are active in this area.

Comments on Target attainment SEK gained 17 new clients in 2018. The target level for 2019 has been significantly increased in accordance with the strategy of attracting new clients by new offerings and structured client processing. As of 2018, SEK has a new employee survey, making it impossible to follow up on the targets established for 2018. To focus on the ambition of reaching out with SEK’s offerings to more clients, the target for green loans and lending for sustainable urban development has been changed from a volume-based target to a target for the number of new loans, where green loans are connected with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The financial targets are established by the owner and are to be viewed over a longer horizon. 14 SEK Annual Report 2018 Follow-up of the public policy assignment SEK’s administration of the official supported export credit system (CIRR system) is a specially commissioned public policy assignment by the Swedish parliament. The benefit to the national economy of this mission should be evaluated partly by measurement of the added value that SEK creates in terms of export credits (of which CIRRs comprise a part) and partly through the stakeholder dialogue. The stakeholder dialogue is presented in Sustainability Note 2. SEK follows up the public policy assignment using a biennial client survey. Below is parts of the results from the most recent survey that was conducted in 2018. 1. “Have SEK’s export credits helped execute clients’ export transactions?” 73 percent of clients who had engaged SEK’s services for export credits stated that SEK’s credits had contributed significantly or very significantly to the execution of their export transactions. This can be compared with 63 percent in the preceding survey. 2. “The reason why the exporters decided to collaborate with SEK” The responses are shown as open replies, in which the clients say, for example, that SEK has excellent understanding of business and that they want to partake of SEK’s competence. Other reasons stated are access to CIRR and that SEK is a bargaining tool for sales. 3. “Did the collaboration match the client’s expectations?” 66 percent of clients stated that the collaboration exceeded their expectations. 28 percent responded that the collaboration significantly exceeded their expectations. The corresponding figures for the 2016 client survey were 73 and 18 percent, respectively. 4. “How SEK can further improve its offering of export credits” Approximately two thirds of the clients considered SEK as proactive, but that it had improvement potential in this respect and scope to increase its proactivity. 5.“How the clients perceived the Swedish export credit system compared with corresponding systems in key competing countries” 73 percent of the client companies consider the Swedish export credit system to be better than the systems in key competitor countries. The corresponding figure for 2016 was 87 percent.

The conclusion was that these are included in a portfolio where the business model entails measurement at fair value and, accordingly, they are recognized at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Those liquidity investments that were previously classified at fair value pursuant to the fair-value option are also classified at FVTPL due to the portfolio’s business model. Certain fixed-rate liquidity investments were already subject to hedge accounting and, from January 1, 2018, these hedge accounting relationships have been terminated since liquidity investments are now measured at FVTPL. 2 Accumulated expected credit losses for off-balance sheet items are reported under provisions in the Statement of Financial Position. 64 SEK Annual Report 2018 continued, Note 1 The following table illustrates the effect of IFRS on reserves and retained (d) Basis of consolidation earnings: The Consolidated Financial Statements encompass the Parent Company Reserves and all subsidiaries, meaning companies over which the Parent Comand retained pany has control and that are impacted by the Company’s results.

These assets, liquidity investments, are from 2018 classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). 2 In conjunction with the transition to IFRS 9 the category Loans and receivables changed name to Financial assets at amortized cost. 3 Difference between Parent Company and Consolidated Group for 2018 is due to different accounting principles regarding changes in SEK’s own credit risk, see Note 1. 4 In conjunction with the transition to IFRS 9 the category Held-for-trading changed name to Financial assets at amortized cost. SEK’s general business model is to hold financial instruments measured at fair value to maturity. The net fair value changes that occur, mainly relate to changes in credit spreads on SEK’s own debt, which due to IFRS 9, are reported in other comprehensive income from 2018 compared to net results of financial transactions prior to IFRS 9, and basis spreads, which are recognized in net results of financial transactions. The changes could be significant in a single reporting period, but will not affect earnings over time since the lifetime cumulative changes in the instrument’s market value will be zero if it is held to maturity and is a performing instrument. When financial instruments are not held to maturity, realized gains and losses can occur, for example when SEK repurchases its own debt, or if lending is repaid early and the related hedging instruments are terminated prematurely. These are effects presented under “Derecognition of financial instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss”, “Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” and “Financial instruments under fair-value hedge accounting”. “Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” and “Financial instruments under fair-value hedge accounting” include realized as well as unrealized changes in fair value.

The correlation is expressed as a value between 1 and –1, where 0 indicates no relationship, 1 indicates maximum positive relationship and -1 indicates maximum negative relationship. The maximum correlation in the range of unobservable inputs can thus be from 1 to –1.

The minimum requirements, which were implemented in Sweden without a transitional period, are 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent for Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total own funds, respectively. The minimum requirements apply in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (CRR). 2 The reduction in Total capital ratio in 2018 is mainly due to the fact that SEK has exercised its right to call the Tier 2 eligible subordinated debt instrument. See footnote in the table “Own funds Adjusting items” below. 3 Expressed as a percentage of the total Risk exposure amount. 4 The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio as reported less its minimum requirement of 4.5 percent plus an additional 3.5 percent. The latter component consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital used to meet the minimum requirement for total own funds of 8.0 percent, since SEK does not have any Additional Tier 1 other than Common Equity Tier 1 capital and nor any Tier 2 capital. 102 SEK Annual Report 2018 Note 26, continued Own funds — adjusting items Parent Company Skr mn December 31, 2018 December 31, 20175 Share capital1 3,990 3,990 Retained earnings 11,239 12,782 Accumulated other comprehensive income and other reserves2 1,256 30 Independently reviewed profit net of any foreseeable charge or dividend 1,615 540 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital before regulatory adjustments 18,100 17,342 Additional value adjustments due to prudent valuation -496 -396 Intangible assets -43 -66 Fair-value reserves related to gains or losses on cash-flow hedges -6 -25 Gains or losses on liabilities valued at fair value resulting from changes in own credit ­standing 112 446 Negative amounts resulting from the calculation of expected loss amounts -136 -65 Total regulatory adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 capital -569 -106 Total Common Equity Tier 1 capital 17,531 17,236 Additional Tier 1 capital Total Tier 1 capital 17,531 17,236 Tier 2-eligible subordinated debt3 2,049 Credit risk adjustments4 Total Tier 2 capital 2,049 Total Own funds 17,531 19,285 Total Own funds according to Basel I floor n.a. 19,350 1 For a detailed description of the instruments constituting share capital, see Note 23. 2 The equity-portions of untaxed reserves is included in the line “Accumulated other comprehensive income and other reserves”. 3 In June 2018, SEK received permission from its competent authority (Swedish FSA) to call its Tier 2 eligible subordinated debt instrument in accordance with its terms. As a result of the permission from Swedish FSA, SEK was required to reduce the level of own funds by the outstanding principal amount of the instrument. The Board of Directors of SEK in September 2018 decided that SEK would exercise its right to call the instrument ( see Note 22) and the instrument was redeemed on November 14, 2018. 4 The expected loss amount calculated under the IRB approach is a gross deduction from own funds. The gross deduction is decreased by impairment related to exposures for which expected loss is calculated. Excess amounts of such impairment will increase own funds. This increase is limited to 0.6 percent of SEK’s risk exposure amount under the IRB approach related to exposures to central governments, corporates and financial institutions. As of December 31, 2018, the limitation rule had no effect, as in 2017. 5 Comparative figures are shown at the level of the Consolidated Group, since a consolidated level of the capital situation was in effect in 2017.

Financial risks may occur in the form of transition risk on SEK’s assets. Transition risk is defined as non-physical climate-related risks that can impact the value of assets and the borrower’s possibility to generate cash flows. Risks include climate-related legislative and regulatory changes, raised climate-related taxes, changed production and consumption patterns, and new technology as well as climate-related reputational risks. SEK could potentially be exposed to credit losses if climate-related transition risks are not managed by the debtor. The indirect negative climate impact of SEK’s lending is the total gross lending on fossil-based assets. The ongoing risk reporting to the Board includes a scenario analysis that estimates SEK’s transition risk exposure and the impact of expected credit losses for various scenarios. The outcome of the scenario analysis shows limited impact of climate-related risks for SEK’s financial risks. For more information about the scenarios used in the analysis, see SEK’s 2018 Pillar III report.
