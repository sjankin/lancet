Since 2016, Hyundai E&C has constructed Management targets, Hyundai E&C established a greenhouse gas reduction target to reduce Scope 1, 2, 3 (including domestic and operated integrated environment & energy systems by applying the ISO 14001: 2015 standard in order to and overseas) greenhouse gas emissions by 52.5% by 2050 compared to 2015 thereby preemptively responding Integrated Environmental improve the environmental energy management system to meet the more improved international standards. In Reduce 52.5% of GHG Emissions to climate change. This target was established including the greenhouse gas emissions generated by supplier Performance Management System 2018, Hyundai E&C upgraded IT systems, including waste generation management systems and greenhouse by 2050 equipment in addition to the greenhouse gas scope (scope 1, 2) generated by Hyundai E&C. Through the gas emission management systems so the wider ranges of environmental impacts than before can be identified foregoing, Hyundai E&C will realize value chain greenhouse gas reduction to fulfil its social responsibility. 52.5 H-PMS and managed.

From 2015, Hyundai Through the IT-based integrated environmental performance management system 'H-PMS(Hyundai-Project E&C diversified and expanded its greenhouse gas reduction activities so that all employees actively participate in Management System)' established in 2013, Hyundai E&C has been efficiently tracing and managing environmental GHG reduction activities. In particular, in 2017, Hyundai E&C applied a patent for deep-running, big-data based performance such as energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste generation, water consumption, Site GHG Emission Estimation & Warning System to minimize the amount of GHG emissions by estimating and emission allowance (BOD , COD, SS, fugitive dust, etc.) in all business places. Hyundai E&C also maximizes monitoring accurate GHG emissions. In addition, Hyundai E&C is realizing efficient GHG reduction by linking its the efficiency of environmental management by integrating and managing diverse systems such as ISO 14001 GHG reduction performance to performance evaluation such as headquarters' and responsible executives' KPIs. (Environmental Management System), ISO 50001 (Energy Management System) management, greenhouse gas management and waste management by interlocking them with each other. It is possible to confirm the Target Activity environmental performance directly on the H-PMS for all work sites under construction, thereby improving work efficiency on site. Hyundai E&C will continue to upgrade its integrated environmental and management system to Target: Reduce 52.5% of GHG Emissions by 2050 Reducing Energy Consumption and practice more efficient eco-friendly management.
