In 1895, as well as SUSTAINABILIT Y creating a revolutionary method of crystal production, he established farsighted principles of fairness to communities and the environment that still guide our REPORT 2019 business today. We understand that Swarovski’s ongoing success depends on our continued respect for Daniel’s principles. They help us consider our responsibilities in terms FROM THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE SWAROVSKI CRYSTAL BUSINESS of generations, not just quarters, and they provide a platform towards our goal of sustainable leadership. But achieving that goal requires us to be restless. While we honor our heritage, we recognize that our world is constantly changing. Climate change, water crises, gender inequality, economic disparity, forced labor, and the overconsumption of natural resources require the private sector to step up. In our 2017 Sustainability Report, we outlined our refreshed sustainability strategy. This year, we detail some of the many activities our business has engaged in that align with the five priorities of that strategy. 4 5 During the last two years, we have innovated across our own supply chain and collaborated with others to change the fashion, jewelry and design industries for good. We are proud of our Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certifications, our Positive Production program and the expanded scope of our Responsible Sourcing Initiative. Our commitment to Conscious Design keeps growing, with Swarovski integrating sustainability into the curricula of nine prestigious design schools. We are doing more to develop positive water stewardship, including our pilot with the Asia Disaster Preparedness Center that is developing flood resilience in Thailand. We continue to use our influence on the global stage, hosting events at both the World Swarovski Executive Board Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and the United Nations (UN) General Assembly. Photography Philip Sinden We accept we have a role to play in tackling many of the sustainability challenges and thus we restate our commitment to the UN Global Compact, continuing to support the delivery of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. Our forward-looking approach means we intend to keep increasing the positive contribution we make to our business, supply chain and society as a whole. We are committed to finding ways to improve supply chain transparency and to developing a consistent approach to responsible sourcing with Swarovski Crystal Business.
