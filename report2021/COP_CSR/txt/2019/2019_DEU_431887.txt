There is hardly another term that has developed as strongly as designed end-of-life solutions/services for our products the word ‘sustainability’ in recent years. But what is ‘sustaina(recycling, composting, fermentation etc.). bility’? One of the most common definitions is still the one used in the (Brundtland) report ‘Our Common Future’ published by PAPSTAR not only shows its responsibility for humans and the World Commission for Environment and Development of the nature by using renewable raw materials for its products, but United Nations in 1987.

The PAPSTAR brand responsibility to consider the many therefore stands for excellent quality different aspects of food hygiene and standards. Sustainable product range design The main focus of the PAPSTAR products and product ranges is on a sustainable approach. The growing demand for sustainable consumption patterns and connected lifestyles by consumers requires the provision of product alternatives and motivates the company to continue its strategy of expanding its range of sustainable products. Innovative thinking and approaches with respect to the input materials for products, the design and packaging are essential aspects here. PAPSTAR is consistently pushing the design of the product range toward these kinds of innovations and is also endeavouring to promote sustainable product alternatives that stand out, thanks to the use of regenerative raw materials, the fact that they can be composted and their mono-material composition. These kinds of innovative products are currently available under the sub-brand PAPSTAR pure PAPSTAR only uses sustainable disposable products of and are made, amongst other the brand ‘pure’ in the company canteen. The used things, of sugar cane, palm crockery is processed together with food and organic leaves, bamboo, PLA waste from the offices in our own composting machine.

PAPSTAR Sustainability Report 2019 | Products _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 11 Promotion of efficient alternative products PAPSTAR has a sustainable approach – it is so sustainable that it is even willing to do without a range of non-sustainable products or materials. This does not restrict the options open to customers, instead it is about offering them efficient alternatives. The company believes that positive impacts on the environment and resource savings can only be significant, if it is possible to achieve a high level of market penetration of sustainable product range innovations rather than simply providing product alternatives. Interaction This is why PAPSTAR consistently focuses on promoting the use of sustainable products in its range, for instance by means of ■■ … certification of product lines focusing on sustainability. Alternatives ■■ … targeted interaction with customers and end consumers. ■■ … active, open and transparent communication. ■■ … provision of in-depth information material. Innovation ■■ … staff training. ■■ … comprehensive information for employees via the Intranet. ■■ … targeted PR work (trade media, online magazine etc.). Innovation, alternatives, interaction – PAPSTAR sees important potential in all three determinants of the product range design for further promotion of the relevance of sustainable products and their use. Also, the formation of the company PAPSTAR Solutions GmbH pushes the development of alternative disposal solutions for sustainable closing of material cycles. 12 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Products | PAPSTAR Sustainability Report 2019 “Come on, let’s make compost!” KLEVE!

Guideline in 2018 which was published in the BE A PAPSTAR Intranet and came into effect in 2019. As corruption is very hard to identify on a day-to-day basis at work, steps were taken to draft an Anti-Corruption Guideline in 2018. The internally appointed ‘Head of Compliance’ offers professional and legal advice, and is also the contact person for the compliance officers for any questions or in case of dubious events. In addition to the guideline, the employees will undergo training (rules of behaviour for corruption-free work) to raise awareness for this issue in the future. Reviews and checks are also part of day-to-day business.

PAPSTAR has implemented the environment management system DIN EN ISO 14001 and is regularly certified according to internationally recognised norms. This shows that the company is clearly committed to continually improving its environmental activities. Currently, the consumption of power and water is being continuously reduced by the use of modern LED equipment in lights and efficient water treatment systems; the percentage of regenerative energy in a power mix (eco-electricity) is continuously increasing. This is accompanied by an effective waste management concept and the permanent minimisation of the fuel consumption, the reduction of CO2 emissions also in the vehicle pool and training the drivers by means of experienced eco(nomic) coaches.
