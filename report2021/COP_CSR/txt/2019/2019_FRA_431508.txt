Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to the note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements which sets out the effects of the first application of the standards IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and IFRS 9 “Financial instruments”. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Revenue and margin recognition on long-term contracts (Note 2.1.1 IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers, Note 2.5.6 Sales and costs generated by operating activities and Notes 3, 18 and 32) Identified risks As at 31 March 2019, the Group’s revenue and earnings before interests and taxes (EBIT) (respectively 8 072 M€ and 408 M€) mainly derive from construction contracts and long-term service agreements (“the long-term contracts”). IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” is applicable by Alstom starting April 1, 2018. Alstom has elected, for the transition, to apply the full retrospective method. Alstom has identified and measured the accounting impacts of IFRS 15 by performing analyses of the contractual and general conditions applicable to its construction contracts as well as long-term service agreements and has updated its accounting principles and policies accordingly. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 — ALSTOM 105 3 Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements These differences and the impacts of the restatement on the equity and the balance sheet as of April 1, 2017 and as of March 31, 2018 are presented in the Note 2.2.1 “IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers”. As described in Note 2.5.6 to the Group consolidated financial statements, revenue on long-term contracts is recognized according to IFRS 15 based on the cost to cost percentage of completion method in order to recognize the revenue from contracts for which revenue recognition is qualified as overtime. At each closing date, estimates and assumptions by management are required in order to assess: yy the revenue at completion, including contract variations (variation orders, claims and contract amendments); yy the revenue of the period recognized in accordance with the cost to cost method; yy the margin at completion on each contract, incorporating appropriate contingencies to cover identified risks (technical, commercial, etc.) related to the project execution; We consider the revenue and margin recognition on long-term contracts to be a Key Audit Matter, because of the degree of required management’s estimates and judgements and the complexity of internal processes to be implemented in order to recognize the revenue and margin relating to these contracts, in particular in the context of the first application of IFRS 15. Our response As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s internal processes and controls for management and monitoring of long-term contracts, identified the main controls set up by Alstom that are relevant to our audit, particularly those related to IFRS 15 implementation, and then tested their operational effectiveness by sampling; We have assessed the compliance of the new revenue recognition accounting principles and methods with IFRS 15 and examined the quantified impacts relating to the adoption of this standard on equity, balance-sheet and order backlog as at April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018 as described in Note 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 to the financial statements. We also performed a critical review of the systems and controls implemented by the Group relating to the measurement of the revenue and costs at completion and of the stage of completion. We took into account the high level of integration of the various IT systems involved in revenue recognition by including IT specialists in our audit team and testing the design, implementation and effectiveness of automated system controls affecting revenue recognition. For a sample of contracts, selected based on their risk profile including their technical or commercial complexity and/or their financial impact, we also: yy examined the terms and conditions of the contracts, including contract amendments and variations; yy obtained an understanding of the performance and stage of completion of the contract through discussion with the project and Group management; yy appreciated for these contracts the analyses of the Group which enabled to conclude on the transfer of progressive control or at completion and, if necessary, the identification of the various performance obligations, variation orders and contract amendments; yy corroborated the main assumptions of revenue and costs at completion with costs incurred to date, yy examined externally available evidence, such as customer correspondence, physical progress or the performance of services provided for in the contract, and for the most significant turnkey contracts performed physical inspection of construction site; yy used our experience gained in previous years on these contracts or on similar contracts; and yy assessed the consistency of the accounting information reflected in the financial statements with the project information obtained. We verified that Notes 2, 3, 18 and 32 to Group consolidated financial statements contain the appropriate information. Assessment of disputes and investigations (Note 22 Provisions and Note 33 Disputes) Identified risks As described in Note 22 and Note 33 to Group consolidated financial statements, Alstom’s operations lead to the risk of litigation and contractual claims from third parties, moreover, the note 33 to the financial statements describes the on-going investigations and procedures performed by judicial authorities with respect to alleged illegal payments in certain countries. Alstom assesses the corresponding risk based on assumptions and estimates, to determine whether a provision is recorded or a risk disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. This assessment involves a high level of judgment by Alstom management. Due to the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements, the degree of management’s judgment and the uncertainty around the resolution of those procedures, we consider the assessment of disputes and investigations to be a Key Audit Matter. Our response We performed a critical review of the provisions recorded and disclosures provided by in particular: yy examining the procedures implemented by management to identify, assess and account for disputes and investigations; yy inquiring with the in-house legal counsels and analyzing underlying documentation of procedures ongoing; yy obtaining external legal positions if considered as relevant; yy examining legal expenses accounts for any indication of legal matters not yet considered; yy reading minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Directors and of the shareholders’ meetings of Alstom’s key entities; 106 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements 3 yy assessing management’s judgment through understanding of precedent outcomes in similar cases and external legal positions; yy assessing whether any events subsequent to the reporting date for the year ended March 31, 2019 have been taken into account to estimate provisions and in the information provided in the financial statements; yy verifying that Note 33 to Group consolidated financial statements contains the appropriate disclosures on the status of disputes and related uncertainties. Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the Management Report We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) is presented in the Group’s management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars, were appointed as statutory auditors of Alstom SA by the Annual General Meeting held on 23 June 2009. As at 31 March 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the 10th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: yy identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; yy obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; yy evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 — ALSTOM 107 3 Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements yy assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; yy evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; yy obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit Committee We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Annual General Meeting of shareholders of Alstom SA Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Alstom SA (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2019. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. Basis for Opinion Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 April 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. Valuation of the investment in Alstom Holdings (Note 2.1 Investments and Note 8 Financial assets) Identified risks As at 31 March 2019, the net value of the investment in Alstom Holdings amounts to 9 216 m€ and represents 99% of Alstom’s total assets. Alstom Holdings owns directly or indirectly all the entities of the Alstom group. As described in Note 2.1 to the financial statements, investments are recorded at their acquisition cost. The recoverable value of the investments is assessed based on a multi-criteria approach. Alstom records an impairment if the recoverable value of the investments is lower than their carrying value. Determining the recoverable value is based on (i) Discounted Cash Flows, and (ii) values in relation with current or contemplated transactions or any other fair market values, if available. This impairment test relies on significant management estimates, such as the group’s business plans and terminal growth rate. Accordingly, we consider the measurement of the recoverable value of the investment in Alstom Holdings to be a key audit matter, due to the amount of the investment recorded in the balance-sheet and the inherent uncertainty of certain inputs, in particular the likelihood of achieving forecast results included in such measurement. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 — ALSTOM 123 3 Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the financial statements Our response We performed a critical review of the methodology applied by management to perform the impairment test by: yy understanding process and controls implemented by Alstom SA; yy assessing the consistency of the assumptions used for the impairment test (projected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates) with the historical and current performance, the existing backlog of contracts and the economic environment in which Alstom SA operates; yy assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine values in relation with current or considered transactions or any other fair market values, if any; yy reviewing sensitivity analyses to key assumptions. Specific verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents provided to Shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. We attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce). Report on Corporate Governance We attest that the Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-3 and L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. With respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 225-37-5 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), we have verified their compliance with the source documents communicated to us. Based on our work, we have no observation to make on this information. Other information In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars, were appointed as statutory auditors of Alstom SA by the Annual General Meeting held on 23 June 2009. As at 31 March 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the 10th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 124 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the financial statements 3 Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: yy identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; yy obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; yy evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; yy assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; yy evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Alstom regularly reviews the risks it faces within the framework of risk management set forth in section 4 “Risk control environment”, allowing to rank them by decreasing order of importance within each risk category. The current document follows the 24 October 2018 guidelines from the AMF regarding the implementation of ruling (EU) 2017/1129 of 14 June 2017 setting forth the description of risk factors in the universal registration document. The risks described below are the ones considered significant for the company, i.e. those which could have the greatest negative material impact on activities or results (or the Group’s capacity to reach its objectives), and/or a significant probability of occurrence. Because of its diverse activities, footprint, and development, the Alstom Group is subject to different risk categories. The Group carries out its operations within fast-moving environments which could trigger exogeneous risks to have an impact on the risk profiles monitored by Alstom. Alstom’s assessment of this order of importance can change at any given point in time, in particular should new internal or external facts occur. The risk factors are assessed by Alstom at the date of this document. The following risks are common between Chapter 4 and Chapter 6: Recruitment and retention, Compliance and Accidents. OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS CONTRACTS EXECUTION Risk identified Monitoring and management of the risk Alstom’s business activities lead the Group to engage in very large complex long-term To anticipate and capture risks on projects, project contracts.

These negative developments could, for example, result in protectionist legislation which creates barriers to trade or result in mandatory embargos or trade sanctions restricting economic exchanges with certain countries or entities. Legal principles such as force majeure or change in laws regarding contracts could allow some mitigation of the impact of these developments but their use could create a litigation risk due to differing interpretations of these legal principles. As a result, these geopolitical events could have an adverse impact on the business activities, financial position, earnings or future outlook of Alstom.

This requires, Officers. on the one hand, significant expenditures and investments of which the future profitability cannot be guaranteed and, on the other hand, a strategy of innovation increasingly developed through partnerships. In addition, Alstom is increasingly using or combining complex technologies that evolve very quickly, or components developed by third parties that integrate such technologies. This evolution requires the implementation of a design and approval process that is more robust in order to shorten the development phase, monitor technological evolution, and comply with product safety requirements. This could trigger additional costs that are more significant than initially anticipated, or cause delays in delivery. 132 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Risk factors, Internal Control and risk management Operational and strategic risks 4 Risk identified Monitoring and management of the risk Concerning certification of the Group products, changes in the certification regulation Alstom Preferred Standards List (APSL) is updated requirements may have an impact on the product conception, organization and financial on a monthly basis and an alert is circulated to performance of the projects.

In meet to share operational experiences and update the past, Alstom has faced difficulties associated with complex homologation procedures, their knowledge of the various regulations. particularly in Germany. In addition, contracts increasingly include language that requires Alstom to bear the risks and obligations associated with the homologation process. The materialization of these risks could trigger cost overruns and the payment of significant penalties or damages, service interruptions affecting the products, or even the risk of cancellation of the contract in extreme cases of prolonged delays. However, the situation varies by country and technology. No guarantee can be given regarding the time frame required for obtaining homologations, and any significant problem in this domain could have an adverse impact on the business activities, financial position, earnings, or future outlook of Alstom.

REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 — ALSTOM 137 4 Risk factors, Internal Control and risk management Operational and strategic risks MARKET RISKS Competition Risk identified Monitoring and management of the risk Alstom faces intense competition, both from large historical international competitors and regional The competition risk is managed via a players as well as new ones from emerging countries (particularly in Asia), where they benefit proactive product policy and optimized from more competitive cost structures. The consolidation initiatives on certain transport market processes and footprint. segments that have already occurred, such as the German company Siemens’ acquisition of the British company Invensys’s signalling business or Hitachi’s acquisition of the railway businesses of the Italian company Finmeccanica, or the merger of the Chinese companies CSR and CNR (renamed CRRC), is increasing this competition. This may put pressure on prices and profit margins, and also on payment terms and conditions, the manufacturing time frame, the technologies proposed, and the services provided to the client, which could weaken Alstom’s position in certain of its markets and, as a result, have an adverse impact on its business activities, financial position, results or future outlook. In addition, particularly in an unfavourable economic environment, competition could further intensify. Increasing competition from Chinese leaders in European markets represent in particular a threat to European actors such as Alstom and could have an impact on Alstom's business activities, financial position, results or future outlook. Furthermore, although Alstom has developed and continues to develop its presence on many geographic markets, including via alliances and partnerships, access to certain markets can prove to be difficult, particularly if there is a local competitor benefiting from a stronghold in its home market. These types of situations could put Alstom in an unfavorable position relative to some of its competitors and slow down its expansion strategy in certain zones. In addition, the initiatives taken by the Group may prove to be insufficient in case of a long-lasting downturn of the world economy, drop in demand and increasing and continued competitive pressures. Any unfavorable development of any of the aforementioned factors may have an adverse impact on Alstom’s markets and as a consequence an adverse effect on its business activities, financial position, results or future outlook. 138 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Risk factors, Internal Control and risk management Operational and strategic risks 4 Tendering Risk identified Monitoring and management of the risk A significant proportion of Alstom' business takes the form of longterm projects with customers, The tender review process includes a list which are initiated via competitive processes, and for the most part, with public entities.

The indemnity amounted to 24 months of the average gross annual compensation, fixed and variable, excluding performance shares, received TARGET COMPENSATION during the three fiscal years preceding the date of the end of the corporate officer’s term of office. 28% 28% To take into account the comments received by the Company in its engagement with investors during fiscal year 2018/19, the Company policy now provides that this indemnity represents 18 months of the average compensation, fixed and variable, excluding performance shares, paid during the three financial years preceding the date of the end of the 44% corporate officer’s term of office. 72% In the event of breach, at any time, of the non-compete covenant by the executive corporate officer: Fixed annual compensation yy the Company will be released from its obligation to pay the financial Compensation subject to performance conditions indemnity; and Variable annual compensation yy the executive corporate officer would have to reimburse all the sums Long-term incentives (ref. : IFRS2 value of March 2019 grant) already received in application of the non-compete covenant. Acting through its Board of Directors, the Company reserves the right, in particular in the event of gross misconduct or major financial issue, to unilaterally waive this non-compete covenant on the date when MAXIMUM COMPENSATION the executive corporate officer’s term of office ends, in which case the latter will be freed from any obligation and no indemnity will be due 40% in this respect. 23% In every instance, this non-compete covenant does not apply if the executive corporate officer retires at the end of his term of office. In this case, no indemnity would be due. The Board of Directors considers that, under certain conditions, the 37% possibility of requiring executive corporate officers to enter into a 77% non-compete covenant is beneficial to the Company. This is particularly the case with Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge, in view of his knowledge, acquired during more than 20 years, of the mobility sector and of the Fixed annual compensation new challenges resulting from its digitalisation. The Board of Directors Compensation subject to performance conditions considers that the Company’s competitors must not benefit from this Variable annual compensation expertise. Therefore, this commitment is intended to protect the Group’s Long-term incentives (ref. : IFRS2 value of March 2019 grant) interests. Severance indemnity The Company’s policy is not to pay any severance indemnity to the Post-mandate compensation conditions corporate officer.

At its meeting on 15 May 2018, the Board of Directors decided that the nature and the weight of the performance conditions retained would remain similar to those of the previous year.

However, Alstom being the only “pure player” of the rail industry (i.e. whose business relies solely on the rail industry), the Board considers it would be against the interests of the Group to publicly state the objectives and performance of the Company as to the gross margin on orders received, as this would give competitors strategic information. (2) With regard to the safety-related indicator, the evolution of the rate of accidents at work exceeded the numeric targets set by the Board (1.4 lost time injury per million of worked hours), but the Board, upon the proposal of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and the Executive Committee, considered that the fatal accidents that occurred in South Africa and Algeria in 2018 do not allow the Company’s objective regarding safety at work to be considered as having been exceeded. As a result, the rate of achievement of this variable compensation target is capped at 100% for all employees eligible to the annual bonus. (3) The Company’s target was that at least 90% of managers eligible for the annual bonus (more than 10,000 people) followed the training. The maximum level is said to have been reached from 95% of the eligible population. (4) The Company’s target is to remain in the DJSI index, i.e., to be one of the 15% of the companies in the comparable group that achieve the best performances. The Company reaches the maximum level of performance if it is in the 5% of companies in the comparable group that achieve the best performances, which was the case for the second consecutive year in 2018 (95th percentile). yy with respect to individual objectives related to specific action plans, based on five criteria, measurable whenever possible, the level of achievement should be evaluated at 35% for a target set at 40% and a ceiling at 50%, as detailed hereafter. 180 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Corporate governance Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance 5 ACHIEVEMENT LEVEL OF INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES Comments Target Criteria evaluation INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES 40% Preparing the The goal set by the Board of Directors was to secure the transaction with Siemens 12% 6% transaction with by 31 March 2019 at the latest, with a level of remedies reduced to a minimum Siemens Mobility whilst ensuring positive communication in both France and Germany. The Board of Directors considered that the goal could not be deemed as fully achieved given that the European Commission, in its Decision of 6 February 2019, forbade the transaction as built by the Boards of Directors of both groups. The Board nevertheless considered that all efforts made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Alstom teams had culminated in the best possible proposal from the Company’s point of view, that the additional remedies required by the European Commission would have produced a transaction devoid of any strategic advantage and that the considerable communication on this decision had not prejudiced the image of the Company in the markets, as proven by the evolution in its share price. As a result, the Board established that this goal should be deemed to be 50% achieved. Preparing the new The goal set by the Board of Directors was to construct the new corporate 6% 6% organisation organisation model, prepare the nominations of future management teams and prepare the cultural integration between the teams from the two original entities. The Board considered that the work on organising the new Company had resulted in a coherent, effective organisational model; this will serve as a basis for the current configuration of the Alstom model, failing the execution of the transaction. In addition, the individual assessments of candidates to the General Management positions had been carried out with the assistance of an outside service provider and had been used to refine the composition of the management teams, including under the current Alstom organisation. Lastly, the working groups centred around the creation of a new corporate culture had been sponsored, strongly encouraged and supported by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the results of their work contribute directly to the construction of the strategic positioning envisaged for the 2020-2025 period. As a result, the Board established that the goal should be deemed to be achieved. Strategy The goal set by the Board of Directors was to construct the new strategic vision 6% 6% and define synergies to be implemented under the transaction. The new strategic guidelines were defined by the Company’s teams, under the direct impetus and coordination of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. They will be presented to the market and the shareholders during the first quarter of the 2019/20 financial year. These guidelines are based on clearly-identified elements established as part of the work to prepare the strategy of the combined entity and include especially an optimisation section for the Company’s operating modes that was used when creating the new entity. They will serve as the basis for changes in the corporate cost structure in its traditional framework by 2025. The Board therefore considered that this work had been successful and that the goal should be deemed to be achieved. Sales performance The record number of orders taken in the 2018/19 financial year close to €12 billion 8% 10% persuaded the Board of Directors that the goal set had been exceeded significantly, thanks notably to securing two major projects in France, Greater Paris Metro and TGV du futur, or confirmation of the REM project in Montreal. The first orders for iLint, the hydrogen train manufactured in Germany, and for the Aptis electric bus were also registered during the 2018/19 financial year. The orders for the Service activity have also shown record growth, mainly thanks to the Riyad metro. The Signalling activity (Alstom Digital Mobility) showed as well genuine robustness with over €1.4 billion of orders taken. As a result, the Board considered that this goal had exceeded expectations and should be assessed at the maximum level possible, as previously established, at 125%. REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 — ALSTOM 181 5 Corporate governance Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance Comments Target Criteria evaluation Operational and The operational and financial performance goals set by the Board for the Chairman 8% 7% financial performance and Chief Executive Officer are based on nine operational performance indicators, the stabilisation of the Working Capital, the improvement of the gross margin and the share of fixed costs, along with a qualitative appraisal of progress in the most important projects in rolling stock (eLoco in India), systems (Riyad and Dubai metros) and signalling (Lille). The operational performance indicators have been high-performing overall despite a few limited deteriorations in terms of On Time Delivery of certain projects (PRASA delivery schedule in South Africa; approval of locomotives in India). The adjusted gross margin has nevertheless continued to improve, as have the structure costs and Working Capital. As a result, the Board considered that this goal had been partially achieved. 2018/19 OVERALL ANNUAL PERFORMANCE 35% Therefore, at its meeting on 6 May 2019, the Board decided that Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2018/19 would be set at €1,020,975, corresponding to an achievement of 136.1% of his objectives. Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s annual fixed and variable compensation has changed as follows over the past three years: Owed for fiscal Owed for fiscal Owed for fiscal year 2016/17 year 2017/18 year 2018/19 (in €) (in €) (in €) Gross annual fixed compensation 750,000 750,000 750,000 Gross annual variable compensation(*) 1,077,750, voluntarily limited to 900,000 1,072,500 1,020,975 (%/fixed) (120%) (143%) (136.1%) TOTAL 1,650,000 1,822,500 1,770,975 (*) The variable compensation of Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge is paid during the fiscal year following the one for which it was due and is submitted to shareholders’ prior approval.

Non-competition covenant between the Company and Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom Directors concerned: Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom. Nature and purpose: During its meeting of 6 May 2019, your Board of Directors authorized the signature of a firm and irrevocable non-competition covenant with Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, considering the duties entrusted to him. By the end of the Annual General Meeting for the approval of the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019, this covenant shall forbid the Chief Executive Officer, following the termination of his mandate (for any cause and at any time), from taking any interest, part, partnering in any way or committing, directly or through a legal entity, as corporate officer , employee, or consultant for any company, anywhere in the world, of which a significant share of their activity (15% of its turnover or at least €1 billion) relates to railway equipment or systems. Transportation operators themselves are excluded from the scope of this non-compete covenant. This non-compete covenant is limited to a two-year period, starting from the termination date of his mandate as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In exchange for this covenant, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shall receive a total gross indemnity equal to 1.5 times his average gross annual fixed and variable compensation, excluding performance shares, received over the three fiscal years prior to the termination date of his mandate, this indemnity being paid monthly, in twenty-four equal payments, over the non-competition covenant period. In the case of breach, at any time, of the non-competition covenant by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer: yy The Company shall be freed from its commitment to pay the financial consideration; and, yy The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer shall be obligated to repay the Company any sums already received in exchange of this non-compete covenant. 200 ALSTOM — REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2018/19 Corporate governance Statutory Auditors’ special report on related-party agreements and commitments 5 The Company, through its Board of directors, retains the right, in particular in the event of gross misconduct or major financial issue to unilaterally waive this covenant at the end of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s mandate, in which case he will be freed from any commitment and no indemnity shall be owed for this covenant. In any case, the present non-competition covenant shall not be applicable in the event the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer retires at the end of his mandate. In this event, no indemnity would be owed. Motivations justifying the interest of such commitments for the Company: The Board of Directors (M.

As a consequence, his expertise should not benefit any competitor of the company. This transaction is, as a result, designed to protect the interests of the Company. Continuation of the commitments between the Company and the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer relating to the defined contribution pension plans under “Article 82” and “Article 83” of the French general tax code Director concerned: Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom. Nature and purpose: During its meeting of 8 November 2016, your Board of Directors authorized the terms and commitments made to Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom and motivated the interest of such commitments for the Company, in accordance with Articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code. These commitments have also been approved during the General Meetings of 4 July 2017. In the context of the renewal of the mandate of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom of Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge in accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial code, your Board of Directors of 6 May 2019 approved once again these commitments. Supplemental retirement schemes (“Article 82”) At its meeting of 8 November 2016, the Board of Directors authorized, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, the closure and freezing, as from 31 December 2016 of rights cumulated under a defined benefit pension plan (“Article 39”) as well as the implementation of a supplementary defined contribution pension plan (“Article 82”) in accordance with articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the French Code of Commerce. All the former beneficiaries of the defined benefit pension plan ie the Executive Committee members with a French employment contract and whose annual base remuneration is eight times above the Annual Social Security Ceiling, are the beneficiaries of this new pension plan. As a consequence, the Board of Directors decided: yy to close, starting 31 December 2016 of the defined benefit pension plan (Article 39) attributable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the freeze of the cumulative rights, on the same date, representing an annual pension of €176,000 (constant euros) subject to the presence condition at the time the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer asserts his pension rights. No new rights shall be acquired in relation to this plan; yy to implement, starting 1 January 2017, an annual contribution dedicated to retirement paid to a third-party organization (Article 82). The calculation of this gross annual contribution is based on the total annual remuneration (fixed and variable remuneration in cash) of Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge according to the following methods: 10% of his gross fixed remuneration between eight and twelve Annual Social Security Ceilings and 20% of his fixed remuneration in excess of twelve Annual Social Security Ceilings, 20% of his annual variable remuneration as determined by the Board of Directors, The reference remuneration (fixed and variable in cash) for calculating the contribution cannot, in any case, be greater than €2 million, No contribution will be paid if the calculation of the variable compensation is zero. In accordance with article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial code, the benefit of this measures is subject to performance conditions. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer undertook, once the tax and social obligations relating to these contributions are satisfied, to keep the amount paid on the dedicated retirement savings vehicle at least for the duration of his mandate. Supplemental retirement schemes (Article 83) In addition, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also benefits from an Article 83 collective supplemental pension plan of which beneficiaries are corporate officers of Alstom SA and Alstom Executive Management SAS. The contributions that finance this plan amount to sums which correspond to 1% of Tranche A, 1% of Tranche B, 4% of Tranche C and 11% of Tranche D of the base remuneration of Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge and are borne up to 95% by the company. For fiscal year 2018/2019, Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge benefited from contributions up to €25,555 borne up to 95% by the company, i.e. €24,277. Motivations justifying the interest of such renewed commitments for the Company: The Board of Directors (Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge not taking part in the vote and in the discussions), at its meeting of 6 May 2019, confirmed the interest to maintain these commitments. As an executive corporate officer of the group and as all the other executives of Alstom SA and Alstom Executive Management SAS, Mr. Henri Poupart-Lafarge is the beneficiary of a collective supplemental pension plan (“Article 83”), which allows them to benefit from a minimum social protection. Furthermore, the interest of the defined contribution pension scheme (“Article 82”) is that it is significantly less costly for the Company than a defined benefit pension plan.
