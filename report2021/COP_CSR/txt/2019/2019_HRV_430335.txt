Following global trends, this Report has also focused on the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goals outlining those, which have been integrated with special attention in all our business activities. The Report deals with all three pillars of sustainable development economic, environmental and social dimensions. It provides an overview of activities undertaken in 2018, which further uphold that social responsibility has become a daily practice in all segments of our business. Despite the fact that 2018 was an exceedingly challenging year, KONČAR Group companies have generated total revenue of HRK 2,956 million. Net profit stands at HRK 128,7 million, which is 19% increase year-on-year. The Group has had HRK 3,026 million in new contracts, which is 18% increase in comparison with 2017. All key indicators point to continued stability in Group operations. Good business results are a direct result of the Group’s proprietary R&D projects in product and production development, which rely greatly on human resources. Our employees are conduits of KONČAR Group development and we are committed to continuous education and professional training, boosting the quality of work and encouraging out-of-work activities. Successful cooperation with scientific and educational institutions has continued. KONČAR has supported faculties and schools in infrastructure modernization; we have awarded student excellence at undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate level, and we have worked closely to facilitate identification, definition and implementation of a number of projects in which all parties participate as equal partners in order to further strengthen collaboration with the business sector. At the end of 2018, we launched a new project with the University of Zagreb and the University of Mostar. In order to explore mutual interest, a tripartite Cooperation Agreement was signed, allowing the Group’s employees holding PhD degrees to participate in teaching courses at the University of Mostar to transfer their knowledge and experience. The aim of the Agreement is to strengthen cooperation between the academic community and business, recognizing science, technology and innovation as drivers of the country’s economic development. Active participation of business in the work of the academic community will create conditions for quality education aligned with labour market needs. The Agreement touches on the “Knowledge Management” project initiated in 2015 in cooperation with the University of Zagreb, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Zagreb and the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing of the University of Zagreb. This project is a part of KONČAR’s Digital transformation programme, which permeates all aspects of our business.

The business enKEY IMPACTS, vironment risk is affected by political, economic and social conditions existing in operating markets. RISKS, AND The Group monitors all the risks and takes measures to mitigate their potential impact on the financial OPPORTUNITIES stability. 102-15 All Group companies regularly monitor and manage their balance sheets, liquidity and capital adequacies, set measures focused on illiquidity cause, prevention or elimination, take measures focusing on companies’ sufficient long-term sources of funding in view of scope and type of their business activity, and regularly monitor capital adequacy level. At Group level, long-term sources of funding (capital, long-term provisions and long-term liabilities) exceed non-current assets and average inventory balance, which indicates a sound funding maturity structure. In relation to short-term liabilities, current assets are 2.5 times higher, which indicates sound liquidity of the system. The structure of consolidated balance sheet indicates financial soundness of the Group. The companies within the Group manage risks that might affect the Group’s operations by monitoring business processes and internal reports on the risks to identify and analyse the exposure by degree and magnitude of risks. Market risk Market risk emerges as a result of potential losses stemming from less-than-favourable economic conditions and decline in market demand. The Group operates domestically and internationally. The Group’s core activity is energy and transportation-related equipment and products. The production programme heavily depends on such investments. Due to the impacts of global recession and geopolitical insecurity, some markets favour awarding contracts to domestic enterprises. In addition to volatile prices of key raw materials in 2018, there has also been a strong competitive pressure on the price of equipment and profit margins. Competitiveness of our products and services is also impacted by changes of operating conditions for both the Group and our customers. Management Boards of individual companies price their products autonomously. Risk in the procurement market Prices of major raw materials and commodities (copper, sheet metal, steel...) have been subject to unpredictable changes in recent years (vast growth or decline over a short period of time). Within the transformer program, the Group companies have been protected from the risk of sudden price changes of strategic raw materials in several ways. In case of copper, given that it is a London Metal Exchange listed raw material, forward contracts are used to negotiate with copper suppliers on the quantities and prices for future periods according to stock and estimates of signed contracts. In case of steel, transformer sheet and some of the most crucial supply parts, risk is mitigated by employing semi-annual or annual contracts with suppliers. Certain long-term customer contracts employ a sliding formula based on material price changes. Technological and development risks Group companies have continuously invested significant assets in key technologies and strategically important segments of production to mitigate risks of falling behind the competition in technology and development. In the forthcoming period, Group companies are planning to invest significant resources in new product development and upgrade of existing product portfolio. STRATEGY 13 Group Human resources risks Usual turnover and changes in the HR structure have not significantly affected the Group’s operations. Sudden or bigger turnover of employees with specialist knowledge (e.g. EU labour markets deregulating for workers from Croatia) might affect business operations. Continuous investments in training and financial incentives offered to key company employees tend to hedge against HR risks. Capital management risk The Group has managed the capital to ensure operating as a going concern while maximising shareholder returns through optimisation of debt-to-equity ratio. The Group has managed capital and made appropriate adjustments in line with changes of economic conditions on the market and risk characteristics of the assets. The Group can decide if retained earnings should be distributed to shareholders, if equity needs increasing or decreasing, if assets should be sold in order to decrease liabilities and similar. Currency risk The official currency of the Group is Croatian Kuna. However, some transactions executed in foreign currency are converted to Croatian Kuna, by applying exchange rate in effect at balance sheet date. Resulting exchange rate gains and losses are being credited or debited against profit and loss account. The companies hedge against F/X risk by continuously planning and monitoring their cash flow, contracting sales and procurement in the same currency where possible, adjusting inflow and outflow dynamics, as well as term F/X purchases in accordance with cash inflows and outflows plan. Companies with a higher share of exports in the total revenue employ financial derivatives to hedge against financial risk exposure. Interest rate risk Group companies have been most exposed to interest rate risk on loans contracted at floating interest rates, while a materially insignificant part of assets is exposed to interest rate risk. Individual companies within the Group have contracted hedge exposure to interest rate risk in contractual relations with foreign currency payments. Credit risk Credit risk is risk of a counter party defaulting on contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a policy of dealing exclusively with creditworthy counterparties thus mitigating risks of financial loss form defaults. The Group uses data and opinions gathered from rating agencies, the Chamber of Commerce and other publicly available financial information on companies’ financial status and uses its own data base to rate major customers. The Group’s risk exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously being monitored. As a principle, contracts are entered into only with creditworthy counterparties when appropriate payment insurance instruments are obtained. (L/C, guarantee, etc.) Exposure to credit risk is affected mainly by individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has established impairment loss allowance as an estimation of incurred losses in respect of expected losses from receivables and investments. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the Group’s inability to meet financial obligations as they mature. Risk management is a responsibility of the Management Boards of the Group companies. The Group has managed this risk by continuously monitoring estimated cash flow, comparing and adjusting it to the actual revenue and expenses. Overall, there has been no significant exposure of the Group to liquidity risk. 14 STRATEGY CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2018 Ethics and Integrity By taking part in initiatives, discussions and projects on national level, KONČAR has opted for a proVALUES, active approach in all aspects of corporate social responsibility.
