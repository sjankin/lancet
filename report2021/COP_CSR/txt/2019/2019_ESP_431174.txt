Code None Version 2018 2018 Progress report Page 16 of 53 Stakeholders This Progress Report is based on the stakeholder reporting methodology. The concept of the stakeholder is key to understanding CSR. The complexity and the dynamics of the current business environment have called for a solid commitment to the various stakeholders who are directly or indirectly affected by the business mission. Identifying stakeholders and their expectations are aspects that facilitate the full implementation of CSR within any organisation. This allows us to anticipate any potential risks or opportunities and to establish policies, actions, tools and performance indicators such as those included in this report. The CTL-TH Packaging Group has produced the following Progress Report by selecting the most prominent stakeholders of its organisation, and identifying the most important challenges for the selected stakeholders as well as their needs and expectations. From all the stakeholders identified (Shareholders, Agents, Associations, Training Centres, Technology Centres, Competition, Foundations, Regulator, Trade Unions, Society and the Community), this report will evaluate the 3 groups with the greatest impact on the definition of our management and corporate development policies: Clients, Staff, Suppliers. Below is a definition of the systems established to collate the needs and expectations as well as the risks identified for each of these 3 Stakeholders and which allow us to define the elements for the preparation of this report.

In 2018, following the approval of a new Strategic Business Plan, one of the strong elements of the mission was to Consolidate a cohesive company model based on outstanding customer service . Suppliers The identification of needs and expectations is carried out through activity or sector forums in which we jointly participate, and through direct suggestions made as part of our quality management system through the recording of incidents, non-conformities and through supplier audits, visits, quality, environmental, prevention and CSR audits, as well as awareness-raising meetings (Business Review, etc.) and, lastly, through active monitoring (suppliers' and competitors' websites, magazines, trade fairs, etc.).

Code None Version 2018 2018 Progress report Page 18 of 53 ANALYSIS POLICIES Formal written documents that define the values, tools and mechanisms of prevention and control of the risks detected in the assessment. This regulates the communication and the relationships between the company and its stakeholders. ASSESSMENT / MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF IMPACT The assessment allows us to analyse the relationship between stakeholders and our company with regard to the issues contained in the 10 principles. We must make a risk analysis with indicators that allow us to launch actions with their objectives for each principle. In this way it is possible to know which policies and actions should be taken for each Principle and which objectives should be set. By using the appropriate indicators, monitoring allows us to provide the tools to supervise compliance with policies and helps to detect faults in the management system for its subsequent improvement. ACTIONS Once the necessary policies have been formulated and the diagnosis has been made, the actions will help us to implement these policies. The actions will help the organisation to shape the policies developed and minimise the risks detected. The actions are planned over time and designed with the target stakeholder in mind.

Code None Version 2018 2018 Progress report Page 20 of 53 In the 2018-2019 period, this report includes the concepts derived from the 10 principles, with a new format that is incorporated into the current SDG structure. We have decided to focus on those DGs where we as a company have the most impact. Goal 3 aims to improve the health and well-being of the population in order to reduce mortality and the number of diseases. SMEs can contribute by promoting healthy lifestyles among the Staff and by having occupational health and safety systems. SMEs in the food or healthcare sector can have a greater impact. Goal 4 seeks to ensure quality education for all, promoting the technical and vocational training necessary to gain access to employment and promoting education based on sustainable development. SMEs can contribute by providing regular technical training to staff and training in areas related to sustainability. Goal 5 seeks to achieve equality between women and men worldwide in employment, social, political and economic terms and to eliminate gender discrimination. SMEs can develop an equality plan, increase the percentage of women in management positions and/or create work-life balance plans. Goal 6 aims to guarantee universal access to drinking water and sanitation services and to promote sustainable water management in order to improve water quality and conservation. SMEs can contribute by eliminating waste and toxic products that pollute water or by controlling water consumption and its reuse in the company. Goal 7 aims to ensure people's access to affordable energy, to increase the use of renewable energy and to promote energy efficiency. SMEs can commit to using renewable energy in their activities and promote measures to reduce energy consumption within the organisation. Goal 8 is designed to boost economic growth in a way that benefits everyone, through quality employment. SMEs can improve the working conditions of the Staff, such as salaries, holidays and working hours, or hire young unemployed people. This document is owned by the CTL-TH Packaging Group.

Code None Version 2018 2018 Progress report Page 21 of 53 Goal 9 seeks to promote a higher level of industrialisation through the use of technology, innovation and research. SMEs can promote digitalisation in the organisation, thinking of new services and innovative products that create new business opportunities or investing in research projects. Goal 10 seeks the social and work inclusion of the most vulnerable people in order to reduce the wealth gap between rich and poor people. SMEs can promote the inclusion of people with disabilities through accessibility in buildings or by offering them job opportunities or hiring people at risk of experiencing poverty. Goal 11 seeks to make cities and towns sustainable while reducing pollution, with affordable public transport services and green spaces. SMEs can promote sustainable mobility with electric or hybrid company vehicles and by encouraging the use of public transport among the Staff. Goal 12 aims to promote the sustainable use of natural resources, such as water, food, electricity and waste, through the reduction, recycling and reuse of these resources by companies and a responsible consumption by the population. SMEs can begin to design their sustainability strategy for the prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of the resources they use. Objective 13 aims to curb one of the most serious problems currently facing the planet climate change, which threatens the planet's fauna and flora and causes extreme weather phenomena such as land desertification, droughts and hurricanes with greater intensity and frequency. SMEs can calculate the carbon footprint of their organisation and start taking action to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Goal 15 aims to protect the environment, mainly land, forests and mountains, and to promote greater protection of flora and fauna. SMEs can implement environmental management systems in their organisation and encourage training for staff and customers on environmental issues. This document is owned by the CTL-TH Packaging Group.

SMEs can create their own Code of Ethics to define the organisation's values and to prevent corruption and train staff in human rights. Goal 17 seeks to create alliances between public institutions, businesses, the civilian society and universities in order to find joint solutions to the challenges of Agenda 2030. SMEs can begin to look for key partners to create alliances that allow them to contribute to the SDGs while at the same time providing benefits in terms of business and reputation.

Code None Version 2018 2018 Progress report Page 24 of 53 We have an integrated internal management system that covers policies, regulations and internal procedures related to product quality, verification controls and manufacturing processes in accordance with international standards. Our management system, in addition to including work processes and procedures related to the organisation, its people and their interrelationships, also sets the standards regarding our product and our supply chain. There are procedures embedded in our management system which are linked to internal policies, regulations and processes concerning quality, Human Resources, the organisation, customer service and Suppliers: “P.00.00015 Monitoring Ethical Code and Functions of the Ethical Committee and Protocol of complaints on the ethical code Also, with respect to the Staff, we keep, within the general internal management document, all the processes and procedures for personnel selection, hiring, induction, labour relations, conflict management, promotion, objective evaluation of performance, etc. in the same way as we have reflected the configuration of our internal organisation and its distribution by areas and functions. In the CTL-TH Packaging group, we base our health and safety policy on the prevention of injuries, health monitoring and the improvement of working conditions. We eliminate or minimise risks to the health and safety of the people and stakeholders operating on our premises. To monitor and control our management in this area, we regularly submit to an audit of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System based on OHSAS18001, and have been certified since 2009 on a continuous basis. Based on this mission and our new company values, we have launched a number of initiatives to raise the levels of commitment and involvement of individuals with the company's objectives. We have an annual training plan for all staff based on an assessment of needs. In the section on Customer services and the processes related to the Suppliers Group, we set out the guidelines for the relationships with these stakeholders in terms of work flow, generic and personalised attention, monitoring of the service and technical assistance, resolution of incidents and measurement of their impact, etc. As a company, our professional teams maintain a constant relationship with our clients in order to attend to their needs and problems.

In the event of in-house development, we provide technical advice in order to work together on the required solution and we also provide training sessions. For new projects, we offer our clients the chance to assist in our factories in the production of samples or BAT to ensure a product that conforms to their plans. The way in which the controls are integrated into our management system, including those of CSR and quality, services and operational satisfaction, etc., are included as part of the evaluation procedures for our Suppliers. The fundamental tool on which our relationship with suppliers is based, from a different perspective than the transaction itself, is the Business Review, where, in addition to such transactional aspects, there is always a reminder of our policies, as well as the setting of annual improvement objectives in all the areas included. For example, the non-approval of ethical code violations (including bribes, etc.), and the assessment of compliance with environmental measures are made explicit. We have introduced the formal purchasing policy, in accordance with the principles of CSR, to our current management system, also taking into account the control system for the designed degree of compliance.

In order to ensure compliance with the Code of Ethics, to resolve incidents or concerns regarding its interpretation and to adopt appropriate measures for its better implementation, a Committee for the application and monitoring of the Code of Ethics has been created. The mission of this Committee is to promote the diffusion and application of these ethical principles in all the company’s activities.

In addition, it should be noted that the Equality Commission has established a specific protocol for dealing with complaints of sexual harassment. With regard to the Staff, as part of these transformation initiatives, in 2017 we launched a Work Survey, with the aim of measuring the commitment and involvement of people in the company, with the direct participation of a large part of the company's Staff and we have begun a process that should lead us to an assessment and action plan in 2018, described in this same report in the relevant chapters.

In the case of suppliers, the risk is the indirect non-compliance with Human Rights and the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, because some of our stakeholders do not comply with them, as a consequence of our lack of verification, control and/or monitoring of some suppliers of raw materials that do not have a presence in our company. However, we must make it clear that the company carries out a check on the contractual conditions that the workers of these subcontracting companies have. These suppliers are evaluated annually within the quality system including checks linked to the human rights detected during the audits carried out on them. This is done through audits of suppliers, to whom the ethical code of the CTL-TH Packaging group is communicated. At the moment, our classification of suppliers is based on the annual revision of their supply of the full goods, with the agreed quality and on the agreed date. The CSR criterion has been added to the suppliers' evaluation (Business Review), pending analysis of the data. This document is owned by the CTL-TH Packaging Group.

The covenant or agreement of working conditions of CTL-TH Packaging S.L.U, is reached and agreed with the works council. The Works Council verifies, together with HR, that the aforementioned company agreement is complied with at all times, together with the CSR conditions related to the principles and, in the event of any incidents, an internal notification is made, which is recorded in the form of Minutes (content of the incident, solution, responsible parties, etc.). The minutes of the meeting and all the resolutions passed by common agreement with the Works Council are recorded in an internal database and are also communicated globally to the entire Staff, becoming part of the internal rules of the Company. In the same way, several direct communication channels are maintained with the people, made known to all staff who become part of the organisation during their induction: direct meetings with the person in charge and with the works committee, internal e-mail, memos, collective meetings with management and workers' assemblies. We do not restrict the meeting time to the legal minimums established in relation to collective bargaining, but instead we invest the time necessary to properly manage each circumstance.. Contracts with the company, both national and international, are governed by the regulations in force in the European Union on the minimum age for access to the labour market, i.e. 18 years.

We have no risk of employing minors under legal age. For each appointment, we verify the identification of the person and carry out an initial medical examination to ensure that all the company's national and international personnel have reached the age of 18 at the time of entering into the employment relationship. We consider that discrimination based on gender is a risk in the CTL-TH Packaging Group, which is why we are currently working on an analysis that has resulted in an equality plan for the years 2018-2021. In future selection processes, we must include the criteria defined in the CSR policy drafted beforehand, in which we will include criteria of gender equality and respect for diversity, as well as procedures for verifying compliance with these policies and managing incidents. To this end, a series of indicators has been established to verify the progress of the equality plan in the areas for improvement identified.

There is a lack of transparent and continuous communication with people to ensure the return of their opinion to the management, in order to encourage constructive exchange. As regards Suppliers and Clients, we have yet to verify whether these Stakeholders are complying correctly with these principles and in particular whether they support the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour. Although we have circulated information to our supply chain about good working conditions and the absence of forced labour through our code of ethics, we do not have a system for verifying correct compliance.
