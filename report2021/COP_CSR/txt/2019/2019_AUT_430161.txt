Building for People UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2018 Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer 2 Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer Heimo Scheuch, Chairman of the Managing Board of Wienerberger AG Ladies and Gentlemen: Since 1819, Wienerberger has been producing Our success story began 200 years ago in the Wienerdurable and sustainable building materials that continue berg district on the southern outskirts of Vienna. When to play an important role in contemporary architecture Alois Miesbach, a man with a vision, bought a small brick and residential construction. Most of the magnificent factory, he prepared the ground for a company that has buildings in Vienna, dating back to the 19th century, become a living example of sustainability. 50 years later, were erected with products made by Wienerberger. The Heinrich Drasche, Alois Miesbach’s nephew, made another company was also instrumental in the construction of decisive move by taking our company public on the Vienna social housing, a pioneering movement that started in Stock Exchange, where we have been listed ever since. Vienna about 100 years ago. Today, we supply not only Since our early days, we have always felt a responsibility building materials with outstanding characteristics, but for generations to come. To this very day, Wienerberger’s entire system solutions for building construction and corporate culture has been marked by strong values. infrastructure, which serve to improve people’s quality of life and create sustainable value. “Since our early days, we have always felt All our activities are focused on our customers and the a responsibility for generations to come.” best possible solutions we can offer them. For about 100 years, Wienerberger has played a role in the creation of Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer 3 affordable housing, which is still a crucial topic today. At the same time, we are determined to offer our customers “Our target for the percentage of secondary raw systems capable of meeting the requirements for buildings materials to be used in plastic pipe production by and infrastructure today and in the future. Noteworthy 2020 was already achieved in 2018.” examples include solutions for energy-efficient buildings and for infrastructure that provides maximum security of supply. Resource efficiency is a matter of high priority not only in the context of digitalization but in many other areas as well. One of our objectives is to focus even more strongly “In 2018, innovative products accounted on the principles of the circular economy. Above all, for almost one third of our total revenues.” residual materials from production, as well as materials from external sources having undergone thorough quality checks, are to be returned into the production process. The key element of Wienerberger’s organic growth One of the targets defined in our Sustainability Roadmap is product innovation. In 2018, innovative products 2020 for plastic pipe production was to increase the accounted for almost one third of our total revenues; in amount of secondary raw materials used to 70 kg per ton other words, almost one out of three euros of revenue was of products produced by 2020. This target was more than generated through innovative products. This underlines achieved in 2018, i.e. two years earlier than planned. We Wienerberger’s position as an innovation leader in our have therefore set ourselves new and even more ambitious industry, which has been made possible by continuous targets for 2020. We are now aiming at 85 kg of secondary research and development activities undertaken in raw materials per ton of products, at least 50 kg thereof cooperation with our partners, including customers, from external sources. architects, building contractors and developers. In 2018, we invested almost € 16 million in research and development. Energy efficiency is another crucial topic for all Wienerberger Business Units. In brick production in Europe, for instance, our target is to reduce specific „Progressive digitalization in all walks of life is energy consumption by 20% by 2020 compared to 2010. fundamentally changing our business model.” By 2018, we achieved a 13% reduction. In plastic pipe production, however, we had to redefine our efficiency targets against the background of a persistent trend in our We are living in the digital age. This also holds for product mix towards lighter products with smaller pipe the construction industry. As a company operating in this diameters. On the one hand, this means higher resource industry, we have to address these challenges. Progressive efficiency: less material is needed for a product providing digitalization in all walks of life is fundamentally changing the same or even better performance. On the other hand, our business model. This applies to the way we interact however, specific energy consumption and CO2 emissions, with our customers and partners, the design and implemeasured per ton of products produced, increase, while mentation of construction projects, as well as internal energy input and water usage remain the same. We have processes in administration and production, where we therefore adjusted our new targets to this development. are striving for higher resource efficiency. Wienerberger is taking the lead in this transformative process. I am convinced that our industry is only at the beginning of a fundamental transformation. Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer 4 The assumption of social responsibility, especially for Wienerberger. The accident victim was a production the well-being of our employees, has always been a high worker in Germany. Wienerberger deeply regrets this priority for Wienerberger. Since the late 19th century, accident. Although the indicator is not within the when urgently needed social reforms were initiated by reporting scope (given that the company concerned the physician and journalist Victor Adler, Wienerberger is not fully consolidated), we disclose the information has evolved to become a fair and responsible employer on account of its high relevance and in the interest of treating its employees with respect and paying decent transparency. We studied the circumstances of the wages and salaries. Today, we are responsible for a workaccident in great depth and are consistently pursuing force of almost 17,000 people. From the social benefits our measures aimed at increasing safety at work for our introduced in our early days, we have moved on to a employees. Comprehensive safety programs have been comprehensive portfolio of responsibilities that we fulfill implemented by all our Business Units in order to ensure on a daily basis in order to live up to our vision of being an even higher level of occupational safety. the preferred employer in our industry. By signing the Social Charter in 2001, Wienerberger undertook to ensure that employment and working conditions across the “The higher diversity of the Managing Board will Group are based on national legislation and/or collective have a positive impact on the company as a whole.” bargaining agreements as a minimum standard. We have highly qualified employees in all our country “Wienerberger now offers its employees organizations. We support them in their development the chance to become co-owners.” through training programs and by providing the best possible framework for their careers. For new appointments, we give preference to women, provided their qualiIt is part of our corporate mission to share not only our fications are equivalent to those of male candidates, as we values, know-how and experience, but also our success. are convinced that diversity adds value to our company. Therefore, Wienerberger now offers its employees the On 1 June 2019, Ms. Solveig Menard-Galli, previously chance to become co-owners.

At the same time, she will be in charge of our digitalization strategy. The higher diversity of the Managing The health and safety of our employees is a matter of Board will have a positive impact on the company as a special importance to us. We are doing our utmost to whole. When it comes to repositioning Wienerberger in make their workplaces safe, healthy and fit for the future a time of forward-looking change, the perspectives and and to reach our target of zero accidents. Compared approaches of a new management generation are indisto the previous year, we were able to reduce accident pensable. The fact that an internal candidate has been frequency by almost 6% and accident severity by close chosen for this important position confirms that our to 11%. However, it saddens us to report that a fatal company has a talent pool of excellent colleagues. occupational accident occurred at a 50% subsidiary of Introduction by the Chief Executive Officer 5 Respect for human rights and zero tolerance of “In times of change, communication is crucial.” child labor and discrimination have always been matters of course for Wienerberger. This is in line with our values and one of the reasons why we acceded to the UN Global Wienerberger is not alone in repositioning itself in Compact in 2003, committing ourselves to implementing a period of change. Society as a whole is undergoing a the ten principles relating to human rights, labor standprocess of transformation and is being confronted with ards, environmental protection, including the precaumajor challenges, such as the fight against global warming, tionary principle, and the fight against corruption. adjustment to climate change, globalization, migration and demographic change, digitalization and cyber security. In order to fully live up to our responsibility along In times like these, communication is crucial in order to the supply chain, we will elaborate and roll out a uniform, provide all stakeholders – above all our own employees, Group-wide “Supplier Code of Conduct” (SCOC), which but also our shareholders and business partners – with will replace the specific codes currently applied by our timely and comprehensive information on the path taken Business Units. Compliance with the SCOC will be by our company. To find out what really matters to our monitored through supplier audits and reported in the stakeholders, we performed our first materiality analysis 2019 Sustainability Report.

I will be greatly product groups and examined our contribution to the pleased to see you, our esteemed readers, accompany us achievement of the 17 sustainability development goals this path. of the United Nations (UN SDGs). It turned out that, besides the need to give constant attention to occupational safety, issues arising upstream in the supply chain, such as human rights and corruption, represent the greatest risks – but also opportunities – for Wienerberger. UN Global Compact: Communication on Progress 2018 6 UN Global Compact: Communication on Progress 2018 The activities of big industrial companies, such as Wienerberger committed itself to comply with the Wienerberger AG, have a strong impact on society and conventions and recommendations of the International the environment. Such companies therefore bear a special Labor Organization (ILO). This includes providing safe responsibility and should act in an exemplary manner. The and healthy working conditions. Respecting human rights minimum standards to be complied with include, above has always been a matter of course for Wienerberger. all, the principles of the UN Global Compact regarding Health and safety is a topic of particular importance for human rights, labor standards, environmental protection us. We are doing our utmost to make the workplaces of and the fight against corruption. Through its accession to our employees safe, healthy and fit for the future and to the UN Global Compact in 2003, Wienerberger officially reach our Group’s target of zero accidents. We also expect committed to the ten principles and undertook to foster our suppliers to respect human rights and act accordingly. their implementation within the framework of the company’s possibilities.
