Our CRS ambition 49 4.2. SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES From the design stage through to a machine’s end of life, we instil Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in all of our actions, prioritising day-to-day improvement for the users of our machines and services. The result of this ambition is the REDUCE approach. It aims to improve the quality of working life for users of our machines, to increase productivity and provide better protection for the environment. Three programmes have been developed: ? REDUCE TCO, launched in 2015, aims to inform REDUCE Fuel, launched in 2013, aims to REDUCE Risks, launched in 2018, aims to our customers about the cost breakdown of measure and compare the fuel consumption improve handling of machines so that they can machines and helping them to improve the and CO2 emissions of our machines in complete be driven safely. The objective is also to provide profitability of their production tool. transparency. The purpose is to support our guidance on the choice of equipment and customers in reducing their environmental services to increase awareness of health and footprint and to reduce the impact of our safety risks. products, especially that linked to climate change. A website devoted to the approach as a whole was launched in 2018 and is available at: reduce-program.com. 4.2.1. ECO-DESIGN: DESIGN THAT INCORPORATES THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY In order to understand more clearly where the hot spots of our activity are located, The CSR initiatives already introduced within the value chain demonstrate the we conducted several specific studies: profitability that these can generate. • A multi-criteria life cycle analysis, in 2012-2013, looking at the life cycle of a • Factoring in eco-design at all stages of the life cycle is a key point in studies. benchmark agricultural machine from our product range8.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF A MACHINE THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE CYCLE In order to work on the machine’s manufacturing, use and end-of-life phases, an eco-design steering committee was formally set up in 2016. It brings together contacts from engineering and design firms, purchasing offices, EHS11 and the S&S 15% division, which provides TCO expertise, and CSR. In 2017, this led to an “Eco-design End of life and TCO” checklist being introduced for engineering, design and purchasing offices so that the environment and machine life cycles can be factored into the design Raw stage. materials manufacturing In 2018, this checklist was tested in the development of five new products and concrete actions were identified to reduce impacts and the TCO (total cost of ownership). It has therefore been incorporated into the procedure for development of new products and services. 80% Use 5% Transport Examples of eco-design in 2018 include: the wheels on aerial work platforms12 have changed from a standard foam inflation to Ecofill. This method for filling tyres using renewable resources helps to reduce the carbon footprint and halve the use Maintenance of fuels for manufacturing. Used tyres are given new life thanks to a rim and foam recovery process. Once dismantled, a new tyre can be fitted onto the wheel. The recovered foam is partially mixed with virgin foam in the new wheel manufacturing process. Insofar as is possible, the tyre carcass is recycled. 8 MLT 840 9 The scope includes the three emissions Scopes defined by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol: Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from electricity consumption) and Scope 3 (other indirect emissions throughout the value chain) 10 The regulatory emissions scope concerns Scopes 1 and 2 only; measurement is only mandatory once every four years, but we undertake the assessment each year 50 4.2.2. THE PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEM: MORE RESPONSIBLE USE OF MACHINES The Manitou group operates in a society in which the consumption of goods, which REDUCE TCO is a programme that seeks to highlight the most significant core was once the norm, is gradually shifting towards economy of use. costs before purchasing and raise awareness among users about cost reduction. To do this, a calculator has been created , which may be accessed online at http:// The second-hand and leasing markets make it possible to sever the ties between tco.manitou.com. Since more than a third of the TCO of our products is related value creation and the use of non-renewable resources and energy consumption. to customers' fuel consumption, there is a close link with the REDUCE Fuel This change in model as regards machine ownership should promote the durability programme. and pooled use of our machines. This calls for innovation in supporting end The work done over the past four years to reduce TCO at all stages of the life cycle customers, because the value of our products no longer resides solely in the quality of our machines resulted in the following in 2018: of our machines, but also in the economic value that our services can provide. • Complete integration of TCO into the new procedure for developing new products and services that will apply to the group in 2019.

The integration of these new territories, along with the high level of activity, explains the negative variation of certain indicators. The increase in water consumption comes mainly from leaks that have been identified. The increase in paint consumption and VOC emissions is also explained by the increase in demand for colours by our rental customers, which requires cleaning and purging of the installations at every colour change. Waste reduction continued, also accompanied by the quality of sorting at source. For example, for ordinary industrial waste, 73% of the waste is reused or recycled, 17% is recovered as energy, 11% is sent to landfill (compared with 14% in 2017). All steel waste is reused. 4.4.4. MANAGEMENT OF OUR RISKS Each industrial site analyses its Safety and Environment risks and opportunities Lastly, faced with the depletion of resources, the group has a responsibility to be each year. as economical as possible with the natural resources it needs for its business, such as energy and water, and to recycle its waste such as steel. The main safety risks associated with our business are as follows: Operationally, many actions are undertaken every day to ensure management of -Falling objects, falls from height, trips the aforementioned risks: -Impact between a truck and a pedestrian or another vehicle • Visual management through initiatives such as the DANTOTSU approach: -Injury caused by manual or mechanical handling analysis of near-miss accidents, incidents and accidents in production centre -Injury caused by use of welding and grinding equipment workshops.

CREATING VALUE WITH OUR PARTNERS The Manitou group places particular importance on the dialogue it maintains with its stakeholders, throughout the regions in which it operates. The CSR strategy is based on the creation of shared value with all of the key players, developed here through: -Suppliers, through a responsible Purchasing policy. -Regional players, with whom interactions ensure that a strong local presence is established. -Civil society, by taking part in socially-responsible actions and managing contracts as ethically as possible. 4.5.1. OUR SUPPLIERS OUR RESPONSIBLE PURCHASING POLICY In 2012, we rolled out a Responsible Purchasing policy aimed at creating The sustainability of the group rests largely on the strength of our network of sustainable, balance and creative value with our suppliers for all the stakeholders. suppliers.

COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD The cost of sales is made up of the cost of goods and services sold, which comprises the cost of raw materials and components, labour directly attributable to the goods or services, and all related production and logistics operating costs. It also includes the amortisation of intangible assets, equipment and materials allocated to production, contractual warranty costs, provisions for inventory impairment, and exchange gains and losses on operating income in foreign currency resulting from the difference between the valuation at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction and the rate on the day of settlement. GROSS MARGIN The gross margin on the cost of sales is the difference between sales and the cost of sales. 98 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS Costs related to preliminary study, the functional analysis phase and user training are recognised as expenses for the period. Research and development costs consist of personnel costs for staff assigned to innovation, development, design, prototyping and product improvements.

These costs primarily include the costs of the personnel assigned to the projects, the portion of overhead costs dedicated to the development activity, the costs of external studies and the costs of prototype creation. Development costs incurred between the decision to start development, the manufacture of new equipment and the testing and pre-series production phase for that equipment are recognised as intangible assets. Depreciation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is ready to be put into operation. Costs incurred in connection with the implementation of an integrated information system (ERP) are recognised as assets for the portion relating to the detailed design of the project and to programming, testing and documentation, if it is likely that the future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and if the cost of that asset can be reliably assessed and monitored. 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT Part 6.

DERIVATIVES In order to secure a maximum level of financial costs, the group has set up, in line with the new financing agreement, interest rate caps and floors. These derivatives are described as future cash flow hedging instruments. They are considered highly effective at 31 December 2018. The characteristics of the caps and floors at 31 December 2018 are as follows: CAP Average rate Fair value at in millions of euros of CAP Notional 31.12.2018 Less than one year 1 to 2 years Q4 2021 0.50% 50 0 2 to 5 years Q4 2022 1.00% 12.5 0 COLLAR Average rate Fair value at in millions of euros of COLLARS Notional 31.12.2018 Less than one year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years Q4 2022 0.548% 37.5 0 2 to 5 years Q4 2023 0.75% 12.5 0 At 31 December 2018, the group also holds forward sale contracts for currencies designed to cover future GBP, AUD, RUB and ZAR cash flows in euro for an amount of €201.3m. The group also holds forward purchase contracts for currencies designed to cover future PLN cash flows into euro for an amount of €0.95m. These hedges are considered effective within the meaning of IFRS. The change in fair value of these instruments is therefore recorded in the balance sheet liabilities for €5.2m, in the balance sheet assets for €3.7m with shareholders’ equity as offset for -€0.9m, with the valuation of forward points being recorded under financial income for -€0.1m and -€0.04m under operating income. 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT Part 6. Financial statements 111 Note 10.8.

CHANGE IN SCOPE In 2018, the change in scope concerns the assignment of 26% of the share capital in its subsidiary Manitou Southern Africa (until now a 100% owned subsidiary) to the Columba Leadership Trust fund. There were no acquisitions in the financial period. In 2017, the change in scope related to acquisition of Terex Equipment Private Ltd, now Manitou Equipment India, in May 2017, and to the acquisition of a majority stake in Marpoll Pty Ltd (LiftRite Hire & Sales) in July 2017. Note 34.2. INCIDENCE OF ACQUISITIONS Following the assignment of 26% of the share capital in Manitou Southern Africa, the Manitou Group retained control of this fully consolidated subsidiary. This transaction has no impact on the group’s cash and net assets. The loss (-€0.6m) was recognised by shareholder's equity. The transaction is combined with a commitment to buy back securities (put on minority interests). This is recorded as long-term financial debt, charged to shareholder's equity, for its present value of the estimated exercise price, i.e. an amount of €1.2m as at 31 December 2018. Note 34.3.

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GENERAL INFORMATION Manitou BF completely denies JCB’s allegations and continues to defend itself vigorously.

Moreover, significant payouts in respect of these Manitou BF is a French Public Limited Company (société anonyme) with a Board of claims seem to be unlikely in view of the evidence put forward by Manitou BF Directors with capital of €39 668 399 consisting of 39 668 399 shares with a par to defend itself.

Note 1.3. FIXED ASSETS The period began on 1 January 2018 and ended on 31 December 2018, spanning 12 months. Note 1.3.1. DEVELOPMENT COSTS The Notes (or tables) below are an integral part of the annual financial statements. In compliance with Article 212-3-2 of ANC Regulation No. 2014-03, the development costs incurred by the company in 2018 relating to clearly defined projects likely to be completed and marketed profitably were capitalised, as the capitalisation requirements specified by the French accounting regulations had HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIOD been fulfilled. As it is a recommended method, the company made the decision in 2005 to apply this accounting treatment. MONITORING OF LITIGATION FOR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL All research expenses and the costs of studies and development other than those PROPERTY RIGHTS described above are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. In May 2017, action was taken against the Manitou Group by J.C. Bamford Excavators Limited (JCB), in France, for allegedly infringing two European patents Note 1.3.2. SOFTWARE regarding certain features related to the control system of the overload cut-off of These mainly include the costs incurred in the implementation of various projects, certain telehandlers manufactured and/or marketed. for the portion related to the detailed design of these projects and to programming, Financially, in May 2017, the claimant was seeking preliminary damages (subject to testing and documentation. further evaluation) of €20 million before the French court, increased in June 2018 Costs recorded during the preliminary study phase, the functional analysis phase by JCB to €50 million. and for user training are recognised as expenses. The legal proceedings for this dispute continued throughout 2018. Within the context of a procedural issue, JCB applied for interim injunctive relief against Manitou BF. The pretrial judge decided on 31 January 2019 to dismiss JCB’s application for the first patent on which JCB was basing its allegations and, with regard to the second patent, temporarily prohibited Manitou BF from manufacturing, offering for sale, leasing and holding a former configuration of certain telehandlers. This decision has no impact on Manitou BF’s business insofar as it relates to the control system incorporated in certain models produced and sold before August 2017 that are no longer manufactured by Manitou BF, a fact that was acknowledged by the decision. Manitou BF has appealed this decision. For this same incident, Manitou BF had alternatively proposed, if the judge considered the interim injunctive relief well founded, the replacement of the bans by a bank guarantee of €470 000 for the two patents. This proposal become irrelevant for the first patent, for which the judge did not declare a preliminary injunction. JCB produced an appraisal valuing its loss at €160 million (for the two patents) in support of its application for the guarantee, if ordered, to be for €30 million (also for the two patents). This proposal was not accepted by the judge, nor was JCB’s application for penalties of €100 000 per day of delay, with the penalties declared by the judge at €1 000 per offence, the decision emphasising that the alleged loss by JCB concerns only the overload cut-off control system and not the machine as a whole. 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT Part 6.
