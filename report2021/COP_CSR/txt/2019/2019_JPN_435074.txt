Until now, we have solved the customer’s problems by combining our unique terminals and network technology. We are an IoT company that has been manufacturing edge devices for over 100 years and connected them to networks and we therefore believe that the arrival of the IoT society will only bring many more new business opportunities. OKI has network technologies, including sensing, data processing, data analysis, business applications, and technology to manufacture highly reliable terminals. This is a major strength as there are not many companies that have all these technologies. Given this backdrop, we have a history of building systems by selecting the most suitable terminals for the edge area and connecting them to networks. By doing this, we have gained our customer’s trust and knowledge whereby it has become a great asset with more and more customers becoming our partners in co-creation. OKI will introduce terminals with a more sophisticated and reliable interface. For this development, we will allocate resources intensively in the future. In addition, there is an important goal which is to solve social issues. We will focus on areas where there are chronic labor shortages, such as in medical care and retail and develop automated equipment that utilize hardware There are already tens of thousands of OKI terminals technology and resources to reduce their burden. installed and operating in various markets.

Message from the New Outside Director I was a bank employee at The Fuji Bank, Ltd. and Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., where I spent a long period of time in the central part of Control Management Department dealing with HR/Strategic Management Planning, Financial Risk Management, and for the last 10 years I was in management working in the midst and dealing with the aftermath of the global financial crisis. What I learned from this difficult and painful period was the qualities required by top managers during times of change. Basically, there are three things: the courage to decide and execute bold strategies; the need to keep a “cool head” to comprehend the risks included in making such decisions, and not to run away when a crisis occurs. Since joining Yamato Transport Co., Ltd. 14 years ago, and taking into account my experience as a bank employee, I have worked on bold business structural reforms, as the environment for logistics has changed drastically. By a strange coincidence, I have joined OKI’s board as a director. OKI has a long history of overcoming many challenges and possesses advanced technologies that have supported Japan’s social infrastructure, including ICT and Mechatronics Systems. However, the speed of change in the business environment is accelerDirector ating, and I believe it is the crucial moment whether or not we can respond swiftly Makoto Kigawa will determine OKI’s future. I will do my utmost to make use of my accumulated experience and contribute to overall management so that we can move towards this next growth phase.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 1) Matters concerning the status of financial instruments (1) Policy on financial instruments The OKI Group mainly uses short-term deposits and highly safe marketable securities for fund management, and raises its funds primarily through borrowings from financial institutions and issuance of corporate bonds. The Group uses derivatives to hedge risk as described below, and does not engage in speculative transactions. (2) Description of financial instruments, related risks, and risk management system The Group strives to mitigate its customers’ credit risks associated with notes and accounts receivable, which are operating receivables, by carrying out customer credit investigations in accordance with regulations for the management of accounts receivable of individual companies. For borrowings, the Group raises short-term funds mainly for working capital and long-term funds for working capital and capital investment. For borrowings exposed to the interest rate risk, the Group applies derivative instruments (interest rate swap transactions) to hedge its risk. Derivative transactions consist of forward foreign exchange contracts which aim to hedge exchange rate fluctuation risks related to foreign currency-denominated receivables and payables, currency swap transactions, and interest rate swap transactions, which aim to hedge interest rate fluctuation risks related to the payment of borrowings. The Company assesses the validity of hedges with interest rate swaps by comparing the accumulated fair value changes of hedged items and those of hedging instruments, but does not perform such assessment if they are subject to special treatment. The Group executes and manages derivative transactions in accordance with OKI Group’s policy. (3) Supplemental explanation regarding the disclosure concerning fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on market prices, but if no market prices are available, their fair value reflects the value reasonably calculated. Because fluctuation factors are incorporated into the calculation of the said value, it may change if different prerequisites, etc. are used. Contract amounts, etc. related to derivative transactions described in “2. Disclosure concerning fair value of financial instruments” do not indicate market risks related to these transactions. 2) Disclosure concerning fair value of financial instruments As of March 31, 2019 (consolidated balance sheet date), the amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, fair value, and the amount of differences are as shown in the table below. Any item whose fair value is deemed extremely difficult to assess is excluded from the table. (See Note 2 below.)

OKI Report 2019 64 DATA SECTION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS [UNAUDITED] Notes: 1. Disclosure concerning methods of calculation of fair value of financial instruments, securities and derivative transactions. Assets (1) Cash and deposits and (2) Notes and accounts receivable These items are settled over a short period of time and their fair value is virtually equal to their book value. Hence, their fair value is determined to be equal to their book value. (3) Investments in securities The fair value of investments in securities is based on their prices determined at the financial instruments exchanges, and the fair value of bonds is based on the quotations offered by the correspondent financial institution as of the balance sheet date. (4) Long-term trade receivables Fair value of long-term trade receivables is determined by deducting the present estimated doubtful receivables from the book value as estimated doubtful receivables are calculated based on the present value of loans / receivables. Liabilities (1) Notes and accounts payable, (2) Short-term borrowings, and (3) Other accrued expenses These items are settled over a short period of time and their fair value is virtually equal to their book value. Hence, their fair value is determined to be equal to their book value. (4) Long-term debt The fair value is based primarily on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest is discounted by an assumed interest rate based on rates currently available to the Company for similar transactions. Some long-term debt with floating interest rates are prescribed to be subject to special accounting treatment applicable to interest rate swaps (see below). Hence, the fair value of a long-term debt is based on the method of calculation whereby the sum of principal and interest, treated in combination with the said interest rate swap, is discounted by an assumed interest rate based on rates currently available to the Company for similar transactions. Derivative transactions Described in Note12 2.
