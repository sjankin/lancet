Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 5 Message from Management Aiming to Make Epson an Indispensable Company for the World The world expects companies to operate responsibly to achieve social sustainability. I am confident that Epson can contribute substantively to sustainability because the efficient, compact, and precision technologies we employ in our products reduce environmental impacts. Epson was founded in 1942. It began as a watch manufacturer, with a factory near Lake Suwa, in Nagano prefecture. Our business activities have always been guided by the keywords “integrity and effort,” words that exemplified the character of founder Hisao Yamazaki. In the early days, we developed mechanical watches with original designs that were different from the industry standards of the day. We later went on to develop and mass-produce the world’s first quartz watches, timepieces that boasted far better accuracy than mechanical watches. Over time, this drive to innovate became a hallmark of our corporate culture. Epson’s creativeness and willingness to take on challenges have yielded a wide range of products, from printers and projectors to watches, robots, and microdevices, all of which employ the efficient, compact, and precision technologies that evolved out of watch manufacturing. Epson has maintained a strong commitment to both local and global environmental preservation, starting with a pledge to keep Lake Suwa clean and later exemplified by Epson becoming the first company in the world to declare that it would eliminate ozonedepleting CFCs from its operations, which it did across the Epson Group in 1993. We have always sought to help solve societal challenges through our business activities. Epson joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2004, and we have aligned our business practices with the 10 principles of the compact relating to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. Furthermore, in 2018, we declared a commitment to contribute to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, we at Epson are looking to transform industry and drive the circular economy by innovating the office and production environments. Our printers employ Epson’s own piezoelectric inkjet technology. Unlike laser systems, piezoelectric systems do not use heat in the printing process. They also have a simpler structure and consume far less electricity. We also provide value by equipping our high-speed line inkjet multifunction printer and the printers with high-capacity ink tanks that reduce users’ environmental impacts while boosting their operational efficiency. These printers can be combined with our dry process office papermaking systems to create an in-office paper recycling loop and shrink the office’s environmental footprint. We also offer smooth, projector-based communication as value needed in offices of the future. Meanwhile, our piezoelectric inkjet systems are driving a technology shift from analog to digital printing in the textile printing industry. On-demand digital textile printing not only allows short-run jobs of limited quantities along with faster turnaround, it also renders conventional analog printing plates and cleaning processes obsolete. Digital processes thus reduce the amount of dye wasted and the amount of water used for clean-up. This makes digital textile printing more environmentally friendly and improves the work environment. As stated in our Management Philosophy, Epson aspires to be an indispensable company. To become indispensable, we must continue to offer products and services that benefit customers and that can help address societal challenges. We will continue to examine customer needs and honestly face and exceed their expectations by using our efficient, compact, and precision technologies to drive innovations, create the kind of new value that only Epson can, and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society.

Our mission is to build stakeholder trust as we grow and prosper with communities and to help create a better world. We consider any action designed to realize Epson’s Management Philosophy to be a CSR activity. In addition to ensuring compliance, observing corporate ethics, and fulfilling our responsibilities at a level that exceeds what society requires, we will fully demonstrate our unique creativity in CSR by creating value through the products we develop and manufacture. In 2017, Epson developed a materiality matrix that identifies key CSR themes, such as environmental issues, respect for human rights, human resources development, and governance. We will use this matrix to guide and strengthen our CSR activities and to help make the world a better place as we seek to become an indispensable company. Management Philosophy (Please refer to page 227 of “Appendices”) Management Philosophy, Principles of Corporate Behavior, and CSR Activity Established in 2005 and applying to the entire Epson Group, Principles of Corporate Behavior spells out principles of conduct for realizing the goals of Epson’s Management Philosophy. In 2017, we updated Principles of Corporate Behavior in response to the latest societal requirements. Epson will fulfill its social responsibility by aspiring to live up to the principles below based on “trust-based management,” a concept that underlies Epson’s Management Philosophy. Principles of Corporate Behavior (Please refer to page 228 of “Appendices”) CSR Guided by International Standards At Epson, we have closely aligned our Principles of Corporate Behavior with internationally recognized standards to help ensure that we serve the role that society expects of us. Epson also understands and respects the laws and regulations in the countries and regions in which it operates. • The United Nations Global Compact • The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises • The Keidanren Charter of Corporate Behavior • ISO 26000 • The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) • The RBA Code of Conduct • ILO Core Labour Standards Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 16 Key CSR Themes To reach the goals stated in our Management Philosophy and to become an indispensable company, we believe it is important to identify issues that should be addressed and to solve them through our business activities.

CSR Stakeholder Dialog Epson conducts dialogue with stakeholders continuously to improve the quality of CSR activities. Global Compact Network Japan Annual Symposium Masayuki Kawana, Seiko Epson director and head of the CSR Management Office, took the stage for a panel discussion titled “Human Capital Development in the SDG Era” at a symposium held on February, 2019, to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Global Compact Network Japan (GCNJ). During the panel discussion, speakers shared their knowledge and views on the topic of human capital development in the SDG era. Mr. Kawana spoke about the necessity of meeting a wide range of social needs and continuously creating value to make Epson an indispensable company for the society. He described how Epson fosters an inclusive culture that engenders mutual respect and maximizes the abilities of its diverse human capital while working toward achieving a long-term corporate vision of driving progress on select SDGs. This was followed by a passionate discussion about topics such as the necessity of having exceptional, innovative human capital given the urgency of addressing the SDGs, actions that can be taken to actually develop human capital, and expectations for other sectors. Environmental Engagement in Hino Seiko Epson invited eight people from the Hino City Environmental Department, the Hino City Environmental Planning Council’s CO2 Group, and private business to discuss CSR and environmental actions. The discussion was held at Seiko Epson’s office in Hino, a city in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Seiko Epson explained its CSR initiatives and the environmental actions being taken at the Hino Office. The guests were then shown Epson’s PaperLab A-8000 dry process office papermaking system and an LX-10000F high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printer. The guests were surprised by the speed of paper production and the speed of the printer. They also offered thought-provoking ideas and expressed confidence in the company.

Relationship to Our SDGs As stated in its Management Philosophy, Epson seeks to become an indispensable company, an ambition that Epson considers to be consistent with the realization of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. In 2017, as part of this effort, Epson created “Key CSR Themes,” a materiality matrix that identifies important initiatives for addressing social issues. Epson examined the relationship between its initiatives and the 169 targets of the 17 SDGs to identify the SDGs that intersect with Epson’s initiatives. Key CSR Themes and Sustainable Development Goals There are 169 targets (1.1 to 17.19) under the SDGs. The ﬁgures in the table below indicate the targets that Epson is addressing with its initiatives (as of June 2019).

(Please note that this matrix was mapped out in June 2019 and is subject to change depending on future business developments.) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 29 Commitment to the SDGs Epson is using its original efficient, compact, and precision technologies and initiatives as vehicles to drive innovations that will enrich the world and make it a better place. Our goals are the same as those of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations. Epson is creating new value by looking hard at solutions to social issues, understanding the expectations that society has of us, and then providing products and services that far exceed those expectations. We at Epson are committed to the development of sustainable societies through the four areas of innovation identified in the Epson 25 Corporate Vision. Minoru Usui President Seiko Epson Corporation Communication with Outside Experts Epson conducts dialogue and communicates with outside experts continuously to contribute to SDGs. Participation in the Nagano Prefecture SDGs Symposium The Nagano Prefecture SDGs Symposium was held at the Hokuto Culture Hall in Nagano City on April 26, 2019. The symposium was organized by Nagano Prefecture and interested groups, including the Nagano Promotion Council for the G20 Ministerial Meeting. The symposium, which was designed to promote broader action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by companies in the prefecture, included an announcement about the creation of an SDG partner registration system in Nagano Prefecture, the unveiling of a logo mark, a keynote address by an academic expert, and stakeholder case studies. Seiko Epson, representing companies in the prefecture, presented specific examples of actions it is taking to achieve the SDGs it is targeting. The presentation was followed by questions and comments from the audience. Seiko Epson also attended the FY2018 Nagano Prefecture Regional SDGs Consortium as an observer and engaged in discussions with prefecture government officials and other companies regarding the SDG partner registration system in Nagano Prefecture. Moving forward, we will contribute to community-building SDGs in cooperation with government and private industry. ESG/SDG Forum (Sasaya Juku) In February 2019, an ESG/SDG Forum (Sasaya Juku) organized by the Business Research Institute was held at Seiko Epson’s Shinjuku Office. The forum provides a platform for increasing corporate value by learning from the most recent social movements and from corporate case studies about environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investment, a topic that is gaining widespread interest, and about the SDGs, which are the universal language of sustainability. Following a lecture session, forum participants toured Seiko Epson’s showroom to see a PaperLab A-8000 dry process office papermaking system and an LX10000F high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printer. Afterwards, they joined in a discussion about contributing to solutions to social problems through business, using Seiko Epson’s activities as an example. Seiko Epson will use feedback from the forum to help shape its future activities. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 30 Building Awareness In-house Lecture on SDGs In November 2018, Seiko Epson hosted a lecture on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for directors, executive managers, and middle managers. Hidemitsu Sasaya, then of Ito En, Ltd., was invited to speak on the topic of using SDGs and creating value in the age of ESG. He addressed the question of why companies are now being asked to work toward SDGs and spoke about the expectations for enterprise. Message from Mr. Sasaya to Epson The SDGs provide a blueprint for creating a sustainable society that will benefit the world, people, and individuals across generations. Epson’s Management Philosophy implies that the company’s business activities should benefit Epson, its customers, and society as a whole. Japanese companies should more actively communicate how their business activities are benefiting society, their customers, and themselves and, as a consequence, contributing to the fulfillment of SDGs. They should assess each of the 17 SDGs in terms of both risks and opportunities. Epson’s PaperLab is achieving many of these goals, among them Goals 6 (water), 7 (energy), 12 (recycling), and 15 (forests). The SDGs provide a common language for reporting on efforts to solve societal problems by stakeholders (e.g., countries, enterprises, associations, and individuals). I would like Epson to help solve these problems and increase corporate value by, first of all, creating a platform for cooperation in SDGs and forging win-win relationships. Comments from Seiko Epson President Minoru Usui Epson is contributing to society and moving to create a better world by executing the strategies outlined in the Epson 25 Corporate Vision. I am confident that Epson’s initiatives and goals are squarely aligned with the global trend toward achieving both social value and economic value and of trying to create a better world over generations. Epson’s actions to drive innovations in inkjet, visual, wearable, and robotics products can genuinely contribute to the SDGs, and we are committed to doing so quickly and as a team. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 31 Introductory Online Course on the SDGs Starting from October 2018, Epson Group employees in Japan were asked to take an online course on the SDGs to deepen their understanding of the topic and to ensure that we contribute to the SDGs through our business activities. They learned that the SDGs are a blueprint for achieving a better and more sustainable world for all, and they deepened their understanding of each of the 17 goals, which were explained one by one, to understand why the SDGs are now necessary. The course was completed by over 90% of the approximately 16,000 employees in Japan. Course-takers commented that the course made them want to consider specific actions they can take on the job to achieve the SDGs, address the challenges as a personal matter, and think about how they can help make the world a better place. Reading Through the 2018 Integrated Report Seiko Epson issued “Epson Integrated Report 2018” in September 2018. The Integrated Report, which covers both financial and non-financial information, is an effective tool not only for external reporting but for informing our own employees about Epson’s initiatives. To deepen employee understanding about the relationship between the SDGs and Epson’s value creation strategies and platforms, employees in Japan were asked to read through Integrated Report 2018 in groups. A total of 8,353 people in 513 groups participated. They gained insights into company policies, the work being done in other divisions and departments, and the relationship between their own jobs and the SDGs. It impressed upon them the necessity of understanding the needs of customers and society and motivated them to try to achieve challenging objectives that only Epson is in a position to achieve. What are Sustainable Development Goals? “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” was adopted in 2015 at the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which was attended by more than 150 world leaders. This agenda is a plan of action for people, planet, and prosperity that includes a declaration and a set of 17 goals and 169 targets for sustainable development. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 32 Participation in External Initiatives Epson seeks to contribute to the achievement of a sustainable society through its business activities and thereby become an indispensable company. For this reason, we endorse and take part in numerous sustainability initiatives. United Nations Global Compact Epson officially joined the United Nations Global Compact on July 16, 2004, when a Letter of Commitment signed by the president of Seiko Epson was sent to and accepted by the Secretary-General of the UN. The letter expressed Seiko Epson’s commitment to the Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. As a member of society, Epson takes an uncompromising approach to socially responsible corporate conduct in areas such as compliance, human rights, environmental action, workforce diversity, and supply chain management. We take these and other social issues seriously and are working toward solutions. We aspire to make Epson an indispensable company through the practice of ethical corporate conduct and by playing a central role in realizing a better world through the products and services we provide.

This is a representative example of Epson’s activities. Epson seeks to meet the expectations of customers from the product design stage. As part of this effort, our design engineers personally visit customers to listen first-hand to their thoughts and needs. They also visit information centers to gather and analyze information on the types of problems customers may be having. Resolving Tank Refill Issues Epson’s high-capacity ink tank printers, first introduced in Indonesia in 2010, were being sold, by 2017, in some 150 markets, both emerging and developed. These printers have earned loyal support from customers who want to print in high volume at low cost. However, we learned by interviewing customers and talking with sales companies that users wanted better protection against ink stains and spills when refilling the tanks. Issue 1 Ink could spill, splash, and stain users’ hands when users removed a protective seal under the bottle cap and tipped the bottle. Action We eliminated the protective seal and replacing it with an airtight bottle cap and a slotted valve near the tip of the nozzle to prevent ink from splashing and dripping. Issue 2 The bottle had to be squeezed about 50 times in the roughly two minutes it took to refill a tank. Action Ink bottles and printer ink tanks were redesigned to enable easy filling of each color. Users simply have to insert a bottle nozzle into an ink tank and wait about 40 seconds for the tank to fill. Filling automatically stops when a tank is full. Ink tank Issue 3 Filling a tank with the wrong color of ink Action The ink bottles have a tip that is uniquely keyed for each color and can only be inserted in a tank of the same color. Ink bottles act like a key that fits only into the keyhole of the correct ink tank Ink bottle Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 37 Innovating Manufacturing with New Force Sensors In creating labels for displaying products to their best advantage, there is a need to be able to design color labels with photographs and text for each product, and print them attractively at high speed, on demand. On learning of this customer requirement, Epson developed the TM-C7500 color label printer. Manufacturers, faced with labor shortages and a need to increase productivity, are rapidly automating their assembly processes with robots. However, there are still many difficult, precision tasks that rely on human sensory perception and skilled workers due to task complexity, the fragility of components, and the need for fine adjustments. Epson is making it possible to automate even these challenging tasks with a new series of S250 robotic force sensors. Force sensors sense the direction and magnitude of force applied to a robot end-effector to precisely control robot movements. Robots that have the ability to sense force can be used to perform tasks that once relied on humans. Epson visited dozens of companies that use its robots to identify customer needs. What we found was that users wanted to automate even some of the most complex and delicate tasks. The majority of force sensors on the market have a flexible component that elastically deforms when a force is applied to an object. Force is measured based on the degree of deformation of this compoThe S250 series of force sensors nent, so the sensor has to readily deform for the sensor to have a practicable level of sensitivity. The problem with sensors that readily deform under light pressure, however, is that the position of the robot end-effector, which is attached forward of the force sensor, becomes unstable. Conversely, sensors that do not readily deform typically have low sensitivity and are unable to accurately measure small forces. For this reason, manufacturers have been unable to automate precision tasks that require high end-effector positional accuracy and the ability to measure very small forces, such as tasks that require fragile components to be inserted in confined spaces. Solving this problem required the development of a new force sensor with conflicting properties: minimal deformation and high sensitivity. Epson used its expertise in crystal devices, which deform very little but can still detect extremely small changes in pressure, to develop the S250 series of force sensors. These force sensors are far more sensitive than other force sensors despite extremely low deformation. The S250 series of force sensors enable robots to perform difficult-to-automate tasks that in the past have always relied on humans. Examples include: High-precision assembly of fragile parts, such as tiny electronic components with bendable pins. Advanced insertion tasks in extremely narrow spaces, such as the insertion of precision components and automotive parts. Deburring, sanding, polishing and other finishing tasks that require delicate force control. Epson was uniquely positioned to develop S250 series of force sensors because it designs and manufactures crystal elements, has material analysis capabilities, and uses robots on its own manufacturing lines. Epson will continue to drive innovation in manufacturing by providing customers with smaller, lighter solutions with enhanced usability that allow users to more easily automate tasks of all kinds. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 38 The TM-C7500 Revolutionizes the Printing Environment In creating labels for displaying products to their best advantage, there is a need to be able to design color labels with photographs and text for each product, and print them attractively at high speed, on demand. On learning of this customer requirement, Epson developed the TM-C7500 color label printer. First, we sought to learn how businesses make and use labels, and ascertained what difficulties they encountered. For example, when making GHS (Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals) for chemical containers, we discovered that customers followed a two-step procedure. First they would ask an external printing contractor to make several varieties of preprinted labels showing the company logo and the red diamond for the picture symbol, in the places designated in the GHS standard. Then, using their own barcode label software, they would print barcodes, product information, and picture symbols for each chemical on the preprinted labels using a monochrome thermal label printer. As a result, we discovered that customers faced the following issues. 1. It was necessary to prepare several varieties of preprinted labels for the different types of chemical. Also, the printing contractors imposed minimum print runs, resulting in inventory management headaches. 2. The cost of disposing of labels that became obsolete through design changes. 3. Printing the barcodes took time.

Write images 1. To achieve color, high speed and high to the TM-C7500/C7500G memory resolution, the printer is equipped with (such as templates and background images) PrecisionCore lineheads with print speeds of up to 300 mm per second. 2. T he internal memory of the printer comes with a stock of images. Equipping the printer with a function for combining this image data with the text and other print information sent from the barcode label software significantly reduces the volume of data sent from the barcode label software. This substantially cuts down the waiting time while data is being sent and read. 3. In order to leverage customers’ existing label printing environments, the printer is equipped with ZPLII commands which are standard in the monochrome thermal label printing environments, and ESC/Label commands including Epson’s proprietary commands for achieving color printing with an inkjet. 4. By working with companies that produce three types of barcode label printing software popular with customers, we incorporated the three types of software in the TM-C7500 native driver to achieve an environment that enables on-demand color label printing without customers having to change their systems. The printer is highly regarded by customers in the healthcare packaging business who have been able to simplify product identification with highly expressive labels through high-resolution color printing with highly water and alcohol resistant pigment inks. They value the ability to cut costs through on-demand printing, reducing use of preprinted labels, as well as reducing the impact on the environment over the product life cycle. Epson will continue to revolutionize the world of label printing by delivering label printing environments that meet wider customer needs. Product Service and Support that Keeps Businesses Running Users of business printer can find their work interrupted if their printer breaks down or if it runs out of consumables. To avoid such work interruptions, sales company Epson Taiwan Technology & Trading Ltd. (ETT) began in 2016 offering business inkjet printer users a package that includes regular on-site service. This is the first service of its kind in Taiwan’s office printing industry. Support staff members with thorough product knowledge visit customer sites to inspect and maintain their printers. They also let customers know when they can expect to run out of ink based on print use patterns. This service has sharply reduced printer breakdowns and ensures stable print quality. And since ETT is able to deliver ink before it runs out, work interruptions are far less frequent. These regular site visits are also an important opportunity to get feedback directly from users. Epson, whose products are used by customers around the world, is increasing customer satisfaction by having local sales companies provide service and support that meets local needs. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 40 Incorporating the Voice of the Customer: Quality Control Improvement in Manufacturing Processes The role of manufacturing processes is to create products that accurately reflect the voice of the customer captured in product plans and designs. In manufacturing processes, we build products that meet specified quality requirements. We specify a lot of quality controls for product components and processes. Quality control engineers are sent to manufacturing sites worldwide to introduce quality improvement activities so that we can strictly manage required controls at the sites and assure quality.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 41 Commitment to Customer Satisfaction Customer Commitment Universal Design Approach to Universal Design Seiko Epson recognizes the importance of providing products and services that reflect universal design principles so that consumers of all ages, genders, nationalities, and abilities and so forth can use them. We try to make our products accessible to the widest possible audience by exercising the utmost care from the development stage to design products that anyone can easily use. Universal Design within Epson Internal Guidelines Epson’s Printing Solutions Operations Division has prepared two sets of written guidelines that describe universal design and color universal design features that must be incorporated into our products and services to help ensure the widest possible product accessibility. We make sure that our products reflect universal design principles by using a process to verify that universal design elements are incorporated in each step of the product commercialization process, from planning and design to manufacturing. Internal Monitor Program Seiko Epson invites employees and members of their families to participate in a monitor program. Registered monitors evaluate product usability and design from an ordinary user’s perspective. In FY2018, we had 366 registered monitors and asked them to evaluate 10 products prior to release, including printers, projectors, and wearables, to identify things such as product operability, visibility, and receptiveness. Some of Epson’s Universal Design Features To enable anyone anywhere to operate our products, we decide the configuration of operating panels as well as dimensions, colors, textures, and markings based on data about usage environments and usage applications.

During the month, we review and improve our business processes from a customer satisfaction and quality standpoint. In FY2018, we used the month as an opportunity to revisit the QC approach, which is the basis for carrying out work logically, and think about increasing the quality of work. One of the events for CS & Quality Month was a talk given by SEC officers. They spoke about user requirements, the market, and the operating environment. The talk, which included numerous specific examples, helped raise awareness of the importance of both customer satisfaction and quality. A large number of employees listened to the talk, both in the main hall and at each of the 15 sites to which it was broadcast. An online training for Epson Group employees was also offered in Japan and completed by 96% of employees. In addition to the talk and the online training, each of our sites and global manufacturing affiliates carried out their own events. We use events like these to help shape our products and services to the needs of our customers. CS & Quality Month posters Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 49 Commitment to Customer Satisfaction Customer Commitment Product Safety Initiatives Approach to Product Safety Epson has established unified Epson Group regulations governing quality assurance and product safety management to help ensure that it offers the same product quality to customers around the world. Our product safety and environmental compliance requirements are set forth in the Epson Quality Standard (EQS), a set of unified standards implemented across the entire Epson Group. EQS specifies independent controls that we widely implement to meet or exceed legal and regulatory requirements in each country. Epson painstakingly evaluates product safety in every area and from all angles to prevent product incidents and provide our customers with safe, secure products.

Analyses to Prevent Product Incidents Electronic components procured for use in Epson products, and especially those that are crucial in terms of safety, are evaluated and analyzed to judge their quality, safety and reliability. Epson uses analytic techniques learned and honed over the years to analyze in-market safety incidents and determine root cause. The lessons learned are shared throughout the Epson Group to prevent recurrence of similar incidents. Epson has set up a combustion laboratory that enables it to conduct tests that cannot be performed in ordinary laboratories, such as tests that use Burning test at combustion laboratory flames or could cause parts or products to ignite, emit smoke, or rupture. In this lab Epson analyzes the causes of incidents and researches combustion-resistant structures and materials. We use the findings from these and other tests and studies to develop standards for creating safe, secure products, therefore seeking to prevent product-related incidents. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 50 Safety Evaluations on Substances Released by Products Products can sometimes release trace amounts of chemical substances during use. Epson goes beyond simply evaluating releases of controlled substances specified under the requirements for environmental labels such as Japan’s Eco Mark and Germany’s Blue Angel*1, and also evaluates the level and safety of substances for which the Japanese Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry has issued indoor concentration guideline values*2. An in-house laboratory enables us to swiftly feed the findings from these evaluations back into our products. Epson seeks to deliver safe, secure printers, projectors, and other products by verifying that releases from these products meet Epson’s strict, independent standards that exceed the rigorousness of the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry’s indoor concentration guideline values. Measurement of substances released by products *1 Blue Angel, introduced in Germany in 1978, is the world’s first environmental label. *2 Indoor concentration guideline values are the levels of airborne chemical substances that are considered to be unlikely to have harmful personal health effects even if persons take in throughout life the substances at the indicated concentrations. Product Information Security Initiatives Once reserved for laser, business inkjet, and other office printers, network connectivity is now routinely provided with home inkjet printers and other consumer devices, which can be accessed via wireless LANs, smartphones, tablets, and other Wi-Fi-capable equipment. Network connectivity is a great convenience, but it also exposes users to security risks, such as cyber-attacks that could lead to the destruction of data or the theft of confidential information by persons or organizations who exploit network device software vulnerabilities*3. To ensure the security of Epson products, Epson evaluates the vulnerability of embedded software, printer drivers, and other software based on information security requirements included in the Epson Quality Standard (EQS). Requirements for web services such as Epson Email Print were also included in the EQS, in 2012. *3 S  oftware vulnerabilities are system flaws or design problems that hackers or other cyber-criminals can use to hijack a computer, network, or other information system or to steal or alter confidential information. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 51 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Environmental Vision 2050 Environmental Vision 2050 In 2008, Epson established Environmental Vision 2050, a statement of our environmental goals out to the year 2050. We began working on initiatives to achieve these goals, but the landscape has changed significantly over the ensuing ten years. Externally, global efforts to achieve sustainability are accelerating, with the United Nations adopting Sustainable Development Goals (SDG*1) and the Paris Agreement*2 charting a course toward a low-carbon society. In line with this, enterprises are being encouraged to change the way they behave to satisfy the new norms and goals. Internally, Epson has been repositioning itself to take better advantage of its strengths. We have divested ourselves of the small-to-mid size liquid crystal display and optical businesses and have been accelerating a shift away from consumer segments and toward the office, commercial, and industrial segments in search of growth. The environmental impacts and needs in these segments are much different from those of the consumer segment. These internal and external changes have forced us to reconsider our long-term policies and revise our environmental vision. *1 International goals for a sustainable society adopted at the U.N. Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015, aimed at global issues such as climate change, poverty, and human rights. There are 17 sustainable development goals with 169 targets. *2 International framework to combat the problem of climate change. The central aim of the agreement is to keep a rise in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Environmental Vision 2050 Epson's vision is to become an indispensable company that uses its eﬃcient, compact and precision technologies to achieve sustainability in a circular economy. Actions ● Reduce the environmental impacts of our manufacturing processes, products and services. ● Advance the frontiers of industry and establish recycling systems through open and unique innovation. ● Contribute to international environmental initiatives. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 52 Environmental Vision 2050 and Mid-Term Targets Approach for Achieving Our Vision by 2050 Global action is needed to achieve sustainability, as the contribution that any one company can make by reducing the environmental impacts of its business activities is limited. Environmental Vision 2050 articulates actions for creating synergies with business partners based on our technologies, products, and services and for allowing us to play a part in creating a better world. To achieve Environmental Vision 2050, we have been setting mid-term milestone targets, while steadily working to bridge the gap needed to reach them. The Epson 25 Corporate Vision, a statement of how we want the company to be in 2025, specifies goals that we arrived at by backcasting*1 from our 2050 goals. We will use our efficient, compact and precision technologies in tandem with various initiatives to improve the environment performance of our products and business activities and to reduce environmental impacts across the value chain. By offering products and services that enable new business processes, we aim to provide outstanding customer value in both economic and environmental terms. *1 A planning technique in which a desired outcome or goal is envisioned and planned before the scenario for achieving the outcome or goal is devised.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 55 Reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions The 2015 Paris Agreement set a goal of keeping the increase in average global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Epson has set targets for reducing GHG emissions in the value chain to achieve this 2°C goal as well as the goals of Epson 25. Epson’s targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative as being consistent with climate change science. GHG reduction targets Scope 1 Reduce scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 19% by the FY2025. Scope 2 Reduce scope 3 (categories 1 and 11)*1 GHG emissions as a percentage of value added (business profit) by 44% by the FY2025. Scope 3 *1 Category 1: Purchased goods and services Category 11: Use of sold products Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions from the use of fuels, etc. Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from purchased energy, etc. Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions of the entire value chain Epson’s Science Based Targets (SBTs) Epson has set FY2025 targets for reducing direct emissions associated with its business activities (scopes 1 and 2 emissions) and for reducing indirect emissions (scope 3 emissions). To achieve these SBTs, we are working in concert with our customers and partners to provide eco-conscious products and services that will both drive business growth and increase corporate value. Initiatives to Reduce Scopes 1 and 2 Emissions Epson has launched an Epson Group-wide SBT project under which each business has selected full-time energy conservationists. Actions to reduce emissions are being explored at model sites and then shared with others to increase the likelihood that targets will be achieved. Main actions for reducing emissions • Production innovations • Investment in updated facilities and equipment such as plant infrastructure, scrubbers, and solar power systems • Purchasing low-carbon electricity and using other forms of renewable energy • Other reductions to be achieved by power utilities reducing their GHG emissions factors Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 56 Renewable Energy Use Epson expects its energy use to increase as production increases in line with its long-term growth strategy. Therefore, all Epson sites and businesses are implementing energy-saving measures and increasing the use of renewable energy to achieve our SBT. In 2018, Epson decided to expand its use of renewable energy by purchasing low-carbon electricity for a new factory in Japan that is involved in the production of PrecisionCore printheads, the core device at the heart of inkjet printers. We were able to increase the rate of renewable energy use in FY2018 to approximately 12% and make progress in reducing the Epson Group’s total scope 2 emissions. We achieve this primarily by entering into long-term contracts for the purchase of low-carbon electricity and by generating power on-site at our plants overseas. Carbon Pricing Carbon pricing, an instrument that captures the costs of GHG emissions across society, is seen as a way to spur action and innovation in support of lower carbon emissions. In FY2018, Epson began trial use of an investment decision-making scheme that incorporates a carbon pricing approach. Based on the information from this scheme, we made a business decision to expand the use of low-carbon electricity. The issues that lie ahead involve building an organization-wide process for making decisions on investments to address climate-related problems, quantifying the performance of each operations division, and creating a scheme for incentivizing the implementation of decarbonizing measures. Reducing Scope 3 Emissions Intensity Contributing to the environment through products and services is cited as one of the most important of Epson’s key CSR themes. Category 11 emissions (emissions from the use of sold products) represent the largest source of Epson’s scope 3 emissions, followed by category 1 emissions (emissions from the production of products purchased or acquired). Under the Epson 25 Corporate Vision, we are seeking to provide environmental value and mitigate environmental impacts along with our customers. In each product category, we set targets (metrics) that are linked to product value. Ultimately, we have an ambitious goal of reducing scope 3 emissions per unit of value added that is linked to a management performance indicator. Environmental Contributions Epson’s inkjet technology saves resources. Our printers, which do not use heat to print, draw comparatively little electricity while consumables and limited lifetime parts require only infrequent replacement. Using Epson inkjets instead of laser printers can cut users’ electricity consumption and reduce the environmental impacts of society as a whole. Epson calculated the contribution of business inkjet printers to avoided emissions in FY2018 to be 8,909 t-CO2e.*1 In FY2018, the Ministry of the Environment issued a call for case study presentations from manufacturers of products that avoid downstream carbon emissions. Epson answered the call and presented estimates of avoided emissions for projectors, which are Epson’s main source of category 11 emissions. We also introduced internal programs that encourage reduction initiatives and promoted the concept of avoided emissions by using business inkjet printers as an example. The expert who critiqued the presentation lauded these initiatives as progressive and agreed that popularizing products that reduce or avoid emissions is a valid and effective way to reduce emissions in society as a whole. Moving forward, we will broaden the scope of avoided emissions calculations, upgrade the energy efficiency, resource efficiency, and overall environmental performance of our products, and contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of society as a whole. *1  stimate of GHG emissions avoided by third parties: The emissions avoided by replacing laser printers with Epson inkjet printers are calculated based on electricity use (flow E base approach).

WorkForce Enterprise Adding New Value to Paper Contributes to a Circulating Society The PaperLab A-8000, the world’s first dry-process office papermaking system*1, makes new paper from old right on-site. Epson’s unique dry fiber technology represents a breakthrough in paper recycling. It enables scrap paper to be reused not only in new paper production but also in the production of a variety of other pulp-based products. The PaperLab A-8000 was awarded the Minister’s Prize, The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, at the first EcoPro Awards ceremony (formerly called the Eco-Products Awards) sponsored by the Japan Environmental Management Association for Industry (JEMAI). In addition to outstanding and innovative paper recycling technology, the PaperLab was recognized for its use in producing environmental education materials, for its use as a symbol of environmental measures, and for helping to raise awareness about resource circulation. *1 Based on a November 2016 Epson study of the office paper recycling market 1st EcoPro Awards Minister’s Prize, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry PaperLab A-8000 Dry-process office papermaking system Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 68 Preservation of Water Resources An ordinary paper recycling process uses about a cup of water to produce a single A4 sized sheet of paper. In contrast, the A-8000 uses only a small fraction of this to maintain humidity within the system, thus helping to conserve precious water resources. Effective Use of Forest Resources Paper is produced from wood taken from the forests, and while efforts have been made to conserve this resource by producing cardboard from recycled paper, the A-8000 produces new copy paper from used documents right in the office. Also, any paper produced by the A-8000 may be marked with the eco-label established by the 3R Promotion Forum Japan. Awareness-Raising The A-8000 reproduces paper on the spot–a fresh surprise that can raise the environmental awareness of your staff and spawn further environmental action. Children who have had the opportunity to see paper recycled come away with insights and greater concern for the environment, as well as a desire to solve environmental issues with science. Internal Case Study Epson uses the A-8000 extensively to recycle and reproduce paper used on its own sites. Since 2018, this recycled paper has been used to produce all orientation training materials for new employees. It is being used for calendars and employee business cards. This paper is also used for notebooks and memo pads, and we plan to further expand uses in the near future. The production of paper and paper-based goods has expanded the range of job opportunities for the staff of Epson Mizube Corp., a special subsidiary that supports the employment of persons with disabilities and is involved in these activities. Calendars made using recycled paper Epson also uses a machine that employs dry fiber technology to upcycle recovered paper into waste-ink pads for inkjet printers and sound absorbing materials for the A-8000. Waste ink pads for inkjet printers (maintenance box) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 69 User Comment Beyond direct benefits: raise children’s awareness of the environment The city government of Shiojiri decided to install a PaperLab after examining the potential environmental, security, and job creation benefits. We saw that we could promote environmental conservation through local recycling of used paper without stressing water resources. We saw that we could strengthen security by destroying sensitive information on-site. And we saw that we could develop employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. I personally feel that the biggest benefit is that the PaperLab can inspire children. For a resource-poor country like Japan, the development of highproductivity industries is important for the national identity. So, I think it is critical to instill Toshiyuki Oguchi Mayor in children a sense of awe and excitement about technology and learning. Shiojiri, Nagano A tangible benefit of installing PaperLab is its productivity: We are producing, on average, 18,000 new sheets of paper per month from locally recovered paper and use them to make application forms etc. This has enabled us to reduce the amount of waste paper transported off-site for disposal by 20%. Eco Features PaperLab A-8000 is an office papermaking system that recycles paper right on site using a dry process. • The dry fiber technology used by the A-8000 represents a breakthrough in paper recycling that contributes to the conservation of water resources. • “Paper to paper” recycling, where fresh sheets of copy paper are produced from used paper PaperLab A-8000 generated on-site, is an effective way to conserve forests. • The ability to recycle at the office reduces the volume of paper that must be transported to off-site recyclers.

An Inkjet Workflow for Brightly Colored Garments with Fineness of Detail There is a growing market for the printing of original images on T-shirts, polo shirts, tote bags and other cotton products. We are answering the needs of this market with advanced inkjet printing technology that renders images in vivid colors and intricate, faithful detail with low environmental impacts. Garment Printer SureColor SC-F2100 Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 76 Transforming the Garment Printing Workflow Traditional silk-screen printing requires extensive preparation, including the production of screens and the mixing of ink, as well as maintenance. For photos and other multicolored prints with gradations, the print process is long, and the longer the process, the more energy, water, materials, and other resources are used. Digital prints produced with a SureColor SC-F2100 print digital data from a PC directly onto T-shirts and other garments. So, not only is there no need for screens or plates but images and photos can be reproduced with smooth gradations and in full color. The SureColor SC-F2100 shortens the garment printing workflow. Moreover, the inkjet process saves resources and is more environmentally conscious than analog processes because there are no films, screens, or plates to produce, wash, or store.

Epson’s Type II Environmental Labelling Program Our program is used to provide environmental information about products that is both transparent and reliable, in accordance with the ISO 14021 (JIS Q 14021) standard. We have implemented programs for both eco labels and ecology profiles. Eco Labels The Epson Group started preparing to use eco labels from December 2009 to communicate the environmental features of its products and services to customers in a simple and straightforward way. The labels are displayed on communication tools such as brochures, product catalogs, and individual product boxes. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 97 Epson Ecology Profiles The environmental attributes of Epson brand products are published in the form of an “ecology profile.” For finished products such as printers and scanners, the environmental attributes of the product as a whole, including but not limited to accompanying packaging material, supplies, and consumables, are published in the format specified by ECMA-370*1. For electronic devices we use our own format to provide quantitative data regarding substances included in these products. *1  CMA-370 specified requirements for environmental declarations established by the international standards organization ECMA International. “The Eco Declaration” is often E abbreviated as “TED.” Safety Data Sheets for Printer Consumables To enable customers to safely and properly use Epson products, including consumable printer supplies (ink cartridges, toner cartridges, ribbon cartridges, etc.), Epson provides Safety Data Sheets (SDS), which describe a product’s chemical content as well as how to operate, handle, and store the product. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 98 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Climate Change/Realizing a Decarbonized Society Epson is combating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions in production (scopes 1 and 2) and across its value chain (scope 3) to help drive a transformation toward a decarbonized future, as envisioned by the Paris Agreement. Epson also contributes to society by developing energy saving products and further developing inkjet technology. Production Epson’s initiatives to mitigate global warming revolve around reducing CO2 emissions by conserving energy, and reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) other than CO2. We set an SBTi-validated target of reducing scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 19% compared to FY2017 by 2025. In FY2018, we made progress toward this target by achieving a 15% reduction in GHG emissions through energy-saving initiatives at each of our sites. A reduction of approximately 63,000 tonnes, representing 70% of the total, was realized in part by signing long-term contracts to purchase renewable energy from hydroelectric power generators and other green utilities. We have raised the rate of renewable energy use from less than 1% to approximately 12%. Our energy use is expected to increase as we grow our business. However, we will achieve our target primarily through energy-saving initiatives, including production innovations, as well as by using low-carbon electricity.

However, it is indirect emissions that occur in the value chain (scope 3 emissions) that account for the vast majority of Epson’s GHG emissions. The lion’s share of scope 3 emissions are emissions during the use of our products (category 11: use of sold products) and emissions associated with the procurement of raw materials (category 1: purchased goods and services). Therefore, Epson has incorporated these two categories in its SBT (science-based target). As the company grows, emissions are expected to increase. Therefore, to ensure that these indicators are useful, we are focusing on reducing emissions as a percentage of business profit as we work to achieve growth and increase corporate value.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 101 Case study Transport Epson has manufacturing sites and sales centers in all parts of the world making environmentally-conscious transportation an important consideration. Here we present examples of such environmentally-conscious transportation initiatives in which we introduced high cube containers*1 and changed our shipping method. *1 With a height of 9 ft 6 in (about 2.6 m), they are 1 ft (about 30 cm) taller than standard containers, whose height is 8 feet 6 inches (about 2.3 m). Topic 1: Improving Transport Efficiency with High Cube Containers Currently, high cube containers account for about 70% of shipping containers in the marketplace. Hitherto, Epson has used the standard type of container for shipping products from its factories, but with the widespread adoption of high cube containers, we are gradually making the switch. Since the inner dimensions of the containers are higher, palletizing products for standard containers resulted in wasted space amounting to about 10%. Optimizing the pallets for high cube containers reduces the number of containers required, contributing to reducing environmental impact by raising transportation efficiency. Says Koyuru Naito, in charge of logistics planning, who led the initiative, “All of our arrangements including the number of products shipped and the height of the pallet racks in our warehouses were optimized for pallet sizes to fit standard containers. In order to introduce high cube containers, it was necessary to ask for the cooperation of the warehouse managers at sales companies who receive the containers. We had to ask them to review the layout of their warehouses, optimize the method of stacking and so on. We had a very hard time adjusting the cost factors, but a shared awareness that this would reduce our environmental impact was a very important point in undertaking this activity.” Koyuru Naito For shipments from Southeast Asia, where many of Epson’s finished products are manufactured, the switch to high cube containers for all areas of Europe was completed in fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2015 for the U.S., Brazil and India.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 103 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Resources/Forming a Circular Economy To contribute to the formation of a circular economy in which waste is minimized, Epson is working to reduce emissions and preserve water resources in its production processes. Epson is also promoting the efficient use of limited resources by making products smaller and lighter, by collecting and recycling end-of-life products, and by developing digital inkjet printing solutions. Reduction of Waste (zero emissions) Epson is working toward zero emissions by reducing generated business waste and recycling. Wastes are generated in our production processes, offices, and operations. Wherever possible, we reduce, reuse, and recycle these wastes on-site. Plastic runners from molding processes are recycled, for example. The remaining wastes, including valuable wastes, are recycled by a contractor. We carefully sort and separate wastes and select the best available recycling methods and contractors for each type. We will continue to reduce wastes and to work for general improvement in waste processing methods, including by allying with recyclers. To help combat pollution from oceanic plastic wastes, Epson sales companies in Europe banned disposable cups and other single-use plastics in their office buildings in April 2019. In the FY2018 we employed control metrics benchmarked against previous year emissions, and we met our Group reduction target. 1.4% Waste Emissions Reduction (thousand t) (t/100 mil. yen) Per unit of business profit Wastes emissions (compared to FY2017) 50 47 48 50 46 40 40 33 34 34 Waste (overseas) 30 31 30 28 Waste (Japan) 30 30 Recycled (overseas) 20 20 10 10 Recycled (Japan) 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) * Waste emissions data includes special wastes that cannot be recycled and wastes that are unrelated to production. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 104 Case study Reduction of Waste Topic 1: Making Printer Parts from Used Paper Epson has established an internal paper resource cycle that uses paper used inside the company as a raw material. For example, we use our dry fiber technology to turn used paper into a raw material for functional recycled parts. PT. Indonesia Epson Industry (IEI) is our largest printer manufacturing site. Some 12% of the waste created at IEI is paper used in printing inspection processes for printers. We have introduced dry fiber technology to take this used paper and reuse it as raw material for porous pads in printers. The result is a roughly 25% reduction in used paper waste (FY2016 results). Porous pad production machine Porous pads, which absorb liquid like a sponge, are included in the maintenance boxes of business inkjet printers and large format printers to boost printer performance. Epson will continue to bring out the potential of paper resources as we develop and take advantage of new high-function parts that enhance product performance. Maintenance box Preservation of Water Resources Water and climate change, as well as other environmental factors, are closely linked. Epson’s business activities rely on water resources, and the sustainability of water resources substantially affects business continuity. Given this, we are working to preserve water resources by avoiding unnecessary contamination and use, and by recycling the water we do use. We actively strive to increase the rate of industrial wastewater that is recycled in our production processes and to meet strict water quality standards. We are also mitigating our overall environmental impacts, including by introducing more energy efficient water processing facilities. Our efforts extend beyond the water used in our production processes. We ensure that all employees have access to safe drinking water, as well as sanitary kitchens and restroom facilities. Moreover, we make our employees aware of the importance of saving water and preventing water pollution, and we install water-saving fixtures and sanitation facilities. We fell short of our goal of reducing the amount of water used compared to last year, as the 8,351 thousand m3 of water used in FY2018 was slightly higher than in FY2017. 0.3% Water Usage Increased (thousand m³) Per unit of business profit (thousand m³/100 mil. yen) Water usage 12.0 11.9 (compared to FY2017) 10,000 12 11.1 8,324 8,351 8,000 7,717 7,906 10 7,577 9.1 Overseas 7.5 8 6,000 6 4,000 4 Japan 2,000 2 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 105 Recycled Water (thousand m³) (%) Recycled Ratio 2,000 19 19 19 20 18 17 1,504 1,526 1,548 1,500 1,441 15 1,344 1,000 10 500 5 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) Addressing Water Related Risk The water-related risks of Epson’s production sites were assessed using two global standard tools for water risk assessments: Aqueduct, developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), and Water Risk Filter, developed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). These tools assess water primarily from a perspective of physical quantity of water resources and water pollution risks. The results of the assessments showed that no Epson site qualifies for the highest risk level per the overall risk indicators. However, it was found that some of Epson’s production sites in China and Southeast Asia are located in water stressed areas. Moving forward, Epson will continue to act to reduce its water usage and explore water risk assessment methodologies in basins at actual sites.

To comply with the European WEEE directive, Epson is building recycling systems in each country. Moreover, Epson implements environmentally-conscious design in response to the WEEE directive 2012, that requires manufacturers to increase recyclability of products. Epson also acts quickly to comply with similar legislation that is expected to be adopted in EMEA*1 nations that are not EU member states. *1 Europe, the Middle East and Africa Cartridges Epson Europe B.V. (EEB) is building a collection and recycling system for cartridges while monitoring customer needs and legislative trends. In 2013, EEB rebuilt the system to provide customers with more collection options and to increase recycling efficiency. • Postal Collections Customers request empty pre-printed envelopes, and return filled envelopes via post for consumer inkjet and LabelWorks cartridges. Customers simply request and attach a return label, and return up to ten cartridges in a package. • Epson Express Center Customers return consumer inkjet, laser printer, and LabelWorks cartridges to the nearest Epson Express Center. • Box Collections After customers go online and sign up to the program they receive a collection box for large format printer and laser printer (more than 10) cartridges. When the box is full, it will be collected by the recycling company. Americas Finished Products In Canada and the United States, some states are seeking to introduce laws requiring manufacturers to collect and recycle products. In the U.S., Epson America, Inc. (EAI) has run a voluntary take back program since 2002. In addition to the recycling program, EAI and the National Cristina Foundation have joined together with the goal of helping those who are facing economic challenges or have disabilities gain access to the technology of today. In Brazil, the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) was launched in 2010, requiring the electronics industry to implement reverse logistics. Epson do Brasil Industria e Comercio, Ltda. (EDB) implemented a Collection Program for disposing of used products and consumables. The Collection Program operates throughout Brazil, with more than 100 collection points countrywide. Products and supplies collected are sent to an approved recycler who disassembles and then sends the item to recycling and/or co-processing*1 as required. *1 Use of waste to replace new resources and fossil fuels. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 108 Cartridges In the U.S. and Canada, EAI has created a mail-based recycling program for ink cartridges. In the U.S., customers can return toner cartridges by attaching an electronic return label printed from a website. Asia Finished Products In India, Epson India Pvt. Ltd. works on promoting recycling program by making an original logo under the India e-waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2011 Directives. In Taiwan, Epson Taiwan Technology & Trading Ltd. complies with the Resource Recycling Act. In South Korea, Epson Korea Co., Ltd. (EKL) is a member of KERC (Korea Electronics Recycling Cooperative) and complies with the Act on the Resource Circulation of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Vehicles. Cartridges In Taiwan, Epson Taiwan Technology & Trading Ltd. set up a system in 2001 using a toll-free number and a website to accept collection requests directly from customers to facilitate on the-spot collection. In Singapore in 2012, Epson Singapore Pte. Ltd. joined with Canon Inc. to cooperate with the Singapore National Environment Agency and National Library Board to begin promoting The Homecoming Project to collect ink and toner cartridges. Under the program, consumers can deposit ink and toner cartridges from any manufacturer in collection boxes installed in 21 branches of the national library. Oceania Finished Products Epson Australia Pty. Limited. (EAL) is a founding member of the TechCollect Program. The program is one of three government approved co-regulatory arrangements for implementation of the Federal Government’s Product Stewardship Act 2011, which began in 2012. Cartridges EAL participates in the Cartridges 4 Planet Ark program. EAL is a founding member of this promotion to recycle ink cartridges and toner cartridges. The aim of the program is to prevent cartridges from entering the waste stream and thereby reduce the potential environmental impact arising from the end of life disposal of cartridges. Japan Finished Products Since 2003 Japan has legally required producers to collect and recycle unwanted computers from individuals and as businesses. In 1999, Epson launched a voluntary program to collect and recycle other Epson-brand waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) also, such as printers, scanners, and projectors, from businesses ahead of the enforcement of applicable laws. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 109 Cartridges Epson has built various cartridge collection schemes while monitoring customer needs. In addition to being good for the environment, Epson’s cartridge recycling program provides employment to persons with disabilities at Epson Mizube Corporation, a special subsidiary to support the employment of disabled individuals within the Epson Group. • Take-Back Service Epson has set up a collection service for customers who consume large numbers of cartridges. As part of this service Epson makes donations to OISCA*1 and NACS-J*2, organizations that work on environmentally sustainable development. *1 The Organization for Industrial Spiritual and ultural Advancement-International. *2 The Nature Conservation Society of Japan. • Bellmark Program Epson has participated in the Bellmark program since 2005. In addition to reducing wastes and helping to preserve the environment, the Bellmark program supports participating schools by awarding them points for ink cartridges collected. Schools use these points to purchase educational materials and equipment. • Cartridge Collection Program at Epson Sites in Japan Epson began collecting used ink cartridges at Epson Group sites in Japan in 2011 in order to expand aid to the Bellmark program. Collection boxes have been installed at every Epson business site to collect cartridges from employees, business partners, and members of the community. The collected cartridges are recycled and Bellmark points are granted based on the number of cartridges collected. The points are then donated to the Bellmark Educational Support Foundation, local schools, or schools that were damaged by natural disasters. • Ink Cartridge Satogaeri (Homecoming) Project Printer manufacturers in Japan joined forces in 2008 to form the Ink Cartridge Satogaeri (Homecoming) Project, a program that uses approximately 3,600 post offices and local governments across Japan to collect used ink cartridges. The project has donated to environmental protection organizations, allowing customers to indirectly participate in social contribution activities. Collection box • Joint Environmental Program In April 2012, Epson and Catalina Marketing Corporation launched an environmental program where used ink cartridges from coupon printers are collected and refilled. Under the program, Epson collects used ink cartridges from nearly 30,000 inkjet coupon printers installed in retail stores across Japan. Epson then refurbishes and refills the cartridges for reuse at the stores. Except for the label, almost all parts of the cartridge are reused and product quality is managed just as it is for new cartridges. Eco Benefits Life cycle environmental impacts per cartridge reduced by 56% CO2 emissions reduced by 39.5 tons per year * Calculated under Epson’s test conditions. Compared with when users dispose of new ink cartridges after use. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 110 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Pollution Prevention & Chemical Management To minimize the effects we have on the ecosystem and human life, Epson is working to control substances of concern in products, manage chemicals used in production processes, and manage environmental risks. Epson also emphasizes communication with stakeholders. Management of Chemical Substances in Products Epson gives preference to lower-impact alternatives when selecting the components and raw materials that make up its products. Management of Chemical Substances in Products Increasing international restrictions on substances used in products, notably the RoHS Directive and REACH regulation in Europe, have made it essential to closely control the type and quantity of materials used. Epson systematically controls product substance content at the purchasing, production, and shipping stages to ensure compliance with these restrictions. • Instruct suppliers to comply with the requirements stated in the Epson Group Green Purchasing Standard for Production Materials*1 • E xclude substances that are subject to legal, regulatory, or other restrictions, and obtain information about substances contained in parts and materials. • C onfirm that no restricted substances are present in parts and materials before producing products. (Analyze parts and materials using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer.) • Confirm that restricted substances have not been used in products before they are shipped. *1  written standard that sets forth requirements for the building and maintenance of a substance control system by suppliers who provide parts and materials used in Epson A products. The standard also defines requirements relating to the elimination or exclusion of legally restricted substances and requirements for providing information on substances present in parts and materials. Examples of Management of Chemical Substances in Products Legal and Regulatory Compliance More and more nations are regulating chemicals. We investigate regulations and chemical hazards as early as possible by using such as an industry standard survey tools, analyze the information we obtain, and then supply products accordingly. --Measures for Meeting the RoHS Directive*2 Epson has made compatibility with the European RoHS directive a standard feature of its entire lineup of products throughout the world, regardless of whether a particular product is bound for the European market or not. *2 The European RoHS Directive restricts the use of the following 10 hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment: lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE), phthalates DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 111 --Actions for REACH Compliance European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals) regulations require that we register the import and production of chemical substances and that we communicate and report when products contain harmful substances (e.g., substances of high concern). We make information on the chemicals used such as in ink available to customers at all times in the form of safety data sheets (SDS) published in 24 European languages on our European sales companies’ websites. We are also responding to countries and areas besides Europe, to similarly meet our legal and societal obligations, as well as the needs of our customers. --Response to GHS *1 The United Nations declared in 2003 that a globally harmonized set of rules was needed to inform consumers and dealers about the hazards and appropriate handling of chemicals. Different nations and regions have enshrined these rules as law and made them obligatory at different times. Epson has continued to respond to the rules as they primarily apply to ink cartridges and toner cartridges. *1 G  HS (the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals) provides a unified, worldwide set of rules on harmful chemical substances. It harmonizes classification standards and labels for the hazards associated with individual chemicals and the way safety data sheets are written. Providing Ink for All Types of Printed Matter We provide inks with safe chemical properties as required for products made with inkjet technology (labels, stickers, fabric, etc.). --The Highest Level of Textile Product Safety Eco Passport *2 certification Epson’s textile printer inks*3 have acquired Eco Passport certification, indicating that they meet international safety standards for chemical substances used in textile production. Even printed textiles that directly contact the skin of infants and toddlers are safe. *2 E  co Passport by Oeko-Tex® is a system by which textile chemical suppliers demonstrate that their products can be used in sustainable textile production. *3 UltraChrome DS inks for textile printers, UltraChrome DG inks and dedicated fabric processing agents for garment printers, digital textile printer inks.

Sample of food packages Switching to Safer Materials (e.g. Eliminating Harmful Substances) Epson standards specify substances that are prohibited from inclusion in products, and substances whose inclusion must be controlled. Information on these substances is collected and managed in a database. This database is used to ensure safety in all processes, from design and procurement to volume production. Epson is proactive in eliminating from its products substances that could adversely affect the environment or human health. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 113 Production Epson uses its “E-Chem” chemical data management system to centrally track information on chemical substances used at Epson sites around the world. We are engaged in ongoing efforts to reduce the quantities of chemicals used and to moderate emissions of pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR) substances and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Using previous year emissions as a benchmark, all Epson business units managed and met their FY2018 targets for reducing emissions. Amid increasingly strict environmental regulations and government guidance, our production sites in China are controlling emissions by using scrubbers to remove harmful materials from exhaust gases before they are released into the atmosphere. In addition, we are building trust relationships by making our substance data available and by creating opportunities to exchange opinions with members of the local community. 43% Reduction PRTR Substance Emissions (t) (kg/100 mil. yen) PRTR substance emission Per unit of business profit (compared to FY2017) 20 15 13.4 15 10 7.8 7.7 10 6.8 8.8 6.9 6.6 4.6 5 5.7 5 3.3 Overseas 0 Japan 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 （FY） 8.8% Reduction VOC Emissions (t) Per unit of business profit (t/100 mil. yen) VOC emission 0.30 (compared to FY2017) 300 0.3 0.25 0.23 0.24 200 192 197 0.2 0.18 184 168 184 Overseas 100 0.1 Japan 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 (FY) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 114 Environmental Risk Management Any environmental pollution resulting from Epson’s business activities could have a serious impact on residents of the surrounding area, as well as for the rest of the region or country. We follow Group-wide standards for pollution control and ensure that all members are well acquainted with the ideas and laws of environmental risk management. Each promotion unit uses ISO 14001 to identify and assess the risk of failing to meet standards or of experiencing environmental complaints or incidents in an ongoing effort to continuously mitigate those risks. Epson did not incur any regulatory violations and administrative penalties in FY2018, nor did it incur any large fines (fines exceeding US$10,000), claims, or accidents. Environmental due diligence We investigate the environmental aspects prior to acquiring new businesses and land through M&As as part of due diligence. We investigate all sites, and not only manufacturing sites, to confirm whether there are any problems involving things such as soil and groundwater pollution and hazardous wastes prior to entering into new contractual agreements. Soil and Groundwater Remediation Epson is pumping and treating groundwater contaminated by chlorinated organic solvents at several sites in Japan, including at its Head Office. In addition, we have barriers in place to prevent further contamination. The concentration of trichlorethylene in groundwater is under long-term management and is moving toward compliance with environmental standards.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 115 Drainage Management Epson’s Chitose Plant is located upstream from Lake Utonai, which has been designated as a national wildlife protection area and a Ramsar Site. Wastewater generated in manufacturing processes is detoxified and then discharged into sewers. To prevent leaked chemicals and other substances from leaking offsite, rainwater is collected in a retention basin to monitor the pH and oil levels before flowing into Lake Chitose and Lake Utonai via the Bibigawa River. All chemicals, waste materials, and wastewater treatment systems are located indoors to prevent them from leaking off the site. Waste Management Epson’s internal policy specifies that wastes must be processed in the country in which they originate. We do not directly import or export any wastes, including hazardous wastes specified under the Basel Convention. However, we employ subcontractors who satisfy the requirements of the Basel Convention to process fluorescent lamps, etc., that originate in countries and regions where it is difficult to process them domestically. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 116 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Biodiversity Conservation We both benefit from and affect biodiversity in myriad ways.

The district is part of the Feitsui Dam water preserve, but in recent years, large-scale tea cultivators in this region have become over-reliant on agrochemicals. These agrochemicals are contaminating the land and water and are threatening the survival of local wildlife. To protect the Taiwan blue magpie, which is registered as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Ver. 3.1), some local tea growers have been focusing on organic cultivation. However, these organic growers, who cannot use any agrochemicals and who have to pick the leaves entirely by hand, have seen their harvests cut nearly in half. Currently only about 10% of the tea gardens in Pinglin are organic. In 2017, Epson Taiwan Technology & Trading Ltd. (ETT), along with a number of major companies, became active as a corporate sponsor in a program to help preserve wildlife in the Feitsui watershed. As part of the program, 70 ETT employees and family members dress up in the traditional costumes of tea leave pickers and go out to organic tea gardens three times a year to help harvest the leaves, which must be picked entirely by hand. The organic tea gardens are home to butterflies and other insects, but the participants were most excited by the discovery of several Taiwan blue magpies. Under a three-year plan, ETT will help support ecosystem preservation and sustainable organic tea production as it looks to raise employee awareness of environmental issues. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 118 Activities in Protected Area (U.K.) Epson Telford Ltd. (ETL) is a core production site for manufacturing ink cartridges for European market and textile ink. It was the first site within the Epson group to achieve ISO14001 and participates in many environmental preservation activities such as recycling of wastes and energysaving. With an area of 220,000 m², the site includes a nature reserve that many rabbits have made their home. ETL has not only reduced its production based environmental impact, but also protects and supports its local environment by: • Setting aside about 1/3 of its land for the nature reserve, • Creating special areas to preserve the habitat of the crested newt and great burnet*1, which have been specified as rare species in the U.K. • Planting trees to offset company car emissions • Introducing bee hives within the site so as to improve the diversity of local living creature and preserve bee species. Also other local species have visited or have made homes within the sites. • Raptors: Buzzards, kestrels, owls • Birds: Partridges, red starts, yellow hammers, green woodpeckers • Others: Foxes, etc. *1 Both species have been registered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) on the Red List (Least Concern: LC). Bee hives introduced in the site Pond in the special area Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 119 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Eco Community We are working to achieve new socially and economically sustainable practices through environmental community action centered on products and services. Eco Corporate Citizenship Please refer to page 198 of “Environmental Conservation.” Eco Technology Introduction of corporate citizenship programs that leverage Epson’s technologies. Release of a Simple Tool for Measuring PFCs Perfluorocarbons and some other gases used in semiconductor and LCD fabrication have extremely high global warming potential–a level that is about 10,000 times greater than that of CO2. But measuring PFC gases was difficult until 2000, when Epson independently developed a simple method for measuring PFCs*1 that enables easy and accurate measurement using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). This method enabled Epson to sharply reduce PFC gas. Epson patented the simple method for measuring PFCs but grants a free license, subject to certain conditions, to others. This method is now being used by numerous enterprises to reduce PFC gas. *1 Formerly called the “Epson Method” Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 120 Eco Education Epson wants its employees to remain mindful of the environment while on the job. We feel it is important for them to consider how their conduct, both at work and at home, affects the environment and we want them to take the initiative in coming up with solutions. Toward that end, Epson provides environmental education and promotes correct understanding of ecological practices. Epson also contributes to broader environmental preservation by sharing its knowledge and experience with outside organizations. In-House Environmental Education Our environmental education curriculum for employees consists of a general education program, a professional education program, and general awareness-building activities. The general education program consists of a mandatory Basic Environmental Training course as a first step, followed by echelon-based training courses in which non-management employees, managers, and executives learn what action they need to take in their respective positions to address environmental issues. In the professional education program, employees select the courses they need in their particular area in order to acquire the skills and knowledge required for environmental action. We also build general environmental awareness among all personnel in a variety of ways, including through environmental messages from management to all employees and by implementing special actions during Environmental Sustainability Month and Energy Conservation Month.

EcoPro 2018 (Japan) EcoPro 2018, Japan’s preeminent environmental exhibition, was held at Tokyo Big Sight from December 6-8, 2018. The theme of this year’s exhibition was “Environment and Society in the SDGs Era, and into the Future.” The exhibition has evolved over the years from an event that focused on environmental issues and environmental education to an event that is now geared toward people with an interest in SDGs, ESG, and other social trends and issues. Epson has had a booth at EcoPro every year since the inaugural exhibition in 1999. This year the Epson booth featured the PaperLab, a dry process office papermaking system that won the Economy, Trade and Industry Minister’s Prize at the First EcoPro Awards. Epson also highlighted how replacing laser office printers with inkjet printers contributes to the SDGs by reducing working time and by saving electricity and resources. Dry Process Office Papermaking System Visitors to the Epson booth were treated to a paper recycling demonstration and shown samples of notebooks, sketchbooks, business cards, and leaflets made on paper that was recycled using the PaperLab A-8000. They were also shown examples of how our premium partners who have installed a PaperLab A-8000 are making efficient use of it. Contributing to achieve the SDGs with Inkjet Printers The Epson booth drew attention to some of the products and initiatives for reducing environmental impacts in the office. Visitors were shown how high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers can increase productivity while saving energy. They were also shown the amount of resources that can be saved with high-capacity ink tank systems. Corporate Corner Panels showed CSR activities that contribute to achieve the SDGs and prize-winning photographs from a nature photography contest that Epson sponsors. In the environmental activity area, Epson showed how it is contributing to environmental sustainability by making inkjet printers smaller, providing advanced features, and promoting inkjet digital textile printing. A groundbreaking printer dating back some two decades was put on exhibit, as were various textile print samples. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 122 Received the 1st EcoPro Award (Japan) Epson was awarded the Economy, Trade and Industry Minister’s Prize, one of main prizes in the First EcoPro Awards, at a ceremony on the first day of EcoPro 2018. Epson was singled out for the environmental performance of the PaperLab A-8000 dry process office papermaking system, for innovativeness in recycling office resources, and for the maintenance of information security through the secure destruction of confidential documents. Epson aims to develop an office recycling ecosystem and a smart recycling business by advancing and leveraging its efficient, compact, and precision technologies to provide innovative products and services. Screening Committee Chair comments Epson developed an innovative and secure method for recycling high volumes of waste paper right inside the office. It has the potential to replace the existing paper recycling and distribution model with a greener model. In addition, when people are directly involved in paper recycling, they see how much paper is used, and this could motivate them to recycle more resources. Keynote Speech on Ecology and SDGs Kazuhiro Ichikawa, Seiko Epson executive officer and deputy general administrative manager of the Technology Development Division, gave a keynote speech at EcoPro 2018 about Epson’s innovation goals and the PaperLab dry process office papermaking system, the development of which he spearheaded. He suggested ways of resolving social issues and contributing to environmental sustainability through products and services like PaperLab as a company that will contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 123 Commitment to the Environment Epson and the Environment Environmental Management As stated in its Management Philosophy, Epson’s business is anchored in a commitment to environmental conservation. Epson carries out environmental programs under uniform standards and goals in every country and region of the world. Our basic environmental stance is set forth in Epson Principles of Corporate Behavior and in the Environmental Policy. In recent years our customers, along with society in general, have become interested in reducing their environmental impacts. The desire to deliver reduced environmental impact products and services that surprise and delight our customers is embodied in the Exceed Your Vision tagline. Environmental Policy (Please refer to page 232 of “Appendices”) Environmental Management System Business units within the Epson Group establish their own enviPromotion System for Environmental Activities ronmental action plans based on the Epson 25 Corporate Vision, President and carry out the activities using an Environmental Management System (EMS).

All financially consolidated companies in the global Epson Group have environmental programs and, in the FY2018, environmental data was gathered from 54 of those companies (representing 96% of revenue). Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 124 Commitment to People Our People Human Resources Development Approach Epson develops and trains its human resources in line with a Human Resources Development Policy established in 1996 that designates talented people as a precious management resource. We assist employees so that they can achieve their dreams of self-fulfillment, and we develop people who connect and support all the companies in the Epson Group. We provide training so that our people understand their roles and what is expected of them as members of the Epson team. Training enables them to work and communicate effectively, solve problems and achieve goals, and experience personal and professional growth. Seiko Epson requires that employees complete a course in management practices before being appointed to a management position. This course prepares them to meet the requirements as a manager by ensuring that they understand their role in terms of both business and actions. On the business end, they learn the skills they need to understand strategic business objectives and respond rapidly and nimbly to internal and external changes in the business environment. On the action end, they learn the skills they need to support the growth and development of the people who report to them by putting organizations and individuals in a position to succeed. In addition, we provide training for new employees, group training for each grade, and various open-type training to develop people who will fulfill roles as future middle managers step-by-step.

All employees of every grade are subject to the systems, and managers and their subordinates work together to set objectives that they can both agree on. Progress toward the objectives is periodically reviewed, end results are evaluated, and new, higher objectives are set. The management by objectives system is itself an on-the-job human resource training system. It is a win-win development cycle in which individual growth leads to the growth of the organization and the company. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 125 Training Initiatives Global Leadership Training In addition to a course in management practices for managers and employees who will be transferred overseas, Epson provides training (F1, F2, and F3 course) to selected employees. In the F1 course, director candidates learn the skills needed to be a top executive. The F2 course is used to prepare middle managers to take the reins of a business or division. In the F3 course participants learn the basics of business through simulated exercises. Through these courses, Epson develops future leaders across the group. The Global Incubation Seminar (GIS) The Global Incubation Seminar (GIS) is a program for developing global leaders who will be a driving force in the Epson Group. At the seminar, we share Epson’s vision and values with up-and-coming leaders from around the world, and empower them to put these into practice in their own organizations. Since 1999, the first year of the program, more than 380 people have participated in GIS training, and nearly all the chief executives of Epson’s overseas companies are graduates of the program. The fiscal 2018 GIS was held at the Seiko Epson Head Office for five days, from February 18, 2019. A total of 25 individuals took part, including personnel from 17 overseas affiliates. Those participants developed a deeper understanding of the business vision and strategies by directly hearing from and speaking to members of the executive management team and re-recognize the idea “profit relies on compliance” through discussion about fraud prevention to make Epson an indispensable company. They also shared issues and actions among themselves, who comes from each area, function and business unit, and think through how we make Epson creates value as a leader in their own organization. They then drafted and committed to executing concrete plans on final day and are executing action plan now. By offering this training on a continuing basis, we hope to develop diverse global talent who will drive Epson to new heights in the future. One participant’s impressions of GIS 2018 Through GIS, I have truly understood what it takes to be an indispensable company and what it meant to have real customer value. Hearing it directly from the Epson executive management team, made such an impact on me as an employee and in turn made me realize how I, as a leader, could make a difference in transforming our organization, to align our direction towards achieving our vision. Getting the inspiration from it, I will collaborate with our HR team and previous GIS participants to come up with a simple program on educating key personnel on the management philosophy and the conduct to achieve it.

Minoru Usui Department Manager, Accounting & Business Control/Compliance Audit Office Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 126 One participant’s impressions of GIS 2018 I was truly impressed by the sheer amount of products that Epson has managed to produce over the years by using the same core technologies that has helped create the Epson brand. It was also great to network with the other GIS participants from various Business Units and learn from them. My strongest impression from the GIS is Usui-san’s message that we exist first and foremost to provide value to our customers. Profit is a consequence of such activity. My role as a GIS participant is to share Epson’s philosophy to our organization, acknowledge the contribution our teams provide to Epson while discovering new ways in our everyday activities that increase value and delight to our customers. (Right) Christian Sammut (Left) S eiko Epson Corporation President Minoru Usui Christian Sammut Epson Europe Electronics GmbH Manager, Business Development Global Executive Seminar In May 2017, Epson launched the inaugural Global Executive Seminar (GES) to further strengthen executive management at overseas affiliates. The seminar is designed to develop leaders who are capable of devising strategies and analyzing issues, leaders who can help guide us toward Epson’s long-term goals, understand the roles that they and their companies should play, and identify changes to make in a business environment with limited future visibility. The seminar starts with a threeday group training session (session 1) and is followed by a year-long period during which participants apply lessons in actual practice, after which they gather to report the results over two-days (session 2). Beginning on May 20 to May 22, 2019, we held session 1 of GES 2019-20 with a new group of four leaders from Epson’s overseas affiliates and two from our Japan operations. These six people are scheduled to return for the second session of GES 2019-20 next year. For the next two days, Session 2 of GES 2018-19 was held at the corporate headquarters, with nine trainees, including two from domestic Epson Group companies. The participants each gave a presentation on the management issues they tackled over the past year. The seminar concluded with them promising further growth and development in the future. Through programs like these, we are laying a more robust business foundation for responding to change and executing strategies. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 127 Training for New Employees in Japan Epson considers the first year of employment to be a training period during which new employees learn about the Epson approach to work. For the first three weeks, new employees in Epson Group companies in Japan gather at the Head Office for group training, where they learn the following: • Conduct expected of them as Epson employees • The mindset and attitude necessary for practicing “monozukuri” or the art and science of manufacturing, which is the foundation of Epson’s efficient, compact and precision technologies • The importance of working cooperatively as a team Training to think about customer satisfaction Training ranges from lectures on the Epson Code of Conduct to hands-on training in manufacturing. New employees learn the importance and enjoyment of working in teams, through group activities that take place throughout the training period. After they complete group training, new employees are sent to the department where they have been assigned. There they learn their job through on-the-job training under a mentor. Mentors are usually selected from among young employees with three to five years of experience. They produce training plans tailored to the individuals they will be mentoring and, for a full year, provide them with the support they will need to stand on their own. Mentors themselves are expected to grow through this experience. At the end of the first year, the new employees gather again for follow-up group training, where they can observe how they and others have grown and developed. To further solidify the foundation they have built as a business professional, they review the previous year and consider action plans for the next year and beyond to achieve further growth and expand their contributions to the company. Lifetime Career Support Epson continuously implements initiatives aimed at being an organization that promotes personnel development. We provide support towards building motivating and challenging careers that encourage growth. To help our employees set their own mediumand long-term career goals and take actions toward achieving them, we have been offering Lifetime Career Support (LTCS) since FY2016. The LTCS provides ageand grade-specific training, which gives employees an opportunity to independently plan their own career path. FY2018 training results LTCS50 training (for all employees age 50) 373 people LTCS40 training (for all employees age 40) 298 people Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 128 Creating Value That Exceeds Customer Expectations and the Monozukuri Juku Epson’s Monozukuri Juku, or Manufacturing School, aims to enhance the customer value we create. To this end, we teach our personnel basic technology and skills and have them experience monozukuri (the art and science of manufacturing) by performing specific manufacturing tasks step by step. This helps them tackle jobs from different angles. To give a specific example, employees learn the basics of component processing technology (molding and pressing). Once they learn these, employees have the skills to make the various parts that go into a product. Employees also learn by mastering essential skills for making production lines more efficient (e.g., automating lines or operating them with fewer staff). In addition, we contribute to the community and society by giving practical training for new employees of local businesses, offering corporate experiences to junior and senior high school students, and providing instruction for technical skill trainings. We also send experts abroad to take part in official development assistance for building technical skill evaluation systems at the request of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Mechatronics Training for Building, Maintaining, and Enhancing Automated Lines Factory productivity improvement initiatives are nothing new at Epson. Earlier examples included the introduction of simple and systematic tools to production processes. More recently, however, we are facing great changes in the manufacturing environment. As wages have risen rapidly and workers prefer non-manufacturing jobs, it is not always easy to recruit the necessary labor. Earlier improvements were based on the assumption there would be plenty of inexpensive labor. Our business is not likely to survive if we just try to repeat such improvements. Therefore, we are making a strong push to build production lines that rely on human labor as little as possible but are still capable of stable production. Monozukuri Juku holds about 100 trainings of various types each year to develop the engineers who keep production lines running. Trainings impart machining skills like mechanical drafting and measuring required to build equipment. The organization prepares such curricula as mechatronics basic technologies, where engineers who promote manpower-saving and automation technology get training in basic technologies like compressed air and electrical control as well as assembling and adjusting simple devices. Other courses include FA robot training, image processing training, and mechatronics practical training, which are designed to teach practical technologies and skills. Thus, we are offering employees an opportunity and place to learn. Monozukuri Juku trains machine tool and maintenance engineers in Japan but also sends staff to teach at overseas affiliates that serve as our major manufacturing sites. There, we develop leaders in production and machine tool maintenance at overseas affiliates, by giving courses based on our training program in Japan. Training engineers at an overseas affiliate (Philippines) Mechatronics practical training Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 129 Developing Young Technicians through National Skills Competition As a manufacturing company, Epson uses training for WorldSkills competitions to develop “groundbreaker technicians”*1 who have acquired essential manufacturing knowledge and skills at an early age. As a rule, individuals are allowed to take part in WorldSkills trainings just once. The purpose of the short-term intensive trainings is to help participants learn technical skills at the all-Japan level. Every year we send 10-15 individuals to the National Skills Competition associated with WorldSkills to compete in six selected occupational categories that are applicable to our employees’ work: Instrument making, Press tool making, Mechatronics, Industrial electronics, Web design, and Watch repair. New employees sent to Monozukuri Juku as WorldSkills trainees experience monozukuri (the art and science of manufacturing) in such forms as filing and sawing. They also learn basic knowledge about machinery, electricity, and other general topics in each occupational category. In conjunction with everyday occupation-specific training, there are training camps three times a year. Participants lodge together, run a long distance, set targets, and the like. All of this helps to build a sense of solidarity as a team. To recreate the feel of the national competition, we also hold joint training events with other companies that take part in WorldSkills. Additionally, our employees actively pursue such national qualifications as machining technician, electronic device assembly technician, web design technician, and watch repair technician. After participants finish WorldSkills trainings, they get practical training to help them build the basic skills learned there into skills they can use to make products. Each participant then joins an operations division. The units they join often praise these employees for performing beyond expectations. *1 Technicians with the ability to break from precedent to create innovative technologies and systems.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 130 Commitment to People Our People Promotion of Diversity Diversity Policy Respect for diversity is a cornerstone of Epson’s Management Philosophy, and our personnel policies reflect it. Diversity is the inclusion of individuals of different genders, national origins, religions, regions, educations, social statuses, and LGBT, regardless of whether these traits are innate or acquired, visible, or invisible. Epson’s true customers are end users the world over. In order to enrich their lives, we have to understand them and meet their needs. To achieve this, our own diversity is important. We believe that only with a diverse workforce of people who have respect for one another and who know and practice what is important can we create customer value. In order to deliver results that surprise and delight our customers, Epson promotes female managerial staff and foreign nationals, fostering a corporate culture that enables diverse personnel to display their abilities to the full. Masayuki Kawana Director and Executive Officer, General Administrative Manager of the Human Resources Division and CSR Management Office Global Talent Epson has sites around the world to accurately identify and Employee Numbers by Region (as of March 31, 2019) swiftly and flexibly meet the changing needs of customers at different times and in different regions.

A high-performing, The Americas 4.5% diverse workforce is essential for achieving vertical integration, Europe 3.2% making it vital for our operations divisions in Japan and Epson Group companies overseas to be on the same page in terms of business vision and policies. That is why we have a variety of international programs to promote communication and interaction among people at various levels within our operations divisions, Head Office, and other internal organizations. Examples of Our Initiatives Sending Young Staff Members Overseas Epson actively sends young staff members from Japan to Epson’s overseas sites for professional development as part of its trainee program.

We provide educational programs that give them an opportunity to learn skills and techniques not available in their home countries and helps them enhance their understanding of business processes. In fiscal 2018, we accepted 79 technical interns and trainees, and since 1988, we have welcomed a total of 1,750 Group employees. The photo on the right shows technical interns inspecting parts manufactured with dies they made themselves. Epson also recently introduced a program that is designed to deepen the insights of young employees at Epson sales companies. The program enables them to get a different perspective on projects they are working on through interaction with people from the operations divisions and Head Office supervisory departments in Japan. It also enhances their appreciation of Epson and Epson values. Epson holds a variety of meetings and seminars for representatives from our global sites. Some are function specific, for areas such as legal affairs, finance and accounting, safety, and the environment. Others are for global projects involving matters such as IT systems and the adoption of IFRS. Still others, such as sales meetings, are held to discuss a range of topics and to share information and opinions globally. Advancement of Women in the Workplace Seiko Epson has had some success in empowering women who actually stay with the company longer than men, on average by creating conditions that allow them to better balance family with work. These conditions include, for example, the ability to take leaves of absence or to work a shorter day, as well as financial assistance to help cover babysitter expenses. However, there is still a gender gap when it comes to promotion to management and other leadership positions in Japan. Seiko Epson recognizes this as an issue and is taking additional action to support the advancement of more women in the workplace. Examples of Actions Taken Plans for promoting women’s participation and advancement in the workplace • We will recruit new graduates, with a goal of securing a hiring class composed of at least 25% women • We will expand and enhance a variety of policies and measures to enable women to shape their long-term careers at Epson. (For example, we will conduct dialogue with management, and encourage women to participate in management and career development training seminars.) • We will explore and expand telecommuting and other more flexible ways of working. Eruboshi Seiko Epson has earned the highest (Grade 3) Eruboshi certification* from the Japanese government in recognition of our excellence in promoting the advancement of women in the workplace. * To be eligible to receive Grade 3 certification a company must satisfy all the criteria in five areas: recruitment, continued employment, working hours, percentage of women in managerial positions, and diversity of career courses Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 132 The Platinum Kurumin Seiko Epson is creating conditions that allow employees to balance their careers with their personal lives. In recognition of our efforts to implement policies that will benefit the next generation, the Japanese government awarded Seiko Epson Platinum Kurumin certification. Nadeshiko Brand In 2018, for a second consecutive year, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, working in collaboration with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, selected Seiko Epson for inclusion to the list of Nadeshiko Brands, an honor bestowed on companies that demonstrate excellence in encouraging the empowerment of women in the workplace. Seiko Epson was recognized for implementing higher quality initiatives to empower women in order to produce greater business success. Family tours Seiko Epson conducts family tours every August. Children of employees visit the company, see our products, make fans using paper printed from an Epson printer, assemble watches, use the employee cafeteria, and participate in other events that show them what Epson is like. Babysitters Employees can use babysitters at company expense. Female Empowerment Project Seiko Epson launched a dedicated project to promote the empowerment of women in the workplace in order to create a climate of support for both male and female employees who want to advance their careers. The members of the project team are knowledgeable internal professionals who are exploring seven topics. They are also working to achieve an action plan as required by the Act on the Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. The Seven Topics Career design, career counseling, work-life balance support (childrearing), work-life balance (family caregiving), internal networking, hiring and retention, and internal/external PR.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 133 Targets We are aiming to have female employees account for 5% (40 people) of management positions and 7% (350 people) of leadership roles (equivalent to assistant manager) by FY2022. Dialog between executive management and female employees Seiko Epson will continue to hold meetings between members of the executive management team and female employees. These meetings are designed to create a mutual support environment and help women network with female managers, with manager candidates, and with other employees who share similar concerns at around age 30. Members of executive management who participate in these meetings learn first-hand about the needs of women in the workplace, such as the ability to telecommute during the childrearing years and availability of a temporary day care space in emergencies. These talks lead the development of actual trials and the creation of new programs. Telecommuting and dependent care Seiko Epson has introduced a system that gives time-constrained employees the opportunity to work from home so that they can provide care to children and other sick or ill family members. The telecommuting program can be used flexibly on an hourly, half-day, or per-day basis, up to a set maximum number of hours per month. For example, parents can leave work during regular working hours as needed to participate in school events. Or, when their child gets sick, they can work a certain minimum number of hours while their children are sleeping. Whereas parents previously may have had to take paid leave for these situations, they now can work more flexibly around them. Telecommuters: 29 for childcare and 2 for family care (as of May 2019) Main Programs Introduced (Japan) 1980 ・ Eliminated gender pay gap (1983) ・ Main childbirth & childcare programs 1990 Parental leave (1991) Shortened workday (1992) 2000 At-home childcare service (2005) Medical leave okayed for paid parental leave (2007) Medical leave okayed for half-days for expanded range of reasons (renamed wellbeing leave) (2009) Certification as a company with policies to benefit the next generation Acquisition of the“Kurumin”next-generation accreditation mark, the ﬁrst company to do so in Nagano prefecture (2007) (Ongoing certiﬁcation in 2009 & 2012) Free at-home childcare service (2015) Acquisition of the Grade 3 (the highest grade) Eruboshi certiﬁcation (2016) Acquisition of Platinum Kurumin (2016) Telecommuting system for dependent care (2018) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 134 Support for managers To deepen understanding of the need for diversity (including the participation and advancement of women) to maximize the power of the organization, every year Seiko Epson invites outside lecturers to talk about why diversity matters. Attendance is mandatory for all members of middle and upper management. Bosses, out of an excess of caution, tend to avoid assigning potentially career-enhancing work to women and other employees whose time availability may be limited. For this reason, we have incorporated content in manager training courses to help ensure that all employees are given equal opportunity and are motivated. To further change the mind-set of management, we are conducting diversity management training from 2018 fiscal year. This training program incorporates content that teaches managers to recognize unconscious bias and effectively use female employees. Evaluation system The criteria for evaluating employees who work a full day and employees who work shorter hours are identical. This was done to ensure a level playing field when it comes to advancement and promotions. Employees are evaluated based on their achievements with respect to goals that are considered to be achievable within their respective workdays. In addition, to be eligible for promotion exams, employees must write a dissertation and pass a written test in the same year. Since a considerable amount of time is needed to write the dissertation and prepare for the written test, employees who have limited free time faced additional challenges. Another stumbling block was that employees who qualify to take the test must do so (and pass) within a three-year period, after which eligibility expired, so those taking maternity leave could end up losing eligibility. To remove these obstacles and make it easier for time-constrained employees to take tests for promotion, we changed the system, in April 2018. We eliminated the expiration period and made it so that employees could maintain eligibility even if they pass only certain test subjects over a multi-year period. Future Initiatives Seiko Epson will roll out further actions to expand the career advancement possibilities for women in the future. Roadmap 1990～ 2000～ 2015～ Launch of the Female Empowerment Project Greater diversity to achieve business strategies Advancement of women in the workplace Equal opportunity employment & work-life balance support Top management commitment Work reform Support for managers Career design for women Telecommuting Work-life balance support (shorter working hours & babysitter service) Introduction & expansion of a work-life balance support system Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 135 Employing and Supporting Persons with Disabilities Epson employs a large number of persons with disabilities. For this reason we accommodate special needs in a variety of ways. For example, we provide easy-access restrooms, parking spaces, and other facilities.

It began with a workforce of 15 people, 11 of whom had disabilities, and has expanded steadily since then. Epson Mizube’s wide range of services include assembly, inspection, cleaning, and packaging of various electronic and precision devices; printing, copying, and bookbinding; catalog mailing; document digitization; dust suit cleaning; building cleaning; and sorting and dismantling used ink cartridges. The company employs 134 persons with disabilities at eight sites (as of the end of March 2019). Facilities cleaning services were launched in 2008, and have since grown to a crew of 45 employees who provide services to 5 sites (as of March 31, 2019). The cleaning crews contribute to maintaining pleasant working environments. In 2017, we installed an upcycling model line in the PaperLab. This has expanded employment opportunities for persons with disabilities and promotes environmental impact reduction by using the PaperLab and DFP to turn used paper into business cards and notebook paper.

The FY2018 Japan National Abilympics in Okinawa featured the most Epson representatives ever (5 employees: product packing Masaya Hirabayashi; facility cleaning Mizuho Yosoi; electronic device assembly Shoichi Yokouchi; office assistant Misaki Kamijo; DTP Takamasa Ichikawa). Masaya Hirabayashi and Misaki Kamijo earned gold, Mizuho Yosoi earned silver and Shoichi Yokouchi earned bronze. Through their efforts, these employees serve as positive examples for workers with disabilities. In May 2019, the four who placed in the Abilympics were also recognized for excellence in their respective skill areas, with Masaya Hirabayashi and Misaki Kamijo receiving the Nagano Governor’s Award and Mizuho Yosoi and Shoichi Yokouchi receiving the Nagano Vocational Ability Development Association Award. Epson Swan Corp. Epson Swan Corporation started operating in March 2002, when it was established as a special subsidiary of Tohoku Epson Corporation in Sakata, Yamagata Prefecture. It was the first certified special subsidiary in Yamagata Prefecture. It is presently a special subsidiary of Seiko Epson Corporation. Located in the grounds of Tohoku Epson, 21 people with disabilities (as of April 1, 2019) clean dust suits and provide building cleaning services within the company. In addition to employee and leisure support, we also focus on professional development. In FY2018, we entered the facilities cleaning category at the Japan National Abilympics In addition, Epson Swan communicates both internally and externally by publishing its magazine Smile via its intranet and as hardcopy four times a year. A total of 38 issues have been released, counting the most recent published in March, 2019. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 137 Selecting Senior Executives Epson seeks to put itself in the best position to achieve the goals of Epson 25 by reviewing organizations, roles, and human resources from a global perspective and making adaptations that best serve our business strategies and the ever-changing business environment. The company specifies the roles and requirements for key positions in the global Epson Group. It establishes succession plans and has systems in place to ensure that the best people for these positions are selected without regard to consideration such as age, gender, and nationality. In Japan, personnel reviews that focus primarily on middle managers in each business and function are conducted to identify candidates for future executive management positions. Succession plans are drawn up, and training, both internal and external, is provided to put them in a position to succeed. Epson also has in place a Group-wide training and rotation program to prepare employees for promotion to entry-level management positions. Epson Group companies outside Japan identify certain ranks at which they look for candidates to fill future top-level management positions. They then compile basic information about everyone at those ranks. Seiko Epson consults with Epson Group companies to grade these individuals based on common global criteria and identify the top talent. Information about their skills and capabilities is gathered by various means, including 360-degree evaluations, and future career path and development plans are explored. As a result of these initiatives, Epson now has home-grown talent in leadership positions at its overseas affiliates. The CEO of Epson’s regional head office in the US is an American who has responsibility for all administrative and business operations at Epson companies in North, Central, and South America. In Europe, all local affiliates controlled by the regional head office are headed by locals. In addition, a number of Epson sales and manufacturing affiliates around the globe have recruited or promoted locals to run their operations.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 138 Commitment to People Our People Respecting Human Rights Zero Tolerance Epson is serious about keeping all forms of discrimination and unfair practices out of its operations around the world. This stance is reflected in our participation in the United Nations Global Compact since 2004. In 2005 we documented policies that outline Epson’s strong convictions in areas including respect for human rights, elimination of harassment, eradication of all forms of discrimination, respect for local culture and customs, prohibition of child and forced labor, and maintenance of positive labor relations. We have established services that employees can use to report or consult on abuses of any kind. These services include such things as a harassment hotline, employee counseling service, and Epson helpline. Epson also strives to prevent fraud and other forms of misconduct in a number of ways, including by periodically sharing information with all employees and by raising awareness with bulletins on the intranet. The Policies Regarding Human Rights and Labor Standards (Please refer to page 235 of “Appendices”) Power Harassment Prevention Training Epson maintains a harassment hotline to respond to employees’ harassment concerns. Epson has been actively fostering the development of an organizational culture with zero tolerance for harassment. To achieve a fair and pleasant working environment, we provide anti-power harassment training seminars to Epson Group companies as a way to prevent and stamp out harassment. In fiscal 2015, we carried out training for management (directors and administrative officers) and all managerial staff at Group companies in Japan, with 100% attendance. In fiscal 2016, we expanded the training to middle management and personnel who are to be transferred overseas. More than 90% of those eligible attended the training in fiscal 2017. The training has also been provided to personnel who are newly promoted to management and other leadership positions since fiscal 2016. In addition, in fiscal 2018, on-line harassment preventive training was provided to all employees.

Seiko Epson has provided anger management training since 2016 to teach employees skills needed to control feelings of anger at work. Echelonand department-based anger management training is offered about 70 times a year. An introductory course teaches people the skills they need to defuse their anger and improve their control long-term, while a course in constructive criticism teaches managers and others effective communication skills. More than 4,500 Epson Group employees in Japan have taken a course. By providing its people with the proper training and skills, Epson hopes to eliminate power harassment from the workplace. Epson Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement Based on the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018, Epson discloses the policy for eradicating modern slavery and human trafficking from the supply chain and the situation of Epson as follows:. Epson Slavery & Human Trafficking Statement for Financial Year 2018 https://www.epson.jp/SR/our_people/pdf/fy18_modern_slavery_act_statement.pdf Human Rights Due Diligence Epson is vertically integrated and develops and manufactures the majority of the products we sell through our global network of sales subsidiaries. We strive to identify human rights risks throughout our operations but particularly at our production sites in Southeast Asia, where the risk of human rights violations is generally said to be highs. To identify and understand human rights risks in our supply chain, we ask suppliers to perform a CSR self-assessment questionnaire. On the other hand, to identify human rights risks within its own group, we conducted the Epson CSR Self-assessment questionnaire on overseas subsidiaries that started in fiscal 2017 as well as in fiscal 2018, as well as at our manufacturing facilities and domestic affiliates. The results allowed us to identify risks, which we instructed our facilities and group companies to take steps to mitigate. The CSR self-assessment will be performed yearly, and we will encourage companies to understand where the issues are and to address them. CSR Self-assessments by Epson Group Companies In the FY2018, Epson had its own facilities, domestic affiliates and overseas group companies complete a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) to evaluate their performance with respect to CSR requirements. The purpose of the SAQ was to identify and address risks and potential threats in areas such as human rights. Epson created the SAQ based on the basic requirements of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). The SAQ consisted of 100 questions concerning things such as human rights, labor, safety and health, the environment, the management system, and ethics. Suppliers were asked to complete the same questionnaire as part of our socially responsible procurement program.

On the other hand, the new company established in 2018 did not fully realize Epson’s policy and management level, and became a high-risk. • There still remain some companies not fully understood the intent of the questions, so the Head Office will provide further explanation and education for them. • The Head Office provided a guidance about the Epson Group’s basic policies, rules, and guidelines to affiliates, so most of the affiliates improved their understanding. • Some of affiliates had not communicated the Epson Group’s basic policies, rules, and guidelines to their employees or had not established their own objectives or action plans (in the areas of labor, safety and health, the environment, and suppliers). The Head Office will provide instruction and support to these affiliates and promote action across the Epson Group. --High risk company Situation Action One company that was established in 2018 was not The Head Office will establish a communication policy, adequately apprised of Epson’s policies and management explain requirements, and provide support. requirements yet. The Head Office and the company deemed high-risk will draft and execute plans to address issues to bring it up to the middle-risk or low-risk levels by March 31, 2020. Security Personnel Trained in Human Rights Seiko Epson outsources security operations to security companies and asks them to train those employees in human rights policies or procedures. In FY2017 we conducted a CSR self-assessment questionnaire to confirm that those suppliers, as well as other suppliers of indirect materials, provided human rights training to those people. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 142 Commitment to People Our People Fostering a Better Workplace Equal Gender Opportunity Initiatives Seiko Epson, an early advocate of equal opportunity employment in Japan, abolished gender-based difference in pay in 1983. In addition, we aim to provide equal gender opportunity at the time of childbirth and childcare. The results of our initiatives show up in the numbers, such as the duration of service and the rate at which mothers return to work after taking childcare leave. Moreover, nearly 100% of employees take parental leave.

Epson’s Wellbeing Leave Program Seiko Epson introduced a special paid leave program in March 1998 that allows employees who do not use all their annual paid vacation days during the year to stockpile the remainder, up to 60 days, in a separate account. They have the option of using special paid leave days in the event of personal injury or illness, or to care for children or family members, or to participate in school events for their children in elementary and middle school. Work-Life Balance Initiatives Recognizing the importance of the well-being and development of our children, Epson encourages employees to balance their careers with their personal lives. We enforce an eight-hour no overtime workday at least once per week at our sites in Japan, and an increasing number of sites have a day each year when parents can bring their children to work. To create an environment suitable for both male and female employees who want to pursue a career, we are working to support childcare. From October 2005, we have offered subsidies for babysitting services. We have gradually increased the subsidy, and currently we pay the full amount for up to 16 hours. Company housing next to the workplace is made available as childcare space to maintain the privacy of employees’ homes. From April 2018, we introduced a telecommuting system for employees on childcare leave or caregiver leave. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 143 Responding to employee caregiver needs With advancing population aging, the number of people requiring care is on the rise. Consequently, the number of employees acting as caregivers for their families is also on the rise. Aiming to eliminate turnover due to caregiver needs, Epson provides the following types of support to caregivers. • Launched a website related to caregiving to provide information related to in-house programs and nursing care insurance systems. • Conducting nursing care preparation seminars to equip employees with the knowledge that will enable them to respond calmly to sudden nursing care needs. • Enable the use of the following programs to support balance between work and caregiving. Caregiving Program Name Overview Caregiver leave May take up to 1 year and 6 months per applicable family member Caregiver reduced hours Available for up to 3 years from start of use Caregiver overtime exemption Exempt employees from overtime exceeding nominal hours Restricts employee overtime to less than 24 hours per month or Caregiver overtime restriction 150 hours per year Caregiver night shift restriction Restricts night shift assignments for employee Caregiver telecommuting program Enables telecommuting up to limited time speciﬁc for each work shift Caregiver leave Allows employee to take 5 days/year for 1 applicable family member or 10 days/year for 2 applicable family members as caregiver leave (unpaid) Certification as an “Eruboshi” Company On July 11, 2016, the Japanese Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare granted Seiko Epson the top “Eruboshi” mark in recognition of its efforts as a good company to promote the active participation and advancement of women in the workplace. The Ministry established the Eruboshi mark in February 2016 based on the newly enacted Act on Promotion of Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace. Companies that draw up and submit an action plan and meet certain standards are eligible to receive the mark if they have demonstrated successful efforts to promote the advancement of women. Companies that apply for the mark are graded on five criteria and awarded one of three levels of certification depending on how many of the criteria they satisfy. Seiko Epson, which met all five criteria, was certified to receive the Grade 3 Eruboshi mark*1. Seiko Epson launched a project to step up its initiatives related to women’s advancement. Through such programs as setting up discussions between female employees and management and establishing a new mechanism that enable people to continue working while they provide care for elderly relatives, the company intends not only to help women continue working, but also to provide an environment where women who want careers can advance into leadership roles. *1 T  he criteria are recruitment, continued employment, working hours, percentage of women in managerial positions, and diversity of career courses. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 144 Certification as a Kurumin and Platinum Kurumin Company As a result of Epson’s efforts to establish a friendly workplace environment, we were awarded use of the so-called Kurumin symbol from 2007 and the Platinum Kurumin symbol in 2016. Use of these symbols is awarded by the Japanese Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare to companies that implement policies that support the parenting of their employees in accordance with the Act on Measures to Support the Development of the Next Generation. Named Nadeshiko Brand for FY2018 Since FY2012, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry working in collaboration with the Tokyo Stock Exchange names companies serving as examples of enterprises that encourage women’s success as Nadeshiko Brands. Nadeshiko Brands are promoted to investors focused on mediumto long-term corporate value growth as appealing listed companies that encourage women’s success. This encourages investment in Nadeshiko Brands, which in turn accelerates the initiatives of these companies. In FY2018, which marks the 7th year of the Nadeshiko Brand listing, Epson was praised for implementing initiatives that encourage more advanced success for women with the goal of producing operational results. Seiko Epson was selected as a Nadeshiko Brand for a second consecutive year, in FY2018, largely in recognition of actions it has taken to promote workplace diversity. These actions include work reforms and initiatives to change the thinking with regard to the role of women in the workplace. They, along with changes in the system of tests for promotion, are designed to facilitate the advancement of women and to encourage more women to seek management positions. Monitoring and Controlling Working Hours Epson specifies its work goals and work culture. Our goal is for all employees to maintain and improve their physical and mental health while working efficiently in a vital, rewarding work environment, without excessive labor demands. In this way, the company will develop in perpetuity, raising its corporate value and ensuring a win-win relationship with its employees. Epson is fully compliant with labor laws. One of the ways we ensure compliance is by following an operations manual for managing working hours. We have also implemented time management initiatives and monitoring systems across the organization in Japan. Epson has programs to build awareness among employees of the importance of regulating working hours appropriately, and we are fully committed to maintaining a well-balanced working environment. Work reform actions From fiscal 2017, we have been taking comprehensive work reform actions. The goals are to revise our approach to work and seek to improve the productivity of executives, managerial staff, and general staff in their respective positions, thereby achieving an appropriate work-life balance and a state in which our diverse employees can work with enthusiasm to realize the Epson 25 Corporate Vision.

Our standards provide for things such as suitable wages, allowances, and extraordinary pay. In Japan, for staff members among non-management employees, we have introduced a qualified grade-based system wherein compensation is determined by the employee’s job and competencies. For senior staff members, we have a system wherein the compensation is determined by their job, which is given based on their competencies, and the level of roles they are fulfilling. We have a role-based grade system for managers wherein compensation is determined by the size of the person’s role. The wage system does not discriminate by gender. Outside Japan, we have established and we follow rules that are in compliance with all local wage-related regulations governing things such as minimum wages, legal benefits, and overtime. We provide employees, who are paid directly, with pay slips on a certain date for each predetermined pay period. In countries and regions where employees may legally be subjected to financial penalties for disciplinary reasons, Epson does not prohibit such penalties but allows them as one option, provided that disciplinary procedures and financial penalties do not overstep legal bounds or have an unreasonable effect on the employee’s living standard. These are articulated in internal regulations, and employees are apprised of them in advance.

Since that program came into effect, we have enforced the Basic NESP Policy and manage our workplaces with the idea that every workplace is responsible for maintaining its own safety. Basic NESP Policy (Please refer to page 234 of “Appendices”) Epson amended the Management Philosophy earlier this year to reflect our commitment to making Epson an indispensable company and the world a better place. As part of these efforts, we ensure that all legal, regulatory, and internal requirements are observed at all sites around the world. We also endeavor to provide safe, secure, healthy workplaces to maintain and promote the mental and physical wellbeing of our people. Understanding that safety, security, and health are lifelines of the company, we are working together under the leadership of management to eliminate occupational accidents, injuries, and illnesses and to continuously meet the needs of our customers. Motonori Okumura Managing Executive Officer Production Planning Division General Administrative Manager and Overall Safety and Health Controller Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 148 Occupational Accidents The frequency and severity of occupational accidents in the Epson Group are far lower than those of the national average.

At the executive management level, the chief operating officers and presidents of Epson companies and sites in Japan and overseas separately gather twice a year for meetings of the General Safety and Health Controllers Committee to update one another about actions being taken and discuss issues to identify opportunities for improvement. At the operational level, managers and health and safety personnel also meet regularly to share information. In Japan, they meet every other month to discuss November 2018 information sharing meeting important topics and issues. Overseas, in China and Southeast Asia, representin China atives from each manufacturing affiliate meet regularly to get on the same page with respect to shared issues, discuss key actions to ensure compliance with applicable local legal and regulatory requirements, and drive improvement. Raising Employee Awareness with Accident Reports Epson analyzes all occupational injuries and accidents in the Epson Group, identifies causes, and makes plans for preventing similar incidents. Occupational accidents are reported in the form of Safety News bulletins that describe accident causes, countermeasures, and actions that all sites are to take to prevent similar accidents in the future. These reports are placed on the intranet and discussed with employees. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 149 Professional Development through Safety and Health Training Epson considers safety and health training vital for protecting employees. The training curriculum is tailored to the position, roles, and responsibilities of employees. Training for non-management employees focuses on practical techniques such as risk assessment and hazard prediction. Training for managers and supervisors focuses on leadership. All Group companies use the same training curriculum. In the 2018 fiscal year, we offered an online safety and health course that was Basic education for managers and supervisors in taken by 17,692 employees (98.3% of the workforce). We also planned and Indonesia in 2018 implemented a basic education course for managers and supervisors overseas. The course was taken by 100% of managers and supervisors in the Greater China Region (580 people) and by 59% in the Southeast Asia territory (599 people). In FY2019, we will provide training to all eligible people, including new managers and supervisors, with a goal of a 100% course completion rate. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 150 Managing Mental and Physical Health Epson promotes employee health under the New Epson Safety and Health Program (NESP) by, among other things, fostering a vibrant organizational climate and monitoring employee health to increase well-being and corporate value. At a meeting of the General Safety and Health Controllers Committee, the executive management team discusses mid-term measures and policies for systematically and continuously preventing occupational illnesses and promoting health based on the Basic NESP Policy. Once the measures and policies have been approved by the director in charge of health management, they are announced to and implemented by all domestic Epson Group companies. In Japan, we have instituted a mid-term health plan every five years since FY2001. The current plan, Health Action 2020, was instituted in April 2016. Under Health Action 2020, we are emphasizing safety and improving the working environment while fostering employee and workplace independence and autonomy. We are carrying out initiatives that address health in three priority areas: workplace, physical, and mental. The results of actions are reviewed every year and tied to further continuous improvements. Outside Japan, we are working continuously to improve employee health in ways that fit the situation at each company. Occupational health and safety laws vary by country and region, so each overseas affiliate manages employee health based on local law. Health Action 2020: Three Key Areas and Actions Health and safety obligations ･ Overwork prevention Creation of a pleasant workplace ･ Workplace harassment prevention ･ Teamwork & energy ･ Encourage individual skills Workplace health W Physical health Mental health Weight E E Eat P Exercise Prevention Self care Prevention We Step activities T S Take a step forward Treatment Smoke Prevention, education, -free early detection/ treatment, recurrence prevention W: Weight control E: Exercise Appropriate S: Smoke-free eﬀorts Training, assignment, T: Treatment/ checkup consultation support E: Eating smart P: Prevention/ promotion Recognized for Health Management Excellence for the Third Consecutive Year In February 2019, Seiko Epson was recognized for the third consecutive year under the Certified Health and Productivity Management Organization Recognition Program (White 500), in the large enterprise category. Now in its third year, the program, which is jointly administered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Nippon Kenko Kaigi, honors enterprises who work with insurers to promote good health and productivity. To earn certification, a company is evaluated on the basis of 23 sets of criteria, such as whether it works with a health insurer, whether an occupational physician and/or public health nurse are involved in planning ways to promote good health and wellbeing, whether it sets concrete targets or plans for promoting health and preventing overwork, and whether it has taken action to protect employees from passive smoking hazards. Epson satisfied all the criteria. In a questionnaire used for certification, Epson earned particularly high marks for things such as the involvement of executive management, scheme building, measures specifically targeting at-risk individuals, and the verification and improvement of measures effectiveness. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 151 Mental Health Initiatives Seiko Epson and its group companies in Japan cite mental health as a key area and have introduced initiatives that are focused on prevention and on fostering strong personal relationships in a vibrant workplace culture. Training We have offered ongoing mental health training since 2000. We give group training for new employees, mid-level employees, and others in senior staff and management positions. Certain online courses have been designed for all employees. Also, employees gather together to read out loud from a mental health textbook. One example of training is “Around 35: Mental Health for the Prime of Your Career.” This course is for employees who are around 35, an age at which their role in the company tends to change and when there are often important changes in their personal lives. The course helps them to better understand themselves, deal with stress, and maintain their own personal mental health. Between the 2012 and 2018 fiscal years, 2,175 employees have taken this course, which has been run a total of 181 times. Consultation System Our business sites have health management offices, where medical professionals (occupational physicians, nurses, and clinical psychologists) offer employees advice on mental and physical health issues. Industrial counselors are on duty in our employee counseling offices. They provide all types of advice as well as career counseling to help employees achieve selfrealization and chart their careers. Stress Checks Since 2004, all employees undergo an occupational stress evaluation when they take their annual physical examination. Medical professionals and industrial counselors follow up with employees found to be highly stressed. The primary purpose is to help employees manage their stress. This evaluation facilitates early detection and early treatment of mental health issues. Since December 2015, Japan’s Industrial Safety and Health Act has required certain employers to offer stress checks to employees. In response, we revised the content of our evaluation to meet the new legal requirements and enacted a Group standard for the stress check system, which is overseen by the safety and health committees of domestic Group companies and sites. We have conducted stress checks in line with this standard since 2016 and, since 2017, have provided a stress analysis report to each department and supported efforts to improve the workplace environment. Recurrence Prevention Employees whose mental health troubles have caused them to take time off from their jobs can benefit from our back-towork program. Since FY2007, the program has helped smooth the transition back to the workplace and avoid recurring troubles. Depending on their situation, employees may meet with medical professionals and industrial counselors, working with them as a team to plot their approach. Moreover, the employee’s primary care physician, workplace manager, and human resources department work together closely to provide better support. In FY2016 we updated the back-to-work program and extended the maximum length of leaves of absence due to personal injury or illness from 18 months to 30 months so that employees can focus on recovery and recuperation. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 152 Providing a Clean, Smoke-Free Work Environment We have been stepping up actions to protect employees from harm caused by both active and passive smoking. In 2016, we began to gradually reduce the number of smoking areas at our sites in Japan and to move them outdoors. Furthermore, in April 2018, we banned smoking during working hours, except for during the lunch break. We have also been helping employees to quit smoking by drawing their attention to associated risks on World No Tobacco Day, offering professional counseling, and fully subsidizing the cost of treatment at a smoking cessation outpatient clinic. The additional actions we have taken since FY2016 have accelerated the rate at which employees in the domestic Epson Group have quit smoking. Whereas the percentage of smokers declined by 2.6% over the five years from FY2011, it has declined by 3.2% since FY2016. In FY2018, the percentage of smokers dropped to 22.4%. Epson is prepared to implement additional measures to promote a smokeand odor-free work environment.

To eliminate infectious disease-related plant closures, we have been taking action since 2009 to ensure that our people are alert to infectious diseases and that they practice measures to prevent their spread in the workplace. In 2017, we stepped up our inspection and improvement programs at our overseas manufacturing companies to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Epson Group companies around the world maintain their own business continuity plans (BCP) to control risks associated with emerging infectious diseases. These BCP are tailored to their specific needs and serve not only to protect their employees but to minimize harm and ensure the continuity of business operations. Life-Saving Training Seiko Epson provides first aid training in Group companies in Japan to prepare personnel to provide effective first aid and care in a medical emergency involving cardiopulmonary arrest. Executives and other personnel have been given hands-on training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). As of the end of March 2019, approximately 13,300 employees had received training. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 153 Fire and Disaster Prevention Epson is committed to fire safety and disaster management. Our independent fire brigades help to protect lives and property. Epson Disaster Prevention Day falls on the last work day of each August. We hold fire and disaster drills and practice extinguishing small fires to help minimize damage in the event of a wide-scale disaster. The actions both increase our preparedness and heighten employee awareness. Formation of Independent Fire Brigades Epson has had independent fire brigades in place for 64 years. The first brigade was formed in 1955, with 15 employees dedicated to protecting their factory from fire. As our business has grown, so has the number of fire brigades. There are now approximately 900 employee firefighters active at business sites in Japan and at facilities around the world. Fire brigades train year-round to protect life and company property. Members of the Group’s first independent fire brigade (1955) Purpose and Significance of Independent Fire Brigade Initiatives • Regular training teaches members about firefighting techniques and skills and raises their safety awareness so they can take immediate and proper action in an emergency. This is part of company safety education. • Initiatives help employees take the lead during fire or natural disasters. Members help to ensure personal safety (relief work) and minimize damage to facilities and equipment (initial fire-fighting). • Employees who learn about safety and firefighting techniques and skills become key members of the workplace to instruct others there. They model fire/disaster prevention and safety for all employees, which raise workplace awareness of the same. • Initiatives to fight fire enhance communication. Fire brigades are a good place to foster friendships between members from different departments, develop character, and cultivate human resources. Fire Brigade Competitions Epson has held a fire brigade competition annually in September that gives brigade members around the world a chance to demonstrate how quickly they are able to take the proper action in an emergency and to demonstrate their skills in extinguishing a small fire. About 700 people in 42 teams, including 15 from overseas, took part in the 2018 Competition. The 42 teams consisted of 22 in the small pump division, 12 in the A men’s small pump team preparing for sprayindoor fire hydrant division, and eight in the bugle band division. The high level of fire ing water safety awareness was evident from the seriousness with which the teams competed in bad weather, showing that the spirit to protect lives and property under which the brigades were first formed is alive and well. The entire Epson Group will continue to improve our fire and disaster prevention and management programs.

Toward this end, we have appointed multiple outside directors. We have also established a Director Nomination Committee and a Director Compensation Committee to serve as discretional advisory bodies for the Board of Directors. Epson will continue to enhance the effectiveness of its corporate governance by further improving the supervisory function of the Board of Directors and by enhancing discussions at board meetings, as well as by speeding up decision-making in management as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. Principles of Corporate Governance 1. Respect the rights of shareholders, and secure equality. 2. K eeping the interests of shareholders, customers, communities, business partners, employees and other stakeholders in mind, work in an appropriately cooperative manner with them. 3. Disclose company information as appropriate and ensure transparency. 4. Directors, Executive Officers, and Special Audit & Supervisory Officers shall be aware of their fiduciary responsibilities and shall fulfill the roles and responsibilities expected of them. 5. Epson shall engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders. Corporate Governance Structure Seiko Epson (“the Company”) has established itself as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee with the aim of strengthening the supervision and monitoring of management and of speeding up decision-making by separating the management supervision and execution of operations. The main corporate management bodies and their aims are described below. Board of Directors The Board of Directors, with a mandate from shareholders, is responsible for realizing efficient and effective corporate governance, through which the Company will accomplish its social mission, sustain growth, and maximize corporate value over the medium and long terms. To fulfill its responsibilities, the Board of Directors supervises general operations to ensure that operations are fair and transparent. The Board of Directors also makes decisions on important business affairs of the Company, such as decisions on the formulation of important business matters, such as the establishment of management plans and business plans and decision on investment projects that exceed a certain fixed amount of money. The Board of Directors is composed of 12 directors*1, including five Outside Directors. Meetings of the Board of Directors are, as a rule, held once per month and as needed. The Board of Directors makes decisions on basic business policies, important business affairs, and other matters that the Board of Directors is responsible for deciding as provided for in internal regulations. Business affairs that the Board of Directors is not responsible for deciding are delegated to executive management, and the board monitors these. The Company is speeding up business decision-making as a company with an Audit & Supervisory Committee. To increase the agility of business, the scope of business affairs delegated by the Board of Directors to executive management has been expanded, so that the Board of Directors focuses only on the most important measures. The Company has further improved the supervisory function of the Board of Directors by specifying in the Corporate Governance Policy that at least one third of the members of the board should be Outside Directors. *1 As of June 30, 2019 Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 155 Audit & Supervisory Committee The Audit & Supervisory Committee, with a mandate from shareholders, is responsible for independently and objectively auditing and monitoring the execution of Director duties and for ensuring the sound and sustained growth of the Company. The Audit & Supervisory Committee establishes criteria for properly evaluating potential External Financial Auditors. After selecting External Financial Auditors, the Audit & Supervisory Committee verifies whether External Financial Auditors possess the necessary independence and expertise. In addition, the Audit & Supervisory Committee conducts audits in cooperation with internal audit departments and Financial Auditors. The Audit & Supervisory Committee is composed of four Audit & Supervisory Committee members*1, three of whom are Outside Directors.

As an advisory body to the Board of Directors, the Compliance Committee is composed of Outside Directors and Directors who are Audit & Supervisory Committee members. It is chaired by the full-time member of the Audit & Supervisory Committee, and meetings are held once every six months and as needed. A Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) is chosen by the Board of Directors to oversee and monitor the execution of all compliance operations. The CCO periodically reports the state of compliance affairs to the Compliance Committee. Director Nomination Committee & Director Compensation Committee A Director Nomination Committee and a Director Compensation Committee, in which Outside Directors make significant contributions, serve as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors. The purpose of these committees is to ensure the transparency and objectivity of selections for Director, Executive Officer, and Special Audit & Supervisory Officer, as well as their compensation. Outside Directors comprise the majority of both committees, which also include the Representative Director/ President and the Director in charge of human resources. Directors who are full-time members of the Audit & Supervisory Committee can attend meetings of either Committee as observers. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 156 Corporate Strategy Council The Corporate Strategy Council is an advisory body to the President. It was created to help ensure that the right decisions are made based on the advice and views of executive management. Meetings of the Corporate Strategy Council are held to discuss important matters that affect the entire Epson Group and matters brought up before the Board of Directors. The Corporate Strategy Council is composed of Directors, Executive Officers, and Special Audit & Supervisory Officers.

Are Directors nominated based on megatrends and the direction in which the Company should aim? Furthermore, we established a discussion time at the Board of Directors meeting, and analyzed and evaluated its effectiveness. As a result, we confirmed that the Board of Directors as a whole was found to be functioning effectively. Based on that, we have identified the following issues in order to improve effectiveness in the future: 1. Improvement of succession plans (including pooling of successor candidates and creating supplementary systems) and further improvement of the process of nominating Officers 2. C larification of the management framework (skill set) for realizing the Management Philosophy and long-term corporate vision (Directors and Executive Officers) 3. Sharing of the effectiveness evaluation results of the Audit & Supervisory Committee in the Board of Directors meetings, and implementation of recommendations from the Audit & Supervisory Committee to the Board of Directors based on the audit results * Regarding a. above, even in the current situation where the President is the chairman, we have positioned it as a mediumterm issue in the future, instead of considering it as an issue in fiscal 2018, because free and open discussions were held based on the Outside Directors’ opinions. * Regarding the evaluation by third party organization conducted in fiscal 2017, it was not implemented in fiscal 2018, because it is the Company’s policy to implement it once every three years. In the future, we will work to further improve effectiveness by addressing these issues. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 163 Commitment to Governance Organizational Governance Internal Control System Epson’s Management Philosophy outlines the vital business principles to which the global Epson Group is committed, while Epson’s Principles of Corporate Behavior describes the conduct required to live up to these principles. Epson has established the basic concept of internal control of the entire group in the Basic Internal Control System Policy, and Epson takes actions to steadily improve that across the entire Epson Group. Group Governance The Epson Group is managed based on the concept: global consolidated responsibility of product-based divisions; and global responsibility of the Head Office supervisory functions. The head of the business operations divisions take the responsibility for the business execution systems of subsidiaries. And the head of Head Office supervisory sections take the responsibility for Group-level corporate functions. With this system, Epson strives to streamline operations throughout the Epson Group, including subsidiaries. Compliance and Risk Management Epson’s goal is to continuously create value that exceeds customer expectations while building trust with all stakeholders based on the company’s Management Philosophy. To maintain and strengthen this trust, Epson seeks to increase management transparency and fairness, ensure effective management through faster decision-making, and appropriately manage compliance and risk. Because of that, we conduct various types of monitoring and supervise activities under the following organization. There were no compliance-related issues that are subject to timely disclosure in the 2018 fiscal year. Compliance Organization Seiko Epson transitioned to a company with an Audit & SuCompliance Organization Chart pervisory Committee after receiving approval for the move at Report & opinions Board of Directors its June 2016 general shareholders’ meeting.

Whistleblowing Systems and Reporting Channels Epson is committed to maintaining effective whistleblower systems and has installed internal and external compliance hotlines and other advisory and support services to facilitate the reporting of potential compliance issues. We have also provided reporting channels for use by our business partners, to quickly catch any potential compliance problems that could go undetected internally. The identity of whistleblowers is rigorously protected and reprisals of any type are strictly forbidden. Counseling and Support Services in Japan Epson helplines Harassment counseling Counseling related to overwork and long working hours Counseling for persons with disabilities Insider trading advisory service Antitrust (antimonopoly) advisory service Corruption (bribery) regulations advisory service Employee counseling Reporting contact for business partners Whistleblowing systems have been installed in all Epson Group companies worldwide. The use of these systems is monitored, and usage data are reported to a corporate management body and to Group companies in an effort to increase system effectiveness. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 165 Internal Audits Epson’s internal audit departments audit a total of 104 business units around the world, including operations divisions in Japan, 56 overseas subsidiaries, and 14 domestic subsidiaries. Audits are used to check compliance and the effectiveness and efficiency of their risk management, internal controls, and management methods. If issues are found, the Audit Office helps minimize business risks by conducting a follow-up audit to check the status of improvements. To ensure effective Group governance, the Office also centrally oversees internal audits conducted by auditors at regional headquarters in Europe, the Americas, China, and Southeast Asia. Business units come up for audit once every three years based on the Audit Office’s mid-range audit plan. In the 2018 fiscal year, the Audit Office performed 29 operational audits and 23 information system audits of Epson business units, and provided them with advice on correcting 170 items that required improvements. Internal Controls over Financial Reporting Every year, we audit internal controls to ensure the reliability of financial reporting (J-SOX). The Epson Group uses an autonomous distributed implementation system in which operations divisions and subsidiaries subject to external audits conduct a self-assessment on the design and operation of their internal controls, while the J-SOX Compliance Department ensures the validity of the assessment results. Operations divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates not subject to external audits are required to independently assess their internal controls and make such improvements as are necessary. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 166 Commitment to Governance Organizational Governance Initiatives of Internal Control Anti-Bribery/Anti-Corruption Basic Principles Epson’s Principles of Corporate Behavior include Principle 5: “Ensuring effective governance and compliance.” In Principle 5, Epson commits itself to eliminating all improper transactions, including those that involve bribery, corruption, cartels, and insider trading, and to pursuing fair, transparent, and free competition and appropriate transactions. In respect to employees, the Epson Group Global Code of Conduct breaks down the actions of the Principles of Corporate Behavior and describes the conduct expected of us as Epson employees. This document likewise affirms that we do not seek profit by improper means and urges employees to immediately report it to relevant departments if there is any conduct that presents a risk of violation. In respect to business partners, Principle 7 of the Principles of Corporate Behavior is “Working with business partners for mutual benefit.” This principle strictly forbids acts of bribery and collusion in our relationships with business partners and demands that our business partners also eliminate any illegal or unethical business practices. In addition, our Anti-Bribery and Competition Law Guidelines for Business Partners demand that business partners avoid the practice of business bribery and that they promptly notify concerned Epson companies if they discover any such act by an Epson employee. Epson Group Anti-Bribery Regulation The Epson Board of Directors is committed to preventing any bribery on the part of Epson. To that end, in 2014 we established a system to prevent bribery, along with rules to be followed. These make up the Group regulations that apply to all Group companies. The regulations state that Epson employees must not offer bribes to public servants and the like. Moreover, we establish a bribery prevention system, for which the President is ultimately responsible. Under this system, supervisory departments take various measures to prevent bribery. Anti-Bribery Activities One of our designated priority company-wide serious risks is a violation of Anti-Bribery Regulation. As a prevention initiative, we draw up and execute plans to suppress the risk of bribery and corruption. We monitor the progress of this work and evaluate the effectiveness of bribery suppressing efforts. Epson’s department responsible for compliance conducts our bribery prevention activities as based on Epson Group AntiBribery Regulation. The wide-ranging activities cover 12 areas, including entertainment and gifts, donations, hiring and internships, penalty, education by external experts, agent management, sponsorships, and procurement management. The various supervisory departments work together to tackle the risk of bribery. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 167 Compliance Permeation Activities To ensure that compliance awareness permeates the Group, Epson provides online courses, training, and more on a regular basis to both general administrative managers and employees, in keeping with the Epson Group Global Code of Conduct. We invite outside experts to give instruction in compliance training courses for executive management. We also provide compliance online courses and compliance training by internal instructors for all employees. At our affiliates outside Japan, our efforts include giving compliance trainings that reflect local conditions. Every October is “Compliance Month” at Epson and this is to help each employee recall the importance of compliance to the realization of the Management Philosophy. During this period each year, we run events for the entire Group, including subsidiaries outside Japan, to raise compliance awareness based on our Management Philosophy and Principles of Corporate Behavior. Specific activities include: 1) the release of Compliance Messages by the Chief Compliance Officer and persons in charge of each business divisions/group companies, 2) the publishing of feature stories on compliance in the company newsletter, 3) initiatives to spread information about the Epson Group Global Code of Conduct, and 4) giving compliance training. These and other activities are meant to raise compliance awareness. When the “Compliance Month” is over, we conduct a survey about these initiatives. We total and analyze survey responses as to participants’ opinions and suggestions on each company’s or organization’s efforts and initiatives. This helps us check employees’ compliance awareness and collect feedback for the next year’s activities. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 168 International Trade Initiatives Epson is a multinational corporation with production centers, sales centers, customers, and business partners around the world. Smooth international trade operations are essential for delivering Epson products and services to customers in a timely manner. Meanwhile, we must observe numerous conventions and frameworks governing international trade that have been put in place to maintain international peace and security. To maintain compliance with these and to ensure smooth trade, Epson has established comprehensive systems and processes that have enabled Group companies to earn certification from the relevant authorities for compliance with international trade programs. (See the table below.) Certifications Program Company Program overview (certifying agency) Special general bulk The program grants a blanket license to export certain items (or Seiko Epson export license provide certain information) to certain destinations without an individual Corporation (Ministry of Economy, application if an export control system is found to be in place.

(US Customs) Certificate of AEO Exporter Certificate of AEO Importer Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 169 Business Continuity Management Epson has a solid business continuity management program in place. For many years we have taken action to prevent and manage disasters, but the program really got started in 2006, when we formulated a business continuity plan (BCP) for what was then our liquid crystal displays business. If a disaster or some other event impacts business at an Epson Group production site, our first priority is to ensure the safety of our employees. Next, we take steps to ensure continuity of the product supply so as not to inconvenience our customers. In order to provide a steady supply of products, particularly consumables and core components such as quartz and semiconductor devices, print heads, and small liquid crystal panels, we have preparations in place that allow us to limit damage, secure repair parts, switch to alternative producers, and restore operations in line with established procedures. We conduct exercises to check our procedures and ensure their effectiveness. Mission-critical IT systems and critical data that are essential for business continuity are consolidated in a robust data center, and backups are at the ready in the event of a disaster. We have secured multiple distribution routes to enable us to immediately switch to alternative routes in response to any disruption in international shipping and transport. In addition, our finance, accounting, public relations, and other key corporate functions have established BCPs so that business can continue in emergencies. Meanwhile, we ask the companies that make up our supply chain to strengthen their BCPs, and we check to see how established those BCPs are. We analyze the items we purchase, and we develop multiple sources for those that are most important. When we cannot secure multiple sources, we keep an inventory of goods on hand or try other means to ensure continuous production in the event that something should happen to a supplier. Every business and site in the Epson Group will continue to refine its BCP to ensure that it has the resilience to withstand threats to business continuity going forward.

In accordance with this basic policy on taxes, we are taking the actions below to maintain and improve tax compliance. 1. Tax governance • The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing tax risk, and Epson’s Chief Financial Officer is the responsible official of Group tax affairs. The group that is in charge of tax affairs reports and manages taxes is under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer. • Epson considers tax risk to be an important risk, and regularly reports such risks to the board of directors and the Corporate Strategy Council, which is composed of directors of the company. • Employees are trained in the tax-related regulations and business process standards that Epson has established to ensure that it properly fulfills its tax obligations. We conduct periodic internal tax audits and report the findings to top management and to the Audit & Supervisory Committee. 2. Monitoring tax affairs • We appropriately respond in a timely manner to changes in local tax systems and taxation trends through regular reporting among the group that is in charge of tax affairs and Epson’s local subsidiaries. • We enlist the support of tax accounting firms and other external experts for advice on taxes and for tax support in each country and region. 3. Tax planning and Tax avoidance • Around the globe, we strive to effectively use preferential taxation systems where possible in our normal business activities to ensure a suitable tax burden. • We do not transfer value created to low tax jurisdictions, and do not use tax structures intended for tax avoidance without the spirit of the law. 4. Dealing with uncertainty • Tax risk uncertainty is expected to increase as countries and regions around the globe strengthen their tax reporting obligations, tax audits, and tax enforcement. Epson controls tax risks by identifying situations that could potentially pose serious tax risks. 5. Transfer pricing taxation • Epson complies with local tax laws and OECD guidelines to control transfer pricing tax risks. We have established transfer pricing guidelines for the Epson Group to help ensure appropriate transfer pricing transactions. In line with these transfer pricing guidelines, we control the profitability range of our global subsidiaries to ensure that transactions are made at arm’s length. • We use an advance pricing arrangement (APA) for transactions with subsidiaries in high-risk countries. 6. Anti-tax haven rules (also known as Japanese Controlled Foreign Company rules, or “CFC”) • Epson sets up foreign subsidiaries to carry out its ordinary business activities, but does not do so in “tax haven” jurisdictions to avoid taxes. When anti-tax haven rules apply, Epson properly files and pays taxes. 7. Relationships with tax authorities • Epson strives to work in good faith with tax authorities and to maintain and improve good tax corporate governance. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 171 Commitment to Governance Organizational Governance Security Epson, in a code of conduct called “Principles of Corporate Behavior,” states “We will protect the security of people and corporate assets and exercise prudence in handling information, and maintain the security of management resources (corporate assets).” The company has put in place a system for ensuring the security of employees and visitors. Employees recognize the importance of security and follow good security practices. The company’s assets (financial, tangible, intellectual, brand, information, and other assets) are properly managed, and the assets of other parties are respected. We strictly control personal data and confidential information to prevent leaks. Information Security Epson has set forth essential information security principles and rules in a Basic Information Security Policy. The company is building an information security governance framework and fostering a corporate culture that reflect the importance and principles of good information security practices. Basic Information Security Policy (Please refer to page 236 of “Appendices”) Our business units (including Group companies) build and mainInformation Security Organization tain their own information security systems based on Group-wide Head Office President rules.

They have also earned ISMS Cloud Security Certification (ISO/ Departments IEC 27017) so that customers can use services with greater peace of mind. In addition, to raise employee awareness of the *1 Chief Information Security Officer importance of information security, we provide online courses in information security, conduct targeted email attack drills, and train managers to assess information security risks. These and similar actions are taken across the global Epson Group. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 172 Cyber Security We have in place a multilayer defense system to protect against cyber security threats. For example, we have installed a web application firewall to protect our public websites from external attacks. We have also installed a new type of anti-virus software on PCs that detects malicious behavior and shuts down attacks of all types before PCs can be exposed to danger. However, since threats to cyber security are becoming increasingly sophisticated and insidious, we are working with a security consulting firm to identify and shore up any Information Security Training at an Epson Group vulnerabilities in our existing security measures. Sales Company Personal Data Protection We at Epson are acting to protect the personal data of our customers, business partners, and employees to reward their trust and fulfill our social responsibility. Countries and regions around the world are establishing and amending laws and regulations governing personal data protection and privacy protection. The E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a prominent example. To accurately understand the nature of changes being made, Epson participates in an international privacy protection association and ascertains whether internal rules need to be revised. In addition, Epson Sales Japan and Epson Direct, domestic subsidiaries that handle personal data belonging to customers, manage personal data protection based on the PrivacyMark System. In FY2018, we offered three online courses in personal data protection to our employees: (1) a course in information security that all officers and employees are required to complete every year and that covers the basics, such as details about what constitutes personal data; (2) a course for employees who handle personal data on the job, which has been completed by a total of 15,850 individuals as of the end of March 2019; and (3) a course concerning the GDPR, which has been completed by a total of 9,727 individuals as of the end of March 2019. Epson has also installed a system that temporarily halts email before it is sent to external recipients. The system asks the sender to confirm whether the mail contains personal data or confidential information that can be sent to external recipients. In addition, PCs that store personal identification numbers are monitored for suspicious activity. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 173 Intellectual Property Protection Epson protects the rights to its proprietary technologies so as to support the smooth and ongoing development of its existing businesses and the development and growth of new businesses. These actions ensure that our IP portfolio contributes to corporate earnings. We also respect the rights of others and implement measures to prevent infringement of those rights. Anti-Counterfeiting Measures around the World To protect the trusted Epson brand, we actively seek to seize counterfeit goods and other fraudulent articles that infringe the Epson trademark or our other intellectual property rights before they reach consumers. We have set up anti-counterfeiting centers around the world that are staffed by people who monitor the goods produced and sold by manufacturers and retailers, and especially e-commerce retailers. We fight counterfeiting in a number of ways. For example, we share information with the police and other enforcement authorities to increase Participating in an IP protection conference organized by customs officials in China raids on counterfeiters. We educate customs officials to better enable them to recognize counterfeits and block their import and export. We also work with e-commerce site operators to halt the sale of imitation goods that violate our rights. The actions we take stop the distribution of counterfeit goods and help reassure consumers that the goods they buy are genuine Epson brand products. Educating customs officials and police about real and counterfeit goods in the UAE Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 174 Commitment to Governance Supply Chain CSR Supply Chain CSR Vision Supply Chain CSR Vision Epson aspires to be an indispensable company, one that seeks to build mutually beneficial relationships with all its business partners, including suppliers, by asking them to uphold the highest standards of integrity and ethics while, at the same time, respecting their autonomy and independence.

The Epson Group Procurement Guidelines were created in 2005 to inform suppliers about Epson’s procurement policies and requirements. In 2008, the Epson Supplier Code of Conduct was added as an appendix to the Epson Group Supplier Guidelines. Epson’s Code of Conduct was based on the code of conduct created by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), now called the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). The Epson Group Procurement Guidelines reflect international requirements. They are intended to help ensure that our suppliers work with us as partners to meet quality, cost, and delivery (QCD) obligations and maintain compliance with requirements in areas such as human rights, labor, the environment, ethics, and health and safety. Rev. 4.0, released in November 2018, is the latest version of the Epson Group Procurement Guidelines. The content was revised to maintain consistency with the latest RBA Code of Conduct. The Epson Supplier Code of Conduct is now a major part of the Procurement Guidelines and will be available in multiple languages. Over the 15-year history of the Guidelines, we have asked our key suppliers to signify their consent to Epson’s requirements by signing a Supplier Agreement. The six language, Japanese, English, Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese and Thai, are available on the Epson website. Requirements Under Supplier Code of Conduct The Epson Supplier Code of Conduct, which is part of the Epson Group Procurement Guidelines, is based on the RBA Code of Conduct. It specifies requirements in the areas of labor, health and safety, environmental, management, and ethics.

We work with suppliers to make improvements as appropriate depending on their score and the gravity of noncompliance incidents. The SAQ is based on site audit criteria of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) but also includes criteria that are unique to Epson. Major suppliers (those representing 80% of the spend) and single-source suppliers are required to complete an SAQ as Epson critical suppliers. Suppliers deemed high risk based on their SAQ scores are audited by an independent organization under the RBA’s Validated Audit Program to foster improvement. To ensure that evaluations are fair and efficient, Epson created the Epson Group Detailed Supplier Evaluation Guideline to clarify SAQ and audit procedures. Since 2015, Epson has evaluated direct suppliers (suppliers of product materials) and indirect suppliers (suppliers of supplies, services, etc.) in alternate years but plans to evaluate them annually starting in 2020.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 181 Results of Detailed CSR Evaluation In 2018, we evaluated direct suppliers. We asked 333 critical Tier 1 suppliers (those representing the top 80% of spend and single-source suppliers) to complete the SAQ. We received completed questionnaires from 312 of them. We also asked Tier 2 suppliers to complete the SQA when the Tier 1 supplier was a trading company. A completed SQA was returned by 132 of Tier 2. For critical Tier 1 suppliers that were deemed to be high risk, we verified the facts on-site and supported corrective actions to help them improve to medium risk or better. As a result of these actions, the average score of suppliers who fell into the high-risk rank on the 2016 SAQ improved by 15 points on the 2018 SAQ.

Audit and Corrective Action Epson supports the corrective action efforts of high-risk and medium-risk suppliers. In FY2018, support took the form of audits and on-site verifications. Audit In 2018, Seiko Epson retained an experienced and qualified organization to audit a key supplier in the Philippines. (This third-party audit conformed to the Validated Audit Program of the RBA.) The auditors found the supplier to be high risk. The supplier responded by establishing a corrective action plan and is now working to improve conditions. Two suppliers who were audited in 2017 were found to have met their corrective action commitments. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 182 On-site Verification and Support for Corrective Action For suppliers that are not asked to receive a third-party audit, Epson manufacturing company staff members visit their sites to verify conditions on-site and help them improve. Through these activities, we not only help them address CSR issues but also support them when they struggle in other areas, such as in introducing fire prevention measures or establishing business continuity plans. Japan Other area Third Party Audit 0 1 On-site verification 38 210 Evaluation of Emergency Response Capabilities Epson is working to improve its ability to effectively respond to threats and to ensure business continuity. When a natural disaster or other unforeseen event strikes an Epson production site, the first thing we do after securing the safety of personnel is to act to restore the supply of products to our customers. It is essential for the entire supply chain to be able to effectively respond to emergencies so that we can fulfill our responsibility to customers by restoring the supply of goods within the target period if the supply should be interrupted by a disaster, accident, or epidemic. Epson therefore evaluates the emergency response capabilities of suppliers every year and helps them remedy issues as needed. Supply Chain Business Continuity Management To help manage business continuity and improve resilience throughout the supply chain, Epson operates in line with supply chain BCM guidelines. These guidelines are consisted of the five function, which are suppliers, production, sales, logistics, and procurement. Supply Chain BCM Procurement function (Alternate procurement) Supplier function Production function Sales function Supplier Production sites Sales sites Customers Logistics function Epson is working with suppliers to ensure that they establish their own BCP systems so that the supply of parts to Epson is not disrupted. We ask Tier 1 suppliers to evaluate their own BCM capabilities every year, provide feedback, and help them remedy issues as needed.

Supply Chain Environmental Initiatives As declared in the Epson 25 Environmental Statement, Epson seeks to contribute to the development of a sustainable society by leveraging its technologies to reduce the environmental impact of products and serDeliver Use vices across their life cycles. Reducing the environmental impact early in the life cycle, at the procurement stage, is a particularly important issue, and one that Epson is addressing in cooperation with suppliers. Recycle Create & Reuse Think Choose GHG Emissions Targets Epson has set greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets in line with an approach championed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The SBTi has validated Epson’s 2025 targets for scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions measured in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Epson’s validated target for scope 3 emissions, which are emissions from an organization’s value chain, is to reduce GHG emissions as a percentage of business profit out to 2025. Response to Climate Risk There is a shared global awareness that climate change poses serious and urgent business risks that must be addressed. Epson has suppliers across Asia, including in Thailand, where severe floods are a regular occurrence, and in China, where there is high potential water risk. Epson recognizes that interrupted or delayed deliveries from suppliers due to floods and droughts, two typical climate risks, could seriously impact the manufacture and sale of Epson products and need to be addressed to avoid inconveniencing customers. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 184 Supplier Support Initiative Under its supplier engagement program, Epson asks suppliers to complete a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ). Suppliers are sorted by risk level based on their SAQ score and given feedback on the results. Epson helps high-risk suppliers improve through on-site verification and audits. Moreover, to encourage the pursuit of environmental sustainability, Epson selects the suppliers who account for 80% of the value of Epson’s procurement spending and, in conjunction with a detailed CSR evaluation, asks them to report the amount of water and the amount of electricity, gas, and other sources of CO2 emissions actually consumed for parts they sell to Epson. Epson shares this data with its suppliers and engages them to help drive production line improvements that reduce the amount of electricity and water used and improvements that will reduce the environmental impact of transport. Partnerships with External Organizations Epson is a member of the following organizations that promote sustainable procurement through industry cooperation: • Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) • The Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), CSR Committee • The Global Compact Network Japan, Supply Chain Subcommittee Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 185 Commitment to Governance Supply Chain CSR Communication and Training Communications with Suppliers Annual Supplier Conference In addition to its commitment to delivering quality products, Epson believes that maintaining human rights, labor standards and environmental conservation throughout its entire supply chain is an important part of its corporate responsibility. Epson therefore considers all suppliers as important business partners. At an annual supplier conference, we explain our procurement policies. At the conference held in April 2019, we provided a general overview of our business situation and strategies, explained our initiatives and procurement policies, and asked for suppliers’ understanding and cooperation in improving quality, reducing costs, keeping strictly to appointed delivery dates, participating in CSR initiatives, promoting business continuity plan, and reducing environmental impacts. We consider annual supplier conferences to be valuable opportunities to capture supplier feedback. We host a separate social gathering to foster communication between suppliers and the Epson executive team, including the president of Seiko Epson. Supplier Conference for CSR At annual CSR procurement supplier conference (since 2016), we explain our CSR procuring activity and request to the supplier. In 2018, a lot of suppliers attended the CSR procurement supplier conference in various Epson manufacturing site such as Japan, China, and Indonesia. In the conference, we request to comply the Sustainable procurement policy and the Epson Procurement Guideline. And we explain the guidance for self-assessment (SAQ) of CSR detail evaluation and emergency response capabilities. In 2018, we introduce Environment SAQ as a basic supplier evaluation to reduce the environmental impact of products. We also ask to strengthen emergency response capabilities and conduct in each supplier.

Epson has thus committed itself to exercising high ethical standards and a social conscience, and Epson has declared that Epson will conduct its procurement activities in strict compliance with both the letter and spirit of laws and regulations in every country and region in which Epson operates. Epson considers the conflict minerals problem to be a major issue in terms of socially responsible procurement. Consequently, Epson does not use conflict minerals, as they are tied to human rights abuses, environmental destruction, and the funding of armed groups in high risk areas. Epson takes the actions below to exclude conflict minerals from Epson products. 1. Epson asks its suppliers to read and follow the Epson Group Procurement Guidelines and the Epson Supplier Code of Conduct. 2. E pson do survey its supply chain using a tool provided by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI, formerly known as the CFSI), a group that is working with enterprises to promote responsible mineral procurement. 3. To ensure that minerals are procured only from smelters and refiners that have been found to be compliant with the Conflict-Free Smelter (CFS) Program of the RMI, Epson asks smelters and refiners to obtain proof of compliance through the supply chain. 4. To ensure compliance with tougher future European Union regulations, Epson will do its due diligence to avoid using conflict minerals from high risk areas, in accordance with OECD guidance. Conflict Minerals Survey Program To conduct practical and appropriate surveys throughout Epson’s entire supply chain to check that Epson products are free from conflict minerals traced back to armed forces, Epson established the Epson Group Conflict Minerals Survey Guidelines as internal standards. These guidelines are based on Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Epson conducts surveys using the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) provided by the RMI to check for conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold), identify refiners on its supply chain, and confirms and assess the status of supplier initiatives related to conflict minerals. Epson then implements measures based on risk level. Epson also use socially responsible procurement supplier briefings and various other opportunities to promote understanding of Epson policies, request initiatives to improve survey accuracy, and share information on conflict minerals response trends. Epson will continue working with suppliers to eliminate conflict minerals that are tied to armed forces.

Around the world, greater efforts are being made to ensure legality and sustainability during the procurement of wood products. Epson has a stated procurement policy that says, “In every region where we do business, we promote procurement initiatives compliant with each nation’s law, international rules and the spirit of the same, cleaving to a high sense of ethics and acting for the good of society.” In keeping with this policy, Epson encourages procurement of paper products with due consideration for the social, economic and environmental sustainability of forests. Thus Epson manages its entire supply chain from the immediate supplier all the way back to the forest to ensure the legality, sustainability and environmental safety of the paper products we procure. We ask that suppliers fully understand the intent and nature of these initiatives and then give us their support. Stance on Procurement of Paper Products Epson has established a procurement policy for paper, the major forest product we procure. Under this policy, which is designed for the social, economic and environmental sustainability of the forest, Epson practices the following procurement whose conformity to this policy can be checked. 1. We make effective use of used paper and other recycled pulp. 2. When virgin is used as a raw material in paper goods we procure, we confirm its • legality • sustainability • chemical safety • environmental management Scope of Application At Epson, the Procurement Policy applies to the procurement of specialty paper for use in Epson printers. Content of Conforming Procurement Management Suppliers are asked to provide a Certificate of Conformity to Epson Paper Products Procurement Policy to confirm their compliance with the Procurement Policy. Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 191 Commitment to Society Corporate Citizenship Approach to Corporate Citizenship Epson is committed to harmonious coexistence with society through programs rooted in local communities throughout the world based on its commitment to being “an indispensable company, trusted throughout the world,” as stated in its Management Philosophy. Recognizing that companies are expected to be even more socially involved, each and every employee will continue to contribute to Epson’s standing as a good corporate citizen and facilitate mutually beneficial relationships. Epson’s contributions go beyond financial support. Epson emphasizes contributions involving the technologies and knowledge that underpin its business as a way to give something back to society.

Epson Group Sustainability Report 2019 195 Commitment to Society Corporate Citizenship Community Events 290 Days of Social Commitment (Germany) Epson Deutschland GmbH (EDG) has been running its “190 Days of Social Commitment” program since 2008. The program began when 190 EDG employees each took one day of paid leave at their own convenience to serve the community by volunteering their time at social welfare facilities or schools in the area around the Meerbusch office. EDG changed the name to “290 Days of Social Commitment” in the 2017 fiscal year because the number of employees had increased to 290. In FY2018, as part of this program, employees cooperated in a project to perform repairs on a local elementary school building and take residents of a home for senior citizens to an aquarium. Watch Assembly Class (Japan) Seiko Epson traces its roots to Daiwa Kogyo, a watch factory. Over the decades, we have developed world-class watch manufacturing technology and have master watchmakers (human capital). In FY2018, the city of Shiojiri, in Nagano prefecture, held a wristwatch assembly class to teach children the fun and enjoyment of creating products. Skilled watchmakers from Seiko Epson taught the children how to assemble part of a watch movement, mount the hour, minute, and second hands, and complete a watch so that it actually starts running. The children, who got to choose their own dials and bands, had fun assembling their own one-of-a-kind watch while also enjoying a sense of accomplishment and learning about a local industry. Lake Suwa Fireworks Festival Sponsorship (Japan) Seiko Epson helps to stimulate the local economy and community as a sponsor of the Lake Suwa Fireworks Festival. The festival, one of the largest in Japan, has been held every year since 1956 in the city of Suwa, a short walk from Epson headquarters.
