We are committed to making the UN Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our cooperative company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to sharing this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. This Communication on Progress builds on our annual business and sustainability report to our stakeholders from 2018, found in Swedish here. In the report much more can be found than what is included in this communication. Sincerely yours, Anders Lago President HSB Riksförbund (Federation of Cooperative Housing) 2019-12-10 2 ABOUT HSB HSB has worked for the good housing for almost 100 years.

Creating Value Our mission is to create the Good Living together with the members, focusing on what is beneficial for them as well as taking their influence and opinions into account. Everything we do is founded on taking responsibility for our residents as well for society in general. HSB meets the needs of the members of today and tomorrow. A growing number of HSB members give us an even better possibility to influence society in a positive way. HSB is taking our part of responsibility for the progress in society and a sustainable future. Our focus is on increasing the value of the HSB membership as well as the customer offering, compromising of a variety of services in housing. In addition, HSB aims to minimize the housing sectors footprint impacting the environment and climate. Strategy for sustainable growth In 2016 HSB put a Strategy for sustainable growth in place consisting of four overarching goals: • Resource efficiency HSB have sustainable and resource efficient member and business operation in 2023 that optimizes our contribution to sustainable development and reduces our dependence on limited resources. • Climate HSB have by 2030 close to zero climate impact and to be adapted to the changing climate. • Sustainable services and products HSB is a leading actor in the development of sustainable services and products in 2023. • Important community actor HSB is an important actor for the sustainable society in 2023 and reflects society's diversity and contributes to creating security/safety. 2019-12-10 HSB wants to contributes to sustainable development focusing on Agenda 2030 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We focus on the goals that are most relevant to our business and where together with our members, customers and suppliers we can make the most positive difference and reduce negative impact. As a company in the housing and construction industry, we direct our efforts to support the global development goals number 5 and number 7-13. We also contribute to three of the sixteen Swedish environmental quality goals: Good built environment, Limited climate impact and Non-toxic environment. 3 DESCRIPTION OF PRACTICAL ACTIONS AND OUTCOMES In this section we describe practical actions that HSB has taken to implement the Global Compact ten principles and the outcomes as well as our own strategy. Find out more here. 3.1 HUMAN RIGHTS Sustainability and human rights throughout the supply chain HSB has high ambitions in terms of taking responsibility for and working with sustainability and human rights throughout the supply chain. With many suppliers, this is a challenge. Therefore, we place clear demands on quality, environmental and social responsibility assurance on our partners. The housing market in Sweden has traditionally a high proportion of supplier collaborations. HSB has national framework agreements with about 130 different suppliers, for example in building management and new production of housing. For several years, when procuring new suppliers nationally within HSB, a thorough supplier and risk assessment is used to ensure that they meet HSB's requirements. All suppliers are allowed to answer a self-assessment questionnaire which includes, among other things, how they work with the environment, human rights, working conditions and anti-corruption. The self2019-12-10 assessment survey is in line with HSB's common Code of Conduct for partners and suppliers, which was adopted in a renewed form by the board of the national HSB federation in 2017. HSB conducts follow-up surveys of all national framework contract providers every three years. At least once a year, HSB meets the framework contract suppliers where sustainability (including human rights) requirements in the agreements are followed up. In the stakeholder dialogue, requests were made for HSB to carry out sustainability audits, which we now review. If discrepancies are detected, we require that they will be corrected and we introduce closer checks to ensure results, if necessary also with the supplier's subcontractors. If the deviation is large and we do not see an opportunity for rapid improvement, the supplier is replaced. We had no reported deviations during 2018. HSB's associations and companies are recommended to work with the goal that all HSB's suppliers are sustainability-guaranteed in 2023. In 2018 90 percent of all HSB's frame contract suppliers were sustainability-assured. 15 out of 31 HSB associations and companies have adopted HSB's common Code of Conduct for partners and suppliers. 6 HSB associations have their own Code of Conduct. In 2018, two HSB associations implemented HSB's national supplier assessment tool, which means that a total of 9 HSB associations and companies had implemented the tool at the end of the year. We have received requests from suppliers for greater coordination between national and local agreements, and to get more regional associations to join the framework agreements, which we work with continuously. A major challenge is to ensure that the third and fourth tiers of the supply chain work in a sustainable way. Suppliers are expected to sign the Code of Conduct and implement routines to ensure compliance, but also have routines to ensure compliance with the requirements in their own supply chain and sub-contractors. HSB is also an active participant in the development of social responsibility criteria for construction products, which has recently been developed within the industry-wide organization Byggvarubedömningen (a Swedish construction product assessment tool). 3.2 LABOUR Labour rights in the supply chain For several years, when procuring new suppliers nationally, a supplier and risk assessment is used to ensure that they meet HSB's requirements. All suppliers are obliged to answer a selfassessment questionnaire which includes, among other things, how they work with environmental impact, human rights, working conditions and anti-corruption. The selfassessment survey is in line with HSB's common Code of Conduct for partners and suppliers, which they also are obliged to sign. A sustainable workplace is an attractive workplace We want HSB to be an attractive employer that also reflects the diversity of society. HSB shall be a developing, inclusive and safe workplace. In order to create the best conditions for our 2019-12-10 employees, we want them to have a safe work environment where employees feel comfortable and feel good. We work continuously and purposefully with leadership, security, equality and diversity. Among other things, it is about building an organization that reflects the general population and reducing the risk of workplace accidents and stress-related ill health. To follow up on how HSB's employees perceive their work situation, annual employee surveys are conducted. In 2018, a joint survey was conducted in which all HSB associations and national companies were invited to participate. A total of 13 HSB associations and 5 national companies participated (approximately 30% of HSB employees). The total NMI index (satisfied employee index) was 66. The total MMI index (motivated employee index) was 68 and the leadership index was 72. Work environment and safety To reduce the risks of workplace accidents in new construction, HSB has significantly improved the system of work environment work in recent years and places demands on a good work environment in our contracting agreements (both shared and total contracts). Follow-up is done at construction meetings. Requirements are also set for renovation, but there is no joint management or follow-up. In 2018, the previous years' commitment to a good and safe work environment in new production continued. A comprehensive risk inventory has resulted in an action plan for an even better working environment in the coming years. A working environment tool has been introduced to report risk observations and incidents more efficiently and thus provide a better follow-up basis. In new production, we have also implemented guidelines for solitary work, threats and violence during the year. To minimize negative stress and sick leave, proactive work in health and wellness is an important issue. Continuous follow-up on health and wellness is done through systematic work environment work at the respective HSB association and companies, through, among other things, introduction to new appointments, protection rounds, employee surveys, employee interviews, and follow-up of key figures. Diversity and equality At HSB we believe in diversity, which is why our goal in 2023 is to have the same proportion of foreign-born in our boards, management and among employees as in society as a whole. Diversity is one of HSB's common goals in one of our steering documents HSB's compass. Today, diversity and gender equality issues are handled mainly by the respective HSB association and companies. The gender distribution among HSB's 3448 employees was 58 percent men and 42 percent women in 2018. In the management groups for HSB's associations and companies, 52 percent were men and 48 percent women. 8 of 33 CEOs were women. On the boards of HSB's associations and companies, 59 percent were men and 41 percent were women. 13 out of 32 presidents were women. 2019-12-10 Annual salary surveys to ensure fair wages and remuneration are carried out at the respective HSB association and companies. In order to reflect society's diversity for HSB, the entire HSB reports from 2018 the number of employees and elected representatives with foreign backgrounds in management, the board and among employees. Foreign background is defined as foreign-born and / or domestic-born with two foreign-born parents and the reporting is done according to Statistics Sweden's method for statistics on foreign / Swedish background. 29 out of 32 HSB associations and companies have reported. In total, 16 percent of employees, 5 percent in management and 4 percent of the board have foreign backgrounds. This can be compared with the proportion of people registered between 20-64 years in Sweden with a foreign background, which according to Statistics Sweden was 28,4 percent in 2018 (the proportion of foreign-born persons was 24,2 percent). 2019-12-10 3.3 ENVIRONMENT Climate HSB's overarching goal is to have by 2030 close to zero climate impact and to be adapted to the changing climate. HSB's goal for the year 2023 is to reduce the climate impact by 75 percent from the base year 2008. In 2018, HSB as a whole has reduced the climate impact by -52.5 percent, for the KPI kgCO2e/Atemp(m2), compared to 2008. The result is due to: • transition to renewable electricity, about 95 percent of bought electricity is renewable • investments in photovoltaics – at the end of the year 2018 there were a total of 6,35MW of installed effect and in 2020 HSB will invest in Sweden’s largest photovoltaics park on 20MW installed effect. • efficiency of electricity use -20 percent for the KPI kWh/Atemp (m2) • less climate impact from district heating, -33 percent for the KPI kgCO2e/Atemp (m2) related to district heating • phasing out of some remaining oil boilers • renewable share of energy use for fuel in the vehicle fleet is 35% and electric cars are being implemented HSB calculates emissions according to the international standard Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

This may include the HSB association having a formulated environmental policy, environmental action plan and conducting regular environmental training. 8 HSB associations are environmentally certified according to ISO 14001 and 3 have an diploma from the Swedish Environmental Base standard. 2019-12-10 HSB makes material choices and works to reduce the amount of potentialy hazardous substances in building materials and products. In new production, building materials are assessed in the web tool Byggvarubedömningen, which is a standard for environmental assessment of construction products. In 2018, more focus was placed on building up knowledge about the climate impact from the materials in the framework and foundation of the building. We are also working on phasing out hazardous chemical substances in chemical products used in the management of housing with the webtool Chemgroup. HSB's ambition is that all new production shall be certified according to Miljöbyggnad, grade Silver (Miljöbyggnad is an environmental certification system for buildings owned by Sweden Green Building Council). Certification according to Miljöbyggnad gives an independent assessment of important qualities of a building in terms of energy, indoor environment and materials. In 2018, 67 percent of HSB finalized new production projects achieved a certification according to Miljöbyggnad building grade Silver. HSB Living Lab Innovative and smart solutions are an important puzzle piece in the future of sustainable society and good housing. To be at the forefront, HSB conducts an innovation project, HSB Living Lab, together with, among other things, Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg. At HSB Living Lab, around 30 people live permanently, while the entire house is a laboratory where research is ongoing around the clock. It is a unique test bed where research is done in a real living environment. So far, about 70 projects have started in HSB Living Lab in everything from sharing economy, energy efficiency, better water management and digitization to circular economy and building materials.

In order to counteract corruption, we require, in the Code of Conduct and Agreements, that our suppliers have zero tolerance against corruption and taking and giving bribes. They must also have established routines to prevent irregularities in their own operations, consultants and subcontractors. We also want the suppliers to train their own employees about anti-corruption and business ethics. Code of Conduct for employees In 2017, the board of the national HSB federation adopted a common Code of Conduct for employees, which provides support for actions when we represent HSB and our members from a business ethical perspective, such as what constitutes a fair and undue benefit and how to promote and safeguard the market's interest in efficient and sound competition on equal terms. 19 of 31 HSB associations and companies have adopted the common Code of Conduct. 7 HSB associations have their own Code of Conduct. All employees must follow the Code of Conduct and be informed of it at the start of employment. During the spring of 2019 an e-learning training in the Code of Conduct for all employees, elected representatives and consultants has been conducted. This gives every employee a common foundation and confidence in their actions when we represent HSB and our members in business-related situations. Contents of the training are also developed in collaboration with the Swedish anti-corruption Institute. During 2018, a whistle blower function was also implemented. Based on HSB's basic values, it is in HSB's interest that business-harmful phenomena come to light and can be handled. Such phenomena are incompatible with the HSB way to run our business in a long-term sustainable and responsible way.
