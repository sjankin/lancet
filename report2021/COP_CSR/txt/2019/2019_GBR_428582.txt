This impacts the reporting of the proportion of revenue that comes from clients who engage with us on sustainability and our carbon emissions per unit of reported revenue for the restated years. The proportion of revenue that comes from clients who engage with us on sustainability has been revised to 13.4% (from 14%) for 2017, and 11.0% (from 11.4%) for 2016. As outlined under 102-49, our carbon emissions methodology was updated in 2018. The new figures utilise the restated revenue figures. Please see our Annual Report & Accounts for a Reporting Practice summary of the restatement. 102-49 Changes in reporting After meeting our 2020 carbon emissions reduction target in 2017 we reviewed our methodology for estimating carbon emissions and set a new emissions reduction target. As part of this review, we adopted full market-based scope 2 reporting. This includes the use of residual mix emissions factors in markets where we consume renewable energy. In addition, we had previously estimated scope 3 emissions by adding 15% onto our total emissions. We no longer make this estimate as the methodology behind it lacked verifiability. Our new per head emissions reduction target encompasses our scope 1 and 2 emissions only. It is based on a science-based target setting methodology. It is our aim to expand scope 3 reporting and set targets for material categories. 102-50 Reporting period About our reporting – page 52 102-51 Date of most recent report 12 Sustainability reporting centre 102-52 Reporting cycle 12 About our reporting – page 52 102-53 Contact point for questions regarding the report Sustainability contacts 102-54 Claims of reporting in accordance with the About our reporting – page 52 GRI Standards 102-55 GRI content index 12 GRI Index – pages 53-56 102-56 External assurance 12 Independent Limited Assurance Statement – page 57 201: Economic Performance 201 Management approach 8 Roles and responsibilities – page 50 GRI 103: Management approach Attracting and retaining talent – who’s in charge? – page 21 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed 8 Annual Report & Accounts – Financial statements Quantifying our impacts – page 7 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and 8, 13 Governance, strategy and risk management opportunities due to climate change disclosures for the Taskforce on Climate-related Economic Performance Financial Disclosures 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the 8, 10 Diversity and inclusion – page 26 local community 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported 8, 11, 17 We provide pro bono services, donate money to charity and negotiate free media space on behalf of pro bono clients which can have a positive social impact.
