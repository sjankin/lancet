The basis for Lifco’s historical performance is a clear business strategy that is centred on earnings, simplicity and decentralisation. This strategy has been pursued successfully and consistently under Fredrik Karlsson’s leadership for over 20 years. My task is to work with all our skilled employees in the Group to continue to nurture our strong business culture and deliver sustainable long-term earnings growth and good cash flows. Earnings, simplicity and decentralisation Lifco’s primary goal is to increase its earnings every year. We have achieved this through organic growth as well as acquisitions. In 2018, EBITA* increased by 25.2 per cent to SEK 2,168 million, with acquisitions adding around 11 per cent and organic growth and foreign exchange effects contributing about 14 per cent. The good economic climate was a strong contributing factor behind our organic growth in 2018. By comparison, Lifco’s average annual EBITA* growth including acquisitions over the period 2006–2018 was 18.6 per cent. Last year, Lifco acquired nine businesses and in the year before that thirteen. To ensure sustainable earnings growth, the Group takes a long-term approach to the companies it acquires. We look for companies that are profitable and have achieved stable growth over an extended period of time. Ideally, we like to buy companies that are market leaders in their niche and not overly dependent on individual suppliers and customers. We are happy for the existing management to remain active in the company, as they are the ones who know the market and the business. We are strongly decentralised, and the companies enjoy a high degree of independence. Our goal is for decisions to be made by the local management teams in the companies where the business is conducted. An important way of ensuring decentralisation in practice is to minimise central functions and resources. A safe haven Lifco has a unique advantage in that the Group offers a safe haven for small and mediumsized businesses. When we acquire companies, we do not target to divest the businesses in the future. Nor do we strive to realise synergies and have never relocated operations. The idea is that the companies should continue to operate as they did before becoming a part of the Lifco Group and thereby deliver steady earnings growth. Our approach to ownership is perpetual, which enables the subsidiaries to combine in a natural way a focus on earnings and cash flow with investments aimed at developing new products and increasing their selling power. Lifco’s decentralised business model, which allows for a high degree of autonomy in the subsidiaries, is a key factor when we negotiate with potential acquisition candidates. In many of the acquisitions that have been made in recent years, Lifco’s clear and simple corporate culture – a culture that has proved its worth over time – has been crucial in persuading the entrepreneur to sell their life’s work to Lifco. Sustainable business It is essential to the success of our decentralised business model that the Group has a clear and shared view of how to run a sustainable business. We have compiled our ethical principles in a common Code of Conduct for the Group that covers our 4,900 employees in 29 countries. Our Code of Conduct covers the company’s 6 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, society and the environment as well as shareholders. To be able to deliver with the highest quality and service level in its niche over the long term, a company needs to run its business in a sustainable manner. This means, for example, that the employees need to be offered good terms and that the company’s suppliers need to meet the criteria for sustainable business. Lifco’s management regularly monitors compliance with the Code of Conduct and takes immediate action in case of any deviations. In December 2016, Lifco signed up to the UN’s sustainability initiative, Global Compact, to show our support for internationally accepted business ethical standards and our longterm commitment to sustainability issues. As a member, we have undertaken actively to implement the Global Compact’s ten principles for sustainable development in the areas Per Waldemarson of human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. President and CEO Strong cash flow A constant focus area for us is the Group’s cash flow and changes in capital employed in our businesses. Cash flow from operating activities increased by 15.6 per cent in 2018, to SEK 1,533 million. The long-term objective is to ensure stable dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio of 30–50 per cent of earnings after tax. For 2018, the Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 4.60 per share, which is an increase of 15.0 per cent on 2017 and equates to 30.1 per cent of earnings after tax. Market-leading niche companies The Lifco Group encompasses many successful businesses and strong brands. Our Dental business area, which sells consumables, equipment and technical service to dentists, has long had a strong position in distribution to dentists in northern Europe. Our Demolition & Tools business area includes Brokk, a world-leading manufacturer of demolition robots, and Kinshofer, a leading supplier of crane and excavator attachments. Systems Solutions includes for example market leader Silvent, which has unique expertise in compressed air dynamics, and Haglöf Sweden, a world-leading supplier of instruments for professional forestry surveyors. Today Lifco is a global group with operations in three continents. Over the period 2006–2018, Lifco made 63 acquisitions and built a strong European presence as well as significant positions in North America and Asia. A financially strong group Financially, Lifco still has significant scope for further acquisitions. Our target is to maintain net-interest bearing debt* in a range of 2–3 times EBITDA*. At year-end, net debt stood at 1.6 times EBITDA* before acquisition costs, which gives us ample space to continue to grow through acquisitions when the right opportunities present themselves. The most important factor for Lifco is our employees. Today, we have 4,926 employees in 29 countries. Many of our employees have worked for a long time in our subsidiaries and their accumulated experience Is Lifco's most Important success factor. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all our employees for their valuable contributions in 2018. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 7 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Directors’ Report Business concept and goals Lifco’s business concept is to acquire and develop market-leading niche businesses with the potential to deliver sustainable earnings growth and robust cash flows. The company’s strength lies in its ability to offer a safe haven for small and medium-sized businesses. Lifco is guided by a clear philosophy centred on long-term growth, a focus on profitability and a strongly decentralised organisation. Financial targets and dividend policy Lifco’s primary goal is to generate sustainable earnings growth. The Group and subsidiaries’ goal is to ensure that organic EBITA* growth exceeds GDP growth in the relevant geographic markets over the course of a business cycle. Additional growth should be achieved through acquisitions. Efficient use of capacity is another important goal for Lifco. Return on capital employed excluding goodwill and other intangible assets should exceed 50 per cent for the last twelve-month period. The net-interest bearing debt* should be in the range of 2–3 times EBITDA*. The long-term objective is to ensure stable dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio of 30–50 per cent of after-tax earnings. A decentralised organisation Lifco consists of 146 subsidiary companies, which are organised in about 30 operating units. The operating units operate in eight divisions, which in turn form part of the three business areas: Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. This decentralised organisation is one of the cornerstones of Lifco’s governance philosophy. The individual subsidiaries are given a large degree of freedom, which encourages a strong entrepreneurial spirit. As the subsidiaries are managed independently, each company is able to retain its specific culture. They can also continue to employ the methods that are used in the industries and markets in which they operate. A strong entrepreneurial spirit is one explanation for the Lifco Group’s ability to retain key individuals in the companies which it acquires. In many cases, the key individuals are attracted by Lifco’s decentralised structure, which allows them to maintain a high degree of independence also after the acquisition. Minimal bureaucracy Lifco has developed a model for developing its subsidiaries. The model is based on Lifco’s philosophy, which is centred on earnings, decentralisation and a long-term approach. It is the fruit of many years’ experience of building businesses. In simplified terms, the model can be described as follows: • Motivated and dedicated heads of subsidiaries • Minimal bureaucracy and simple processes • A focus on customers with the potential to generate sustainable earnings growth • An efficient cost structure with a focus on value-creating functions • Monthly monitoring of the subsidiaries’ income statements and balance sheets with a focus on EBITA, changes in capital employed and cash flow A clear acquisition strategy Expansion through acquisitions is a key element of Lifco’s business concept. The Group acquires companies that can form new divisions as well as companies that add to and ex8 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 DIRECTORS’ REPORT EMPLOYEES 4,926 COUNTRIES 29 COMPANIES The map shows the countries where Lifco has employees. 146 Lifco’s acquisition process Identify takeover candidates Analysis Post-acquisition action plan Takeover candidates are identified through various Lifco looks at the company’s position of While acquired companies have a high degree networks, mainly through the subsidiaries.

An acquisition must either generate profitable growth and good cash flows or meet a strategic objective. The risk taken by Lifco must also be limited. Takeover candidates must meet the following criteria: • Stable business • Leading in its niche • An attractive position in the value chain without being dependent on specific suppliers or customers • Limited or no exposure to technological risk • Documented profitability • Conduct a sustainable business Lifco may decide to make an acquisition even if the five first criteria have not been met if the company offers attractive strategic or financial opportunities. Lifco does not acquire companies which are considered to violate the UN Global Compact’s principles on human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption. Nor does Lifco acquire companies which manufacture or sell weapons, tobacco, fossil fuels or uranium. A high ethical standard and sustainability Lifco's focus is to create prerequisites for a sustainable value creation in the subsidiaries. A fundamental requirement for the decentralised structure is that the subsidiaries operate in accordance with Lifco’s ethical principles. The ethical principles are set forth in the Code of Conduct, which all subsidiaries are required to follow. Compliance with the code is monitored regularly by senior management. The Code of Conduct also includes Lifco’s core values: respect for others, openness and pragmatism. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 9 DIRECTORS’ REPORT Financial results 2018 was another year of solid growth for Lifco. Net sales and earnings improved, mainly through acquisitions and organic growth.

Average capital employed excluding goodwill increased over the year to SEK 1,312 (1,155) million while EBITA* in relation to average capital employed excluding goodwill was 165 (150) per cent at year-end.

Lifco sells dental technology to dentists in the Nordic countries and Germany, and develops and sells medical record systems in Denmark, Sweden and Germany. The business area also includes a number of manufacturers which produce denture attachments, disinfectants, saliva ejectors, bite registration and dental impression materials, bonding agents and other consumables that are sold to dentists through distributors around the world. A stable, non-cyclical market Dental care is a significant market, accounting for around 0.5 per cent of GDP in Lifco’s main markets. The European market for dental care is stable and relatively non-cyclical and has historically grown modestly. A dental clinic needs a large number of products, ranging from consumables such as tissues and gloves to advanced technical equipment such as X-ray machines and dental chairs. Lifco fills an important role in the dental market by bringing together a large number of suppliers in what is otherwise a fragmented market. The market for dental care products can be divided into consumables, equipment and technical service, and dental technology. Consumables account for around 70 per cent of total sales. Demand for consumables is non-cyclical and is characterised by small but frequent orders, which requires a high level of delivery reliability and a broad product range. Demand for equipment is relatively stable and depends mainly on the age of the installed equipment, the length of the replacement cycle and the number of dental clinics. Shared warehouses Although Lifco’s subsidiaries mostly operate independently of each other, they collaborate to some extent on goods purchases. Lifco has three central warehouses for consumable goods, located in Enköping in Sweden, outside Aarhus in Denmark and in Büdingen, Germany. The Enköping warehouse offers around 44,000 products, the Danish warehouse 18,000 and the German warehouse 58,000. Lifco as a whole offers products from about 500 suppliers. A part of the range consists of own brands, which mainly comprise less complex products. Own brands account for around ten per cent of net sales in the subsidiaries. Lifco is working actively to increase the share of own brands. In dental technology, Lifco operates mainly in Germany but also in the Nordic countries. Lifco provides most of the products, including crowns and bridges, which are made in China, the Philippines and Turkey. This enables Lifco to achieve cost advantages over local dental laboratories. Lifco handles the central parts of the process, such as dental prosthesis design and contacts with dentists. This ensures a high level of quality and proximity to the customers. Online sales Consumables are sold through three main channels: the subsidiaries’ sales forces, catalogue sales and online. Between 25 and 75 per cent of sales are made online depending on the market and subsidiary. The remaining orders are mainly made by telephone. 16 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 DIRECTORS’ REPORT NO SE FI DK ee UK DE US LT FR LV CZ CH AT CN HK IT HU SI PH The map shows countries with employees in the Dental business area.

Lifco is the world’s leading supplier of demolition robots and crane attachments. The company is also one of the leading global suppliers of excavator attachments. The operations are divided into two divisions: Demolition Robots and Crane & Excavator Attachments. Demolition Robots accounts for 40 per cent of the business area’s net sales and Crane & Excavator Attachments for 60 per cent. Demolition Robots Lifco’s remote-controlled demolition robots are sold under the Brokk brand. The machines are easy to manoeuvre and can be deployed without time-consuming preparations. They can also handle hot and stressful environments. The arms have a long reach, and a wide range of attachments increase the machines’ flexibility and applications. In addition to demolition, Brokk’s machines are also used for renovation of cement kilns and removal of linings. As the machines can be remote-controlled, they are suitable for use in elevated-risk environments such as nuclear power plants and for handling contaminated materials. The company’s main market is the global construction and demolition industry. Its sales follow the trend in the global market for construction machinery. The demolition robots are sold directly to the end customers or to selected distributors and agents. The components are produced by contract manufacturers and the products are assembled in Sweden. The company also has some production in Germany. Crane and Excavator Attachments Lifco’s crane and excavator attachments are sold under the Kinshofer, Demarec, Hultdins, Solesbee’s, Doherty, RF-System and Auger Torque brands. The attachments make it possible to use the same crane or excavator for different purposes. Typical applications include construction and earthworks, snow clearing, demolition, pipe and cable laying, forestry work, scrap handling and railway works. Sales of crane and excavator attachments largely follow global machinery sales. As purchasing an attachment from Lifco is a smaller investment for the customer than buying a new machine, the market is less cyclical than the market for construction machinery. Crane attachments are sold directly to the crane manufacturers while excavator attachments are sold mainly through resellers. The products are sold under Lifco’s brand or under the crane and excavator manufacturers’ own brands. 18 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 DIRECTORS’ REPORT NO SE CA UK NL DE US CH FR AE AT IT CN CZ SG au NZ The map shows countries with employees in the Demolition & Tools business area Earnings in 2018 Net sales by Net sales increased 24.7 per cent in 2018, to SEK 2,820 (2,261) million.

Construction Materials reported good sales and earnings growth in 2018 driven by acquisitions and organic growth. Interiors for Service Vehicles Lifco makes interior modules for vans and light commercial vehicles, including tool storage and other modules. The interior modules are made from a special type of steel which combines durability with low weight. The solutions can be used in practically all European-made light commercial vehicles. The division operates under the Modul-System and Tevo brands. The largest customers are in the energy and construction sectors. In 2018, Lifco acquired the car interiors business of Toolpack of Norway, which made Modul-System the leading player in the Norwegian market. Interiors for Service Vehicles saw strong sales growth in 2018, with increased profitability. Contract Manufacturing Under the Leab, Texor, Wintech and Zetterströms Rostfria brands, Lifco offers contract manufacturing of products that are used in a wide range of industries, including manufacturing and medical technology.

Management has defined the operating segments based on the information that is handled by the CEO and used as a basis for decisions on the allocation of resources and the evaluation of results. The results for the presented segments are assessed based on EBITA (earnings before amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition, acquisition costs, interest and tax). Revenue The Group’s material revenue streams attributable to the sale of goods comprise sales of dental products, tools and machinery, construction materials, interiors for service vehicles, environmental technology and equipment for the forest industries. The “dental products” revenue stream, which derives from the Dental operating segment, is generated from sales of products in the form of consumables and equipment for dentists. The “tools and machinery” revenue stream, which derives from the Demolition & Tools operating segment, is generated from sales of equipment to the construction and demolition industry, where the most significant products are demolition robots and tools for cranes and excavators. The “Construction materials,” “Interiors for service vehicles,” “Environmental technology” and “Forest” revenue streams, which derive from the Systems Solutions operating segment, are generated from sales of various products, such as machinery and equipment for electrical installations and electricity production, electrical equipment, LED lighting, interior design modules for vans and light goods vehicles, machinery designed to improve the environment, workwear, instruments for land surveyors and equipment for sawmills and pellet plants. No sales are made between the segments. The revenue from external parties that is reported to the CEO is measured in the same way as in the income statement.

Contract assets and contract liabilities The Group only has contract assets in the form of work in progress on another party’s account, which will henceforth continue to be recognised separately in the item inventories and is designated work in progress on another party’s account. Otherwise, apart from accounts receivable, there are receivables from contracts with customers whereby payment for the good or the service depends only on the time that has elapsed. Receivables from contracts with customers are recognised as a part of Prepaid expenses and accrued income on the line “Receivables from contracts with customers”.

Remuneration of senior executives Principles: The Chairman and other members of the Board of Directors receive Directors’ fees in accordance with the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting. Employee representatives do not receive Directors’ fees. Remuneration of the CEO and other senior executives consists of a basic salary, variable remuneration, other benefits and pension contributions. Other senior executives refer to the three individuals who, together with the CEO, make up the senior management team. For the composition of the senior management team, see page 37. The balance between basic salary and variable remuneration must be proportionate to the executive’s responsibilities and authority. Variable remuneration: For the CEO, variable remuneration is based on achieved results and is capped at 70 per cent of the fixed salary. For other senior executives, variable remuneration is based on outcomes in relation to individually defined targets. 56 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pensions: The minimum retirement age for the CEO is 60 years. Lifco sets pays an amount equal to 60 per cent of the CEO’s fixed salary (excluding payroll costs) into pension plans, capital redemption pension plans, and life and health insurance policies. Other senior executives are entitled to pension benefits of up to 35 per cent of their fixed salary and the earliest retirement age is 60. All pension benefits are vested, i.e. they are not contingent on future employment with Lifco. Termination salary: The employment contract of the CEO is terminable on twelve months’ notice in case of termination by the company and six months’ notice in case of termination by the CEO. The employment contracts of other senior executives are terminable on 12 months’ notice in case of termination by the company. The right to a salary and other benefits are retained during the notice period. Drafting and decision-making process: During the year, the Remuneration Committee submitted recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning principles for remuneration of senior executives. The recommendations covered the ratio of fixed to variable remuneration, and the size of any salary increases. The committee also proposed criteria for assessing bonus outcomes. The Board discussed the Remuneration Committee’s proposal and made decisions based on the committee’s recommendations. The remuneration payable to the CEO for the financial year 2018 was approved by the Board based on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. The remuneration paid to other senior executives was approved by the CEO in consultation with the Chairman of the Board. In 2018, the Remuneration Committee convened on two occasions.

The assumptions used in estimating value in use are the same for goodwill and trademarks. The recoverable amount for a cash-generating unit is determined based on calculations of value in use. These calculations are made using estimated future cash flows before tax based on five-year financial budgets that have been approved by senior management. Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate. The estimated growth rate is assumed to represent the growth rate in the fifth year, which is expected to be around 2 per cent for all operating segments in both 2018 and 2017. Assumptions have also been made for gross margin, overheads, working capital requirements and investment requirements. The parameters have been set to represent an annual growth rate of 2 (2) per cent for all operating segments. The pre-tax discount rate used is 9.4 (9.6) per cent for Dental and 9.4 (10.8) per cent for other the operating segments. The calculation as at 31 December 2018 shows that value in use exceeds the carrying amount for all cash-generating units. There is thus no impairment. Nor was any impairment identified as at 31 December 2017. Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis shows that the remaining goodwill value for all cash-generating units would remain warranted if the discount rate were raised by 1 percentage point or the growth rate, terminal growth or gross margin were reduced by 1 percentage point. LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 59 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Lifco’s reportable operating segments are Dental, Demolition & Tools and Systems Solutions. For the purpose of performing impairment tests, goodwill is allocated, with the exception of the reportable segments Dental and Demolition & Tools, to the five cash-generating units: Construction Materials, Interiors for Service Vehicles, Contract Manufacturing, Environmental Technology and Forest.

The carrying amount of defined benefit obligations is SEK 37 (36) million. For salaried employees in Sweden defined benefit pension obligations for retirement and family pensions under the ITP 2 plan are secured through an insurance policy with Alecta. According to a statement from the Swedish Financial Reporting Board, UFR 3 Classification of ITP Plans Funded through Insurance with Alecta, this is a multi-employer defined benefit plan. For the financial year 2018, the company has not had access to information that would enable it to account for its proportionate share of the plan’s obligations, assets and expenses. It has therefore not been possible to report the plan as a defined benefit plan. The ITP 2 pension plan secured through an insurance policy with Alecta is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution plan. The premium for defined benefit retirement and family pensions is calculated individually and depends on factors such as salary, previously earned pension benefits and expected remaining period of service. Contributions to ITP 2 insurance policies with Alecta in the next reporting period are estimated at SEK 12 (11) million. The collective funding ratio is defined as the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of its commitments to policyholders calculated using Alecta’s actuarial methods and assumptions, which do not comply with IAS 19. The collective funding ratio is normally permitted to vary between 125 and 155 per cent. If Alecta’s collective funding ratio were to fall below 125 per cent or exceed 155 per cent, it would be necessary to take measures that will enable the ratio return to the normal range. In case of a low collective funding ratio, one measure that can be taken is to raise the agreed price for new subscriptions and expansion of existing benefits. A high collective funding ratio can be addressed by introducing premium reductions. At the end of 2018, Alecta’s surplus, defined as the collective funding ratio, was 142 per cent (2017: 154 per cent). Lifco has made pension promises to two persons and in connection therewith purchased endowment policies which have been posted as collateral for the pensions of these employees. Under the arrangement, the individuals concerned will receive the value of the endowment policies less payroll tax. As there are no guaranteed remuneration levels, the Group’s net obligation will always be zero. These endowment policies are considered to be plan assets and are recognised on a net basis after deducting the obligation. 64 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 26 Provisions Restructuring SEK million Guarantee reserve reserve Premises costs Other provisions Total 1 January 2017 48 1 1 12 62 Additional provisions 19 1 2 4 26 Acquisition of companies 1 7 8 Utilised during the year -10 -1 -2 -6 -19 Reversal of unused provisions -12 -12 Reclassifications 3 -3 Translation differences 1 1 31 December 2017 47 1 4 14 66 of which, short-term provisions 27 1 4 4 36 of which, long-term provisions 20 10 30 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 year 27 1 4 4 36 Within 3 years 8 8 Within 5 years 11 9 20 After more than 5 years 1 1 2 31 December 2017 47 1 4 14 66 1 January 2018 47 1 4 14 66 Additional provisions 29 1 7 10 47 Acquisition of companies 10 10 Utilised during the year -5 -1 -6 -15 -27 Reversal of unused provisions -20 -1 -21 Reclassifications -2 2 Translation differences 2 1 3 31 December 2018 51 1 7 19 78 of which, short-term provisions 30 1 6 5 42 of which, long-term provisions 21 1 14 36 Anticipated outflow date Within 1 year 30 1 6 5 42 Within 3 years 8 1 4 13 Within 5 years 12 10 22 After more than 5 years 1 1 31 December 2018 51 1 7 19 78 The warranty provision is based on outstanding commitments at the balance sheet date and the calculation is based on previous experience. Other provisions refer mainly to commissions to agents in the Dental business area. In addition, the Group has other contingent liabilities of SEK 198 (107) million. As it has been deemed that no outflow of funds will take place for these commitments, no provisions have been made. See also information in Note 30. Note 27 Transactions with related parties Transactions between Lifco AB and its subsidiaries, which are associated companies of Lifco AB, have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Sales of products and services between Group companies are subject to commercial terms and conditions and made at market prices. Intercompany sales were SEK 3,234 (2,511) million during the year. Carl Bennet AB owns 50.1 per cent of the shares of Lifco and is deemed to control the Group. Other related parties include all subsidiaries in the Group as well as senior executives in the Group, i.e. the Board of Directors and senior management. Lifco AB, the parent company of the Lifco Group, has not purchased administrative services from Carl Bennet AB during 2018 (2017: SEK 1 million). One of the Directors, Erik Gabrielson, is partner in Avokatfirman Vinge which has received 5 (8) MSEK for ongoing legal advice.

Note 31 Business combinations Nine new businesses were consolidated during the year. The acquisitions comprised all shares of Denterbridge, ERC Systems and Spocs as well as majority shareholdings in Computer konkret, Dental Direct, Rhein83 and Wexman. Through asset deals, Lifco also acquired the assets of Toolpack’s Norwegian car interiors business and Flörchinger Zahntechnik. The purchase price allocation includes all acquisitions made in 2018. Acquisition-related expenses of SEK 14 million are included in administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year. Since the respective consolidation dates, the acquired companies have added SEK 371 million to consolidated net sales and SEK 73 million to EBITA. If the businesses had been consolidated as of 1 January 2018, net sales for the year would have increased by a further SEK 213 million and EBITA would have increased by a further SEK 37 million.

There were no repurchased shares held as treasury shares by the parent company during the period. SEK million 2018 2017 Profit attributable to parent company shareholders 1,389 1,084 Weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares 90,843,260 90,843,260 Earnings per share (SEK) 15.29 11.94 After dilution: Earnings per share after dilution are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares for the dilutive effect of all potential ordinary shares. There were no potential dilutive ordinary shares in 2018 or 2017. Earnings per share were thus the same before and after dilution. Note 33 Dividend per share Dividend payments made in 2018 and 2017 totalled SEK 363 million (SEK 4.00 per share) and SEK 318 million (SEK 3.50 per share), respectively. At the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2019, the Board will propose a dividend for the financial year 2018 of SEK 4.60 per share, resulting in a total distribution of SEK 418 million. The proposed dividend has not been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. Note 34 Sales of subsidiaries No sales were made in the financial year 2018 or in 2017. Note 35 Events after the end of the reporting period On 3 January, it was announced that Lifco had acquired Indexator Rotator Systems of Sweden, which develops and manufactures rotators, mainly for the forest industry. The company generated net sales of around SEK 300 million in 2018 and has around 140 employees. Indexator Rotator Systems will be consolidated in the Demolition & Tools business area. On 23 January, it was announced that Lifco has acquired Hammer of Italy, which delivers hydraulic breakers and other demolition equipment for excavators. The company generated net sales of around EUR 20 million in 2018 and has about 100 employees. Hammer will be consolidated in the Demolition & Tools business area. The individual acquisitions will not have a significant impact on Lifco’s results and financial position in the current year. A preliminary purchase price allocation will be presented in the interim report for the first quarter of 2019. On 7 February 2019, Fredrik Karlsson stepped down as CEO and President and from his seat on the Board. On 8 February, Per Waldemarson was appointed President and CEO. At the time of his appointment, Per Waldemarson was Deputy CEO of the Lifco Group.

The parent company applies other accounting principles than the Group in those cases which are indicated below. Format The format prescribed in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act is used for the income statements and balance sheets. The income statement is divided into two statements: one for profit or loss and one for comprehensive income. The parent company has no items which are accounted for as other comprehensive income. Total comprehensive income is therefore the same as net profit for the year. The statement of changes in equity follows the format used in the Group but contains the columns specified in the Annual Accounts Act. The formats for the parent company have different names than in the consolidated financial statements, primarily with regard to financial income and expense, provisions, and items in equity. 72 LIFCO ANNUAL REPORT 2018 PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment. Cost includes acquisition-related costs and any additional considerations. When there is an indication that an investment in a subsidiary is impaired, an estimate is made of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses are recognised in the items “Profit/loss from investments in Group companies”. Financial instruments IFRS 9 is not applied in the parent company. Instead, the parent company applies the points stipulated in RFR 2 (IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, points 3–10). Financial instruments are measured at cost. In subsequent periods, financial assets acquired with the intention of being held short term will be recognised in accordance with the lowest value principle, at the lower of cost and market value. On every balance-sheet date, the parent company tests whether there are any indications of impairment of any of the financial fixed assets. An impairment loss is recognised if the decline in value is adjudged to be prolonged. Impairment losses on interest-bearing financial assets recognised at amortised cost are calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the present value of executive management’s best estimate of future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss for other financial fixed assets is established as the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of fair value less selling expenses and the present value of future cash flows (which is based on executive management’s best estimate). Leases All leases, both finance leases and operating leases, are classified as operating leases. Revenue Other operating income in the parent company includes costs billed to subsidiaries. Group contributions Group contributions paid and received are both accounted for as appropriations in the income statement. Note 38 The parent company’s sales to and purchases from Group companies During the year, the parent company invoiced the subsidiaries SEK 48 (89) million for group-wide services. The parent company has not purchased services from subsidiaries.
