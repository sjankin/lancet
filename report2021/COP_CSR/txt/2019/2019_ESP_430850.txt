2018 Sustainability Report Memoria de Sostenibilidad 2018 03 Content Guide Chairman’s Statement 04 Iberia company profile 07 Governance and stakeholders 33 Sustainable operations 43 Materiality 59 Appendix Content 63 Global Reporting Initiative Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Statement from Luis Gallego, Executive Chairman 2018 has been a year in which once again we have made progress, in transforming our company, in all areas. Innovation and digitalisation have played an outstanding role, with the incorporation into our fleet of the new generation A350 aircraft in one of the most significant achievements. We also took delivery of the first A320neo, included new functionalities in iberia.com (with the voice playing a major role), and launched a digital press app for our customers, among other initiatives. In addition, we renewed our Premium lounges, and inaugurated flights to San Francisco, as well as increasing the frequency of flights to several destinations in our network, focusing on Latin America and Japan; internally, we launched the Plan person@ and the Diversity Plan. All these initiatives form part of what we have called the Virtuous Circle, where financial results, customers and people are part of an inseparable and interdependent whole. If we focus on our financial performance, 2018 has been a positive year; we have achieved operating profit of 437 million euros, representing an increase of 61 million euros over the previous year, with an operating margin adjusted by leasing of 10%. GRI Content [102-10, 102-14] 2018 Sustainability Report 05 As I said at the beginning, the incorporation of the A350 to our fleet was a great achievement in 2018. This aircraft provides efficiency for the company, is more environmentally friendly and offers customers better service. This new-generation aircraft represents a great technological leap forward. In 2018, we received two of these aircraft; four will arrive in 2019 and a further 14 will reach us by 2023. The short and medium haul fleet is being renewed thanks to the A320neo; this aircraft is quieter and more advanced and efficient, with lower CO2 and NOx emissions (50% less in the case of NOx), and at the same time incorporates new benefits for customers, such as USB connections available in all rows, and new seats which make it possible to offer more space we are also incorporating these seats into the rest of our short and medium haul aircraft. We have a firm order for 20 A320neo aircraft, the first two of which were received in 2018. Innovation is not only present in the new fleet. In phase 2 of our Future Plan, digital transformation is a crosscutting project which affects the entire company, our employees, equipment and processes, and our customers. We launched 35 specific projects which materialised in 2018. We want the experience to be 100% digital and to achieve total connectivity. We want an internet connection to be permanently available for our customers, as well as in the airport, the aircraft and the maintenance hangars. We have incorporated new concepts of communication and payment platforms, onboard WiFi, virtual and augmented reality, and digital press, etc. But this is only the beginning. As for our people, in 2018 we launched the Plan person@, centring on personal and professional development and recognition for the individuals who make up Iberia, focussing additionally on diversity and inclusion. In short, we have continued working on the company’s transformation so that once the challenge of survival has been met, we can set ourselves a greater challenge: excellence. Luis Gallego GRI Content [102-10, 102-14] Memoria de Sostenibilidad 2018 07 Iberia company profile Achievements Every day is the first day. The maxim we follow Safety in all operations is our commitment to Excellence 2018 in figures Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Achievements The most outstanding achievements in 2018 The arrival of our new-generation fleet, the A350-900 aircraft In 2018 we received the first two A350-900 of an order of 16. These are new-generation, long-range (14,800 kilometres) twin-engine aircraft, which consume 25% less fuel than other, similar aircraft, emit 25% less CO2 , therefore, and are much quieter. The delivery flight from Toulouse to Madrid was carried out using a mixture of biofuel. The new aircraft have 348 seats spread through three cabins, with 31 in Business Class, 24 in Tourist Premium and 293 in Tourist. The layout of the spaces throughout the plane, with integrated galleys among other features, has made it possible to increase the space devoted to passengers, as well as providing greater capacity for their hand luggage in all three cabins. All seats have individual, à la carte entertainment, connectors for recharging personal devices and KU-band WiFi. The aircraft has seven temperature control zones, which will allow the temperature to be regulated differently in the different sections of the plane. The windows, one for each row of seats, are panoramic and the lighting is based on LED lights. The arrival of the A350-900 also entails a new way of understanding Iberia’s flight operations, such as eOperations, which enables us to use the digital information about the flight in electronic form, and to integrate the plane’s onboard systems with its Operations and IT infrastructure. The company and all its employees are meticulously preparing to receive the new aircraft. Between September 2016 and July 2018, we undertook more than 270 activities relating to purchasing materials, tools and ground equipment; training for crews and aircraft maintenance technicians; flight, maintenance and engineering operations; and technical documentation. The names we have chosen for them pay homage to significant Spanish individuals and entities, such as Plácido Domingo, Paco de Lucía and the Prado Museum. GRI Content [102-10] 2018 Sustainability Report 09 Achievements The most outstanding achievements in 2018 Technological leap forward in short and medium haul as well Iberia has also made a considerable technological leap forward in its shortand medium-haul fleet with the arrival of the first two A320neo of an order of 20. This is an aircraft for shortand medium-haul routes, and is the most advanced, most efficient and quietest, and the most environmentally friendly, as it emits 5,000 fewer tonnes of CO2 a year and 50% less NOx. It can accommodate 186 passengers, and boasts wider aisles, more knee room, a USB connection in all rows and reclining seating which can connect to the electrical network in Business Voice, taking centre Class. stage in the digital Aviation is the theme followed by the names of the Airbus A320neo, such as Patrulla Águila and Getafe transformation at (the cradle of Spanish aviation), the names given to the first two units received by Iberia of this model. Iberia Among the initiatives we are developing to improve our customers travelling experience, there is a commitment to voice-based options to Four-star airline facilitate communication and simplify many of the interactions with customers. In line with this goal, Last year, the Airline Passenger Experience the airline is in Alexa, Aura and Google’s assistant, Association (APEX) included Iberia among its 4-star and has launched its chatbot. airlines thanks to the positive ratings given by passengers. The APEX ranking is highly prestigious, These virtual voice services are part of the huge as it is drawn up taking into account anonymous digital transformation project the company is opinions collected from over 500,000 flights. undertaking, which is based on four key pillars: The aspects surveyed included in-cabin service, customers, employees, efficiency in operations and entertainment and seat comfortableness. the search for new ventures. Digital transformation reaches the entire company Digital transformation is one of the crosscutting initiatives of Iberia’s Future Plan; it affects all the areas, the process, the people and customers. For Iberia, digital transformation calls for a good balance to be struck between internal transformation (digital culture, new working methods which are more agile, collaborative, creative, etc.) and opening up to the outside (e.g., start-ups, new businesses and innovation). Among other initiatives, in recent months, we have become actively involved in “voice commerce” with the development of an accessible chatbot at iberia.com; the launch of the Iberia skill in Amazon’s assistant, Alexa; and its presence in Google Home, Google Assistant and, very soon, the Movistar platform as well. In addition, Iberia has been a pioneer in introducing virtual reality as part of the available onboard entertainment. Many of these projects have been developed in conjunction with start-ups, which has also allowed the company to adapt to new ways of working. GRI Content [102-10] Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Achievements The most outstanding achievements in 2018 Broadband WiFi We have installed the 2Ku broadband system on our A330-300 and A340-600 aircraft, thus offering greater connection speeds and even making streaming possible. It is available for flights to the United States and Latin America. New Dalí Premium Lounge Following the refurbishment of the Velázquez Premium Lounge one year earlier, in 2018 the Dalí Premium Lounge, located in T4 at the Madrid airport, underwent a thorough makeover in order to improve the travel experience for its users, providing more space, connectivity, an improved culinary range, and more room for showering and resting, among other benefits. As part of our commitment to the environment, we have put in place a project to reduce plastics and waste in our Premium Lounges, by replacing plastic with returnable glass, and individually packaged items with loose items, among other initiatives, which will be explained later. Direct flights to San Francisco In April 2018, Iberia inaugurated its direct flights to San Francisco. This route was initially launched as a seasonal option for the summer season and offered three direct flights a week with A330-200 aircraft, the only non-stop flights between Spain and the Californian city. Iberia began flying to the United States of America in 1954 and currently operates direct flights to New York, Miami, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Juan, Puerto Rico. In addition, in codeshare with its partners it offers flights to 103 additional destinations. Increased frequency of flights to Tokyo Since October 2018, we have been offering five direct flights per week to Tokyo, two more than before. This will allow us to offer 150,000 seats on this route over 2019, up by 60% compared to 2017. The onboard service features Japanese details, such as menus based on Japanese cuisine, publications and films in Japanese and cabin crew who are from the country. Iberia began flying to Tokyo in 2016. GRI Content [102-10] 2018 Sustainability Report 11 Achievements The most outstanding achievements in 2018 Flights to Los Angeles, Dubrovnik and Zagreb throughout the year Three routes, which started out as seasonal routes just for the summer season at the time, became routes run throughout the year in 2018. The three destinations are Los Angeles in the US and Dubrovnik and Zagreb in Croatia. In this way, Iberia continues to offer greater connection opportunities for its customers in its destination network. 60 years flying to Colombia Iberia began flying to Bogotá on 6 July 1958. Since then, we have been increasing the number of flights to and from Colombia, which in 2018 rose to 340,000 seats a year, spread over one direct flight a day between Bogotá and Madrid and three flights scheduled per week with Medellín. One of the best-known anecdotes about this route from its 60-year history was the birth of a baby on board on 14 November 1999. Supporting Spanish culture Since the very beginning, Iberia has been characterised by its support for the culture and values of Spain, and the events which have most contributed to increasing its visibility around the world. As part of the #Talentonboard project, Iberia participates with the Prado, ThyssenBornemisza, Reina Sofía and Guggenheim museums. It supports the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and Photo España. We are also patrons of the Teatro Real and Liceu theatres. Furthermore, we lend visibility to numerous artistic expressions through our entertainment channels and magazines, as part of this project. In a new venture, in 2018 Iberia participated in the Meninas Madrid Gallery urban art exhibition. Teresa Helbig designs the new uniforms Barcelona-based designer Teresa Helbig was chosen from among 30 candidates to create the new uniforms for the company’s personnel. Using navy blue as the predominant colour, her design combines the traditional hallmarks of the company with its new image. The design will therefore combine both classic and contemporary aspects, while remaining elegant and practical. This is the first time a woman has designed the uniforms for Iberia. GRI Content [102-10] Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Every day is the first day The maxim we follow We have a successful track record; however, we do not settle for what we are, rather we strive to get better and outdo ourselves every day. Thinking what we have already accomplished is very good won’t lead us on to achieve our goal. That is why we believe the only way to become better is to work every day as if it all still remains to be done. This is our attitude and the way we face each day to offer the best of ourselves. GRI Content [102-16] 2018 Sustainability Report 13 Safety in all operations is our commitment to excellence For a company such as Iberia, committed to serving society, safety – understood in a global, positive and humanistic way – is a basic pillar. This is an ongoing process which affects all the areas at horizontal level and the entire organisational structure at vertical level. But, above all, it is a way of being and of acting. A philosophy which is leading to the implementation of the most sophisticated, latest developments, whether in the area of technology, in interconnection via the internet of all the processes and systems, in understanding the environment in which we are acting, and in the application of predictive programmes or projects specially aimed at prevention. Safety should extend to users, naturally; but it must begin from within, through recycling and individualised, ongoing training programmes which make it possible to maintain a team which is prepared at all times. Building a responsible, safe organisation is not a fad it is a characteristic which identifies us and enables us to make progress, through processes for continual improvement with their corresponding roadmaps.

We have renewed 80% of the motorised fleet in the last four years, and incorporated alternative energies; in fact, almost 40% of the equipment which can be run on electricity is electric, which has led to a very significant reduction in emissions and in fossil fuel consumption. More than 96.6 million passengers assisted in all the stations in the national network, 6% up on 2017. Around 58 million items of luggage handled, 2% up on the previous year. In 2018, we assisted 62,936 unaccompanied children. Go-up! is a macroproject from Iberia Servicios Aeroportuarios to make handling a more efficient, digital and sustainable activity. It covers 130 iniciativas, including: Kepler System. This is a tool which serves to plan, manage and assign our resources in real time. The aim is to gain efficiency and competitiveness through the incorporation of mobile technology in all areas and at all levels. In 2018, we implemented this tool at the airports in San Sebastián, Pamplona and Vigo and it is scheduled to be installed in the remaining Spanish airports in 2019. The BRS system. It enables detailed information to be obtained about the luggage items loaded on each flight, ensuring baggage traceability. This system is already implemented in the major airports in the national network; Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Palma de Mallorca, Málaga, Las Palmas, Tenerife Sur and Alicante.

Faithful to its basic principles, it is firmly committed to innovation and analyses the opportunities offered by new technologies applied to the business, with the goal of offering its customers a catalogue of services at the cutting edge of the sector. Training and jobs for young people was another of our priorities in 2018, with initiatives such as the implementation, in conjunction with the Madrid Autonomous Region, of a new advanced vocational training course in aeromechanics, thanks to which 40 students gained skills and work experience at Iberia’s facilities in La Muñoza, near Madrid’s airport. In addition, we inaugurated a new continuous training centre in the Engine division (NEXT – New Engine X–perienced Training), where 90 employees received training last year. These activities combine with many others aimed specifically at aiding maintenance mechanics to build their careers inside Iberia.

Iberia was the third most punctual airline in Europe for on-time flight arrivals, sixth in the world and the first in Spain, according to FlightGlobal, the leading consultant for real-time flight information, with more than 82% of its flights arriving on time. Iberia Express came top in the worldwide punctuality league table for the fifth year running in the low-cost segment, with 86.5% of its flights arriving on time. Iberia and Iberia Express achieved these positions in a particularly difficult year for the European aviation industry, which experienced serious air traffic control issues due to labour disputes and airspace saturation.

The key factors which had a positive impact on the NPS in 2018 were punctuality, long-haul fleet renewal, the new Premium Economy cabin, the refurbishment of the Velázquez and Dali Premium lounges in T4 and the new features on the Iberia app. Factors causing a negative impact were the disputes affecting air traffic control in Europe, mainly in the spring, which led to the impairment of the usual punctuality rates. Claims In 2107, we rolled out a project to transform the way we managed claims, reviewing our entire process and developing a new tool to enable us to handle claims more efficiently. Thanks to this project, although the number of claims rose, we managed to reduce claim settlement times and the average response time dropped from 21 days to under four days in the last quarter of 2018, which is an extremely good rate and something that our customers have noticed. The increase in operational causes and disruptions such as air traffic control strikes and poor weather conditions, among other factors, were the main reasons for the greater number of claims received in 2018.

Diversity and Inclusion Plan At Iberia, we are working on bringing together in the single document the Equality Plans of the three groups, Ground, Pilots and Cabin Crew. The primary objectives of the Equality Plans are: to support and promote policies designed to prevent discrimination due to gender in the areas of recruitment, promotion and remuneration; to improve and promote the presence of women in the groups where it is lower; to strengthen the zero tolerance policy regarding any type of sexual harassment or mobbing, as well as to resolve any disputes with the greatest possible speed and to put in place measures to support people who are victims of gender-based violence. Iberia wanted to give an even greater boost to diversity and inclusion, a key strategic element. In 2018, a study was conducted which included a diversity audit and a series of interviews with the members of the Management Committee, which led to the launch of the Diversity Plan. It is based on three pillars: Awareness, Leadership Accelerator and Diversity Facilitators, all with the goal of encouraging female talent so that more women achieve management positions. All these policies have had an effect on the current situation of the organisation, although it is necessary to keep on developing lines of work to highlight the valuable contribution made by diversity for the teams and for the company. In 2019, the Diversity Plan has evolved at Iberia to become the Diversity and Inclusion Plan. . Plan person@ This plan was created in 2018 with the goal of bringing together under one umbrella all the present and future initiatives launched by the company and aimed at employees. It is committed to growing and evolving, focussing on people and on the value they contribute to the company. This is intended for all those who are part of Iberia, although each of the actions which comprise it has a different scope depending on position and role. It includes: training for new technologies and tools, health programmes, recognition (25 years at the company and “Iberia people of the month”), fostering the Vive Iberia employee club and intergenerational events (Iberia en Familia), the development programme (mentoring), and the fostering of ideas being generated (Iberia Lab), among other initiatives. GRI Content [102-8, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 401-1, 406-1, 407-1] Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content 2018 in figures Diversity and equal opportunities People with disabilities Pursuant to current laws and regulations, Iberia must hire a number of workers with disabilities equivalent to not less than 2% of its total headcount. Owing to the company’s complex productive nature, it is especially difficult to incorporate workers who have disabilities in sufficient number to meet that quota, so the company meets its legal obligation through the alternative measures stipulated in law. In both cases Iberia guarantees compliance through its collaboration with the Envera Association and its special employment centres. This association was created in 1977 by Iberia employees with children with special needs, and the association’s activities are explained later in this report. Health and Safety The Prevention Plan is the tool facilitating the integration of prevention at the company and lays down the necessary procedures to perform preventive activities and include them in the different management areas. At Iberia, there are work centres where different companies are present, and it is therefore necessary to strike a suitable balance between worker safety and flexibility in applying the occupational risk prevention plans. A key element to manage prevention programmes is that of coordinating business activities. In 2018, AUDELCO awarded Iberia the Occupational Risk Prevention System Certificate following a favourable audit pursuant to article 30 of the Prevention Services Regulation. Iberia subjects its prevention system to an audit on a four-yearly basis, in accordance with article 30 of the Occupation Risk Prevention Act and the Prevention Services Regulation. .

In addition, 41 trainers continued to develop and update their skills at the Trainers School. Overall, more than 1,400 training hours were received. New initiatives in 2018 were the workshops implemented to reinforce key behaviours for leadership profiles and professionals at our company, with 315 participants. A total of 5,957 employees from all areas participated in training on diversity and 1,280 in cybersecurity courses. Skill development in e-learning format remained strong, with more than 3,500 hours devoted to subjects such as leadership and negotiation techniques.

GRI Content [404-1, 404-2, 412-2] 2018 Sustainability Report 31 2018 in figures Recruitment and talent Recruitment There were 232 recruitment processes held in 2018, 20% more than the previous year. Individual vacancies handled externally increased by practically 50% compared to 2017. This greater volume is due above all to the need to incorporate new crew members (pilots and cabin crew) to cover the increase in our flight plan. These results are coherent with the company’s growth. Talent We periodically carry out performance and talent appraisals for all employees who hold key positions in the company and for those under the ground staff collective agreement. Employees with the flight group also receive evaluations and ongoing feedback on their onboard professional performance. Taking into account the result of these periodic assessment processes, decisions are made related to the succession, promotion and development of our professionals, through career plans, participation in internal recruitment processes (job posting), high potential programmes and mentoring, etc. Grants Iberia is committed to young talent and to training for their incorporation into the job market, through postgraduate grants for recent graduates, associated with projects from our businesses. In 2018, we gave this opportunity to 42 young graduates.

This is done by the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee and the Iberia Audit Committee, set up in 2017, pursuant to applicable regulations. The main duties of these are to: (I) Supervise the effectiveness and periodically review the internal control systems, internal auditing and risk management systems in the group companies; (II) act as a communication channel between the Board of Directors and external auditors; (III) voice opinions about its independence; and (IV) supervise the compilation and presentation of mandatory financial information. Through its management, control activities are implemented in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of risks and achieve the goals set. In addition, the Iberia Audit Committee coordinates its activity with the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee. Ethics and integrity Iberia has a General Code of Conduct, which regulates the conduct of Group directors, executives and employees when carrying out their duties and in their business and professional relationships. The code stipulates that they should prevent any personal or family interests from interfering in the decisions, actions, services or advice that they take, perform or provide on behalf of Iberia. The directors’ obligations are defined in the Board of Directors Regulations and in the IAG and Iberia Corporate Bylaws. The Annual Report analyses the compliance thereof. In 2018, as in the previous year, no conflicts of interest were detected in the performance of duties of the Iberia Board of Directors or its Management Committee. IAG has a Supplier Code of Conduct, which is applicable to the supply of any goods and/or services to either IAG or any IAG Group company.

For this reason, and as set out in the financial reporting internal control policy, Iberia has monitoring systems in place based on the reference framework established by the CNMV. These internal control systems are configured around a protocol of processes that must be followed by the Board of Directors, the IAG Audit and Compliance Committee, the Iberia Audit Committee, senior management and the personnel involved. Regulatory compliance committee Several tools are made available by the Iberia Group to employees to get advice and resolve any issues they may observe. There is also a grievance mechanism handled by an external service provider to guarantee total confidentiality. All the reports made are analysed and the Regulatory Compliance Committee, consisting of senior managers of the company, is informed in order to review them and take decisions. The company performs an internal audit on an annual basis on the compliance offence prevention model, which ensures the model is always up to date. Rules on anti-competitive behaviour The programme for complying with anti-competitive behaviour rules are based on a specific IAG risk matrix. Implementation of the programme is assured via the commitment of senior management to the approved compliance strategy. This is also reflected in the compliance commitment within the company’s Code of Conduct, the internal guidance for employees through its manual on compliance with competition rules and the development of specific guidelines, training initiatives, internal reporting/whistleblowing channel and process monitoring. GRI Content [102-17, 102-28, 102-29, 102-30, 102-31, 102-33, 102-34, 103-1, 103-2, 103-3, 413-1] 2018 Sustainability Report 41 Anti-corruption policy We integrate our fight against corruption and bribery in the crime prevention programme. The programme is a series of measures for preventing, detecting and reacting to possible crimes set out in the Spanish Penal Code. In addition, it is a commitment to permanently monitor and penalise unethical behaviour and to maintain effective mechanisms for informing and raising the awareness of all employees to foster a preventive culture. In order to comply with the company’s anti-corruption policy and internal regulations on Regulatory Compliance, Iberia regularly carries out due diligence processes (finding and analysing information) on third parties linked to it. In particular, these check the suitability of tender bidders and business intermediaries, according to various criteria. In 2018, 103 due diligence processes were conducted. Responsible procurement Procurement and outsourcing management at Iberia is managed by IAG Global Business Services (IAG GBS) which, in line with Iberia’s goals, is regulated by internal procedures. The tender process includes a survey that assesses Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) aspects and labour policies and regulation, reviewed by the outsourcing area. The process monitors the clauses related to confidentiality, industrial property, data protection, labour commitment, environmental commitment, the UN Global Compact and regulatory compliance. Compliance with these clauses is assessed sufficiently frequently according to the monitoring information, the level of risk to the company’s reputation and criticality for the value chain. The clauses on the UN Global Compact require all suppliers awarded service contracts to: Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights in their respective spheres of influence. Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Uphold the freedoms and rights of their employees in the labour area. Support the effective abolition of child labour. Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and promote the development and diffusion of the most environmentally friendly technologies. Foster any necessary initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. IAG GBS continued progressing in health and safety and the environment in 2018 by conducting audits and working with suppliers to be leaders in safety through training and local programmes.

We have supported the work of Envera throughout the organisation’s 40-year history. At the special workplaces run by Envera, the workers perform tasks such as packing the cutlery for our aircraft, document management and laundry, as well as managing the inventory of the aircraft component storage areas. Mano a Mano The NGO Mano a Mano, founded in 1994 by Iberia employees, develops projects in charity canteens, schools and hospitals in Spain and other countries, such as Guatemala, Cuba, Ecuador, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Peru and Venezuela. In addition, this NGO takes advantage of the holds of the company’s aircraft to send humanitarian aid to countries affected by natural catastrophes or wars. Its commitment to disadvantaged people also led Mano a Mano to develop projects focussing on children’s health. In 2018, Iberia facilitated transport for 16 children with serious illnesses who required urgent medical treatment. In addition, Iberia transported 11 tonnes of humanitarian aid destined for Peru, Cuba, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Colombia.

The main objective of the agreement, which is based on microdonations, is to raise funds to support vaccination projects and prevent illnesses such as measles, polio and whooping cough. The project, which was launched in 2013, enables Iberia customers to make donations of between 3 and 20 euros when they purchase a ticket on the company’s website. In the five years the project has been running, it has raised more than 943,000 euros. This has helped to finance children’s vaccination campaigns to fight polio in Chad, diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus in Angola, and rubella, measles and mumps in Cuba. Overall, over 1 Ver vídeo million children have been vaccinated in these campaigns. In 2018, the money raised through donations to UNICEF from Iberia customers was used to give the MMR vaccination to 80% of Cuban boys and girls aged under 1 year old. . Make a Wish Ver vídeo Since 2001, we have been collaborating as the official transport company for Make a Wish Spain, an organisation devoted to making the wishes of seriously ill children come true, enriching their lives through unique and unforgettable experiences which help them to overcome negative emotions, such as fear, distress or loneliness.

This programme, which has been achieving very positive results since it was set up in 2014, aims to reach 7,000 children and teenagers in the country. . Juegaterapia Since 2016, we have sold more than 3,600 baby pelones dolls on board Iberia aircraft to support the fight against children’s cancers both inside and outside Spain, as part of the activities of the Fundación Juegaterapia, which helps ill children through recreational projects in hospitals and funds research into cancer. Fundación Integra Iberia is a trustee of Fundación Integra, which supports women who have been victims of gender-based violence and fosters their integration into the workforce. Since 2016, we have been offering job opportunities to this vulnerable group. We also carry out volunteer activities, holding training workshops for marginalised individuals and women who are survivors of gender-based violence, and we carry out social awareness-raising campaigns. Women executives at Iberia participate in the “Leadership for a job” programme. This initiative seeks to leverage the skills and experience of executives to use them to the advantage of people experiencing social exclusion, to help these individuals to find a job which can change their lives. Also in 2018, Fundación Integra honoured us with a Special Mention for Human Resources, in recognition of the company’s efforts to support people at risk of exclusion.

We offer our resources to expedite and facilitate the transportation of organs to their destination, ensuring the survival of the organ and the viability of the transplant. Since 2003, we have transported more than 400 organs for transplants in our aircraft. Support for Guatemala In 2018, we worked with the Guatemalan government to mitigate the consequences of the eruption of the Volcán de Fuego volcano, which engulfed a number of communities in the central-southern region of the country. We flew over a team from the firefighters’ NGO Bomberos Unidos Sin Fronteras, which helped in the task of attending to the inhabitants affected and in searching for the missing. We also transported a water treatment plant on a pro bono basis. Guatemala was the first destination in Central America Iberia flew to, over 50 years ago. Dressed in pink to support the fight against cancer We joined in with Day Against Breast Cancer and, in collaboration with the Spanish Anti-Cancer Association (AECC) and Solán de Cabras, we contributed to raise awareness among society about how important it is to prevent this illness. Our aircraft were dressed in pink, with touches of this colour inside the aircraft, and customers received pink bottles of water. GRI Content [102-12, 413-1] Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Main environmental projects Fleet renewal In 2018, we received five new aircraft, whose fuel consumption and environmental impact are considerably lower than the fleet they were replacing. There were two units of the Airbus A320neo, an aircraft for shortand medium-haul flights, which cut the sound footprint by 50%, NOx emissions by 50% and fuel consumption by 15%. There was one unit of the Airbus A330-200, used on long-haul international routes, with kerosene fuel consumption savings per aircraft of 15%. The two units of the Airbus A350-900 are used for long-haul routes and achieve fuel savings of 25%. The first aircraft was delivered using biofuel made from sugar cane, which boosts reductions in emissions by up to 30%. At the end of the year, our fleet had an average age of 10,79 years. Other measures to reduce emissions Another of the measures to trim fuel Fuel efficiency consumption is a reduction in the use of the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) which is utilised to In 2018, we continued developing and supply the aircraft with the necessary energy to implementing additional measures to reduce start up, fostering use of ground facilities to the fuel consumption and, consequently, CO2 greatest extent possible. emissions. Several of these measures we carry out with the participation of the Fuel Efficiency Other measures that also make it possible Support Group (GSEC) of the Operations to reduce consumption include optimisation Department, made up of volunteers who are of the fuel management system, the search pilots from the different fleets, whose objective for optimum flight level through the Nimbus is to implement best practices to save fuel. system, optimisation of fuel to the alternative In 2018, the implementation of this type of through improvements in the alternative nearest operations prevented the emission of 7,208 airport policy, and the reduction in fuel planned tonnes of CO2. for use by the APU on the ground. GRI Content [201-2] 2018 Sustainability Report 51 Main environmental projects Recycling of catering waste In October 2018, we began to implement the LIFE Zero Cabin Waste project, which aims to create a sustainable management model for waste from the aircrafts’ catering service. The initiative, which will be developed until December 2019, is led by Iberia and includes the participation of Biogas Fuel Cell (BFC), ESCI-UPF, Ecoembes, Ferrovial and Gate Gourmet. Thanks to its implementation, we will succeed in recycling 80% of the waste generated in the cabins during our flights, and thus avoid emissions of 4,340 tonnes of CO2 a year, equivalent to the emissions of 340 flights between Madrid and Barcelona. Another of the keys of the initiative is that it can be replicated by other European airlines. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), each year around 5.7 million tonnes of waste are generated in aircraft cabins, and therefore achieving a universal model would significantly optimise how it is managed. Another of the goals of the LIFE Zero Cabin Waste project is to produce a guide containing the main guidelines to follow in managing aircraft catering waste. PROJECT CO-FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION THROUGH THE LIFE PROGRAMME ‘Green’ approaches at Heathrow Airport Since 2013 Iberia has been applying the Continuous Descent Approach (CDA) procedure, also called the green approach, for approaches to Heathrow airport. A CDA is a procedure through which the aircraft follows a continuous descent path, with minimal flight stabilisations. With this technique, air emissions, fuel consumption and noise levels are reduced. In 2018, we achieved an improvement of 7% in approaches and more than 85% of our flights used this procedure at Heathrow Airport. Innovation in ground equipment Another of the areas where we are working with the goal of reducing fuel consumption and emissions into the atmosphere relates to the equipment we use on the ground. We have two projects under way: Catalyser. A device is installed which facilitates cleaner combustion of the fuel, which reduces emissions of pollutant gases and increase engine power. Its efficiency has been confirmed after one year of use. Telemetry. We are incorporating geolocation devices into the ground equipment fleet to gain efficiency in terms of fuel consumption and emissions and ensure the safety of operations at airports. GRI Content [201-2, 304-3, 413-2] Chairman’s Iberia Governance and Sustainable Materiality Appendix GRI Statement company profile stakeholders operations Content Main environmental projects Less plastic As a demonstration of our commitment to caring for the environment, we have implemented a series of initiatives to reduce waste generated when attending passengers during flights and in the Premium Lounges of Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport. On flights, the plastic bag which used to hold Business class earphones has been replaced by a paper band. This small gesture represents a reduction of 436,000 bags and savings of 1,500 kg of plastic a year. In the Premium Lounges in Madrid, plastic packaging was replaced with returnable glass solutions, and suppliers were requested to avoid wrapping individual items for certain products. All this is going to mean an annual reduction of almost 1 million cans (23.5 tonnes) and 200,000 plastic containers (6,500 kg). In addition, over half of the old furniture from the Dalí Premium lounge, which was recently renovated, was reused or donated to non-profit organisations. Energy saving at facilities To improve efficiency in power consumption, we replaced conventional lighting with a LED system at the cargo terminal in Madrid and the engine workshop. In 2018, this change affected 665,180 KWh at the cargo terminal and 2,679,979.07 KWh at the workshop facilities. GRI Content [201-2] 2018 Sustainability Report 53 Main environmental projects Protecting species in danger of extinction We collaborate to protect species in danger of extinction. We have been committed to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) since 1986, and therefore we do not agree to transport these species. We also provide support for various institutions and actively participate in returning animals which have been illegally removed from their natural habitats. In addition, as a member of the IAG Group, Iberia has joined the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce Buckingham Palace declaration. It aims to reduce the levels of trafficking of animals in danger of extinction through improving the exchange of information between customs authorities and airlines, as well as to increase awareness among customers and employees. Environmental management In 2018, we made progress in certification and compliance with international environmental criteria: The company verified its CO2 emission monitoring and notification system in its intra-European and ground (industrial areas) operations with Aenor. The Iberia fleet complied with the international environmental standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on noise emissions and air quality below an altitude of 900 metres in the vicinity of airports. The environmental management strategy of the ground operations is based on internal systems, others which are externally certified and specific procedures which cover 100% of its activities that are linked to the environment. The airport services have achieved Aenor certification for their integrated quality system (standard ISO 9001) and environmental system (ISO 14001). It covers the activity of the 29 plus stations on the Spanish national airport network. An important part of the company’s environmental strategy is transparency, and this is why we have calculated and audited the carbon footprint of flight operations in 2018 in accordance with standard UNE-EN ISO 14064-1.
