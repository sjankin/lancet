Our policy is to encourage free communication between employees and their managers to ensure that questions and problems arising can be aired and resolved quickly, to the satisfaction of all concerned. We have a comprehensive three-stage process for grievances: informal complaints, formal written complaint, and formal a grievance hearing. We also allow an appeals process for individuals that may be dissatisfied with the outcome.
