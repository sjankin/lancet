It allows people and businesses to protect themselves from risk and helps them become – and remain – prosperous and resilient. Risks are becoming more complex and interconnected as a result of climate change, globalization, urbanization and technological development. Insurers are increasingly expected to use their core capabilities to help communities and society become more resilient to these interconnected risks. The premiums we invest in capital markets also help to finance businesses and projects that are important for society. At Zurich, sustainability is integrated into our strategy. For us this means using our role as society’s risk experts to encourage more long-term ethical thinking; to develop risk-focused solutions that help society adapt to transformation with confidence; and to ensure we harness the full potential of each of our employees. By doing this, we aim to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders in reflection of our purpose, values and our code of conduct.

The Z Zurich Foundation (‘Foundation’) made contributions to all partners over the course of the program, totaling CHF 37 million. In addition, Zurich funded a dedicated program team and provided significant senior management input, as well as resources at country level in Indonesia and Mexico where local programs were run. After the completion of the first phase, we reflected on the achievements and lessons learned as well as looked ahead to the second phase announced in July 2018. Looking back at the first phase Through the use of the Flood Resilience Measurement Framework for communities (FRMC), we have seen many communities increase their understanding of and resilience to flood exposures. With very few exceptions, resilience measurement results have improved in all program communities over the duration of the program. One important – but unquantifiable – impact has been the level of collaboration, exchange and sharing of knowledge across country programs. The Alliance’s disaster risk reduction activities have made a difference and directly benefited 225,000 people across our 13 programs in nine countries. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Practical Action and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) have continued as members of the Alliance in the second phase.

It facilitated meetings of a diverse stakeholder set to focus on planning and financing local mitigation efforts. Post Event Review Capability (PERC): Zurich has developed, in collaboration with ISET International, a forensic methodology to understand how large flood events turn into humanitarian disasters. This process analyses the root causes of why events become disasters. It tries to answer, at an event level, what worked well and where there are opportunities for further improvements. We have produced 13 PERC reports and an overall PERC summary report consolidating all our global lessons learned so far, including one analyzing the dynamics surrounding Hurricane Michael Szönyi, Zurich’s flood resilience program lead, tends to a warning system camera, while Miguel Arestegui of Practical Action, Harvey in Houston. who developed the simple, cost-effective technology, checks the Zurich has contributed around USD 350,000 into developing camera image on his smartphone.

In just over four years, we have reduced the number of data centers used from 70 to 14; an 80 percent reduction. A major benefit delivered by this program even as our data demand grows, is that we are able to absorb the growth through a more efficient platform structure. This gives us far greater control of our total energy impact.
