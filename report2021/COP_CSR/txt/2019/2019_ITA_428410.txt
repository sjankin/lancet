CHAIRMAN Dear Stakeholders, Awareness has been the key word of our 2018. Awareness of our «NEW CHALLENGES IN past and of the importance of the heritage we treasure. Awareness of our future, looking ahead to the new realities of our business A FAST-CHANGING environment, being cognizant of the role we want to play in it. WORLD AWAIT US» Our capacity to have a long-term view of both the past and of the future sets us apart. Our uninterrupted links with Academia and Research since our foundation have allowed us to tap into and capitalize on future trends. They ensure that we are proactive to change and not reactive and a high-value and high-quality business proposition for our stakeholders. This past year has been a clear indicator of the ongoing evolution we are experiencing, bringing into focus the challenges we have ahead of us both as a business player and as a corporate citizen. Sustainability is not a mere declaration of intent. It becomes a core tenet of our operations and acts as a compass to guide business decisions, while providing a major competitive leverage. Global changes prompt us to find long-run solutions to environmental emergencies and we are aware of the difference we can make by flanking Clients as they make business decisions, as well as the importance of mitigating any side effects that could emerge from the misuse of industrial materials that we contribute to creating. Moreover, value creation for stakeholders and the local impact generation of our projects are of utmost relevance and central to our responsibilities as an international industrial player. The international-level commitment we have taken, supporting the UN Global Compact and embedding the Sustainable Development Goals in our everyday work, is an integral part of our way of doing business and is the lens through which our 2018 could be read. Fabrizio Di Amato Maire Tecnimont Chairman and Major Shareholder 4 CREATING VALUE LETTER FROM THE CEO Dear Stakeholders, «BE PIONEERS The Maire Tecnimont Group has grown relentlessly over recent years, both in terms of its structure and its financial results, reporting in TO DRIVE 2018 a record of 3.6 billion of revenues. Such outstanding developCHANGE» ment in a skin-changing global environment impacted by strong market discontinuities is the first, sound evidence of our pioneering mindset: we read the market and react in advance so as to seize opportunities and open new paths of sustainable growth. As we operate in the hydrocarbons downstream industry (petrochemicals, oil&gas refining and fertilizers), the key factors that drive our business are based on global demand both for plastic and for fertilizers, linking tightly our operating strategy to demographics, as well as to social and industrial development. Our technological know-how in the delivery of large, complex industrial plant puts us at the crossroads between the energy and manufacturing industries, bridging the gap required to unlock and retain locally higher value by processing natural resources. We contribute to locally build developments brick by brick, driven by a strong, best-in-class focus on Health, Security and Environment. Sustainability is, hence, truly a key factor in each project we execute, both in economic and social terms. Given our technological mindset, we want to play a pivotal role in this ever-changing energy scenario. We have reacted responsively to progressive market trends towards non-fossil and unconventional sources, launching at the end of 2018 our Green Acceleration project through a dedicated company, NextChem, to seize opportunities in the field of Green Chemistry and technologies to support the Energy Transition. We have invested in several initiatives to lead the way as a green innovator, focused on a three-pillar strategy: Greening the Brown – reducing carbon footprint by offsetting environmental impacts from the conversion of oil and gas – Circular Economy, and Green-Green – developing oil additives or substitutes used for fuels or plastics from renewables, with the long term goal of industrializing the production of bioplastics. Our mission is to be a technology enabler and accelerator, identifying new solutions to be industrialized as breakthrough innovations. We maintain a constant focus on the Sustainable Development Goals as a core feature of our daily operations as we want to thrive in this future environment: our commitment is clear and our engagement is measurable. This is our time to drive change.

The development of “general environmental regulations” could generate new business opportunities for Maire Tecnimont in the growing low carbon energy market. The expertise of the Group in developing sustainable solutions for its clients and the ability of the Group to react quickly to changes in environmental regulations are clear competitive advantages. Moreover, client and consumer demand for eco-friendly solutions and renewable energy technologies is on the up. Maire Tecnimont is already providing low-carbon solutions to its clients and is therefore equipped to handle the potential growth in demand. 2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 41 GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS 3 MATERIAL TOPICS –– ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE –– ANTI-CORRUPTION –– GRIEVANCE MECHANISM SDGs STAKEHOLDERS BUSINESS LOCAL PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS ORGANIZATIONS /CATEGORY & NGOs ASSOCIATION CONTRACTORS CLIENTS LOCAL EMPLOYEES & SUBCOMMUNITIES CONTRACTORS OUR FOCUS DIRECTORS DIVERSITY 2 9 EXECUTIVE APPOINTED 4 1 2 OF DIRECTORS DIRECTORS FEMALES FEMALE FEMALES IN THE BOARD IN THE BOARD IN THE OF DIRECTORS OF STATUTORY SUPERVISORY AUDITORS BODY BOARD OF DIRECTORS FABRIZIO DI AMATO GABRIELLA CHERSICLA VITTORIA GIUSTINIANI 1 4 7 CHAIRMAN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR PIERROBERTO FOLGIERO ANDREA PELLEGRINI STEFANO FIORINI 2 5 8 CEO & COO INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR DIRECTOR LUIGI ALFIERI PATRIZIA RIVA MAURIZIA SQUINZI 3 DIRECTOR 6 INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR 9 INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR GROUP’S VALUES LEGALITY, TRANSPARENCY KNOWLEDGE HEALTH AND SAFETY AT 1 5 8 AND FAIRNESS MANAGEMENT THE WORKPLACE 2 CUSTOMER COMMITMENT RESPECT FOR THE SUSTAINABLE 6 9 INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT 3 INNOVATION 7 EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES RESPONSIBILITY 10 4 FLEXIBILITY TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING 15 GOVERNANCE BODY MEMBERS THAT DURING THE ORGANIZATION’S ANTIGOVERNANCE THE YEARS CORRUPTION POLICIES BODY MEMBERS TRAINED 2016, AND PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN ON ANTI-CORRUPTION 2017, COMMUNICATED TO AND 2018 100% 3 GOVERNANCE AND ETHICS 3 The Maire Tecnimont Group is and Risk Management System that Maire Tecnimont considers corrupcommitted to maintaining the hiis appropriate to its size, complexition as an untenable obstacle to ghest standards of corporate goty, operational structure, business business efficiency and fair comvernance, particularly with regards and sustainability challenges.

WORKING SMART IN THE MAIRE TECNIMONT GROUP The introduction of Smart Working has featured an approach which going beyond the mere concept of remote working wanted to establish a new working culture based on the involvement and the accountability of our People, confirming our flexible attitude towards market changes. During the year, the “BE ADAPTIVE! Working Smart in Maire Tecnimont Group” Program concluded successfully the pilot phases, launching the deployment phase that has involved the population meeting the requirements for program access. By year-end, more than 700 employees of the Milan offices have been enabled to work “adaptively” and confirming the importance assigned by the company to the program implementation – even 8,152 hours of training have been provided to personnel coordinators and their collaborators. Smart Workers have been in fact involved in a dedicated training path centered on IT skills and on the most effective behaviours to support the affirmation of this new working culture. This culture seeks to maximize the individual operational autonomy and their ability to achieve results, enhancing more and more accountability, spirit of initiative and sense of belonging to the Group mission. The investment in this Program – whose guiding principles are the increase of productivity, motivation, sustainability and People engagement in addition to its innovative nature, allowed the Group to receive the “Smart Working Award 2018” from the Osservatorio Smart Working of the Milan Polytechnic, as well as the special recognitions from the Advisory Board and from the public during the dedicated ceremony.

It only needs water and energy in order to de-polymerize plastic, thus reducing it in its building blocks (monomers), ready to be re-introduced as virgin-grade material in plastics production. DEMETO is a Project Co-Funded by the European Commission in the EC HORIZON2020 program. TECHNICAL OBJECTIVE: build a full industrial-grade pilot plant of the de-polymerization process, having a gr3n Reactive Unite at its core, while optimizing the purification steps. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE: exploit immediately the mature market of the packaging waste, while preparing the technology transfer to the huge and unexplored red polyester/textile value chain. The Group is participating in the project with the scope of Engineering, Procurement and Construction of the pilot plant with Micro Waves reactors able to treat about 100 kg/h of PET material (6 reactive units) Maire Tecnimont will have the worldwide exclusivity for licensing DEMETO Technology. PURSELL AGRI TECH The Maire Tecnimont Group, through its subsidiary Stamicarbon, is focused on sustainable innovation. In 2017, Stamicarbon invested in PAT, a company which has developed a controlled released coating and a process to apply it to fertilizers. This company is also working on a process to add seedcores of micro nutrients to urea. In June 2018 the first commercial plant was commissioned in Alabama US. Given the fast-commercial success of the products sold from this plant, plans are being prepared to construct a second plant in 2019. Building on the US success the international market is actively being approached through the Technology Licensing model. Focus on the R&D front is to develop a biodegradable coating. In the field of UREA, Stamicarbon is working on innovations for dust emission reduction from urea plants, small scale ammonia/urea plants and product improvement (formaldehyde-free product). A low energy process for urea was developed, with a first project sold in 2017. In 2018 two more projects based on this Technology were licensed. The development of specialty fertilizers, e.g. slow and/or controlled release and adding special nutrients to urea, is another challenge for the future. This addresses the challenge to reduce excessive fertilization and the environmental burden of fertilizers. 80 CREATING VALUE TECHNOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION AND R&D R&D AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION 5.1 DCCD™ The Dual Column Cryogenic Distillation (DCCD™) is a proprietary cryogenic distillation process, which allows to obtain natural gas at commercial-grade purity while separating a high-pressure liquid CO2 stream suitable for direct re-injection. In 2015 Tecnimont started the construction of a laboratory scale pilot plant in Piacenza, Italy. The Plant was designed to process feed gas flowrates in the range of few litres/h, with an inlet CO2 content up to 50 mol%. In early 2016 the laboratory plant was commissioned, and two experimental campaigns were executed. The last campaign ended in October 2018. The experimental results confirm the validity of the thermodynamic model and the “dual column” process configuration. DCCD™ technology advantage vs. competitive technologies for natural gas sweetening are: single step purification from any CO2 and/or H2S content down to 1 sales gas or LNG specifications; lower overall OPEX & CAPEX with respect to competitive 2 technologies; 3 pumping and re-injection of 100% of the recovered CO2; higher methane recovery, compared to physical solvents and 4 membranes; no proprietary solvents required (e.g. formulated amines or physi5 cal solvents). In November 2018, a major international Oil & Gas company signed a contract for the completion of a feasibility study for the introduction of the DCCD™ Technology as part of the development of an offshore gas field, extracting a CO2-rich raw gas that needs to be treated in order to meet the sales gas specification. The feasibility study will be completed in Q1 2019. In consideration of the strong synergies existing between the DCCD™ technology and the liquefaction processes for LNG production, a review of the DCCD™ technology and of the purity requirements of commercial LNG has been undertaken. This analysis showed the necessity to further study the properties and the behaviour of the natural gas in the specific operating conditions of the DCCD™ technology, aimed at demonstrating the suitability and the convenience of this technology for LNG production. For this purpose, Tecnimont will cooperate with the Centre of Process Thermodynamics (CTP) of the École des Mines of Paris– a research group with recognized expertise in the determination and modeling of the thermodynamic properties of natural gas. 2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 81 5.2 EPC INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY, DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION AND R&D EPC INNOVATION THE GROUP CONSTANTLY FOCUSES ON STIMULATING THE GENERATION OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS, NOT ONLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AREA.

DEVELOPMENT 86 CREATING VALUE COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITIES AND RESEARCH CENTERS Maire Tecnimont Group has a long history of collaboration with major universities, technology suppliers, research centers and commercial partners. Over recent years, the Maire Tecnimont Group has stepped up its collaboration with top Italian and foreign universities, developing research projects and exchanging views and ideas and thus creating a strong bridge between the academic and industrial world. Maire Tecnimont long-standing collaboration with Politecnico di Milano has been further strengthened through research project partnerships, and through the funding of a Chair of “Chemical Projects Engineering and Management”, launched in 2018 and for the next 15 years. The collaboration with the Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma is in force since 2011 as part of the concrete support for the University Master’s Degree course in Chemical Engineering for Sustainable Development. In 2018, the Maire Tecnimont Group began cooperating with BHOS (Baku Higher Oil School), as a concrete support for the University Master’s Degree course and for the supply of research facilities. Other historic academic partners are Università “La Sapienza” di Roma, the Università di Salerno, Università dell’Aquila, Università di Bologna and Politecnico di Torino. Abroad, Maire Tecnimont companies cooperate with the University of Leuven, the Technical University of Eindhoven and with Ecole des Mines in Paris. Collaborations and agreements have been established with international research institutions, e.g. with Tecnalia, a research Centre in Spain for the development of membrane reactors for hydrogen production, in addition to Intertek Laboratories. Some of these collaborations have developed into business partnerships, such as those with Protomation, Holland Novochem and Envirocare. 6 CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE 6 CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE MATERIAL TOPICS –– ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT –– LOCAL COMMUNITIES –– LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT –– CUSTOMER RELATIONS –– RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN SDGs STAKEHOLDERS BUSINESS CLIENTS PROFESSIONAL PARTNERS /CATEGORY ASSOCIATION CONTRACTORS LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS & SUB-CONTRACTORS & NGOs 88 CREATING VALUE CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE 6 OUR FOCUS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT €3,573.1 mln ECONOMIC VALUE DISTRIBUTED SUPPLY CHAIN 27 4,300 + 22,000+ QUALIFICATION AUDITS ACTIVE SUPPLIERS (AT LEAST SUPPLIERS PERFORMED ONE ORDER PLACED IN 2018) 606 47 NEW POSITIVE QUALIFICATIONS WITH COUNTRIES SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS 680+ € 4.30 BLN 41% € 3.30 BLN MATERIAL GROUPS 59% 4 LOCAL EXPENDITURE* IPO’S/PROCUREMENT HUBS TOTAL PURCHASING VALUE PURCHASING VALUE ON * Referred to 16 projects that best represent the business of the Group both in terms LOCAL SUPPLIERS of progress and as a type of product and technology. 2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 89 6 CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE 6 Maire Tecnimont is mindful of the Maire Tecnimont maintains regular and an improvement in perforsocial dimension of its activities dialogue with its stakeholders to mance, not only by enhancing synthroughout the value chain.

Framed by the topics identified by materiality analysis and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (SDGs), the Group’s Philanthropy plan bases its actions on 5 flows: PROMOTION OF HEALTH AND SAFETY 1 TRAINING, HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION 2 AND START-UP MITIGATION OF GLOBAL WARMING, PROTECTION OF 3 THE ENVIRONMENT AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECT AREAS 4 CULTURAL SUPPORT 5 In order to be active on every flow, ongoing contact with the NGO’s, the tertiary sector organisations, the universities and the research centers is essential as they are the initial detectors of the needs emerging from the regions in which we operate. This does not only involve monetary donations, but also making available the time and expertise of our leading personnel to share our knowledge with a broader range of stakeholders. In addition, we adopt cause-related philanthropic initiatives, involving our personnel in certain periods of the year or encouraging their involvement in internal activities. Where necessary, our support responds to specific needs in the field with the donation of materials, ensuring that our support arrives promptly to those benefitting the most. MAIRE TECNIMONT SUPPORTS “THE OCEAN CLEANUP” Our role in creating advanced multiuse materials for everyday life does not end in the scope of production but involves also our support in encouraging a culture of responsible consumption and the correct recovery of plastics, in order to protect the ecosystem. Demonstrating our Group’s commitment in this area, in December 2018 we supported “The Ocean Cleanup”, a non-profit organisation involved since 2013 in developing advanced technologies to collect plastics from the oceans, utilising alternative methods to reduce both economic and time demands. This type of pollution is becoming a global environmental emergency which involves the oceans to an incredible extent. Thanks to the idea developed by The Ocean Cleanup, with the placement of floating barriers working with the ocean currents, plastics are first pushed in the direction of the barrier, treated and thereafter removed. 92 CREATING VALUE CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 6.2 LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Maire Tecnimont plays a significant economic development policy foHelps develop a sustainable 1 role in its sector and contributes cused on the main areas of trainand trusting relationship with substantially to the economic deing and hiring local staff and purthe local market, reducing velopment of the countries in chasing local goods and services. the costs and risks associated which it operates.

The Maire Tecnimont Group continuously invests in training opportunities for disadvantaged women in India as considering economic independence as the first step to walk the talk toward gender equality. Partnering with the local NGO CORP, our Group for the fourth year in a row promoted the active participation of Indian women in the economic life of their communities, thanks to vocational courses generating quality employment and/or micro enterprises (tailoring, beauticians, teacher training, computer literacy and income generation programs). The project involved more than 900 women in 13 disadvantaged neighborhoods of Greater Mumbai. It encompassed specific skill training as well as education on women’s rights and empowerment, providing at the same time proper support services (creches and preschool for women’s children) so as to maximize women’s attendance and making real their involvement. According to the participant reviews and follow-ups, the more women were economically independent the more they increased investment in their children’s education, and so starting a virtuous circle with an additional longterm positive effect. The outcomes of the initiative covered a wide range of positive returns: the approach to social and economic issues in an integrated but very pragmatic way allowed us to simultaneously cover key topics in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, with our Group deciding to embrace (SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 8).

The number of new hires concerns permanent employees, considering the focus on structural personnel and as indicated by workforce movements in the year. For consistent turnover analysis, the permanent workforce and the presentation of the voluntary departure rate was focused on. Given the broad global spread of the Group, only benefits uniformly recognized at the various Group companies are qualitatively represented. It was decided to report the results of the basic salary analysis given the significant portion of secondment indemnities out of total remuneration, which as applied almost exclusively to the male section of the workforce would have made the data non-representative. Data referred to the personnel of the Italian Group companies, with registered office in Italy.

Independent auditor’s report on the consolidated nonfinancial statement pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree n° 254/2016 and to article 5 of Consob Regulation 20267 adopted by resolution of January 2018 To the Board of Directors of Maire Tecnimont SpA Pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of Legislative Decree n° 254 of 30 December 2016 (the “Decree”) and article 5 of CONSOB Regulation n° 20267/2018, we have performed a limited assurance engagement on the “Sustainability Report Containing the Group non-financial disclosure pursuant to Legislative Decree n° 254/2016” of Maire Tecnimont SpA and its subsidiaries (hereafter the “Group”) for the year ended 31 December 2018 prepared in accordance with article 4 of the Decree and approved by the Board of Directors on 14 March 2019 (hereafter the “NFS”). Responsibility of the directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors for the NFS Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with article 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards defined in 2016 (“GRI Standards”), , identified by them as the reporting standard. Directors are responsible, in the terms prescribed by law, for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Directors are responsible for identifying the content of the NFS, within the matters mentioned in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group and to the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Group’s activities, its performance, its results and related impacts. Directors are responsible for defining the business and organisational model of the Group and, with reference to the matters identified and reported in the NFS, for the policies adopted by the Group and for the identification and management of risks generated and/or faced by the Group. The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, compliance with the Decree. 140 CREATING VALUE Auditor’s Independence and Quality Control We are independent in accordance with the principles of ethics and independence set out in the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants published by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which are based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, competence and professional diligence, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our audit firm adopts International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC Italy 1) and, accordingly, maintains an overall quality control system which includes processes and procedures for compliance with ethical and professional principles and with applicable laws and regulations. Auditor’s responsibilities We are responsible for expressing a conclusion, on the basis of the work performed, regarding the compliance of the NFS with the Decree and with the GRI Standards. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (hereafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and apply procedures in order to obtain limited assurance that the NFS is free of material misstatement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in scope than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not provide us with a sufficient level of assurance that we have become aware of all significant facts and circumstances that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures performed on the NFS were based on our professional judgement and consisted in interviews, primarily of company personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analyses of documents, recalculations and other procedures designed to obtain evidence considered useful. In particular, we performed the following procedures: 1 Analysis of the relevant matters reported in the NFS relating to the activities and characteristics of the company, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process used, in accordance with article 3 of the Decree and the with the reporting standard adopted. 2 Analysis and assessment of the criteria used to identify the consolidation area, in order to assess their compliance with the Decree. 3 Comparison of the financial information reported in the NFS with the information reported in the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 4 Understanding of the following matters:  business and organisational model of the Group, with reference to the management of the matters specified by article 3 of the Decree; 2 of 4 2018 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 141  policies adopted by the Group with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree, actual results and related key performance indicators;  main risks, generated and/or faced by the Group, with reference to the matters specified in article 3 of the Decree. With reference to those matters, we compared the information obtained with the information presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described under point 5 a) below. 5 Understanding of the processes underlying the preparation, collection and management of the significant qualitative and quantitative information included in the NFS. In particular, we held meetings and interviews with the management of Maire Tecnimont SpA and with the personnel of Tecnimont SpA, KT Kinetics Technology SpA, Neosia SpA, Stamicarbon BV and we performed limited analyses of documentary evidence, to gather information about the processes and procedures for the collection, consolidation, processing and submission of the non-financial information to the function responsible for the preparation of the NFS. Moreover, for material information, considering the activities and characteristics of the Group:  At a group level: a) with reference to the qualitative information included in the NFS, and in particular to the business model, the policies adopted and the main risks, we carried out interviews and acquired supporting documentation to verify their consistency with available evidence; b) with reference to quantitative information, we performed analytical procedures as well as limited tests, in order to assess, on a sample basis, the accuracy of consolidation of the information.  For the following companies Tecnimont SpA, Neosia SpA, KT – Kinetics Technology SpA, Stamicarbon BV and construction sites of Birillo 2007 (Italy), Lotos K-214 (Poland) and Socar HAOR (Azerbaijan), which were selected on the basis of their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at a consolidated level and their location, we carried out site visits, during which we met local management and gathered supporting documentation regarding the correct application of the procedures and calculation methods used for the key performance indicators. 3 of 4 142 CREATING VALUE Conclusions Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of Maire Tecnimont Group as of 31 December 2018 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and with the GRI Standards.
