The company owns 14 per cent of Sweden’s forest land, has operations in 170 municipalities and has 840 employees. Sveaskog conducts forestry and trade activities with wood raw materials in Sweden. Its main products are saw logs, pulpwood and chips as well as biofuel. Sveaskog’s customers are primarily located in Sweden and in the forest industry. The Swedish forest industry is export-oriented and delivers to markets all over the world. Activities Good demand in brief The biggest market for the Swedish forest industry when it comes to pulp, 100% paper and sawn wood products is Europe including Sweden. However, global demand trends for these products are important to the Swedish state-owned forest industry. The state of the market has been very good during the year and has also beneﬁted from a favourable exchange rate for Swedish companies. Despite some fall in demand and prices during the latter part of the year, the state of the market is still good and prices are favourable for forest products, not least measured in Swedish kronor. Fluctuations in exchange rates continue to have a signiﬁcant impact on the proﬁtability of the Swedish forest industry. Sweden’s biggest forest owner The availability of wood raw materials has, due to weather disturbances in the form of a lot of snow during the winter and spring and the dry summer, had an adverse effect on industrial production. In addition, the availability of felling and transport resources during the year has limited the supply capacity from the forest. 840 employees Sveaskog combines proﬁtable forestry with the preservation of high natural values. The company decided as early as in 2002 to invest in long-term 37 ecoparks conservation corresponding to 20 per cent of its productive forest land, and during 2018 Sveaskog’s ecoparks celebrated their ﬁfteenth anniversary. The ﬁrst was opened in 2003 and there are now 37 ecoparks in total. Sveaskog also has a very strong focus on innovation issues. The development efforts are focused on increasing timber production and productivity in forestry, reducing costs and environmental impact, and ensuring better use of and increasing the value of wood raw materials and forest land. Owns 14% of Sweden’s forest land 6,971 million SEK net revenue KEY FIG U R ES 2018 in brief Sveaskog’s operating proﬁt for the year as a whole is the best it has ever been. Net sales, which include both deliveries from Sveaskog’s own forest and externally sourced wood raw materials, increased by 12 per cent to SEK 6,971 million (6,206). The prices increased by 11 per cent on average and the total delivery volumes increased by one per cent. Operating proﬁt increased by 14 per cent and amounted to SEK 1,422 million (1,248). The positive effect of higher prices has been somewhat counteracted by four per cent lower delivery volumes from Sveaskog’s own forests, where the margins are higher than for externally sourced wood raw materials. Costs related to forest ﬁres and reduced sales of non-forest land have had a negative effect on proﬁt. Very good proﬁt from activities combined with a strong capital structure enables the Board to propose increasing the dividend to SEK 1,100 million (900) to the annual general meeting.

During 2018, Sveaskog was the ﬁrst forest products company in Sweden to quantify all the values of the forest. This Unique work aims to promote everything the forest has to offer and show how many more values there are in addition to what we previously reported in the ﬁnancial result. The idea is not to commercialise these values, but to provide insight into our impact, whether positive or negative. Through this work, we have managed to quantify carbon sequestration, recreation, hunting and berry picking as well as ﬁnancial values such as taxes and other contributions to the community, among other things. Stockholm in March 2019 In the long term, we also want to show how strategic choices affect forest values. For example, when we choose to increase growth through fertilisation, we know that the forest will grow faster and sequester even more carbon dioxide. But we also know that fertilisation can affect the natural values.

There has been a great demand for wood raw materials in the form of sawlogs and pulpwood, with record prices as a result. The year was also punctuated by extraordinary weather events. It started with a lot of snow, and this was followed by a hot and dry summer with extensive forest ﬁres. S veaskog can now put another successful year tive impact on productivity, which has nevertheless behind it. Through our employees and our conincreased.

Net sales increased to SEK 6,971 million (6,206). Our associate, the wood industry company Setra Good year ﬁnancially Group, also demonstrates a strong earnings trend Sveaskog’s operating proﬁt for 2018 as a whole and Sveaskog’s share of earnings in the company increased by 14 per cent to SEK 1,422 million increased by 83 per cent to SEK 106 million (58).

Sveaskog creates many values. These include economic, social and environmental values. In addition to the ﬁnancial result, Sveaskog’s forests contribute to solving the climate challenge since the forestry sequesters carbon dioxide.

A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I LI T Y R E P O R T, 2 018 11 VALU E CR EATION The forest Sveaskog uses the forest with the aim of combining economic, ecological and social considerations. More biomass and more biodiversity need to be created so that the values for future generations are strengthened. S veaskog aims to be a leader within sustainable forestry. This is done through active, proﬁtable and responsible use of forests and land to ensure and increase growth on a continuous basis, to enrich nature and to create value for future generations. In 2018, Sveaskog delivered 11 million cubic metres of sawlogs, pulpwood and biofuel to customers while also increasing the biodiversity of its own forests. Forests form the basis of the Swedish bioeconomy. To meet customers’ demand for different qualities and volumes, Sveaskog supplies raw materials from its own forests and from other forest owners in Sweden and abroad. More growth than felling The forest must be used Each year, Sveaskog thins or clearcuts approximately today, but it must also be 50,000 hectares. The felling levels are optimised in preserved for future generations. the long term so that they do not have to be lowered in the future, thereby ensuring stability for Sveaskog in both deliveries and proﬁtability. Sveaskog works with 100-year plans. There is more growth than felling in the forest. In 2018, 70 per cent of the growth Increased growth on managed land was felled.

There is a risk that world trade will develop in a negative direction, even though there are a lot of positive economic signals just now. However, the development of many of the leading world markets is difﬁcult to assess, Views of the forest such as how Brexit might affect the signiﬁcant British demand. The discussion of what the forest is to be used for and what sustainable forestry means is intensifying. There is also increasing polarisation of views on preserving forests on the one hands and using them on the other. In the spring of 2018, the government decided on a strateTransparency gy for Sweden’s national forest programme, after which regional forest programmes were developed.

This was done to increase transparency and improve dialogue with those who want insight into the assessments. Skills provision and forest knowledge Urbanisation means that forest knowledge in Swedish society is in danger of diminishing. Fewer and fewer Swedes will thus have direct experience of forestry. At the same time, there is a growing interest in what the forest offers in the form of renewable raw materials, climate beneﬁts and experiences as well as biodiversity. A general challenge that the forestry industry will face in the future is the rural ﬂight, which may make it more difﬁcult to ﬁnd the right skills. COLLABORATION AND DIALOGUE Sveaskog is a company at the heart of society and has activities in 170 of the country’s 290 municipalities. The forest affects and interests people. That is why Sveaskog has a close stakeholder dialogue with many different players. Such players include municipalities, private individuals, non-proﬁt organisations such as cooperative associations, conservation organisations, sports clubs or nature tourism enterprises. Sveaskog also consults with the Sámi communities, as there may be conﬂicts of interest between reindeer husbandry and felling activities.

But other values are also created through the forest holdings and use of the forests. Sveaskog is the ﬁrst forest products company in Sweden to use the IP&L method, which is a unique way of measuring hidden values that exist, but have not been measured before, such as recreation. We developed this method in 2018, together with world-leading sustainability economist Pavan Sukhdev. What creates value… The forest The forest holdings of 4 million hectares, of which 3 million is productive forest land, are found in approximately 170 of the country’s 290 municipalities. ... through forestry...

Sveaskog has therefore integrated sustainable enterprise fully into its business strategy and business plan development.

The volume from its own forests, the prices of products and the efﬁciency of activities and administration are what is most crucial in terms of proﬁtability. Good proﬁtability ensures that the business can continue to develop. The reﬁning of forest holdings through purchasing and sales as well as the exchange of forest land is also a step in ensuring good long-term value development.

Results The aim of achieving a more balanced gender distribution with at least 30 per cent women in the company is moving in the right direction, but relatively slowly due to a low employee turnover, with many employees staying with Sveaskog for a long time. The motivated employee index and leadership index already have high values, but by working with a strong focus on training and the development of active employeeship, they can be even better. The satisﬁed contractor index has gone down compared to the previous measurement, but is still comparatively good, though not on a level with the long-term targets. Responses bear witness to underlying problems for our contractors when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, and the need for stable business conditions.

This includes both views from the stakeholder dialogue and Sveaskog’s own view of which issues are of greatest importance. E ach year, Sveaskog carries out a materiality analysis in which the most important issues from a sustainability perspective are listed. These are the sustainability issues that have the greatest impact on Sveaskog, but also the issues that Sveaskog is best able to inﬂuence as a company. Stakeholder perceptions are based on a number of index measurements with detailed questions directed at different groups: employees, customers and local organisations. The opinions of stakeholders are then compiled and the various issues discussed by Sveaskog’s sustainability committee and Sveaskog’s group management. During 2018, the weighting of a number of issues was increased in the analysis. This includes the importance of game conservation in relation to the local hunting laws to deal with damage caused by elk grazing. Another issue is skills development and meeting new knowledge needs has an impact on areas that are important to reindeer among stakeholders when it comes to the changes that the husbandry.

Sweden will lead the way in implementing the agenda with a transition both at home and in the global system, according to the government’s national action plan for the 2030 Agenda. Industry plays a crucial role in achieving the goals, and Sveaskog has accepted this task in earnest. Sveaskog can relate to all of the goals, but has mapped those where the company can contribute in the most relevant way.

Sveaskog offers a wide range and is a valued partner for paper and pulp mills. P ulpwood is made up of trees and tree parts that cannot be used by the sawmills. The largest volumes of Sveaskog’s pulpwood come from thinning and regeneration felling. Sveaskog offers a wide range of pulpwood that comes both from its own forest and through the purchase of other forest owners, as well as imports. The offer is also supplemented with cellulose chips from its own sawmill customers. Sveaskog has about 20 pulpwood customers in Sweden. The customers manufacture paper pulp and paper and cardboard that are exported or used in Sweden. The exported pulp is used for packaging and printed cardboard. The pulp is also used in hygiene products such as nappies, paper towels and toilet paper. Pulpwood from Swedish forests has qualities that make it particularly good for packaging with high requirement levels, such as liquid cartons for milk and juice. Sveaskog’s strength is its extensive experience of working with pulpwood customers, and its focus over recent years on developing goods logistics in partnership with them. Sveaskog also has the advantage of being able to offer a wide range of fresh pulpwood and cellulose chips. Market and deliveries The price level passed USD For several years, Swedish paper and cardboard production has enjoyed a positive trend, with rising 1,200/tonne during the volumes and prices.

In one of Sweden’s largest industrial projects, with an investment of nearly SEK 8 billion, SCA has more than doubled the capacity to deliver paper pulp from 430,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes at the mill in Östrand.

Biofuels are good example of the competition from an environmental point of view as the amount of for forest raw materials. carbon dioxide emitted during incineration is the same as that absorbed by the trees during their growth, so there is not the net addition of carbon dioxide that occurs when burning fuel based on fossil raw materials and residues.

S veaskog combines proﬁtable forestry with the preservation of high natural values. The company decided as early as in 2002 to allocate land for long-term conservation corresponding to 20 per cent of its productive forest land. The conservation work uses three different strategies in different geographical scales: eco-parks, conservation forests and consideration for nature in the production forest. The eco-parks There are currently 37 eco-parks across the country, covering a total area of 174,000 hectares. In all eco-parks, at least half the area is allocated for nature conservation, conservation-oriented management and consideration for nature, which in total corresponds to 110,000 hectares. This results in large contiguous forests in landscapes that beneﬁt species that move over large areas, such as various bird species. Nature conservation forests The nature conservation forests cover a total of 300,000 hectares, varying in size from half a hectare to several hundred hectares. These allocations are spread over the entire country. In the north, most of the conservation forests are left for free development, while in the southern part of the country there is often management to recreate or enhance the natural values. Sveaskog allocates the forest areas with the highest natural values as conservation forests. If a new area of forest worth protecting is discovered, for example when drawing up the inventory prior to logging, this area of forest is swapped with land of a lower natural value, thus ensuring Milestones in Sveaskog’s1 environmental work Agreement with the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to Becomes the first Sveaskog give formal protection to Swedish forest Sveaskog is awarded publishes details Restoration/ the company’s domain company to have the World Wide Fund of its allocated recreation of reserves.

Natural value assessments Each year, Sveaskog carries out felling in several thousand locations around Sweden. In all cases, nature valuation inventories are performed before felling in order to pay due regard to the conservation of protected environments and species. All of Sveaskog’s natural value assessments from 2018 onwards are available at sveaskog.se. The aim of Sveaskog’s natural value assessment is to ﬁnd structures and elements of importance in conservation terms. It is relatively common for the inventory to show that there are small areas of high natural value in the forest. Sveaskog will then ensure that the substrates required by the species are located both within the assigned Sveaskog’s eco-parks areas and within the environmentally protected areas THE ECO-PARKS ARE large contiguous areas of countryside left standing during felling. For example, this may be with high natural values and conservation aims. These combine groups of forests containing dead wood, large old trees extensive protection of large areas, including the restoration or watercourses. In this way, sustainable forestry and of natural values, with forestry operations adapted to take valuable structures, substrates and environments will also conservation into account.

This applies in many different parts, both in terms of how Sveaskog itself works, but also in the form of how the company develops its purchases and how the company works to develop logistics. D uring 2018, Sveaskog contracted services for almost SEK 2 billion, and this work corresponds to 1,400 full-time employees. The skills, abilities and attitudes of the contractors are important if Sveaskog is to create trust and value. It is partly about securing well-performed services and partly about minimising risk in the industry in terms of the work environment, social responsibility, working conditions and human rights. Purchasing process Before hiring a contractor, Sveaskog and the contractor establish a written Service Declaration. This clariﬁes Sveaskog’s and society’s requirements, as well as the consequences of non-compliance. The purchaser also checks the contractor with regard to a number of deﬁned points to ensure that it complies with laws and regulations and has the ﬁnancial stability necessary Board of Directors.

Sustainable sourcing and transport SVEASKOG WORKS ACTIVELY to use new technology to streamline transport and logistics. This is both so as to reduce the impact on climate and the environment and to increase the beneﬁt to customers. An important event relating to this work occurred on 1 July 2018. On that day, parts of the national road network were opened to the new load carrying class BK4, and thus to lorries of up to 74 tonnes, an increase of 10 tonnes. BK4 allows the use of heavier vehicles on some parts of the road network, improving the efﬁciency of Sveaskog’s freight transport and helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the entire forest industry. ‘For several years, we had been involved with and run projects relating to this, which means that we could quickly get started with 74-tonne lorries,’ says Torsten Wiborgh, construction engineer and coordinator for all road overseers at Sveaskog. Successful digitisation ‘We are delighted, but here, too, we must continue to Using 74-tonne vehicles means the payload on shipments can have a close dialogue with them in order to understand be increased by 25 per cent and emissions reduced by around their satisfaction and challenges,’ says Mats Oja. ten per cent without any increase in axle load. ‘As there are more axles, there is a lower load per axle Logistics despite the increase in total weight.

A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I LI T Y R E P O R T, 2 018 51 CLI MATE The role of the forest in combaing climate change The Swedish forest is of great importance to Sweden’s aims to become fossil free by 2045. As the forest grows, it helps to take up a large amount of carbon dioxide. By using forest products instead of materials produced using fossil-based resources, we can reduce the negative climate impact. Sveaskog aims to take a leading role in utilising and developing the climatic beneﬁts that forests provide. T he forest has a crucial impact on the climate. At a time when we need do everything to prevent the Earth's temperature from rising, sustainable use of forests is crucial. Forests and forestry provide beneﬁts to climate in a number of ways. The growing forest binds carbon dioxide. As Sveaskog fells signiﬁcantly less than the annual growth, it means that the store of sequestered carbon in the forest is constantly increasing. Part of the felled forest is turned into timber, which then becomes bound in wooden structures. For example, a wooden house can bind the carbon dioxide once taken up by the trees. Using forest raw materials, we can also replace fossil-based products. The more the forest grows, the greater the uptake in some ten years has developed from an innovation of carbon dioxide. Over time, therefore, the greatest project into a full-scale production of raw pine diesel carbon dioxide uptake is in the used forest. Through based on pine oil, a residual product from pulp mills. sustainable forestry and with active forest management measures, Sveaskog promotes a high level of forest New climate targets growth, which at the same time ensures a high level of In Sveaskog’s own operations, transport accounts for carbon sequestration. This allows a continuous harvest half the carbon emissions generated by the company. of forest raw material, which can be used to replace Each year, a total of 290,000 lorry shipments take place, fossil-based resources. In this way, the forest raw or 795 per day. Each journey is an average of 100 km, material harvested from its own forest by Sveaskog in which means that Sveaskog’s lorry shipments cover 2018 has helped ensure that almost 4 million tonnes the equivalent of twice the circumference of the Earth of carbon dioxide from fossil sources has not been each day. Sveaskog is making active efforts to reduce released. Sveaskog sees the forest as a key factor its own carbon emissions. The focus is on increasing in the green transition and is therefore taking part in the involvement of renewable fuels, with a major a variety of development and innovation projects to reduction in fossil-based carbon dioxide. This can be develop the use of forest raw material. An example of achieved by mixing in biodiesel based on abattoir waste this is the pine diesel production from SunPine, which and forest residue. In parallel with this, Sveaskog is Total emissions 2018, tonnes of CO2 Forestry and felling: 43,000 (–15.7%) During the year, Sveaskog’s operations generated carbon dioxide emissions amounting to 115,000 tonnes, which means that the company has reduced Transport: 59,000 (+1.7%) emissions by 29.5 percent compared to 2010, relative to the delivered Road construction: 9,000 (+12.5 %) volume unit. On 1 July 2018, a new law was introduced on fuel sales, referred to as the reduction obligation, which seeks to reduce greenhouse Electricity and heating: 3,000 (0%) gas emissions and to increase the use of renewable fuels. Sveaskog Travel: 800 (–11.1%) welcomes the new law, which means that all fuels, by mixing in renewable fuels, will achieve a certain reduction of fossil CO2 compared to completely fossil-based fuels. It is likely to stimulate increased Swedish production of Total CO2 footprint: 115,000 (+2.8%) renewable fuels, where forest raw material will have an important role to play.

TO PLAN 31.12.2018 30 13 An allocation to deferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 for the full value of the biological asset in accordance with IAS 41. Deferred tax is calculated on the difference between the properties’ book value and Tax assessment values for Swedish properties their value for tax purposes. The properties’ book value comprises the value Group Parent company of growing forest, the value of forest land (see Note 14) and other property MSEK 2018 2017 2018 2017 values (see Note 14).

Sveaskog has assessed that there are no relevant market prices that can be used to value forest holdings of the size held by Sveaskog. Sveaskog is thus carrying out a valuation by calculating the current value of expected future cash ﬂows from the growing forest. Valuation at actual value is being carried out based on Valuation Level Three (see Note 26). Cash ﬂows are calculated for the next 100 years – a period that is deemed to be the forest’s felling cycle. Cash ﬂows are calculated on the basis of felling volumes in accordance with Sveaskog’s current felling plan and assessments of future price and cost developments. Prices are based on a rolling ten-year average (2009-2018). Regarding cost developments, the current normal cost (see model assumptions below) is being applied. Inﬂation assumptions in the model are based on assessed development during the period 2019 to 2119. The cash ﬂows before tax are discounted at an interest rate of 5.75% (5.95), which is deemed to correspond to the long-term weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for this kind of asset. Sveaskog’s board of directors assesses that this interest rate should describe the long-term cost of capital for an investment in forest assets and is not affected by short-term variations in market interest rates.

Accounting with regard to ﬁnancial instruments On the assets side, ﬁnancial instruments recorded in the balance sheet include liquid resources/assets, trade debtors, shares, loans and bonds receivable. Liabilities and equity include trade creditors, loan liabilities and derivatives, long-term liabilities and interest-bearing longand short-term liabilities. Financial instruments are initially recorded at acquisition value corresponding to the instrument’s actual value via the proﬁt/loss statement, with additions for transaction costs for all ﬁnancial instruments other than those belonging to the category Financial asset recorded at actual value via the proﬁt/loss statement. Accounting takes place accordingly, depending on how they have been classiﬁed as below. A ﬁnancial asset or ﬁnancial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the company becomes party to the instrument’s contractual terms. Trade debtors are recognised in the balance sheet when an invoice has been sent. A liability is recognised when the opposite party has performed and there is a contractual obligation to pay, even if the invoice has not yet been received. A ﬁnancial asset is removed from the balance sheet when the rights in the agreement are realised or expire, or when the company loses control of them. The same applies to components of a ﬁnancial asset. A ﬁnancial liability is removed from the balance sheet when the contractual obligation is discharged or otherwise terminated. The same applies to components of a ﬁnancial liability. Acquisition and disposal of ﬁnancial assets are recorded on the business day, which is the day when the company undertakes to acquire or dispose of the asset. At each reporting date the company assesses whether there are objective indications that a ﬁnancial asset or group of ﬁnancial assets are in need of write-down. 102 A N N UA L A N D S U S TA I N A B I LI T Y R E P O R T, 2 018 NOTE R NOTE 21 Cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing liabilities and other financial instruments Financial assets Financial Financial assets valued at actual Financial assets liabilities Derivatives at valued at value through valued at actual valued at actual value Derivatives accrued other value through accrued through the used for acquisition comprehensive the proﬁt/loss acquisition proﬁt/loss hedging Group, MSEK ﬁnancial value income statement value statement purposes Book value Actual value instruments 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 201812 201801 Interest-bearing assets and liabilities Interest-bearing long-term assets Interest-bearing other long-term receivables – – – – 3 5 – – – – – – 3 5 3 5 Total – – – – 3 5 – – – – – – 3 5 3 5 Liquid resources/assets Cash at bank and in hand 387 1,144 – – – – – – – – – – 387 1,144 387 1,144 Short-term investments 460 537 – – – – – – – – – – 460 537 460 537 Total 847 1,681 – – – – – – – – – – 847 1,681 847 1,681 Total interest-bearing assets 847 1,681 – – 3 5 – – – – – – 850 1,686 850 1,686 Interest-bearing long-term liabilities MTN (Limit SEK 8,000m) – – – – – – 3,888 4,387 – – – – 3,888 4,387 4,041 4,545 – Bank facilities (Limit 4,200) – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – Loan participations – – – – – 800 800 – – – – 800 800 801 801 Interest-rate derivatives 9 9 70 68 79 77 79 77 Total – – – – – – 4,688 5,187 9 9 70 68 4,768 5,264 4,921 5,423 Interest-bearing current liabilities Commercial-paper programme (Limit SEK 5,000m) – – – – – – 2.212 2,412 – – – – 2.212 2,412 2.212 2,411 MTN (Limit SEK 8,000m) – – – – – – 500 600 – – – – – – 500 600 Banking facilities – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – – Loan participations – – – – – – – 400 – – – – – – – 400 Interest-rate derivatives – – – – – – – – – 3 – 27 – 30 – 30 Utilised bank-overdraft facility and overnight loans – – – – – – 12 – – – – – 12 – – – Total – – – – – – 2,724 3,412 – 3 – 27 2,724 3,442 2,712 3,441 Total interest-bearing liabilities – – – – 7,412 8,599 9 12 70 95 7,491 8,706 7,633 8,864 Non-interest-bearing ﬁnancial instruments Long-term non-interest-bearing assets Other long-term holdings in securities (spec.

The company is of the opinion that these indicators provide valuable supplementary information to investors and the company’s management as they enable the evaluation of the company’s performance. Since not all companies calculate their ﬁnancial metrics in the same manner, these are not always comparable with the indicators used by other companies. Accordingly, these ﬁnancial metrics should not be considered a substitute for the indicators deﬁned in accordance with IFRS. The table below presents indicators that are not deﬁned in accordance with IFRS, unless otherwise stated. Net operating assets Deﬁnition: Total assets excl. interest-bearing assets, tax assets and assets held for sale minus non-interest-bearing assets and deferred tax liabilities, all calculated at the end of the period/year.

The Group’s deﬁnition is unchanged compared with previous periods. Comment: Yield is one of Sveaskog’s ﬁnancial goals, that goal being an average yield of at least 4.5%.
