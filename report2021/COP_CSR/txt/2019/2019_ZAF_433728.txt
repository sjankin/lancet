Growing local manufacturing, local content, local procurement and local innovation. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4. Responsible Sourcing 4.1. Management approach viiEdcon utilises and is driving a decentralised federal model where the operating chains contribute and collaborate in key initiatives, with impact on the clothing textile approach to sourcing and collaborations. Edcon acknowledges its responsibility to use its influence to encourage good environmental, social and governance practices in its supply chain. By directing more of its spend to local and regional suppliers, not only is this further entrenching the benefits of a quick response business model, it also seeks to help to develop the economies in which Edcon’s current and future customers live and work, including the more specific transformation goals such as enterprise and supplier development. Edcon Local manufacturing has increased to 53%. viii Commitment to the excellence of products – Unpacking Edcon’s Circular Economy – Closing the Loop As a Proudly SA member Edcon and its associated brands can use the logo to showcase its local manufacturing and/or local brands. This is done through the corporate brands, as well as on products including labelling, promotional material, in store promotions and campaigns. Figure 5: Unpacking Edcon’s Circular Economy 15 Long-Term Fabric Strategy Review and identify areas of improvement and differentiation in line with each Operating Divisions value proposition. Standardize qualities on common fabrics and reduce the long fabric tail where possible, while also identifying opportunities for fabric consolidation and fabric cost reductions. SA Cotton Cluster Edcon joined the Cluster in 2017 and committed to 600 tons of cotton lint (from SA cotton farmers and it has since increased its commitment to 2200 tons. The aim of the initiative is to implement a fully integrated Supply Chain “from farm to shelf”, creating sustainability in the pipeline, reviving the local cotton sector, promoting near sourcing and Quick Response and driving job creation in South Africa. Sustainable Raw Materials Long-Term focus to incorporate textiles that allow Edcon to reduce its environmental impact and protect biodiversity, such as organic cotton, which does not require fertilisers or chemical pesticides, and viscose where fibre has originated from wood in forests that are managed in a sustainable way. Product Development: Fit For Purpose Fit performance, styling and fabric performance can be analysed upfront on a full size curve and adjustments can be made prior to sampling. Supplier Landscape: Strategy & Management Edcon has made significant progress in reducing absolute supplier numbers, shifting more product to Local / Regional vendors and balancing the geo mix over the past 2-3 years. Quick Response / Fast fashion Quick Response is the ability of any business to respond quickly to actual consumer demand within a season through a well-planned testing and planning strategy. Responsible Manufacturing: Integrated supply chain & compliance Edcon will for the first time be able to rigorously supervise the manufacturing process for our products, from the acquisition of raw materials to the completion of the product ensuring compliance from start to finish through our on-site facility and product audits through to our in-house QA and lab test. Assessment of wet processes Edcon is committed to and takes a concerted effort to ensure that the production processes of its items from the selection of the components, to the finished product are completed in a safe and sustainable manner. This requires exhaustive knowledge of the supply chain and complete preparation and supervision of the facilities and the products used. The wet processes include dyeing, printing & finishing. Preferential Procurement and B-BBEE (South Africa) The Procurement Policy already includes provision for a set aside of procurement spend with Black Women Owned enterprises, Exempt Micro Enterprises and Qualifying Micro Enterprises (Section 10 of the Procurement Policy). Within the South African context, Edcon fully supports the Broad Based-Black Economic Empowerment (B-B-BEE) codes and encourages the increased participation of black-owned, black-women owned and designated groups in Edcon procurement activities. 16 Strategic projects, commitments, and progress to date Commitment 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 1.

The SA vendors contribute almost 80% of the Local Regional volume, balance 20% placed with regional vendors (Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho etc.)x. (2) As Edcon does not manufacture the majority of its own merchandise but instead works closely with a number of suppliers, the largest supplier of the private-label apparel accounted for 3.5% of the total purchases, and the largest five suppliers accounted for 14.9% of such purchases. (3) All Edcon suppliers are evaluated using internal criteria. The Supply Chain and Sourcing Department is committed to supporting the development of local industries, promoting and tracking ESG performance of local supply base by reducing waste and energy across the supply chain. This will be done through ethical production, development of local industries and resource conservation. Progress note on 2018 targets:  The targets for the Sustainable Cotton Cluster exceeded performance. Not only did Edcon attain the target, the 2018 commitment increased to 1600 tons and 2200 in 2019.  The Chino fabrication by Edcon was the first under the Proudly South African brand to retail.  Edcon continues with supplier development and screening of suppliers 4.2. Enterprise and Supplier Development (ESD) Approach The Edcon Enterprise and Supplier Development Programme (Group ESD) operates as a Centre of Excellence (CoE) to the Edcon Divisions to achieve locally sourced and manufactured merchandise and products. As a Centre of Excellence, Group ESD works in conjunction with the Chain Merchants, Sourcing and Quality Assurance to ensure that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with the relevant product or service are identified, trained and capacitated to deliver on the Chain’s requirements. This is in line with the Group’s Definition of Purpose of being a trusted, long-term partner of sourcing competitive local in-country manufactured product of fast fashion. 17 Edcon is also committed to promoting, accelerating and supporting the development of broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) compliant suppliers through the way it directs its procurement spending on goods and services, as well as through enterprise development initiatives. Management approachxi The approach to ESD is differentiated between the types of assistance a current supplier qualifies for based on the screening. The staggered approach screens existing suppliers on their current characteristics, namely:  Retail readiness  Sourcing experience and repeatability with Edcon/other retailers  Capacity issues Based on these three criteria, a supplier can qualify for enterprise development (ED) or supplier development (SD) assistance, with SD being a longer-term view and based on all the above criteria being met. As an SD candidate – the product type and business model of the supplier operations must meet the requirements of the Edcon business unit for a successful and commercial beneficial relationship with the supplier being developed.

Some of the direct influences include water and electricity consumption, waste disposal and the choice of merchandise, packaging and services provided. Indirect environmental influences stem from partnerships with suppliers and manufacturers of merchandise and packaging, transport contractors, property developers, landlords of business sites and the communities and projects supported. The Group’s approach is guided by the Edcon environmental policy, which commits the Group to the reasonable and cost-effective management of its direct and indirect impacts on the environment, and providing a healthy and safe environment for employees and customersxii. The energy management programme ensures that the carbon footprint of the organisation is consistently measured through its stores and all locations. The approach adopted to manage the environmental challenges and opportunities is in a prudent and phased manner with the focus on high impact, low cost projects such as switching off all unused equipment, while undertaking regular maintenance of lighting, heating and cooling systems makes for optimal operations. Fundamental store refurbishment is in the longer-term plans, with implementation of more effective energy-efficiency measures. 19 5.2.

Energy management  Edcon instituted a new energy management programme as of the 1st of April 2016. The rising costs of energy and the need to keep up with technology, has seen Edcon seek alternative means of energy conservation.  The energy management programme constitutes the replacement of old meters for new smart meters that collate information to a central system. The collation of this information seeks to ensure there is reduced energy consumption, thereby not only reducing costs, but also cutting down on the carbon footprint. The methodology being used to ultimately calculate the energy usage is through baseline data and readjustmentsxiii due to there being no direct way of measuring electricity use savings, as electricity meters cannot measure the absence of electricity use or demand. However, the absence of electricity use or demand can be calculated by comparing measurements of electricity use and/or demand from before and after the implementation of an electricity cost savings measure. Post the baseline projections, the electricity consumption will be monitored and results reported to ensure that the ECM (Energy Conservation Measure) is managed according to the original intent i.e. cost savings and carbon footprint reduction. 20 Edcon Group Energy Management Reduction: All Edcon kWh (Kilo-Watt hour) Division 1 (COR) Division 2 (EDG) Division 3 Division 4 (CNA) % inc/dec Edcon Total Total Total (DISC) Total Total YoY Month (FY 2018) April 1,898.15 8,409,726.14 6,099,031.61 834,878.50 15,343,636.25 May 3,967.68 7,888,259.83 5,743,577.80 797,129.32 14,428,966.95 June 4,457.52 7,219,822.65 5,160,379.63 737,027.92 13,117,230.20 July 3,981.83 7,247,800.13 5,300,130.30 728,939.28 13,276,869.71 August 3,545.29 7,354,116.45 5,212,853.89 727,940.16 13,294,910.50 September 2,003.37 7,857,018.78 5,642,670.45 735,832.15 14,235,521.38 October 2,152.21 7,996,345.48 5,969,315.34 775,570.16 14,741,230.98 November 1,755.64 8,437,556.74 6,342,016.20 815,388.72 15,594,961.66 December 1,567.95 9,134,412.13 7,338,197.48 866,874.91 17,339,484.52 January 1,829.14 8,953,749.12 6,967,729.30 903,798.49 16,825,276.91 February 1,675.68 7,907,373.61 6,293,377.00 790,278.60 14,991,029.21 March 1,817.97 8,487,944.36 6,618,947.55 809,171.27 15,916,063.18 TOTALS 30,652.43 96,894,125.42 72,688,226.55 9,522,829.48 179,105,181.45 Month (FY 2019) April 2,080.19 7,843,828.41 5,786,412.41 804,461.87 14,434,702.69 -6% May 3,622.55 7,253,627.00 5,465,516.75 781,555.61 13,500,699.36 -6% June 4,359.92 6,534,284.92 4,893,475.55 708,761.30 12,136,521.77 -7% July 5,088.94 6,597,527.16 4,974,554.41 702,872.34 12,274,953.91 -8% August 2,998.72 6,775,696.01 5,113,290.17 694,892.48 12,583,878.66 -5% September 2,263.79 7,137,878.22 5,358,080.82 711,845.52 13,207,804.56 -7% October 2,771.19 7,857,566.92 5,868,600.54 782,185.20 14,508,352.66 -2% November 3,760.65 8,080,927.64 6,252,479.34 771,849.06 15,105,256.04 -3% December 3,192.00 9,085,163.35 6,978,680.13 857,131.47 16,920,974.95 -2% January 3,422.56 8,773,195.78 6,837,353.52 849,021.61 16,459,570.91 -2% February 3,334.97 7,629,667.44 6,095,767.47 730,105.76 14,455,540.67 -4% March 2,879.83 8,058,158.50 6,475,624.06 774,916.61 15,308,699.17 -4% TOTALS 39,775.31 91,627,521.35 70,099,835.17 9,169,598.83 170,896,955.35 % inc/dec YoY -5% -4% -4% -5% -5% Table 4: Progress on energy reduction, Source: RMS Energy Report, March 2019 Cumulative savings energy management Table 5: Cumulative energy consumption savings, Source: RMS Energy Report, March 2019 21 5.4. Lighting  Lighting is the second highest consumption area for Edcon and its facilities department has projects in place for the maintenance and upgrade of its systems, especially in keeping abreast of the latest technology solutions. To reduce lighting costs even further, sensors triggered by daylight or movement can contribute to saving energy and have been installed. Daylight sensors, switch on when it becomes dark, a feature which is particularly valuable in conserving energy in areas such as unused meeting rooms, illuminating signage, toilets, etc. The Building Management System (BMS) switch lights on escalators/lights, etc. The -programme started in 2016 and has generated over R12m savings in Diesel consumption. Stores have been equipped with BMS RTU’s. These units control a number of relays that typically controls the lighting and air-conditioning systems on a time schedule. The BMS RTU can be programmed remotely through the Edcon PNPSCADA system interface, which is the interface used for the smart meter data management. The BMSRTU roll out forms part of the after-hours consumption project, and is intended to ensure that the afterhours consumption is limited to essential services only. The after-hours period is defined as from 19h00 to 07h00 every day. 5.5. Cooling appliances Edcon is cognisant of the impact of R22 Gas use in air conditioning units placed in its stores and buildings. R22 Gas or HCFC-22 is established as an ozone-depleting substance. R22 is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential that is 1810 times as powerful as carbon dioxide. Edcon has proactively decided to phase out the R22 gas from the business starting in 2016 to the event of being completely R22 Gas free. The following tables below is a report on R22 gas. Information has been supplied to RMS by Edconxiv: Table 6: Edcon R22 Reporting, Source: RMS Energy Report, March 2019 3.1 Waste management: Edcon has a waste management solution for its headquarters. The organisation utilises the services of Emmunah Waste (Pty) Ltd to collect its waste and report. The following diagrams is a sample illustration of the waste removal cycle that Emmunah Waste utilises, which has also been utilised in educating staff on the waste management process. 22 Strategic projects and commitments and progress to date Commitment 2016 2017 2018 2019 1.

Edcon relies on its dedicated employees to identify and secure top quality fashion brands and merchandise, to execute the Group’s strategy and to build its brand through giving its customers excellent service. Employees are also significant shareholders, owning 10.6% of the issued share capital of the Group. Edcon’s sustainability framework ensures the development of a high performance culture in support of national development goals. This includes a focus on diversity and inclusion through the various transformation initiatives. The Group is committed to a progressive talent management strategy focused on attracting, developing, rewarding and recognising the required capabilities and competencies to drive a high performance organisation. Human resources practices, policies and objectives are aligned to the organisation’s strategic goals through an integrated performance management, skills development, employment equity, remuneration and benefits programme. In executing its mandate, the HR department switched over to being the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in support of embedding sustainable transformative human capital practices into the business. 4.2 Objectives In driving Transformation, one of the key tools at the disposal of business is the measurement of Employment Equity (EE). A three-year employment equity plan is devised by the organisation as per requirement of the Department of Labour in response to the challenges, opportunities for Edcon to create not only an equitable work environment but contribute to the meaningful transformation of the retail sector. The objectives of the 2018 2021 Edcon Employment Equity (EE) plan include the following:  Eliminating any unfair discrimination  Dismantle any barriers to Employment Equity  Ensure representation of designated groups at all occupational levels  Skills Development /Training 24 Skills development at Edcon aims to:  Provide learning and career development opportunities for all employees.  Ensure a sustainable supply of talent to meet current and future business needs.  Develop learning and career paths for critical and scarce skills.  Design and implement flagship skills development programs aligned to the group talent and resourcing plan and defined capabilities.  Support Edcon’s Transformation agenda, thus improving the BBBEE rating on skills development for Edcon.  Ensure compliance with Skills Development legislation, such as Workplace Skills Plan (WSP), Annual Training Report (ATR), Pivotal Planning, etc.  Maintain Edcon’s accreditation as a Private Training Provider.  Lead and influence the Wholesale & Retail SETA (W&RSETA) regarding the retail sector, environment and skills needs  Position Edcon as the leader in retail skills development  Leverage Skills development opportunities in positioning Edcon as the Employer of Choice  Forge strategic partnerships with the external market to compete for the best available talent in the retail industry, in partnership with HET Institutions (universities & colleges) 4.2.1 Functional skills Edcon spending on functional skills as of March 2019 is apportioned towards women employees, which is in line with the strategic objectives of the organisation. Total Spend Number Expenditure Male 38 053 R 13 904 201,00 Female 93 926 R 33 272 754,00 4.2.2 Learnerships, internships and academic programmes The importance of developing critical skills is that it begins to address some of the areas of transformation that Edcon and the retail sector is required to address. A total of 116 Learners and 185 interns were targeted for 2019, leveraging on Seta funding. 4.3 Ethical behaviour Consistency is recognised as the foundation of ethical behaviour. In an organization the size of Edcon, consistency can be a challenge, but the challenge can be overcome by having clear policy direction at a Group level to inform the various Operating Divisions on ethical behaviour in order to ensure an orderly workforce. Having moved most of the discipline and performance management functions to the Operating Divisions to reside with Line Managers, the ER department still plays an important role to ensure the continued and consistent application of discipline and performance management by providing expert advice to Line Manager and HR Business Partners against the backdrop of a wide variety of polices which informs principles relating to misconduct and incapacity. 25 The risk associated with external labour disputes are still managed at a Group level, as is collective bargaining with the recognized unions in the various countries. The continued focus on fair employment practices, compliance with employment legislation in contracts and policies and maintaining strong relationships with important stakeholders, like unions, ensure a stable labour climate which is required at a time when the business is fully focused on its turnaround strategy. 4.4 Employee communications  The Employment Equity report is displayed for any employee to view. Not only is this prescribed by the Labour Relations Act, but it ensures that with the operating divisions engage robustly on the issues.  The Employment Equity Forum has representatives from various business areas and labour representatives. These representatives feedback to the various employee groups as mandated.  Any pertinent information is transmitted via the Edcon intranet and newsletter Strategic projects, commitments, and progress to date Commitment 2018 2019 2021 1.

We believe in transformation that creates opportunities for real development. We have a deep commitment to growing our communities, harvesting the benefits of diversity and driving social inclusion. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------5 Corporate Social Investment 5.1 Management approach Edcon acknowledges that environmental, social and governance issues have an impact on its operations and similarly the Group’s activities have an impact on the environment and society in which it operates. The Group understands that failing to address issues of non-financial sustainability ultimately affects its business through challenges that may include escalating utility costs, declining staff productivity, regulatory fines or reputational damage. The organisation is involved in a number of social and environmental initiatives that aim to enhance the communities in which it trades and build a more sustainable future. The sustainability focus areas are based on the understanding that a sustainability strategy helps the Group innovate to drive competitiveness in a changing world. The responsibility towards the development and upliftment of its communities, while pursuing its business objectives remains a key a commitment to contributing towards making a sustainable difference. Corporate Social Investment (CSI) is therefore an integral part of Edcon’s transformation strategy. 5.2 Strategic Focus Area The Edcon CSI programme is driven strategically in alignment with the CoE model. Embedding sustainable practices into the business is critical and underpins vertical and horizontal integration in the business strategy. The organisation is involved in a number of social development initiatives that aim to enhance the economic empowerment of women, youth and persons with disabilities and employee volunteerism, such as Edgars UNiTE Orange Day Campaign, the Design Innovation Challenge, Casual Day Campaign for persons with disabilities and the Edcon Growing Hope Employee Volunteer Programme. 27 5.2.1 Edgars UNiTE Orange Day Campaign In conjunction with the Edgars division, the organisation is rolling out the Edgars UNiTE Orange Day campaign to not only underpin the importance of women and gender based violence, but also to address the development of a new women-owned supplier base into the business. The Edgars UNiTE Orange Day Campaign is a partnership with UN Women, the South African provincial Departments of Social Development, with a planned staggered rollout into the country’s nine provinces. It forms part of Edcon’s commitment towards the UN UNiTE Campaign and the UN Women HeforShe initiative. The programme seeks to interpret the key aspects of the drivers of gender based violence through integrated skills, economic and psychosocial model designed to address and advocate for the economic empowerment of women survivors of gender based violence. The Edgars UNiTE “Orange Dialogues” are used to bring the gender conversation into the consumer space. Figure 6: Edgars UNiTE Project impact 2016 -2018 0000 28 Edgars UNiTE Campaign rolled out to 3 provinces (Gauteng, KZN & Western Cape),, 229 women survivors of gender-based violence have undergone a 12months intervention including accredited training in sewing and design. Additionally, 100 of these women were selected to received accredited training in sewing to commemorate Nelson Mandela and Albertina Sisulu Centenary year. 90% of the women are deriving additional income from the sewing skills gained. +/60 % of the women are “Paying it forward” teaching other women sewing at church groups, community centres etc. In the lead to the Global Citizen festival held in Johannesburg in December, 2019, Edgars UNiTE Orange Day Campaign partnered with UN Women in a side event hosted by UN Women Execucitive Director, Dr Phumzule Mlambo-Ngcuka, presenting UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Danai Gurira. An exhibition of the campaign formed part of the Nelson Mandela Foundation “Isithunzi Sabafazi:The Dignity of Women Dialogue Session” with Oprah Winfery and Mrs Gracą Machel, held in Johannesburg as part of the Nelson Mandela Centenary. Recognition Awards The Edgars UNiTE Orange Day Campaign was nominated and has received several recognition awards including: Mbokodo Humanitarian Award, Global Entrepreneurship Network Compass Award, the Public Private Partnership category of the Gauteng Premier’s Service Excellence Awards and Best Contribution to the Reputation of the Profession Award. 5.2.2 The Design Innovation Challenge The increasing trend away from global brands to locally sourced product requires Edcon to start building a pipeline of young emerging designers, strengthening customer proximity, reducing stock, and increasing product momentum. Edcon has committed itself to driving localisation and as part of this commitment; the Group launched the Edcon Design Innovation Challenge a combined CSI, skills development, and enterprise development initiative in September 2016 that seeks to nurture and develop a pipeline of young talent for not only Edcon employment but also possible integration into the Group supply chain. The young designers’ merchandise collections was sold in selected Edgars stores extending the design innovation challenge into the commercial retail market. The Edcon Design Innovation Challenge is fully endorsed by Proudly South African as a Proudly South African Initiative. The Edcon Design Innovation Challenge is an initiative that seeks to address a two pronged approach – a 21 Steps to Retail programme that facilitates transition from fashion design graduate students to retail experience and an experiential one-year internship for with the opportunity for absorption into Edcon employment or other the retail industry players. This initiative contributes and adds to Edcon’s employee intake and the attraction critical skills into the business and further, enhances the BBBEE compliance through absorption into the organisation. 29 PROGRAMME IMPACT 2017 2019 Unemployed Other Employer Edcon Internship Selected Univ/College 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 2019 2018 2017 Table 7: The Designs Innovation Challenge impact: 2016 -2019 Designs by interns in the Edcon Design Innovation Challenge Brics Fashion Forum Edcon participated in the 2018 BRICS Fashion Forum held in Johannesburg, South Africa, sharing a case study on inclusive growth, localization and its impact as experienced through the implementation of the Design Innovation Challenge and shared inputs on building sustainability into the value chain. 5.2.3. Casual Day Campaign One of the successful initiatives that has garnered employee participation and support is the annual Casual Day Campaign – an initiative of the National Council for Persons with Disabilities South Africa (NCPDSA) that raises awareness and funding for organisations for and working with persons with disabilities. Edcon has been an anchor funder of the Casual Day campaign for six (6) years ending 2018, contributing over R25million over this period to the cause and continues to support the initiative through its retail stores. Casual Day drives the NCPDSA mandate for social change, which is in line with Edcon CSI, transformation and Sustainability. 30 5.2.4. Edcon Growing Hope Employee Volunteer Programme The Edcon Growing Hope programme forms part of the organisation’s objectives and approach to charitable giving and a policy of encouraging employee involvement in local charities, community projects and voluntary organisations. A platform to actively engage and involve employees in social issues where Edcon is able to share its human resources capital (Hope Growers) to build relationships that position its brands and sub-brand in a favourable position with beneficiary organisations, governments and communities. Leverages non-cash assets (product, employee time & expertise/skills or other company assets) to enhance staff morale and loyalty. 5.3 The level of charitable donations Despite financial challenges, Edcon has retained its CSI budget, which has been steady and commitments are managed closely as most are multiyear, as opposed to yearly and impact driven.
