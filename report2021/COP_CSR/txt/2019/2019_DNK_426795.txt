It is handled by the OEKO-TEX Association. Nybo still a frontrunner in sustainable work wear Nybo Workwear do not just want to be a manufacturer of light work wear. We also want to be an innovative frontrunner of sustainability and ecology. In end 2015 we have launched our very first sustainable collection: Nature. Nature is a collection of upper parts made of regenerated polyester and organic cotton. Nature is now available in 5 colors, which indicate purity, freshness and healthiness thereby supporting the good qualities of the sustainable fabric. We have also expanded the collection with one more model for women. Regenerated polyester is made of e.g. old dumped plastic bottles found in nature or at landfill sites. In contrast to the production of traditional polyester, no oil is used in the production of regenerated polyester and therefore the consumption of energy and the CO2 emissions are profoundly less. Organic cotton protects the environment because no pesticides are used in the production. A production without pesticides naturally also contributes to improved living and working conditions of the cotton farmers. With Nature, the user does not only get a high quality product. He also gets a product produced under sustainable and resource-saving conditions and the user actively supports a production with a good conscience and takes responsibility for our common future. At Nybo Workwear, we believe that sustainability is imperative in the future production of work wear and we have now taken the first step. We will focus on having a total concept of sustainable collections in different ways to offer to our customers. We have focus on sustainable products – and for us it is not only to use sustainable fabrics but also to produce quality products with a long lifetime so the customers have to have as few supplies of garments in the contract with the enduser.
