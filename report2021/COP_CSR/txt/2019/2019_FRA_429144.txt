Our five sustainability engagements support our vision for next generation digital security.” Philippe Vallée Chief Executive Officer Being a leader in digital security, our solutions touch billions of people’s lives every day. Ensuring these solutions are sustainable in the way they are made and used, while also creating the greatest value for all our stakeholders is central to our approach. With clients in over 180 countries our impact on digital security is global. Our five specific sustainability engagements set-out in 2017 (see page 03) aim to support our Next Generation Digital Security strategy. For example in 2018, we launched our Non-Profit Program for Trust in the Digital World which supports research in Responsible Digital Identity as well as other topics. We also deployed a mandatory on-line training course on personal data protection for all our 15, 000 employees. Energy being an increasingly critical resource to power the digital world, we grew our use of renewable energy worldwide.
