Purchases from local suppliers over the course of the year accounted for 12.4% of all of the goods we procured and services we hired. (GRI 204) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2018 | UNACEM 48 SUPPLIER EVALUATION Through our Procurements Division, we evaluate the providers of goods and services on whom the quality of our products depends. For this purpose, we ask them to fill out the Supplier Evaluation Form, which has the force of a sworn statement. This form includes general information, such as the list of brands and products, warranty and after-sales service, as well as information on quality management, environmental issues, occupational health and safety, social responsibility, and anticorruption practices. Depending on the score obtained, we decide whether a supplier meets our standards, and thus is an eligible candidate with which to establish a business relationship. We also require all of our suppliers and contractors to act with respect for human rights, and to commit to following the Company’s policies and procedures on the matter. One clear example of this commitment is their compliance with the identity verification procedure for all individuals upon being hired. This procedure serves to corroborate each worker’s identity In 2018, we continuously evaluated our suppliers and It should be noted that, to date, we have not received and ensure legal age, based on personal documentation, contractors, registering 232 new suppliers who successfully any complaints or grievances in relation to human rights thus fostering a culture of preventive safety among all of passed through these filters.

To achieve this, it is essential to identify, assess, and implement opportunities for environmental improvement. Gas and Particulate Matter Emissions We believe it is important to reduce our emissions of particulate matter and greenhouse gases for each ton cement that we produce, as well as our indirect greenhouse gas emissions. With this goal in mind, UNACEM has carried out the following projects and activities: > At the Atocongo plant, we use natural gas in part of the manufacture of our cements, which has reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by over 120,000 tons annually.

We recognize that our processes require large amounts of energy to manufacture our products. For this reason, we use modern, efficient technologies implemented through upgrades and overhauls, as well as rolling out new, ecologically efficient production lines. One of our strategies for achieving this goal is the development and preparation of blended cements, which have a lower clinker/cement ratio, and thus require less energy consumption. We also monitor our heat and electricity consumption for each ton of clinker and cement produced in our plants. We also incorporate and encourage the use of clean energy, such as that generated at our Carpapata I, II, and III hydroelectric plants. Additionally, we are the majority partner in Compañía Eléctrica El Platanal (CELEPSA), which provides us with hydroelectric power for our Atocongo and Condorcocha plants. Lastly, we have taken other actions aimed at improving our energy efficiency, most notably: > Encouraging the rational use of electricity at our camps > Gradually changing over the technology used in the > Optimizing the management of energy resources in and facilities, by promoting “Earth Hour” and carrying old production lines for new equipment that is more our hydroelectric plants. out campaigns on efficient energy consumption. efficient in its consumption of energy. > Optimizing coal consumption by using adequate mixes for our processes.
