Tracey McDermott Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing, Conduct, Financial Crime and Compliance 2 Standard Chartered Sustainability Summary 2018 Contributing to sustainable Being a responsible Investing in Sustainability OVERVIEW economic growth company communities data Shaping our response to climate change Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing society today. Recognising the scale and complexity of the challenge, we are collaborating with clients and external stakeholders to find solutions that support the Paris Agreement. In 2018, we reinforced our commitment to addressing climate change. We announced our decision to end financing for new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, save where we have an existing commitment. This followed extensive consultation with investors, civil society organisations and government representatives that informed our decision. Before the announcement, we engaged with affected clients to discuss our position and its implications for them. Given coal’s role in power generation in our markets, this decision required us to decline participation in potential transactions. To support clients through the low-carbon transition, we have committed to develop a methodology to measure, manage and ultimately reduce emissions related to the financing we provide. This has implications beyond our own business. As such, we are collaborating with other financial institutions via the Science Based Targets Expert Advisory Group and through signing the Katowice Commitment to progress this work. We have updated our Aspiration for climate change to reflect these new commitments and will focus on delivering against these targets in 2019. CASE STUDIES Sustainable and responsible banking Extending finance through digital banking In 2018, we worked with UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, to deliver faster, safer payments to 4,000 people in the Meheba Refugee Camp in Zambia, using our mobile wallet Straight2Bank. We replaced inefficient cash distributions with digital money transfers direct to recipients’ mobile phones. The trackable payments reach beneficiaries quickly and the solution is now being considered by other UN agencies. Supporting the fight against financial crime We work with clients and counterparties to raise standards through our Correspondent Banking Academies. Between 2015 and 2018, we trained 5,000 people from 1,200 organisations in more than 70 countries. This training focuses on ‘de-risking through education’ to build understanding and improve anti-money laundering and financial crime compliance controls.

OUR SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT Since 2009, we have measured the socio-economic impact of our financing in markets to better understand how we contribute to sustainable economic growth. To date, we Measuring have commissioned independent socio-economic impact studies in Bangladesh, Ghana, Indonesia and Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2018, we published our latest report assessing the our impact in contribution we make in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. East Africa is on the rise. Growing trade in the region is supported by the East African Community through a East Africa customs union and common regional market. It has a young and growing labour force, rapid adoption of technology and steadily improving living standards. We want to ensure that the business we do in the region supports sustainable development. Using 2016 data, the report illustrates the positive socioeconomic impact of our financing. We provided $3.4 billion in financing to businesses, consumers and government agencies helping key sectors like manufacturing to expand and connecting the region to global markets. We supported a further $2.8 billion of value-added impact through salaries, tax and local company profits – equivalent to 2.1 per cent of the region’s GDP. We directly and indirectly supported more than one million jobs with our clients and their associated value chains. 4 Standard Chartered Sustainability Summary 2018 Contributing to sustainable Being a responsible Investing in Sustainability OVERVIEW economic growth company communities data To further integrate sustainability and Identifying opportunities Supporting our communities responsibility across the organisation, we Our ambition is to increase our support In 2018, we launched Futuremakers by created a new Bank-wide Sustainability for sustainable finance.

Understanding our sustainability themes During the year, we consulted stakeholders on increasing our commitment to sustainable finance and adapting our community programmes to respond to the changing economic and social needs in our communities. These consultations contributed to our enhanced ambition to promote sustainable finance and economic inclusion in our communities. In addition, we deepened our engagement across a range of sustainability themes that matter to stakeholders and impact our business, including coal, climate change and human rights. The outcomes of the limited-scope materiality review we conducted in 2017 continue to represent the key themes raised by stakeholders in 2018. We share how we manage and measure progress against these issues through policies and statements on sc.com, our Annual Report and Accounts and this publication.

Overview Here for good As set out in our Sustainability Aspirations, we partner with clients to deliver sustainable finance. In 2018, we mobilised $20.8 billion for infrastructure development, including $2.9 billion towards clean technology, and helped our clients issue $9.1 billion in green bonds. We exceeded our Power Africa commitment by supporting more than $5 billion of power generation projects between 2013 and 2018. We closely manage lending to high-impact sectors and continue to progress our approach to climate change. In 2018, we reviewed 827 transactions against our Position Statements and trained more than 1,300 front-line colleagues on our revised environmental and social risk framework. We set out our intention to develop a Bank-wide climate risk management framework and published our first report aligned to the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We set a climate change Aspiration in 2016 as an important first step toward understanding the impact of climate change on our clients and portfolio. Since then, we have developed assessment criteria for energy utilities clients and expanded this to other high emitting sectors in 2018. Given that the complexity of this issue necessitates a holistic and strategic approach, New 2019 Sustainability we have not yet introduced these criteria into our decision-making processes and therefore Aspirations are in the gatefold at the back of this document have marked this Aspiration as Not Achieved. We are building on this work as we develop our climate risk management framework. In 2019, we will develop a Bank-wide sustainable finance strategy, extend environmental and social risk reviews to Private Bank transactions and take forward the targets in our updated Climate change Aspiration. SUSTAINABLE FINANCE In 2018, we acted as green loan coordinator on a transaction that repriced and extended a $2 billion conventional and Murabaha (Islamic) revolving credit facility Supporting green to DP World. DP World is a leading enabler of global trade through its ports and terminals, maritime services, industrial parks, lending in the logistics and economic zones. Recognising DP World’s ambition to be a pioneer in the Middle East region’s capital markets and a leader in sustainability, we proposed a green loan that would incentivise the company to become more environmentally efficient. The deal is the Middle East’s first green loan that links pricing to the company’s carbon emissions, and the first with this link in an Islamic format. The loan provides DP World with a financial incentive to improve its environmental performance. Aligned to our Sustainability Philosophy, the transaction supports our commitment to find innovative ways to mobilise capital to have a positive environmental and social impact in our markets. 6 Standard Chartered Sustainability Summary 2018 CONTRIBUTING TO SUSTAINABLE Being a responsible Investing in Sustainability Overview ECONOMIC GROWTH company communities data Target: We will work with Aspirations our clients to: Target date Progress Infrastructure ¼¼ Provide advisory, financing, debt structuring services and ¼¼ Jan 2017 – Dec 2019 (infrastructure) Achieved / Ongoing Everyone should have access to safe, 2018: $20.8 billion policy advice for $25 billion reliable and affordable power and 2017 – 2018: $33.6 billion of infrastructure projects, infrastructure which transforms lives including $4 billion toward ¼¼ Jan 2016 – Dec 2020 Achieved / Ongoing and strengthens economies clean technology (clean technology) 2018: $2.9 billion 2016 – 2018: $4.9 billion Climate change ¼¼ Introduce criteria to assess alignment to a 1.5-degree ¼¼ May 2016 – Dec 2017 (partially met in Not Achieved Climate change is one of today’s greatest See facing page for more climate scenario for energy 2017; carried forward challenges and addressing it is essential information sector clients and transactions to 2018) to promote sustainable economic growth ¼¼ Expand climate assessment ¼¼ Jan 2018 – Dec 2018 Achieved criteria to other high-emitting Worked with the United sectors Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI) and 15 banks to pilot climate assessment criteria for additional sectors including oil and gas and transportation, and reported publicly through UNEP-FI.

Most of this is supplied by water tankers and is used to keep IT servers cool, but it is also needed for the cafeteria, washrooms and landscaping. In 2018, the Chennai property team saw an opportunity to improve wastewater processing and reduce freshwater use at the same time. As part of a required upgrade to the sewage treatment plant at the Haddows Road campus, they are creating a zero-discharge solution that will reuse treated water to meet the water needs of the cooling towers, landscaping and washrooms. Commissioning began in September 2018 and once fully operational, the plant is due to save approximately 100 kilolitres of water daily and up to $35,000 per year. 8 Standard Chartered Sustainability Summary 2018 Contributing to sustainable BEING A RESPONSIBLE Investing in Sustainability Overview economic growth COMPANY communities data Aspirations Target: We will Target date Progress People ¼¼ Increase gender representation: 30% women in senior roles ¼¼ Sept 2016 – Dec 2020 Ongoing Our people are our greatest 2018: 27.7% in senior roles asset, and our diversity drives our ¼¼ Roll-out a comprehensive ¼¼ Jan 2018 – Dec 2018 Achieved business success employee wellness programme across four key markets (UK, US, Singapore and Hong Kong) ¼¼ Roll-out a refreshed diversity ¼¼ Jan 2018 – Dec 2018 Achieved and inclusion strategy Bank-wide Environment ¼¼ Reduce annual energy use by 35% to 230 kWh/m2/year in ¼¼ Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 On track Reducing our own impact on the 2008 – 2018: 33% reduction our tropical climate locations environment will protect our planet (80% of portfolio) for the benefit of our communities ¼¼ Reduce annual energy use by ¼¼ Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 Achieved/Ongoing 31% to 275 kWh/m2/year in 2008 – 2018: 35% reduction our temperate climate locations (20% of portfolio) ¼¼ Reduce our annual water use ¼¼ Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 Ongoing by 72% to 0.5kL/m2/year 2008 – 2018: 57% reduction ¼¼ Reduce annual office paper ¼¼ Jan 2012 – Dec 2020 Ongoing use by 57% to 10kg/FTE/year 2012 – 2018: 24% reduction Conduct ¼¼ Effectively embed the conduct management framework ¼¼ Jan 2018 – Dec 2018 Achieved Good conduct and high ethical standards 99.6% of employees so that all staff are able to are essential in achieving fair outcomes reconfirmed commitment identify, mitigate and manage for our clients. to the Code of Conduct in conduct risk September 2018 Conduct identifed as new Risk Type in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework Financial crime ¼¼ All eligible bank staff to complete relevant ABC, AML ¼¼ Ongoing Ongoing compliance and sanctions training with 99.9% of employees completed ABC training Financial crime has serious social and less than 2% overdue economic consequences, harming 99.9% of employees individuals and communities completed AML training 99.9% of employees completed sanctions training ¼¼ Deliver at least 10 ¼¼ Jan 2018 – Dec 2018 Achieved correspondent banking 21 Correspondent Banking academies Academies delivered Aspirations progress key On track Not on track Achieved Not achieved 9 Contributing to sustainable Being a responsible INVESTING Investing in IN Sustainability OVERVIEW Overview economic growth company COMMUNITIES communities data Pillar 3 Investing in communities Objective We seek to promote economic and social development in our communities.

Essential elements To understand more about the social, cultural and economic barriers that prevent girls from reaching their full potential, for girls’ economic we co-authored a report with Dalberg Advisors, released on International Women’s Day in March 2018, that identified eight essential elements for girls’ economic empowerment. These include freedom of movement, freedom from violence empowerment and access to education, healthcare and contraception. For girls to overcome barriers, they need more training to become employable; more men, boys and older women to champion them; more goods and services made for them; and more role models and support networks, such as those provided by Goal, our girls’ empowerment programme. Through Goal, girls gain the confidence, knowledge and skills they need to be economic leaders in their families, communities and society. To support girls further, we offer work readiness as part of the Goal curriculum.
