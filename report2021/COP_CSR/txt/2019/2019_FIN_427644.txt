In 2018 we renewed the Fazer brand positioning and placed the consumer in a central role as part of this transformation. We co-created food innovations both internally and with partners and developed our High Performance Culture. 2018 was the first year of our new strategy period, and we began strategy implementation in all business areas and units. We amplified our consumer-centric approach to form a solid basis for brand and business development. Our renewed Fazer brand positioning, ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’, ensures that Fazer is meaningfully different in the eyes of the consumer also in the future. It is an ambitious promise that builds on our mission and vision, reflects our heritage and reaches out to the future. Fazer Group’s net sales were 1,618 M€ in 2018, showing a slight decrease from the previous year. Fazer Bakery reached net sales of 552 M€, Fazer Confectionery of 333 M€, Fazer Food Services of 593 M€, Fazer Lifestyle Foods of 122 M€ and Fazer Retail of 46 M€. We continued to develop our offering throughout the year and prepare our businesses for future international expansion. Through research and innovation, we created new foods and services that maintain and enhance well-being and support sustainable lifestyles. We created value for our customers, partners, owners, supply chain and society at large while observing sustainable practices in our operations. 3 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Year in brief Group President’s review A modern sustainable food company Fazer’s focus, in the coming years, will be on speeding up our transformation to become a modern sustainable food company with a joint direction. In 2018, we started important actions to implement our new strategy. Financially, our operating result fell behind previous year even if the net sales were at 2017 levels. Life today is fast-paced. People’s criteria for making choices have changed. We as a company are expected to understand what people want before they’ve even asked for it. For Fazer, it means that we shall become smarter, faster; to understand where consumer behaviour is evolving and to act upon it; to innovate across our categories, collaborating to uncover our potential in the market. Developing these capabilities will impact our way of working and our culture. Trends are heavily shaping the world of food. New proteins and plant-based substitutes for meat are increasing in popularity. The climate impact of food production is being actively discussed, and many are willing to reduce their meat consumption. Fazer Lifestyle Foods is directly targeting this sustainable, health-conscious lifestyle and it will have a significant role in our geographical expansion beyond the Nordics. Vegetables and oats are at the innovative core of sustainable snacking, and bakery products that enhance well-being as well as artisanal products continue to attract consumers. Flexible eating habits shape the offering of Fazer Food Services, too. In Fazer Confectionery, we have combined classics with innovations, resulting in successful tablet launches. The launch of the online Fazer Candy Store demonstrates on the other hand our enhanced attention to consumer-convenience. In Fazer Retail, we focus on strengthening our direct-to-consumer offering and the unique Fazer experience. In 2018, we began implementing our new strategy. We are heading towards our joint strategic goal backed by a strengthened consumer focus and a renewed Fazer brand positioning. We emphasize value creation through portfolio choices, continued operational excellence and structural improvements. We invest in the development and renewal of our products and business portfolio, based on deep consumer insight and research. We target growth within our selected categories and will reach new customers in Northern Europe and other selected markets with an offering based on strong brands in growing categories. Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ products, together with chocolate, will lead the way to international markets. We continue to concentrate on delivering our strategy, with an emphasis on future proofing for a digitalised world, our highperformance culture as well as our safety culture. We are committed to improving our performance with strategic initiatives in all our businesses and geographies. We have set the bar high and will focus on execution. We leverage deep customer insight 4 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Year in brief and close cooperation with the scientific community to create new, attractive products and solutions. We innovate through collaboration, creating added value for customers and partners alike. The investment in a new factory in Lahti, Finland, which will utilise state-of-the-art technology to produce xylitol from oat hulls – a side stream of the oat milling process – marks a further step on the way towards enhanced sustainability and circular economy through innovation. The works on the site in Lahti have already been started. With our renewed Fazer brand, we will ensure that Fazer will be meaningfully different in the eyes of the consumer also in the future. ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’ is unique and forward-looking; it is an ambitious promise that builds on our heritage and reaches out to the future, enabling Fazer’s ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. In addition to excellent products and services, there is a growing consumer need for brands to stand for a deeper purpose and to demonstrate values, attitudes and actions that do good for society. We want consumers to choose Fazer. Our renewed brand helps us better communicate who we are, what we offer and what we stand for. We have defined a new Sustainability Approach to take a stronger stand and to deliver concrete actions. It is aligned with Fazer’s mission, strategy and the renewed Fazer brand. The new Sustainability Approach consists of four Core goals: 1) 50% less emissions, 2) 50% less food waste, 3) 100% sustainably sourced, and 4) More plant-based. We know that how we grow, produce and consume food has a significant impact on the environment, on society and on our well-being. With food, we can make a difference. We are committed to the principles of the UN Global Compact and by working towards reaching our core goals by 2030 we contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals. To support Fazer’s transformation into a modern sustainable food company, Fazer’s research and innovation unit Fazer Lab invited everyone at Fazer to come up with ideas at the first ever Fazer Innovation Challenge in spring 2018. The challenge attracted 110 ideas and culminated with 24 innovator teams joining the final pitching event. The teams were working on a wide range of ideas, and the first outcome, an artisan bread baked with hemp, is already available for consumers in Finland. We value cooperation with external partners, aiming to increase our knowledge and innovate across categories. We believe in open and agile innovation and, during the year, we have collaborated on the development of renewable and recyclable packaging materials, among others. In 2018, the economies in many of Fazer’s key markets continued to develop favourably. The Finnish economy saw growth supported by private consumption and favourable development in employment as well as slow inflation. Also, the Swedish economy witnessed steady growth in 2018. The labour market continued to be tight, but wage growth was quite stable, and inflation remained at a normal level. On the other hand, the Russian economy continued to face the threat of sanctions and challenges caused by internal reforms, although their effects are buffered by strong macroeconomic indicators and a cautious monetary policy. The country’s unemployment rate remained low, while the risk of inflation increased. In all markets, competition is fierce and has further increased. Fazer is, however, well equipped to strengthen its positions on its home markets and to grow in Northern Europe and beyond. In Fazer Bakery, both the Finnish and the Baltic units showed strong development. The triumph of in-store bakeries in Finland continued with new bakeries being opened and new products added to the offering. In Russia, Fazer received a record number of awards for quality and innovation. Unfortunately, consumers’ weakening purchasing power had a negative effect on volumes and business performance in Russia. In Sweden, the performance issues continued, but towards the end of the year, improvements could be seen. In Fazer Confectionery, all commercial units delivered a good result. Fazer Confectionery promoted international growth by signing a deal with a distributor in China and by starting to build an organisation in the USA. The launch of the re-designed Fazer Yosa products marked the start of Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ stronger presence on store shelves across the Nordics. The creation of Fazer Retail opened new possibilities for cross-unit cooperation and stronger direct-toconsumer business opportunities. Fazer Food Services’ performance was on a good level, especially in Denmark and in Finland. New concepts and ideas, reflecting current trends and flexible eating habits, have been tested in Fazer Food Services, and at the end of the year, we celebrated the success of the Swedish and Finnish Fazer Culinary Teams which won double victory in the Culinary World Cup: Fazer Team Sweden was number 1 and Fazer Team Finland number 2. 5 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Year in brief The Fazer Experience visitor centre has been steadily growing in popularity. The centre drew over 200,000 visitors in 2018. Fazer Experience is a unique place where everybody can experience Fazer in their own way. It’s a destination that interests people, and many visitors keep returning. Every interaction promotes continuous development, dialogue and a better understanding of consumer needs. At Fazer, we aim high and dare to think big. We have grown stronger as a company and the market sees us in a new light – as being more progressive and forward-looking. This is the result of the work of all our great people. Together, we will develop the company further and continue its success. Finally, I’d like to thank all our partners and stakeholders for their engagement and support in 2018.

Made Real.’ is a unique and forward-looking promise that enables our ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. Our sustainability approach was revised to better reflect our current strategy. Fazer’s ambitious direction towards 2030 consists of four Core goals: 1) 50% less emissions, 2) 50% less food waste, 3) 100% sustainably sourced and 4) more plant-based. Fazer made a new five-year commitment to the Baltic Sea. In the new commitment we focus on circular economy, sustainable grain farming, implementation of our water stewardship plan and development of Fazer’s offering. In Fazer Bakery, the strong demand for health and well-being products, as well as the interest in artisanal bread continued. We continued to invest in our offering in new growth areas such as healthy products, developing novelties and driving the bread category further. We increased the number of in-store bakeries offering fresh artisanal bread to 64 in Finland. Fazer Cricket Bread received huge international attention and won several awards. Fazer Veggie bread and Hlebny Dom Hercules Mini won Innovative product of the year 2018 awards in Russia. Fazer Confectionery’s business performance was strong. Our market share in chocolate tablets increased and biscuit sales developed strongly in Finland. Fazer Candy Store was opened to serve consumers online, and cooperation with JD.com was started to explore opportunities in the Chinese market. In the USA, we have started to build our own organisation and have developed the first new products for international markets. The new MD for the Business Area, Nathalie Ahlström, started in September. In Fazer Food Services we set up an innovation ecosystem and research restaurant TestEat in cooperation with IBM and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland to study people’s diets and behavioural patterns in the lunch restaurant. Fazer Food & Co was launched in Denmark and Norway. In Denmark, we also launched our new vegetarian street food concept “Green Street”. Together with our client, we developed a ground-breaking Meal Watch concept for senior people in Sweden to help the elderly to receive the right food and nutrition based on their individual profile. Fazer Food Services’ Culinary Teams Sweden and Finland took a double victory at the Culinary World Cup in Luxembourg. In Fazer Lifestyle Foods, significant investments were made in organisational development and marketing activities to ensure future growth. The Fazer Yosa oat product family was expanded with eight products, and the brand was refreshed with, for example, new 8 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Year in brief packaging design. Fazer Mills launched the unique, patented LOFO™ enzyme-based solution that provides a low-FODMAP feature for wheat and rye baking. The new MD for the Business Area, Mats Liedholm, started in November. Fazer Retail was formed at the beginning of 2018, combining our Gateau bakery shops in Finland and Sweden and Fazer Cafés in Finland into one business unit. Fazer Café Kluuvikatu – the very first Fazer Café, opened in 1891 in Helsinki – was renovated and its offering refreshed with new products. The Fazer Innovation Challenge invited everyone at Fazer to join to create new, bold and creative ideas, many of which have been moved forward to further development and realization. More than 200,000 people visited the Fazer Experience Visitor Centre during 2018. We are very pleased to welcome new guests and returning visitors to the centre, which allows people to experience the Fazer brand. 9 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer This is Fazer Fazer is all about meaningful food experiences. Fazer is an international family-owned company offering bakery, confectionery, biscuit and grain products, plant-based meals, nondairy products, on-the-go food & drinks as well as food and café services. We operate in nine countries and export to around 40 countries. In 2018, Fazer Group had net sales of 1.6 billion euros and more than 15,000 employees. Our operations are guided by high quality, responsibility and respect for the planet and people. We aim to develop a culture where our employees perform, engage and develop together. It means taking initiative, looking further than completing our task, understanding the impact of our contribution and taking responsibility for the result. With our renewed Fazer brand, we will ensure that Fazer will be meaningfully different in the eyes of the consumer also in the future. ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’ is unique and forward-looking; it is an ambitious promise that builds on our heritage and reaches out to the future, enabling Fazer’s ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. 10 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Operating environment Our work with meaningful food experiences and delightful food moments takes place in a rapidly changing market landscape, with economic and social factors continuing to shape our operations. The world around us, the business environment and our lifestyles are changing at a rapid pace – setting new demands for companies across industries. The continuing trends of an aging and growing population, extended work life, urbanisation, technology and sustainability, among others, affect our operating environment. While the economies in our key markets continued to develop favourably, the competitive landscape has become tougher for all our businesses. Economic development: growth in all main markets The Finnish economy saw growth, supported by private consumption and favourable development in employment as well as slow inflation. Employment has improved significantly, but the growth rate is expected to slow down in the coming months due to uncertainties in the global economy and to a gap between the supply and demand of workforce. The Swedish economy witnessed steady growth in 2018. The labour market continued to be tight. Inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was at a normal level, setting modest cost pressures on the Swedish economy. The Swedish krona is likely to remain weak due to the expansionary monetary policy, uncertain housing markets and the effects of potential trade wars. The Russian economy continues to face the threat of sanctions and challenges of internal reforms, although their effects are buffered by strong macroeconomic indicators and a cautious monetary policy. The country’s unemployment rate remains low, while the risk of inflation has increased due to a number of factors. With the currency highly dependent on political factors, the outlook remains uncertain. Weakened currencies affect result All of Fazer’s main currencies have weakened against the euro in 2018. Weaker currencies affect Fazer Group’s figures directly, when local currencies are recalculated to euros. They may also adversely influence local profits through, for example, higher material or product costs. Pound sterling, the main currency for cocoa purchases, has remained relatively stable during 2018, but was clearly weaker at the end of 2018 than before the Brexit vote in 2016. This affects Fazer’s raw material costs favourably. 11 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Market development: Competition remains strong and demand for well-being offering continues The demand for health and well-being products continues to be strong and the shop-in-shop business is gaining ground in Finland. However, with record competition, our bakery business lost market share in Sweden and Russia. In Finland, domestic rye and oats have sufficed to fill the needs of Fazer Bakery despite the exceptionally challenging crop year. The deficit in wheat may have to be replaced in part by imports. Artisanal bread has maintained its popularity especially in Finland and Sweden. Bread consumption declined in value in value-added segments in Russia, although consumers moved from low-price segments to mid-price segments, increasing the market value in Moscow. The extraordinarily hot weather affected the consumption during the summer. Despite sales challenges set by the hot weather in the summer, Fazer Confectionery’s net sales in 2018 grew from the previous year. Fazer Confectionery’s market share in tablets increased in Finland, but heavy competition continues to set challenges. The market share in biscuits remained unchanged. The food service market saw positive contract sales in 2018, with some large contracts won. The retention of existing contracts was close to target level and some unprofitable contracts were exited. Actions to improve performance were carried out successfully to support profitability also in 2019. Fazer Lifestyle Foods is seeing increasing competition from private label companies in the smoothie and non-dairy categories. The profitability of Fazer cereal business is being challenged by increasing raw material prices. Fazer Mills suffered from high grain prices after the weak crop in 2017 and an even worse crop in 2018 due to the hot summer. Fazer Retail’s performance for the full year 2018 was affected by challenges with sales in the spring and summer while an improvement was visible later in the year, especially in Finland. The market situation in Stockholm continues to be particularly challenging. 12 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Joint strategic direction: Value through growth and portfolio development In 2018, we began to implement our new strategy. We aim to become a modern, sustainable food company in Northern Europe and beyond. With this strategic goal in mind, we have strengthened our focus on the consumer, and renewed the Fazer brand positioning. We target growth, value creation through portfolio choices, continued operational excellence and structural improvements. We have begun our transformation into a modern sustainable food company with joint strategic direction. During the 2018–2022 strategy period, we intend to grow our net sales on average by 6–8 per cent annually. We target a Group EBITDA margin of at least 12 per cent. In relation to these targets, 2018 was a challenging year. We are nevertheless committed to improving our performance with strategic initiatives in all businesses and geographies. We have set the bar high and will focus on execution. Development of our business and product portfolios is one of the cornerstones of our strategy. We leverage deep customer insight and close cooperation with the scientific community to create new, attractive products and solutions. In addition to the development and innovation in the businesses, we use Fazer Lab to build new growth engines for Fazer and accelerate transformative business development across the Group. We innovate through collaboration, creating added value for customers and partners alike. Renewed brand supports strategic expansion With our renewed Fazer brand, we will ensure that Fazer will be meaningfully different in the eyes of the consumer also in the future. ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’ is unique and forward-looking; it is an ambitious promise that builds on our heritage and reaches out to the future, enabling Fazer’s ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. In addition to excellent products and services, there is a growing customer need for brands to stand for a deeper purpose and to demonstrate values, attitudes and actions that do good for the society. We want consumers to choose Fazer. Our renewed brand helps us better communicate who we are, what we offer and what we stand for. In 2018, we introduced new products across categories; functional Froosh smoothies and Fazer Alku cereals, new Fazer Yosa oat products for snacking, drinking and cooking, as well as crispy, fibre-rich Fazer Snacks, to name a few. We also developed products and services to be introduced in 2019 and beyond. 13 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Consumer insight guides portfolio development In our strategy, we place the consumer first. By engaging with consumers in all contact points – online and in our cafés, bakery shops and restaurants – we learn what people value. Understanding their needs more thoroughly allows us to deliver new products, services and experiences faster. We experiment fearlessly to surprise consumers with new flavours and services. Having a meaningful role in people’s lives is reflected as added value in our customer relationships. The health and well-being trend continues strong, and customers’ interest towards sustainability continues to grow. According to a food trend survey commissioned by Fazer in 2018, as many as 41% of Finns are interested in favouring vegetable proteins to protect the environment and 54% would eat food tailored to their health condition. Fazer Lifestyle Foods, a business area established in 2017, serves conscious customers looking to enhance their quality of life through food. The business area focuses in non-dairy, plant-based meals and breakfasts and sustainably produced foods. Fazer Lifestyle Foods has been recognised as a strong growth area, and its organic growth will be supported with potential acquisitions. In Fazer Food Services, we introduced Fazer Brainhow to increase awareness about brain-friendly foods – a topic we continue to research. In the beginning of 2018, we formed the Fazer Retail business unit to strengthen our direct retail offering to consumers. Fazer Retail caters to customers in cafés and bakery shops, combining its high-quality artisan products with an exceptional customer experience. Strategic recruitment actions have been carried out during the year to ensure the organisation is equipped for future growth. Our ambition is to grow beyond our main markets in the Nordics, Baltics and Russia. We will reach new customers in Northern Europe and other selected markets with an offering based on strong brands in growing categories. The lifestyle category, together with chocolate, will lead the way to international markets. Smarter, faster, digital Fazer We have created a digital vision and roadmap for the Group. Fazer Digital means that we will become smarter and faster. We will increase our understanding of how consumer behaviour is evolving and innovate across our categories. Our digital roadmap for 2019-2020 will focus on the following themes: Direct to consumer – We will build direct relationships and insight for creating meaningful offerings and experiences, supporting brand loyalty. Consumer understanding, offerings and insight drive Fazer’s position as a preferred trade partner and enable new business models and opportunities. Digital commerce – We will ensure capabilities to serve customers in various channels. We will create new business models, revenue streams and go-to-market strategies as well as develop our existing models and relationships. Connect the operations – We will use data and analytics to make the supply chain transparent and to drive efficiency. We will enable new delivery and fulfilment models by increasing agility and responsiveness through connected processes, shared information and demand analytics. Build data capabilities – We will harness data from processes, markets and transactions to create insight and to transform operations. We will create an environment for learning and sharing. Fazer values are at the heart of our operations Our values guide us in everything we do, and they form a core around which strategy, mission and vision were built. These values form the basis for our everyday interactions and steer us towards the future. • Customer Focus The needs, tastes and preferences of our customers guide us in product development and service design as well as in sustainability work and stakeholder cooperation. Meaningful food experiences can only be created by thoroughly understanding customers’ expectations and striving to exceed them every day. 14 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer • Quality Excellence We demand the highest quality from ourselves across all our operations and functions – from products and services to logistics, financial management and leadership. We create superior experiences throughout our offering, efficiently and sustainably. • Team Spirit Providing joy and well-being through food is a joint effort. We work together, as one Fazer, one team, supporting and respecting each other. We share the same goals and take responsibility for our performance. Together, we take pride in what we do. Agile High Performance Culture driven by entrepreneurial spirit Staying competitive requires fast moves. We favour action to lengthy planning processes. We engage others early, collaborating iteratively to integrate points of view along the way. This requires trust and openness to learn from each other. It is our shared task to build a working culture, where we are comfortable to share without fear of judgement before being ready. Our behaviours enable the development of a truly entrepreneurial culture: we engage, we perform and we develop. We aim to develop a high performance culture in which we act more like entrepreneurs than employees. It means looking further than completing our task, understanding the impact of our contribution, adapting quickly to changes in the environment and taking responsibility for the result. We all have an important role in transforming Fazer. 15 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Mission and vision In a changing and hectic world, people look for meaning and delight tailored to their tastes. Fazer is transforming along with the world to create sustainable growth and serving new desires with the same passion that has driven us to serve the needs of past generations. With everything increasingly available immediately and in real time, the wish for real and authentic experiences and delightful moments grows. At the same time, technological development has allowed for new, richer customer experiences to emerge. Sustainability has made its way into consumer lifestyles and even indulging through food. People care about themselves and the planet, and consumers expect responsible and transparent solutions that fulfil their needs and exceed their expectations. The passion with which we have served previous generations lives on today and in the future. Like all great brands, we are evolving along with new expectations in order to provide products and services that exist to delight, excite and stimulate people every day. The future of our success builds on being authentic, desirable and progressive.

Made Real. Our ambition is to transform into a modern sustainable food company with a joint direction 18 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer Fazer renews its positioning – we make Northern Magic Real In 2018, we worked to crystallise the Fazer brand and found our essence: Fazer is Northern Magic. Made Real. This is a unique, forward-looking and ambitious promise, building on Fazer’s current and aspired home market presence. It is aligned with Fazer’s future ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’ enables the Fazer brand to enter new markets and supports us in reaching our strategic goals. With our renewed Fazer brand, we will ensure that Fazer is meaningfully different in the eyes of the consumer also in the future. ‘Northern Magic. Made Real.’ is an ambitious promise that builds on our heritage and reaches out to the future, enabling Fazer’s ambition of strong expansion in Northern Europe and beyond. In addition to excellent products and services, there is a growing consumer need for brands to stand for a deeper purpose and to demonstrate values, attitudes and actions that do good for the society. We want consumers to choose Fazer. Our renewed brand helps us better communicate who we are, what we offer and what we stand for. With our new positioning, we stand behind three themes: Northern Liberty, True Relationships and Fearless Creativity. The Fazer brand architecture is a hybrid. It is a mix of Fazer branded, Fazer identity brands, Fazer identity endorsed brands and independent brands. We combine tradition with innovation, creating meaningful brand experiences. Our brands are developed in line with our strategy, guided by customer engagement, strong consumer insight and research. They help us connect with consumers and build a relationship based on trust and authenticity. Global trends and changing lifestyles Global trends of aging and extended work-life, urbanisation, dialogue of cultures, technology, digitalisation and sustainability strongly impact the food business, as do politics and regulation. At the same time, the hectic, urban lifestyle sets new standards for consumers’ expectations towards brands, products and services. We engage with modern-day, conscious consumers who seek food experiences that enrich their lives. We share their concern for the health and well-being of people and the planet. We set the consumer first. The key insight for the development of the Fazer brand states how our strategy impacts people engaging with us, every day. We have therefore delved deep into the thoughts and ideas that consumers have on joy and well-being – in order to create these positive impacts, we need to thoroughly understand them. 19 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 This is Fazer We continue innovating and building strong brands In 2018, we have launched new taste experiences in familiar, highly appreciated brands – Karl Fazer Tyrkisk Peber chocolate tablet, Fazer Alku cereals and Jaffa Pihlaja biscuits to name a few. We introduced the pink Fazer Pure Ruby chocolate, based on the special ruby cocoa beans and a unique manufacturing method. Our ambition is to build a strong Fazer brand recognised across our markets and our new brand philosophy supports strategy execution. A strong brand opens doors internationally and allows us to focus our efforts. 20 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Our businesses Fazer’s products and services, created with the greatest passion and care, exist to delight, excite and stimulate people. We have four business areas and one business unit that together form a comprehensive offering. Bringing our strategy, mission, vision and brands to life, the different businesses ensure that people can experience meaningful moments with all Fazer’s products and services. ​ e are present throughout people’s lives with our products and services and across the different Fazer touchpoints: breads, W pastries and cakes from Fazer Bakery; chocolates, sweets and biscuits from Fazer Confectionery; nutritious lunches from Fazer Food Services; wholesome snacks, smoothies and breakfast foods from Fazer Lifestyle Foods; freshly baked bread, special coffees and sweet and savoury pastries, offered directly to consumers from our cafés and bakery shops in Fazer Retail. 21 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Fazer Bakery: Sustainability and innovation The demand for products that enhance health and well-being continues to grow in the bakery business. People seek to balance healthiness with treats and flexible eating habits, and we are responding to these trends. New and innovative solutions are at the core of sustainable snacking, with ingredients such as vegetables, oats and insects replacing traditional raw materials in the bakery business’ end products. The artisanal trend continues to grow. We have continued to invest in our offering in new growth areas such as healthy products, developing novelties and driving the bread category further. We have increased our focus on innovation and sustainability in the bakery business. Strengthening our shop-in-shop business has driven the development. Performance in 2018 2018 was a challenging year for Fazer Bakery in Sweden and Russia. Fazer Bakery grew its market share in the Finland and Baltics, with dark portion bread and artisanal bread, in particular, driving growth in the Finnish market. The shop-in-shop business also continued to grow in Finland. We launched a number of healthy novelties and snacking products. In Russia, Fazer Veggie bread and Hlebny Dom Hercules Mini won the Innovative product of the year 2018 awards. Our popular Fazer Sirkkaleipä cricket bread, introduced in 2017, won the Bronze Lion in the Sustainable Development Goals section of the Cannes Lions competition, under the category Responsible Consumption and Production, along with several other prizes in Finland. We introduced two hemp breads, originating from Fazer’s internal innovation competition, in our in-store bakeries in Finland. Fazer’s sustainability approach is being applied to the bakery business. We continued stakeholder dialogue on the implementation of our grain vision and sustainable farming principles in Finland and Sweden. Sustainability was high on the agenda also for food waste where we introduced, for example, in in-store bakeries the Hävikkitalkoot (joint food waste effort) concept, with people being able to buy products made the previous day for an affordable price. The poor crops resulted in an increase in raw material prices, especially during the second half of the year. 22 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses NET SALES – FAZER BAKERY, M€ 800 700 647 590 574 574 583 600 552 500 400 300 200 100 0 2014 2015 2016 2016 2017 2018 FAS IFRS Going forward We will continue to strengthen our local presence and increase operational efficiency in all our operations. Supporting our growth in artisanal business, we will expand our in-store bakery network and will also pilot the concept outside Finland. In order to drive our consumer-centric experience, we will invest in an innovation culture to support growth in new areas, aiming to also become a category leader in point of sale excellence. We will also increase agility within the Fazer Bakery business, with a focus on, for example, the go-to-market process and the utilisation of innovations across different countries. 23 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Fazer Confectionery: Combining classics with new innovations Fazer’s chocolates, sweets and biscuits continue to exceed expectations and meet the needs of consumers. Fazer retains its position as Finland’s leading confectionery company. People want to enjoy life and delightful moments. With our confectionery offering, we at Fazer want to enable this indulgence. Consumers are making increasingly conscious choices when it comes to food, and this is reflected in our current and future product portfolio. The cocoa we use is 100% sustainably sourced, and we have continued to future-proof our sweets by favouring plant-based ingredients in recipes. We are also optimising our packages and improving their recyclability. Amidst tightening competition, we want to be the confectionery brand of choice in all our markets. Performance in 2018 Fazer is the market leader in confectionery in Finland, with the market share increasing. Fazer Confectionery’s net sales grew in 2018 from the previous year, despite challenges in sales during the summer due to the extremely hot weather. Fazer chocolate tablets saw healthy growth. We have successfully used our strong brands to create appealing novelties. We had three successful co-branded Karl Fazer Milk Chocolate launches during 2018: Domino, Tyrkisk Peber and Dumle. These were well received by our customers. In November 2018, Fazer launched a special limited edition of the Fazer Ruby Pure chocolate, based on the rare ruby cocoa beans. Fazer Pure Ruby was sold out in less than a week. The Tutti Frutti recipe change towards vegan and more natural ingredients generated increased sales, especially in Sweden, with the Tutti Frutti Original up by 36.5%. Biscuit sales have grown significantly, supported by strong sales in Domino, Jaffa Pihlaja and Jaffa Green Jellies. The Jaffa brand has gained over 500,000 new purchasing households during the rolling year. To respond to high demand for the beloved Fazer brands, we opened our own e-commerce channel Fazer Candy Store. The web store contains all confectionery products as well as a Fazer Novelty Box that includes a selection of novelties. Currently, the web store ships to EU countries, and geographical expansion is being planned. 24 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses We have continued to develop our partner network in China and signed a deal with a distributor. In the USA, we have started to build our own organisation and we have developed the first new products for international markets. Fazer Nordi is a chocolate concept and brand created to meet the better-for-you chocolate trend in the USA.

Our key growth drivers are attractive launches supported by marketing investments. Seasonality will also be highlighted more heavily to drive business growth. We will develop our sweets portfolio to meet the needs of modern consumers, with well-being and fun as key elements. Fazer will implement organic growth plans for Sweden and Norway with a focus on chocolate ​as the primary game changer. In Denmark, we established our own sales organisation in January 2019. Beyond the Nordics, we will grow in new markets, spearheaded by our chocolate portfolio. We will continue the execution of our portfolio strategy, aiming for fewer but bigger innovations to grow ​our strategic brands. To facilitate growth, we will focus on operational excellence and cost management through improved sales and operational planning. Growth will also be supported by the continuous improvement of supply chain operations. 25 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Fazer Food Services: Creating the future of food Food is more than just fuel. What and how we eat impacts how we feel. It affects our productivity and even our cognitive capabilities. Fazer Food Services creates modern food experiences that nourish, delight and energise people. Trends are heavily shaping the world of food. New proteins, such as lupins, and plant-based substitutes for meat are increasing in popularity. The climate impacts of food production are actively discussed in traditional as well as social media. Today’s consumers are interested in maintaining and improving their health through dietary choices, but they also want their food to be sustainably produced. At the same time, the eating experience has grown in significance. Great taste is no longer enough – food has to satisfy all senses. Guests come to Fazer Food Services’ restaurants for visually attractive, fragrant food served in an inspiring environment. Performance in 2018 Net contract sales were strong especially at the end of the year, and some large new contracts were won. Retention of existing contracts improved. Reported net sales for the full year were slightly below and with comparable currency rates at the previous year’s level. Performance improvement actions were initiated in 2018 and they will continue further into 2019 strengthening the competitiveness of the business. Positive impacts were already seen at the end of 2018, with raw material management succeeding particularly well. We launched a new research and pilot restaurant, TestEat, in cooperation with IBM and VTT Research Centre of Finland. The restaurant, located on IBM’s premises in Helsinki but open to all, includes modern research technology that collects data in both the kitchen and the lunch room. The goal of the cooperation is to study how and what people eat and how they behave in the lunch restaurant. The research paves the way for the crEATe open innovation ecosystem, which was be launched by the three parties in early 2019. The first Tastory restaurant in Finland was opened in Espoo. The restaurant specialises in providing delicious and green lunches as well as café and deli products in a welcoming and attractive environment. 26 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses We extended our partnerships with two of our largest clients in Sweden Volvo and SEB. As part of the cooperation, we have introduced our new service brand Fazer Food & Co to renew our offering. Fazer Food & Co was also launched in Denmark and Norway. In Denmark, we launched our new vegetarian street food concept “Green Street” – a culinary journey to the green world cuisine. This concept takes green nudging to the next level. Together with our client Ersta Diakoni, we developed a ground-breaking meal concept for senior people in Sweden. The purpose of this Meal Watch concept is to help the elderly to receive the right food and nutrition based on their individual profile. Fazer Culinary Teams from Finland and Sweden participated in the Culinary World Cup with the overall theme “Against food waste”. The Swedish team won the competition, successfully defending its title from the last World Cup, with the Finnish team taking the second place and securing a double victory for Fazer. We participated in the YouTuber event Tubecon in Helsinki by organising a food court with activities that challenged participants to reflect on their eating habits.

In portfolio management, retention remains a key priority. We will complete and fully leverage our account management programme to reduce churn with a stronger focus on profitability. We will work to optimise revenue in each unit more systematically to drive net sales on a unit level. We will also execute local programmes in raw material management and ​add personnel planning initiatives to sustain restaurant margins. We aim to grow in each of our operating countries and across sectors, with the public sector, business parks and universities as focus areas. We will continue to feel the pulse of the consumers and anticipate their evolving needs. Our More Greens campaigns and approach will be even more relevant in the future as more people embrace a plant-based diet. The trend of on-the-go eating continues, and we are developing our offering to provide food flexibly throughout the day. 27 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Fazer Lifestyle Foods: Good for the body, mind and planet At its best, food delights, nourishes and supports our health, all at the same time. Plant-based foods are quickly gaining market share as customers look for tastes that are good for the body, the mind and the environment. Fazer Lifestyle Foods answers these needs. Our Food Trends of the Future study, conducted in summer 2018, shows that the health trend still continues strong in the Nordic countries. People are interested in plant-based foods, new proteins and diets tailored to their health needs. Many are willing to reduce meat consumption to mitigate climate impacts. Locally produced, sustainable ingredients are welcome on the lunch menu. Fazer Lifestyle Foods combines foods that enhance well-being with products for those who seek to reduce the environmental strain of global food production. Its offering includes fruity Froosh smoothies, Fazer Yosa oat products and non-dairy drinks as well as Frebaco and Fazer Alku oat-based breakfast foods, and oat derivatives for the food, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries. The investment in a new factory in Lahti, Finland, which will utilise state-of-the-art technology to produce xylitol from oat hulls – a side stream of the oat milling process – marks a further step on the way towards enhanced sustainability and circular economy through innovation. The works on the site in Lahti have already been started. Performance in 2018 Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ net sales, supported by the acquisitions completed in 2017, increased clearly from the previous year. Competition is tightening in the smoothie and non-dairy markets, with both branded and large private label competitors vying for market share. In the cereals business, higher raw material costs led to price increases in Finland during the last few months of the year. Significant investments were made in Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ organisational development and marketing activities to ensure future growth. Several new products were launched during the year under existing brands. The Froosh smoothie range was complemented with functional smoothies produced solely from plant-based ingredients: Froosh plus energy, Froosh plus protein and Froosh plus natural herbs. Cereals and organic porridges were launched under the Fazer Alku breakfast food brand. 28 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses The Fazer Yosa oat product family was expanded with eight products, and the brand was refreshed with, for example, new packaging design. The well-established brand, acquired by Fazer in 2017, was the first of its category in Finland. Oat-based products have sparked global interest, and we want to stay at the forefront in developing this category. Nordic oats are highly regarded around the world, and Fazer Yosa products are well positioned in the tightening competition. New products and innovations were developed also to be introduced in 2019 and beyond.

Fazer Lifestyle Foods is a strong growth area for us and will have a significant role in our geographical expansion beyond the Nordics. We aim to complement organic development with acquisitions. We will build an innovative, consumer insight driven offering in the categories of non-dairy, plant-based meals, cereals and fruits. Customers will be able to choose their favourites from a wide selection including “throughout-the-day” food products and premium on-the-go food and beverages. We will create a world-class branded offering representing outstanding taste and creativity. Implementation and finetuning of the growth strategy will continue in the business area, with the development of plant-based meals and marketing strategy as important focus points. The strong concept and brands, together with organisational efficiency and investments in sales and marketing, support us in reaching our ambitious targets. 29 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses Fazer Retail: Premium quality meets superb service experience Fazer Retail was formed at the start of 2018, combining our Gateau bakery shops and Fazer Cafés into one business unit. With Fazer Retail, we will strengthen and develop our direct-to-consumers offering and experience, reflecting the renewed Fazer brand positioning. There is growing demand for great café experiences and artisanal bakery products. Fazer Retail combines artisanal bakery products and high-quality delicacies with first-class experience. In Fazer Cafés, excellent taste is complemented by scents, sounds and stylish design to create a comprehensively enjoyable experience. Gateau’s fresh breads have been embraced by customers in Finland and Sweden looking for everyday luxury. Performance in 2018 The competitive situation in the bakery shop and café business was increasingly challenging, with both newcomers and established players increasing their market presence. The grocery channel is gaining ground in the unpackaged bread category, impacting bakery shop sales of artisanal bread. Following a somewhat challenging spring and summer, performance took a positive turn in Finland during the last three months of the year. We have focused on building the organisation for future growth and recruited new talent to expand our retail expertise. Two new Gateau stores were opened in Helsinki, Finland: one in the city centre and one in the newly built REDI shopping centre. In Sweden, three unprofitable Gateau stores were closed. A new Fazer Café, with an updated concept, opened its doors in Helsinki in November, and the unprofitable café in Vaasa was closed at the end of the year. Fazer Café Kluuvikatu – the very first Fazer Café, opened in 1891 in Helsinki – was renovated and its offering refreshed with new products. The flagship café’s renovation was carried out with respect to the historical milieu of the current building, dating back to 1930, and the Finnish National Board of Antiquities was consulted about all changes. 30 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Our businesses During 2018, sales to e-commerce B2B customers doubled in Sweden and are expected to continue growing. In Finland, a new cooperation with S-Group was initiated around sales of Gateau artisanal bakery products in one of S-Group’s chains.

We will focus our efforts on organic growth in the Nordics. We will maintain our strong focus on customer experience and develop our service culture further. At the same time, we will seek and implement improvements in operational efficiency and streamline our processes to ensure profitable growth. 31 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Food with a purpose – For people, planet and business In 2018, we introduced a new sustainability approach. Sustainability is integrated into our strategy and our new approach will support us in implementing our mission, Food with a purpose, and our vision, We spark joy and well-being through meaningful food experiences. Our high regard for the social and physical environment in which we operate is reflected in this new approach. We want to actively participate in sustainability dialogue, take a stand and create solutions that respond to the global challenges of our time. The Core goals by 2030 driving our sustainability work are: We approach sustainability through three areas: For People, For Planet and For Business. We want to do business in a sustainable way throughout the value chain and respond to consumers’ expectations of responsibly produced goods and services. We will continue to invest in collaboration with stakeholders to find new sustainable solutions. 32 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Sustainability highlights 2018 In 2018, we revised and updated our sustainability approach. Fazer’s ambitious direction towards 2030 consists of four Core goals that support reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals through food. The Core goals are: 1) 50% less emissions, 2) 50% less food waste, 3) 100% sustainably sourced and 4) more plant-based. Our reputation remained on a good level in all main markets, with especially high marks in Russia and Finland. Fazer was ranked as the 3rd most sustainable brand in Finland in the Sustainable Brand Index 2018 and the 4th most reputable company in Finland in T-Media’s Reputation & Trust study 2018. Fazer’s 125 Opportunities for Working Life initiative was awarded as the Recruitment Activity of the Year in Finland Our lost time accident frequency dropped by 17% from 2017 and by 46% from 2013. Fazer Lab organised an internal Fazer Innovation Challenge, in which employee teams created and developed ideas for new products and services. One innovation, artisanal hemp bread, is already on the market. We continued our commitments concerning responsible sourcing of cocoa, grain, soy, palm oil and fish. 100% of our cocoa was sustainably sourced. We started a new farmer programme under the Fazer for Better Cocoa Programme in Ivory Coast. We became the first food industry company to make a Finnish water stewardship commitment. Fazer made a new five-year commitment to the Baltic Sea Action Group. The focus areas of the new commitment are circular economy, sustainable grain farming, a water stewardship plan and the development of Fazer’s offering. Our energy usage per produced tonne increased slightly to 0.86 MWh/tonne from 0.85 MWh/tonne in 2017. This was mainly due to fewer production tonnes as well as increased cooling and heating needs due to changing weather conditions. The share of the renewable electricity was 88%. Our total waste amount decreased compared to the previous year, showing positive development, but more efforts towards waste reduction are needed. The recycling percentage decreased from 83% to 76%, and more waste was directed to energy recovery. 97% of the waste was recycled or used for energy production in 2018. 33 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Fazer Food Services continued food waste reduction campaigns in restaurants. We met the reduction targets in Norway and Denmark and saw good progress in Sweden while in Finland we still need to intensify our actions. Through optimised and more sustainable packaging, we succeeded in reducing the use of plastic. We created Fazer Group’s approach to sustainable packaging and committed to stop using plastics in disposables by 2020. We further developed our Grain Vision guidance. We shared knowledge of the vision and initiated a project with pilot farms to measure its impact. All our businesses increased their offering of plant-based foods and developed new plant-based products. Fazer, Nokia and Nightingale Health carried out a research project within the Fazer Brainhow® programme on new tools for people to monitor and control their health. The research focused on understanding the effect of a brain-friendly diet on work productivity, cognitive performance and quality of life. 34 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Our updated sustainability approach: Core goals guide our way In 2018, we revised and updated our sustainability approach to better support our transformation into a modern sustainable food company with a joint direction. Sustainability is integrated in the Group strategy and our new sustainability approach is strongly aligned with the strategy and the renewed brand positioning. Together with them, it will help us to reach higher than ever. We chose four Core goals to crystallise our ambitious direction towards 2030. These goals were chosen because of their global impact, but also because they encourage others to join the work to create a more sustainable future. Goal 1: 50% less emissions Climate change is a challenge faced by everyone on the planet. The food system and its emissions are a factor in climate change, and by taking action to reduce the impacts of food production, we can make a difference. Climate change also has a direct impact on the availability, accessibility and affordability of our raw materials, and by doing our best to mitigate it, we are also futureproofing our business. In addition to climate emissions, the global food system causes also other emissions in water and on land, which we need to reduce as well. Goal 2: 50% less food waste Approximately one third of the global food production is lost or wasted annually, creating major negative impacts on the climate, water, land and biodiversity. Reducing food waste is one of the key actions to minimise negative environmental impacts of food and, at the same time, drive value for business through lower costs. Goal 3: 100% sustainably sourced Our impacts on people, societies and livelihood are not only limited to our own actions; raw material production, logistics and sourcing are equally involved. Therefore, we must ensure sustainability throughout the value chain from farmer to consumer. This we can do with clear basic requirements for all suppliers and extra attention to selected value chains such as cocoa, palm oil, grain and soy. 35 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Goal 4: More plant-based Our strategy states that we want to support consumers’ healthy and sustainable lifestyles. There is strong scientific evidence that fibre-rich plant-based foods contribute to a decreased risk of many diseases. Plant-based foods have a significantly smaller climate impact than meat and dairy. We develop our offering to reflect the favourable impacts of plant-based foods on both people and the planet. Wheel of Essentials and SDGs The four Core goals are supplemented with the Wheel of Essentials – an overview of essential sustainability topics addressed by Fazer. These topics are strongly interconnected but can be divided into three groups: For People, For Planet and For Business. We have defined an action plan that includes key actions, targets and KPIs. We have also defined the ways in which our work with these topics contributes to the realisation of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are strongly committed to supporting the implementation of the SDGs and encourage active stakeholder dialogue on them. We see food as a solution and know that the food industry has a significant impact on reaching the goals. 36 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Managing sustainability In order to efficiently manage our sustainability work, we have defined the roles and responsibilities of the sustainability team, network and leadership forum. The highest authority in sustainability matters lies with our Board of Directors and Group Management Team. Our sustainability work is guided by our Corporate Responsibility Policy, Human Rights Policy, QEHS Policy, governance practice, operating principles and ethical principles, which are based on the ten international principles of the UN Global Compact. Fazer Group signed the UN Global Compact initiative in 2012. Board of Directors Sustainability Leadership Sustainability Network Forum Approves ethical principles Ensures sustainability alignment Ensures alignment within the within Fazer Group Group Management Team Group; defines Group-level strategies, policies, guidelines, Ensures the effective use of Approves policies and objectives targets and positions resources Group President: ultimate responsibility Assesses, monitors and Shares knowledge, know-how Group’s EVP, Communications and Branding: develops sustainability topics and market views in different responsible for sustainability within the Group countries and businesses Ensures the agreed actions are Head of function implemented Approves instructions Escalates and prepares issues for the right decision forums Business areas and business units Implement sustainability programme and strategic outlines, and set targets and objectives Set sustainability focus areas Follow instructions, practices and operating models Sustainability team Develops sustainability approach and supports its implementation 37 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability Stakeholder engagement In order to develop our operations and offering, we maintain a continuous dialogue with all our stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees and other actors in the value chain as well as the research community, NGOs, local communities, decision-makers and authorities. We earn their trust through openness and transparency. Their insight helps us to anticipate changes in consumption patterns and the regulatory environment. We reciprocate by actively sharing information and supporting, for instance, research initiatives on health and nutrition as well as other sustainability topics. We partner with various organisations in the area of sustainability. These organisations include the Baltic Sea Action Group, WWF Finland, Climate Leadership Coalition, EAT, Hållbar Livsmedelkedja, SOS Children Villages, the Lake Vesijärvi Foundation, Helsinki Zoo (Korkeasaari) and universities. We have identified our most important stakeholder groups and outlined several engagement methods. Key stakeholders Key channels of dialogue How we respond to stakeholder expectations Consumers Daily encounters, customer service channels, Through immediate connections both online surveys, websites and social media, packaging, and in our cafés, bakery shops and restaurants visits we learn what people value. We turn these consumer insights into new products and services. Consumers need to be able to trust the quality and safety of our products and services.

By promoting a plant-based diet, we want to have a positive effect on people’s health while reducing the environmental impact. We also want to create a safe and healthy working environment for our employees and to give opportunities for development. Our Core goal related to people is increasing our plant-based offering. Fazer looks to respond to the consumers’ increasing need for more healthy and sustainable lifestyles. There is a growing market opportunity for plant-based products. Eating more vegetables and less meat is moving from early adopters to mass market, and we want to be at the core of this trend. Other essential Fazer people-related themes include health and nutrition, stakeholder dialogue, human rights, employee health and safety, diversity and inclusion, quality and food safety and responsible marketing. We want to promote employee health and wellbeing. We follow UN’s guiding principles on businesses and human rights and related processes. Our focus has been in carrying out human rights impact assessments for our different businesses based on these principles. Diversity is also a key enabler for us in our transformation into a modern sustainable food company. We want to provide a culture of diversity and inclusiveness where all employees can experience an equal working community with a motivating, respectful and safe work environment. Work in 2018 The health trend has continued strong, and in order to respond to people’s interest towards enhancing their well-being, we introduced several new products and campaigns. Fazer Brainhow, the research programme studying cognitive abilities through food, proceeded well, and more products will carry the Brainhow claim in 2019. In the beginning of 2018, Fazer Food Services Finland organised a Fazer Brainhow restaurant campaign. Fazer, Nokia and Nightingale Health carried out a research project on new tools for people to monitor and control their health, with Fazer providing the “brainfood” meals for study participants. All Fazer businesses have focused on increasing the offering of plant-based foods: Fazer Lifestyle Foods expanded the Fazer Yosa product range with eight new products; Fazer Bakery launched a product type for healthier snacking; Fazer Confectionery introduced a vegan chocolate, and Fazer Food Services continued recipe development towards vegetarian and vegan options and arranged employee trainings to promote cooking with more greens. Share of vegetables of Fazer Food Services’ purchases was 37,7% in 2018. We also collaborated with universities and research networks, startups and NGOs. In our human rights impact assessments, we have identified potential negative impacts on our operations, along with mitigation actions and grievance activities. This work continues. We have continued to manage and improve quality, occupational health and safety and environmental (QEHS) responsibility both via internal programmes and through third-party certifications for our management systems. 40 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability EMPLOYEES BY AGE, % EMPLOYEES BY GENDER 100 Women 60% 90 Men 40% 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 FI SE RU DK NO EE LV LT Total Under 20 30–39 yrs 50–59 yrs 20–29 yrs 40–49 yrs 60 yrs or over SAFETY OBSERVATIONS FREQUENCY OF OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS (LTAF) Number of accidents per one million working hours 15000 13,5605) 20 12,1544) 18 12000 16 150 14 125 121 9000 113 7,305 2) 7,698 3) 12 9.4 10 6000 5,285 1) 8 6 3000 4 2 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 1) Figure includes Fazer Confectioner y and Fazer Baker y 2) Figure includes Fazer Confectioner y, Fazer Baker y and Fazer Food Ser vices Finland 3) Figure includes Fazer Confectioner y, Fazer Baker y, Fazer Food Ser vices Finland, Fazer Mills Finland and Fazer Cafés 4) Figure includes Fazer Confectioner y, Fazer Baker y, Fazer Food Ser vices Finland, Fazer Mills Finland and Fazer Cafés 5) Figure includes Fazer Confectioner y, Fazer Baker y, Fazer Food Ser vices, Fazer Lifestyle Foods and Fazer Retail During 2018, we had no product recalls regarding food safety. Fazer Food Services’ food safety self-monitoring was digitalised and all processes refined across the Nordics. We accomplished to certify all our internal production sites against the Global Food Safety System (FSSC 22000). We evaluated food fraud risks of raw materials in all industrial businesses and started mitigation actions on a corporate level. Our lost time accident frequency dropped by 17% from 2017 and 46% from 2013. The year 2018 saw significant efforts put on safety communications across the company. New videos, e-learnings and other materials were produced to raise awareness and competence on the subject.

In 2018, we put focus on growing internal entrepreneurship and agility. As an example, Fazer Innovation Challenge was organised in spring 2018 offering everyone at Fazer a chance to take a great idea forward, learn new skills and work with colleagues from across the company. In 2017, we introduced anti-harassment guidelines. The year 2018 saw continuation of this work and the introduction of a cross-functional diversity team and Fazer Diversity Officer. We focused on building awareness of diversity and inclusion. Diversity guidelines were included in the recruitment instructions. Going forward During the coming years, we will continue to implement our HR vision 2022. We will develop capabilities in human resource information systems (HRIS) and analytics. We will also develop role exchange and job rotation.We aim to develop a culture where our employees perform, engage and develop together. It means taking initiative, looking further than completing our task, understanding the impact of our contribution and taking responsibility for the result. We invest in strengthening our group-level leadership capabilities and growing internal entrepreneurship and agility. Fazer Lead leadership programme pilot will start in 2019. Diversity and inclusion e-learning will be launched during 2019. Diversity as a topic will be included in recruitment trainings. E-learning on quality, environment, health and safety as well as other sustainability topics will be introduced to increase overall awareness and competence. We will continue building a safety culture where all employees are involved. We will also continue food fraud and food defense mitigation actions. We will continue to invest in R&D and product and service development as well as in new ingredients and technologies to increase healthy and sustainable plant-based offering across businesses. The goal and target setting of increasing plant-based foods will be evaluated. Communication with relevant stakeholders will be in an important role, as our work continues.

We want to act sustainably throughout the supply chain and minimise the negative environmental impacts of our operations. Our Core goals regarding our environmental responsibility include 50% less emissions and 50% less food waste. Increasing the share of renewable energy sources together with energy efficiency actions are a crucial part of Fazer’s climate change actions. We carry out waste reduction actions across the Group, focusing on preventing food waste and recycling our side streams in order to increase the circular economy activities. Other essential Fazer sustainability themes include water management, packaging, animal welfare, biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. We continuously assess water risks in the value chain and engage in collective action to develop sustainable water use. Our packaging has been optimised to reduce the use of plastic and we strive to close the loop of materials by using recyclable packaging and increase the share of recyclable materials. A key part of our quest to support sustainable agriculture is the Fazer Grain Vision. We are committed to maintaining global ecosystems by following the WWF seafood guide as well as with our no deforestation, palm oil and soy commitments and World Cocoa Foundation’s Cocoa and Forests Initiative. Work in 2018 In March 2018, Fazer became the first food industry company to make a Finnish water stewardship commitment. With this commitment, we aim to improve and develop water management through operational and value chain actions. A waste water quality project was continued in Finnish industrial sites, with a focus on Fazer Confectionery and Fazer Bakery production sites.

We aim to reduce our energy use per produced ton by 20% by 2020. We increased the focus on our investments and actions related to energy efficiency. Finnish large bakeries continued to conduct self-assessments of best practices in energy efficiency. Reducing food waste and other waste has been one of the key sustainability focus areas at Fazer for many years now. In Fazer Bakery, we analysed the amount of bread waste we generate from production to end consumption to understand where we have the biggest impact. Through optimised and more sustainable packaging, we have succeeded in reducing the use of plastic. Fazer Bakery Finland has adopted a target of reducing the use of plastic by 20% by the year 2025. Since 2017, Fazer Bakery Sweden has reduced plastic packaging with 81 tonnes. For the Oululainen Reissumies branded products alone, we have saved 27 tonnes of plastic annually. We continued our journey towards fulfilling our palm oil commitment and increased our share of segregated palm oil, although we were not able to achieve our target for 2018. We continued dialogue with suppliers on other sustainable vegetable oil alternatives. We offer organic options based on customer and consumer needs. Fazer Mill Sweden was nominated as one of the finalists for the sustainability award “Årets Garant Ekostjärna 2019”. We carried out dialogue with animal welfare organisations. In light of the UN IPPC report and the summer drought, reducing our climate emissions was also a big focus point for stakeholders during 2018. We witnessed our customers also committing to reducing their CO2 emissions in the value chain. During 2018, we carried out a vast number of activities to realise the Fazer Grain Vision. We developed a guidance document on how to fulfil Fazer Grain Vision. Moreover, we participated in stakeholder events and shared knowledge of the vision. We initiated a pilot project to measure the impact of the vision and performed audits to follow up on the progress. We joined the World Cocoa Foundation’s Cocoa and Forests Initiative to commit to no further conversion of any forest land for cocoa production, to end deforestation and restore forest areas. The actions related to achieve these objectives are to include monitoring systems for traceability, and they will focus on long-term sustainable production of cocoa while increasing productivity, so that growing more cocoa on less land becomes a reality. This can be reached with improved planting materials, training in good agricultural practices, and the development of sustainable livelihoods and income diversification for cocoa farmers. WASTE TREATMENT Recycled 76% Recycled as energy 21% Landfill waste 3% Going forward We will continue to monitor and mitigate our impacts on the climate. We are committed to reducing our CO2 emissions throughout the value chain, also in parts of the value chain where we do not have direct control. We will have focus also on material efficiency and national food waste initiatives. During 2019, we will create a Group level guidance on CO2 emission and food waste calculations and KPIs. We are preparing our commitment on animal welfare, based on dialogue with animal welfare organisations as well as suppliers. We will continue to execute our commitments related to waste, water management, energy, the Baltic Sea, cocoa, palm oil, grain, soy and fish. We believe the agricultural and food sector can have a big role in curbing global warming. This is something we will consider in our work. 45 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability What Why Key actions in 2018 Food waste and side streams • Halving food waste and reducing food • Continued waste and food waste losses by 2030, according to SDG target reduction and recycling activities 12.3 • Analysed the amount of bread waste we generate from production to end consumption Energy efficiency • Following Energy Efficiency Directive • Continued executing the long-term (2012), requiring all EU countries to use energy plan, aiming to reduce our energy energy more efficiently, aiming to meet use per produced tons by 20% by 2020 20% reduction by 2020. • Increased the focus on our • Following European Commission’s investments and actions related to proposal (2016) for new 30% target for energy efficiency 2030 • Core goal of 50% less emissions Water management • Water as a major economic, political • Became the first food industry company and social issue.

The profitability of our operations is a prerequisite for growth, development and employment. We conduct our business in a fair and transparent way. Our main Core goal regarding responsible business operations is 100% sustainably sourced. Ensuring the sustainability of our entire value chain, from raw material production to consumers, is highly important to us. We have a continuous dialogue with our suppliers to develop the environmental, social and economic responsibility of our sourcing. We have sustainability requirements for our suppliers and we systematically monitor and audit their operations. We use a risk management tool to identify and evaluate risks related to our raw materials. Other essential themes concerning sustainable business practices include ethical principles, profitability and growth and shared value, research and innovation and brand value. Sustainable, profitable growth allows us to employ and hire personnel and to develop our offering. It also makes it possible for us to carry out projects and programmes, such as our cocoa farmer programmes and scientific research initiatives, that benefit society. We seek to continuously develop our brand value, improve our reputation and reach new consumers with our message of meaningful food experiences. Work in 2018 We continued our commitments concerning responsible sourcing of cocoa, grain, soy, palm oil and fish. In 2018, all our cocoa was sustainably sourced, either through UTZ, Rainforest Alliance or Fairtrade Cocoa Programme certifications or via our own direct programmes. We monitored our cocoa programme in Nigeria and opened two schools to support the education of the farming community. In addition, we started a new programme in the Ivory Coast. We were also able to source 100% RSPO certified palm oil through the three supply chain options, segregated, mass-balance and book and claim. Target in 2018 was to use 100% segregated palm oil in Fazer Confectionery, but we did not quite reach it as 96% of the palm oil used was segregated, with mass balance and book and claim certified oil making up the difference. We had the same challenge in 2017 and continue to work on solving the issue for the remaining products and fractions. We also decided to cover these amounts of palm oil with small holder certificates supporting the small holders in palm oil production. In 2018, we reached our goal for 100% sustainable certified soy. Of the 100%, Fazer has bought certificates to cover 35% and 65% is covered by our suppliers. In Fazer Cafés, all coffee served is certified. We have continued to follow the WWF seafood guide in our restaurants and cafés. Ensuring the continuity and profitability of our business is a prerequisite for sustainable growth and development. We create value for customers, consumers, society at large and owners. Our value creation is a result of mutually beneficial co-operation with a variety of stakeholders, experts and local communities. 48 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability RESPONSIBLE COCOA STATUS RESPONSIBLE PALM OIL STATUS Cocoa purchased according to RSPO certified palm oil (incl all Fazer's cocoa programme 100% RSPO supply chain options)100% Certified 75% Segregated 4692% Direct farmer programmes 25% Mass Balance 14% Book & Claim / GreenPalm certificates 5168% FAZER’S PALM OIL USE BY BUSINESS AREA RESPONSIBLE SOY STATUS RSPO certified palm oil (incl all RSPO supply chain Certified soy 100 % options)100% Cer tification by Fazer Bakery 639% suppliers 65% Fazer Confectionery 341% Cer tification by Fazer Food Services 21% Fazer 35% RESPONSIBLE FISH STATUS 100 Green list fish (FI+SE) 77% 90 Green list fish Finland 76% 80 70 Certified fish Sweden 80% 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Our reputation remained on a good level in all markets, with especially high marks in all main markets. We regularly monitor our reputation in all our operating countries and regard it as an important factor in our preparation for international expansion. Investments in research and innovation help us secure profitable business also in the future. Fazer Lab organised an internal Fazer Innovation Challenge, in which teams of Fazer employees created and developed ideas for new products and services. One of the results, an artisanal hemp bread, has already reached market. The Challenge was also a way to promote a culture of internal entrepreneurship and open-minded exploration within the company. Throughout the year, we also collaborated with several universities and research institutions to increase scientific knowledge on health and nutrition. We conduct our business according to our Ethical principles that apply to all employees in all business areas and countries of operation. These principles are based on our values and the UN Global Compact, which aims to promote corporate sustainable development and good corporate citizenship. We carry out human rights impact assessments to identify the potential negative impacts on our operations and establish mitigation and grievance procedures. Our human rights approach is based on the UN guiding principles on businesses and human rights and the related process. We renewed and expanded our whistleblowing system. As a grievance mechanism, it serves also third parties, who are now able to report observed or suspected breaches of company policies or regulations. During 2018, 18 cases were reported through the system, mainly concerning HR matters and QEHS. The cases have been investigated internally and the necessary measures have been taken. Three investigations are still ongoing. 49 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability DIVISION OF ECONOMIC VALUE, M€ TAXES BORNE AND EMPLOYER'S CONTRIBUTIONS, M€ *) Personnel 5452 Income taxes 224 Society 242 Taxes on proper ty 11 Owners 607 Employer's contributions 1098 Financiers 23 Other taxes 05 Business development 362 *) Insurance taxes and energy taxes not included EQUITY AND RETURN ON EQUITY TAXES COLLECTED, M€ 600 5297 5573 544.4 30 Payroll taxes 1055 5113 4948 500 4728 25 VAT, net 570 400 20 Other taxes 110 14.1 13.3 300 11.6 15 200 7.6 10 4.8 3.5 100 5 0 0 2014 2015 2016 2016 2017 2018 Equity, FAS, M€ Equity, IFRS, M€ Return on equity (ROE), % We are committed to preventing the occurrence of bribery in all our businesses.

We have a comprehensive anti-bribery programme in place, which includes among other things an anti-bribery policy, training and eLearning, gift registration procedures, internal audits and a counterparty risk assessment. Going forward The new sustainability approach will be taken into practice across business areas and functions. We will concentrate on the implementation, focusing on the core goals and taking into account business needs and focus areas of each business area. We will further develop our issues management and risk management from the perspective of sustainability. We will continue to monitor our reputation. Together with the sourcing, QEHS and legal functions, we will develop our sourcing processes to ensure responsibility and compliance throughout the value chain. We will revise our supplier requirements both for direct raw material categories and for indirect services. We will also work to increase supplier understanding of these requirements. We continue the work to develop the transparency and traceability of our extensive value chain. By cultivating good relationships with our suppliers, we ensure the availability of high-quality raw materials in the future. We will continue developing our approach concerning categories such as packaging and eggs, in which we strive to reach the highest sustainability level. Work with existing focus areas – cocoa, soy, palm oil, grains and fish – continues as well. We want to earn the trust shown by our stakeholders and develop our sustainability work together with them. We believe that through co operation, new innovations and solutions can be found, and we therefore apply a collaborative approach. 50 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Sustainability What Why Key actions in 2018 Ethical principles and Human Rights • Following our ethical principles in • Renewed and expanded our all business and encouraging our whistleblowing system to include partners to follow them as well third parties Fair value chain • Strengthening collaboration in the • Sourced 100% sustainable cocoa; value chain 100% certified soy; 100% RSPO certified palm oil.

While the economies in Fazer’s key markets continued to develop favourably, the competitive landscape became tougher for all the businesses. Also, the extraordinarily hot summer affected Fazer’s businesses. In addition, the weak performance in Fazer Bakery Russia and Sweden and the weakening of all Fazer’s main foreign currencies had a negative impact on the 2018 financials. As a result, Fazer Group’s net sales and operating profit decreased from the previous year. In 2018, Fazer’s brand positioning was redefined to amplify the consumer-centric approach. At the start of 2018, Fazer Retail was established as a separate business unit to strengthen the direct-to-consumer business. Also, the organisational setup for Fazer Lifestyle Foods was further developed. Focus on efficiency improvements continued with initiatives in several fields. Occupational safety and developing Fazer’s safety culture remained an important theme with positive results. Markets, business environment and sales In 2018, the economies in Fazer’s key markets continued to develop favourably. On the other hand, all of Fazer’s main foreign currencies weakened against the euro, and affected Fazer´s financial performance negatively. The largest foreign currency impact on Fazer came from the Swedish krona, which weakened by 6% against the euro. Year 2018 was a challenging year for Fazer Bakery Russia and Sweden. At the same time, the performance in Finland reached record levels and business in the Baltics developed positively: in these markets Fazer’s market share also increased. Artisanal bread maintained its popularity, especially in Finland and Sweden. Bread consumption in Russia shifted towards lower-priced segments. The extraordinarily hot summer affected bread consumption in all markets. Fazer Bakery’s net sales decreased to 552.3 M€ (2017: 583.2 excluding net sales of Bakery Shops transferred to Fazer Retail and net sales of Alku porridges transferred to Fazer Lifestyle Foods). Programmes are in place to turn the development and to increase operational efficiency in all Fazer Bakery operations. Fazer Confectionery’s net sales for 2018 reached 333.1 M€ (2017: 331.2). The market share in chocolate tablets increased and biscuit sales grew in Finland. In Sweden, Fazer kept its confectionary market share. Fazer Candy Store was opened to serve 53 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Governance consumers online. Currently, the web store ships to EU countries only but the geographical expansion is being planned. Cooperation was started with JD.com to explore opportunities in the Chinese market. Fazer Food Services with more than 1 000 restaurants in Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark reached net sales of 593.2 M€ (607.7). With comparable currency rates the net sales were at previous year level. Retention of existing contracts was on a good level while some unprofitable contracts were exited. Actions to improve performance were initiated and they will continue further into 2019 to strengthen the competitiveness of the business. Fazer’s Culinary Teams from Sweden and Finland took a double victory at the culinary World Championships in Luxembourg in November. The competition tightened in the smoothie and non-dairy markets, with both branded and large private label competitors vying for market share. Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ net sales increased 21% and amounted 121.8 M€ (100.4). Several new products were launched during the year. The Froosh smoothie range was complemented with functional smoothies. Cereals and organic porridges were launched under the Fazer Alku breakfast food brand. The Fazer Yosa oat product family was expanded with eight products and the brand was refreshed with, for example, a new packaging design. Oat-based products have sparked global interest and Nordic oats are highly regarded around the world. Significant investments were made in Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ organisational development and marketing activities to ensure future growth. Fazer Retail was established as a separate business unit at the start of 2018 to strengthen Fazer’s direct-to-consumer business. The business unit combines the Gateau bakery shops in Finland and Sweden with Fazer Cafés in Finland. The new business unit combines artisanal bakery products and high-quality delicacies with a first-class experience. In 2018, the focus was on building an organisation and operating platform for future growth and for expanding its retail expertise. The net sales of the new business unit reached 46.4 M€ during its first year of operation. The Fazer Experience Visitor Centre was visited by more than 200,000 people in 2018, which is a new record. Financial results Fazer’s reported net sales decreased by 1% from previous year and reached 1,618.2 M€ (1,641.6). The weakened foreign exchange rates reduced the net sales by 48.6 M€. The businesses acquired in 2017 increased the 2018 net sales by 18.8 M€ compared to previous year. The Group’s operating profit decreased to 84.2 M€ (92.1). Operating profit included 4.2 M€ (3.5) one-time restructuring costs and write-offs (net). Profit for the financial period amounted to 63.9 M€ (72.1). Fazer Confectionery was the only business area that improved its profitability. Cash flow and financial position The Group’s financial position remained strong. Interest-bearing net debt totalled 95.0 M€ (79.0). The Group’s equity ratio was 56.8% (55.1%). Cash flow from operating activities was 114.6 M€ (149.6) and gross investments amounted to 50.5 M€ (108.0). The majority of the investments were done in new production equipment and upgrades to the existing machinery in the bakery and confectionery operations.

With this strategic goal in mind, Fazer strengthened its focus on the consumer and updated the Fazer brand positioning. Fazer targets growth and value creation through portfolio choices, continued operational excellence and structural improvements. Despite 2018 having been a challenging year, Fazer is committed to improve its performance in all its businesses and geographies. Implementation of Fazer’s new strategy included in 2018 a large number of value creation initiatives in different businesses and Group functions, building the organisation and capabilities for growth in the new Fazer Lifestyle Foods business area, creating the new Fazer Retail business unit, establishing a distribution company for Fazer Confectionary in the USA as well as planning and developing other means for profitability, growth and geographical expansion. Quality, environment, occupational health & safety and food safety In 2018, the focus in quality, environment, health and safety (QEHS) was on the development and digitalisation of the related management system, ensuring compliance with regulations, improving competences, strengthening risk management and promoting safety leadership. New ways of communication and leadership activities continued to improve occupational health and safety. Management safety walks, safety reviews, safety commitments and other safety practises are part of the daily operations. Accident frequency fell by 17% from 2017. All businesses have safety plans in place. Fazer continued to improve its quality and food safety management in many ways. In addition to the new digital QEHS system taken into use, the programme to certify all production sites against a global food safety system was continued, and allergen management was developed. 55 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Governance Fazer has certified all its production sites against the Global Food Safety System (FSSC 22000). In addition to this, also other QEHS management systems have been certified depending on the demands of the markets and customers. Fazer Food Services’ HACCP (preventative food safety) process was digitalised and harmonised across the Nordics. In 2018, there were no product recalls. Fazer’s environmental management continued to improve through internal programmes and 3rd party certifications. Fazer continued to engage in energy efficiency activities, conducting energy efficiency mappings and self-assessments. Waste reduction actions across the Group were carried out, focusing on preventing food waste and recycling side streams. Fazer was the first food industry company to make a Finnish water stewardship commitment. Sustainability In 2018, Fazer revised and updated its sustainability approach to support the transformation into a modern and sustainable food company with a joint direction. Fazer’s ambitious direction towards 2030 consists of four core goals that support reaching the UN sustainable development goals through food. The core goals are: 1) 50% less emissions, 2) 50% less food waste, 3) 100% sustainably sourced and 4) more plant based. The highlights of Fazer’s sustainability work for 2018 include systematic work to improve energy efficiency to reduce climate emissions and continuing to focus on food waste reduction. Fazer continued its commitments concerning the sustainable sourcing of cocoa, grain, soy, palm oil and fish, and increase of its offering of plant-based foods. Fazer’s reputation remained on a good level in its main markets. Risk management Fazer regularly evaluates and analyses the Group’s strategic, operative and financial risks within the framework of its risk management policy and takes action to mitigate these risks. In 2018, no major risks were realised. For more information on financial risk management, see Note 11.3 to the Financial Statements.

Two clinical trials were successfully finalised in 2018. The BRAVE study, a cooperative project with Nokia and Nightingale Health investigating the effects of brain-friendly food on cognitive functions, physiology and blood biomarkers, showed very promising results that will be published in 2019. Fazer Lifestyle Foods’ technology and new product development work resulted in the launch of the new non-dairy oat products under the Fazer Yosa brand. The Fazer LOFO improver, which is a result of long-term R&D work, was presented at the international bakery exhibition (IBA) in Munich. This patented improver is the world’s first enzyme-based solution to reducing the amount of FODMAP compounds in bread making the bread more belly-friendly. Fazer’s cooperation with universities and researchers continued and resulted in the publication of one doctoral dissertation and multiple master thesis works. 56 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Governance Research and development costs amounted to 9.8 M€ (9.9). Changes in Group legal structure Fazer continued its work to simplify its legal structure and several legal entities were merged in 2018. The changes in the Group legal structure are disclosed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements. Shares and share capital At the end of 2018, the parent company had 3,958,763 preference shares and 2,365,200 ordinary shares. Preference shares carry a preferential right of at least 6% of the share’s nominal amount, ahead of ordinary shares, for the annual dividend from the company’s distributable profit. At the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, each ordinary share is entitled to ten votes and each preference share carries one vote.

In 2019, the net sales and the operating profit are expected to increase compared to previous year. Events after the reporting period In January 2019, Fazer announced considering closing of the Oulu bakery in Finland to improve efficiency of its bakery network. Collaboration negotiations concerning Oulu bakery were concluded in March 2019. Bakery’s operations will gradually be transferred to other Fazer bakeries. Operations of the bakery and contracts of all 83 employees will end in September 2019. 57 Fazer Group’s Annual Review 2018 Governance In January, Fazer also announced its plan to invest 40 million euros into a new production facility in Lahti, Finland. With this investment, Fazer brings Finnish raw material based xylitol production back to Finland and builds the first xylitol manufacturing facility in the world that uses oat hull as its raw material. The xylitol market is expected to grow, and Fazer targets markets in Northern Europe and beyond with this plant-based product.

These risks together or separately may have an effect on Fazer’s business, results, financial standing, competitiveness or reputation. Climate change affecting raw material availability, price and quality as well as water-related risks are recognised risks for food production. Fazer has recognised potential risks compromising human rights or unethical practices that may occur especially within the value chains. Any possible risks related to the realisation of human rights, anti-corruption or bribery are managed with the help of personnel training, internal policies and audits. Human rights related risks are also mitigated by following UN Guiding Principles on businesses and human rights and processes described in these guiding principles.
