In this regard we have been able to keep a stable percentage of employees former employed as student assistants or interns close to 20% over the past 5 years. The employee turnover considerably increased in 2018. Compared to previous years, a significant amount of employment contracts was terminated within the first year of employment due to different expectations of employer and employee. For 2019 we aim at reducing the staff turnover, inter alia, by putting more emphasis on a thorough and in-depth recruitment of new staff.

Amongst others the location of our head-quarters in Freiburg in a “plus-energy building” shows our environmental commitment. Plus-energy buildings are characterized by on average generating more energy than its inhabitants spend. We kept on our policy, that no employee is provided with an own company car. The company owns one car that is at everyone’s disposal for business purposes. In exchange, Particip provides Bahncard50 a German Rail loyalty card that offers a 50% discount to all travelling employees. Travels within Europe are therefore mainly undertaken by train. For 2019, we plan to dispose of our company car using car sharing instead.
