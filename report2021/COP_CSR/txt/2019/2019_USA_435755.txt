Our projects in Africa and Latin America have been focused on STEAM education, particularly in IT/BPO sectors, which in turn create large numbers of knowledge-based jobs for the youth. Avasant has worked in over 50 countries including Palestine, Albania, Moldova, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa and Ghana in Africa and Jamaica, Trinidad Proud students at Jamaican and Tobago, and Haiti in the Caribbean region. graduating class, 2019. We understand that a firm’s social responsibility must not be limited to its outreach initiatives. It should be an all-encompassing concept covering all stakeholders (such as employees and vendors) and based on moral, ethical and justifiable business principles (such as fair trade, nondiscriminatory policies, zero corruption, etc.). Despite being a consulting organization where employees need to travel to client sites, we try to minimize travel using tech-collaboration tools. This is one of the many ways that Avasant contributes to the environmental sustainability of our business. Avasant works with leading institutional bodies, including the World Bank, InterAmerican Development Bank, African Development Bank, EBRD, Asia Development Bank, United Nations Agency for International Development (USAID), United States Trade Development Agency (USTDA), Rockefeller Foundation, Clinton Global Initiative, American India Foundation, Girl Rising, United Nations and SDG Funders Philanthropy Platform in their pursuits to end poverty and enable societies globally to realize their potential.

This initiative has provided over 600 deserving youth with vocational and life skills trainings and connected over 94% of them to employment through Impact Sourcing practices. We do this by educating the business partners on Impact Sourcing job hiring, which complements the traditional outsourcing model to provide business value along with an added advantage of social benefit. 7|Page Avasant Foundation Chairman Kevin Parikh and Executive Director Chitra Rajeshwari were recognized by the Clinton Global Initiative in 2015 and 2016 for their hugely successful youth employment initiatives in the Caribbean.

The purpose for doing this was to gather data on the perceptions of gender equality, empowerment and opportunities for women in the outsourcing industry and to identify where and how outsourcing has internationally empowered the lives of women, both inside and outside the workplace.

The government of Zanzibar wanted to identify the priority sectors of the economy that would attract foreign exchange and investment dollars not only to offset the deficit, but also for growth & job creation. These sectors would be made engines of growth by Government. . Intervention Avasant identified and developed the Sector Development Strategy for the priority sectors that included capacity building, private sector strategy, ease of doing business, financing, SME development and value chain integration. Avasant also benchmarked policy incentives with competing destinations and recommended best practices for investment promotion 15 | P a g e Impact Based on Avasant’s recommendations, the Government of Zanzibar is re-aligning their policies for the development of the sectors we identified. Zanzibar is also implementing the recommendations that would attract investment of more than 1B USD over the next 5 years and create 10,000 direct jobs and more than 25,000 indirect jobs in the archipelago Malawi Investment Master Plan Malawi is one of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) having 4th lowest per capita income in the world. The economy is primarily agrarian and the country does not have any manufacturing base as they are a land-locked territory. The Government of Malawi has identified Services Sector as the engine of growth. The country is well endowed with natural assets that hold the potential to turn Malawi into a sought-after tourist destination. Tourism exports would lead to socio-economic development and help to bridge the current account deficit. However, the national infrastructure of Malawi needed major upgrades to enable tourism to flourish. Avasant was selected for developing a National Masterplan for attracting investments into the travel and tourism sectors. Intervention • Avasant has identified ten nodes for infrastructure development. Projects are being formulated in each of these nodes and would be marketed to international investors for attracting FDI over the medium to long-term. 16 | P a g e • Avasant is assisting the Governments in investment facilitation for mid-large investors. This included providing assistance in getting timely approvals, acting as a liaison between investor and the Government, providing additional information and advising the investors through the course of investment process. • Avasant is also developing branding and positioning strategies for the various product lines offered to Malawi and for the country as a whole. In addition, we assisted in designing digital marketing campaigns. • Avasant is supporting the Government of Malawi in enhancing the talent base to support the sector development. This includes providing programs to train their workforce, offering service quality improvement as well as industry partnerships. Impact • Projects worth $25Bn would be formulated as part of the National Investment Masterplan over the long-term. • The Masterplan would enable Malawi to attract FDI worth at least $10Bn. • These projects would result in direct employment of 150,000 and indirect/induced employment of 300,000. 17 | P a g e Investment Promotion in Ghana Though the International Finance Corporation (IFC) had been assisting the Government of Ghana in strengthening its ICT sector, they engaged Avasant to provide additional support to the Government so that it could better position itself as a preferred destination for investors. The objective of the project was to present the findings from the feasibility study conducted by Avasant and provide recommendations for the ICT sector. These recommendations are now being pursued by the IFC and the Government of Ghana to leverage the successes in the ICT sector and position Ghana as a preferred destination to leading international and domestic investors. With inward investments, the ICT can help Ghana to lower prices by reducing operating costs for B2B, B2C, B2G businesses and generally contribute to the efficient functioning of both domestic and export markets. Lower costs will lower the barriers to entry and foster healthy competition, which can lead to higher productivity and more investments in Ghana’s ICT sector, thereby creating more jobs in the sector. The feasibility study identified global ICT investment trends, assessed the overall market size for ICT inward investment into Africa and the relative value proposition for Ghana, benchmarked against key competitors in the region (Nigeria, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt, South Africa and Mauritius). The study has also identified the key drivers for improving ICT business, competitiveness and location attractiveness of Ghana; assessed the readiness of the Accra Digital Centre (ADC) for ICT investors as an example of an investment-ready location; and developed an investment promotion strategy of Ghana’s ICT sector to attract and retain investors. A workshop was also conducted with key stakeholders from the IFC, the Ministry of Communication of Ghana, NITA – Ghana, Ghana Investment Promotion Center (GIPC) and major Ghanaian entrepreneurial ventures from the ICT sector. The findings of the study conducted by Avasant were discussed in the workshop and the recommendations were shared to promote investment in the Ghanaian ICT sector. 18 | P a g e Investment Promotion in Palestine In July of 2018, Avasant was engaged by the DfID to consult on its Palestine Market Development Program (“PMDP”) for the Occupied Palestinian Territories (“oPt”). Avasant collaborated with DAIEurope and assessed the supply side capabilities of the technology sector and key service providers in West Bank and Gaza. The findings from this assessment resulted in the development of the Palestinian outsourcing value proposition which was leveraged to solicit UK market demand for services supplied by Palestinian ITO and BPO services. The business linkage activities that followed resulted in the identification of 11 potential and active opportunities. The active opportunities are now being pursued by the DfID to foster buyer-service provider relations between UK-based buyer companies and Palestine ICT providers and broader economic development in this region. A key challenge for the Palestinian economy is that has never been perceived as a business destination. Though political troubles and travel restrictions are a reality, Palestine ) is bolstered by a thriving economy driven by a burgeoning educated youth. Leading universities in Palestine (Berzeit, Al Quds, Bethlehem, etc.) have been producing technology professionals through alliances with leading global universities. Despite this growing technical pool, the world has largely been unaware of its presence. Despite the best efforts of the Palestine Authority to attract new investments and business, they failed to present a holistic picture of the region to specific buy-side markets. In the past, their efforts focused on presenting a view of the region that was aimed more at attracting nongovernmental/NGO funding or private sector organizations with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) functions. The HM Department for International Development (“DfID”) wanted to grant the UK corporate sector access to the Palestine ICT sector in order to facilitate the government’s approach to the region as a form of economic diplomacy. For close to 3 years, the DfID failed to present a commercially viable value proposition to potential buyers while the CSR approach floundered due to an absence of long-term market interest. Appealing to the “feel good factor” was not yielding results as expected and corporations continued to overlook Palestine in favor of regions in Africa to meet their CSR goals. Our solution approached the problem differently. 19 | P a g e We recognized that the sustainable long-term solution to the challenges of Palestine lay in creating a holistic value proposition for the economy as a destination open for business. The objective database for the economy developed through our solution gave potential investors/corporations looking to do business with Palestine IT service providers the ability to build a holistic picture of the economy and compare it with nearby destinations like Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt. The importance of the first 11 opportunities identified through our solution cannot be understated in terms of establishing a first level awareness of the region. Their impact does not merely lie in the numbers, but because they individually and collectively confirmed the validity of Palestine’s portfolio of value propositions and the value of our solution. The opportunities represented each of the different target stakeholders corresponding to the value propositions. These target stakeholders included those who sought to outsource providers at scale, niche specialist product development technologists, staff augmentation services, professional services (e.g., translation, documentation and archival. They also included companies that offered product/service localization to facilitate entry into the Arab market established delivery capability in Palestine. These opportunities gave the DfID confidence in our methodology and initial hypothesis that it was essential to adopt a granular approach to understand the data and information requirements of each target group before building a holistic picture of the region. Though it is difficult to quantify the impact at such an early stage of the process, these opportunities have triggered a range of conversations between the two sides of the market. 20 | P a g e BPO Sector Development and Capacity Development in Haiti Avasant is engaged by the Centre de Facilitation des Investissements (CFI-HAITI) and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in a project focused on developing the BPO Sector and promoting capacity development and entrepreneurship skills that ended in January, 2018. Key Objectives • Promote Haiti as an ideal outsourcing destination and spur development in Haiti’s BPO Sector. • Build capacity in the local workforce enabling faster uptake into newly created jobs within the sector. • Support the development of incubation capabilities to promote entrepreneurship in the country. • Organize a national-level job fair initiative that brings young students, professionals & experts from the IT-BPO industry under one roof on the same day. The objective of the job fair is to attract candidates who are interested in working in the IT-BPO sector in Haiti, and familiarize them on the industry and the opportunities that are available to them. • Develop an online platform that brings together BPO investors/employers and job seekers who are interested in working in the sector. 21 | P a g e Avasant Foundation Objectives Avasant Foundation leverages its expertise in the Digital Economy to bring together diverse stakeholders and create opportunities for youth to succeed in the workforce of today and into the future.

Our Values Service: to humanity Teamwork: working together for better results Responsibility: taking accountability for our actions Integrity: doing the right thing Vision: working with purpose Excellence: in our commitment 22 | P a g e | Commitment to Human Rights and Fair Trade Labor Practices Avasant is committed to the UN Global Compact Principles 1 through 6 and 10 as they relate to human rights, labor practices and fighting corruption. Our commitment to labor principles spans across our supplier base and employees, which includes ensuring no use of child labor and forced or bonded labor in the value chain. Our organization is transparent in its management and commercial relations. It is accountable to its stakeholders and respects the sensitive and confidential nature of commercial information supplied. Avasant focuses on the social, economic and environmental wellbeing of marginalized small suppliers, and does not maximize profit at their expense. Avasant is committed to a consistent and fair tender process and to facilitate this, all potential suppliers receive a request for Quotation/Proposal RFP/RFQ letters which invite suppliers to participate as well as Intent to respond and Non-disclosure documents. Upon completion of these documents, suppliers who wish to offer a tender will receive the RFQ/RFP, which includes process timeframes and response formats to which suppliers must strictly adhere. All tenders provide an opportunity to allow suppliers to respond with questions and give an identical time-period for all Avasant employees at annual meeting to respond. Through this process, Avasant ensures that the supplier bidding process is fair and is conducted through an effective mechanism, which creates a win-win situation for both suppliers and Avasant. Avasant envisions a more integrated and inclusive supply chain in key geographies where our firm operates that aligns our corporate social initiatives and has a demand for outsourcing services. Fostering the social betterment of underprivileged communities helps Avasant to create positive economic growth and an employable workforce in emerging nations where we are directly engaged with governments.

Avasant conducts formal 360-degree feedback sessions twice a year along with informal, interactive “happy hour” sessions at least twice a month.

Avasant’s 8-week training program and mentor-mentee initiative is aimed at grooming the associates through regular one-on-one sessions on career progression, firm development and honing consulting skill sets. Avasant adheres to health and safety standards for its employees, contractors, partners and clients. We also support flexi-working, which allows our consultants to work from his/her home so that they can focus more on their demanding workload and less on unproductive and often stressful office commutes. We encourage our workforce to maintain a healthy work life-balance and offer them more control of their own time.
