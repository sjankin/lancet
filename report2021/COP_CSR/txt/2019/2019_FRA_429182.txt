This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.” FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 To the Annual General Meeting of the Shareholders of Plastic Omnium, OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Compagnie Plastic Omnium for the year ended December 31, 2018. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2018 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Accounts Committee. BASIS FOR OPINION AUDIT FRAMEWORK We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. INDEPENDENCE We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1, 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. EMPHASIS OF MATTER Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in Note 2.1. Application of new IFRS applicable from January 1, 2018 to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the change in methods and impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements of the first-time application of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments . JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS – KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. 224 PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT www.plasticomnium.com 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 VALUATION OF REVENUE Notes 1.1.7 Revenue / Revenue from contracts with customers and 1.1 Accounting policies, accounting rules and principles in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the income statement for Compagnie Plastic Omnium amount to €7,245 million. KEY AUDIT MATTER Parts revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of the ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer, usually upon delivery of the goods, and measured at the fair value of the consideration received, after deducting discounts, rebates and other sales taxes and customs duties. Regarding the revenue from services and tooling, as indicated in Note 1.1.7 Revenues / Revenue from Contracts with Customers , since January 1, 2018 the Group has been applying IFRS 15. ● The new accounting treatment is based on the Group's identification of two performance obligations, separate from the production of parts, which are the Design of the parts business and certain specific tools, for which control is transferred to customers; ● Revenue related to lumps sums payments and contractually stated amounts that will be paid via part price (“PPA”) that are explicitly identified in the contracts, and the negative or positive margin related to these performance obligations are recognized at the start of series production. Costs related to performance obligations are recognized as inventory during the project phase and then expensed when their control is transferred to the customer, i.e. at the start of series production. We have considered revenue recognition and the analysis performed by the Group in regards to the first-time application of IFRS 15 as a key audit matter given: ● The volume of accounting entries related to sales of goods and the numerous ongoing discussions between the Group and its customers on prices; ● Judgments to be made by Management of the Group to estimate the incurred and projected costs related to the project phase that could lead to an incorrect revenue related to the services rendered and the production of tools. OUR RESPONSE We analyzed the process and identified key controls implemented by Management regarding revenue recognition and tested their effectiveness by 4 sampling. In order to assess the recognition of revenue related to the sale of goods, we conducted tests on a sample of contracts by: ● comparing the sale prices applied to the deliveries of parts with the contractual prices; ● examining the credit notes issued during the period. In order to corroborate the level of progress and the recognition of the turnover related to services and tooling, we conducted tests on a sample of contracts by: ● comparing the sales prices applied to services and tooling at the start of the series life with the contractual prices; ● examining revenue and costs allocated to performance obligations. We assessed the conformity of the methodology applied by the Group with IFRS 15 and the impact of the new accounting treatment on revenue and operating margin of the Group as it relates to fiscal year 2018 by analyzing a sample of contracts. EVALUATION OF FIXED ASSETS RELATIVE TO DEVELOPMENT COSTS Note 1.1.11 “Intangible assets”, and note 1.2 “Use of estimates” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, fixed assets related to development costs for Compagnie Plastic Omnium amount to €555 million. KEY AUDIT MATTER ● Development costs incurred during the project phase and related to the execution of the contract concluded with the customer that do not meet a performance obligation are posted as intangible assets. These internal and external costs relate to work on the organization of purchasing, logistics and industrial processes in order to produce the parts that will be ordered by customers. PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 225 4 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 ● These costs are recognized as fixed assets in progress during the development phase and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated duration of the series production, generally three years for exterior parts, five years for fuel systems and the Modules activity. ● These fixed assets are subject to annual impairment tests and when there are indications of impairment loss at the start of the series life. ● The valuation of capital assets related to development costs is considered a key audit matter due to judgments to be made by Management to determine: ● the costs to be incurred in the development phase; ● the recoverable value of these assets, based on forecasts of future sales volumes. OUR RESPONSE Our work consisted in: ● acknowledging the process of identifying capitalized development costs; ● reviewing the estimated development costs incurred for the Automotive projects; ● reviewing the depreciation method used in light of changes in market conditions and performing arithmetical checks. We also considered the relevance of the impairment indicators used by the Group at the closing date and, when appropriate, we examined the impairment tests performed. ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR CHANGES IN SCOPE KEY AUDIT MATTER As stated in note 2.3.1 Acquisition by the Group of Mahle-Behr's 33.3% equity stake in HBPO of the notes to the consolidated financial statements: ● On March 1, 2018, Plastic Omnium Auto Exteriors SA and Mahle-Behr signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement ( SPA ) whereby Mahle-Behr sold its 33.3% stake in HBPO, provided the Group obtained approval from the competition authorities. On June 26, 2018, the Group finalized this acquisition for a purchase price of €370 million. Following this acquisition, the Group now owns 66.67% of HBPO and Hella 33.33%. ● Following exchanges with the partner and taking into account the integration procedures achieved in the weeks following the acquisition, the Plastic Omnium Group concluded that it exercised control over HBPO. ● This transaction resulted in (i) a fair value revaluation of the previously held securities generating a capital gain of €255 million in profit and (ii) posting at fair value of HBPO's assets acquired and liabilities assumed and provisional goodwill of €525 million. The Group had a period of twelve months from the date of acquisition to adjust the value of HBPO's acquired assets and liabilities. ● As indicated in note 2.6.1 Sale of the Environment business of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, a sale purchase agreement was signed on October 26, 2018 between the Plastic Omnium Group and the consortium Latour Capital/Bpifrance (French public investment bank) . The Net profit after tax of discontinued operations presented in the consolidated income statement of €1.5 million includes: ● in accordance with IFRS 5, the activity of the Environment Division net of inter-company transactions with the Group, from January 1 to December 18, 2018 for +€11.964 million; ● and the net tax loss on the sale of this business for -€10.47 million. These changes in scope and accounting treatment are a key audit matter due to their significance, complexity and judgments that Management has had to exercise. OUR RESPONSE The work we did consisted mainly of: ● reviewing the shareholders' pact and HBPO's terms of consolidation and reviewing the Group's analysis of control against IFRS 10 criteria for HBPO control; ● reviewing the methodology used to identify the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and their valuation at fair value, including our valuation experts in our audit team, ● reviewing the assumptions used to value the fair value of customer contracts and the HBPO brand and the fair value of previously held securities. As part of the disposal of the Environment Division, we examined the accounting entries for the disposal of the scope of consolidation and the disposal profit. 226 PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT www.plasticomnium.com 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS In accordance with the professional standards applicable in France, we have also performed the specific verifications required by French laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no comments to make as to their fairness and consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We state that the consolidated statement of extra-financial performance pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code is part of the Group’s management report, it being stated that, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 823-10 of this Code, the information contained in this statement have not been verified by us for accuracy or consistency with the consolidated financial statements. INFORMATION RESULTING FROM OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPOINTMENT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS We were appointed as Statutory Auditors for Plastic Omnium by the General Meeting of December 28, 1977 for MAZARS and of April 29, 2010 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres. As at December 31, 2018, MAZARS and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres were in the forty second and ninth year of total uninterrupted engagement respectively. Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit had been a statutory auditor since 2001. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OFFICERS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS It is the responsibility of management to prepare consolidated accounts that present a true and fair view in accordance with the IFRS as adopted in the European Union, as well as to implement the internal control that it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements. No material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for evaluating the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern, to 4 present in these accounts, where appropriate, the necessary information relating to the continuity of operations and operations apply the going concern accounting policy unless it is intended to wind up the company or cease trading. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. STATUTORY AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OBJECTIVES AND AUDIT APPROACH Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 227 4 2018 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ● Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. ● Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements; ● Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. ● Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ● Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. REPORT TO THE ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE ● We submit a report to the Accounts Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.

OUR RESPONSE Our work consisted in: ● Comparing the net book value of equity securities with the net equity of these companies; ● Assessing the existence of indication of impairment by ● interviewing the Group’s Finance Department on the results and profit outlook of the different companies, ● assessing the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors of Compagnie Plastic Omnium. ● Assessing, when applicable, the valuation methodology and the arithmetical accuracy of the calculation of the recoverable value and verifying the consistency of assumptions used with the economic environment at the reporting and closing dates.

PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 251 5 2018 STATUTORY ACCOUNTS Statutory Auditors’ report on the financial statements INFORMATION ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPOINTMENT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS We were appointed as statutory auditors of Compagnie Plastic Omnium by the Annual General Meeting held on December 28, 1977 for Mazars and on May 15, 2001 for Ernst & Young et Autres (under the name Ernst & Young Audit on May 15, 2001 until April 29, 2010). As at December 31, 2018, Mazars and Ernst & Young et Autres were in the forty-second year and ninth year of total uninterrupted engagement respectively. Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit was the Statutory Auditor since 2001. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OFFICERS REGARDING THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the board of directors. STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OBJECTIVES AND AUDIT APPROACH Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the french commercial code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of the Company's management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout this audit. Furthermore it: ● Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ● Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. ● Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements. ● Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. 252 PLASTIC OMNIUM 2018 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT www.plasticomnium.com 2018 STATUTORY ACCOUNTS Statutory Auditors’ report on the financial statements ● Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
