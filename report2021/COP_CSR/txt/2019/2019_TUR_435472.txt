(the Bank), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 and the statement of profit or loss, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter on the unconsolidated financial statements described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the accompanying unconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the unconsolidated financial position of Türkiye Sınai Kalkınma Bankası A.Ş. as at 31 December 2018 and unconsolidated financial performance and unconsolidated its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (“BRSA”) Accounting and Financial Reporting Legislation which includes “Regulation on Accounting Applications for Banks and Safeguarding of Documents” published in the Official Gazette no.26333 dated 1 November 2006, and other regulations on accounting records of Banks published by Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency and circulars and interpretations published by BRSA and Financial Reporting Standards (“TFRS”) for those matters not regulated by the aforementioned regulations. Basis for Qualified Opinion As explained in Note 7 in the Explanations and Disclosures related to the Liabilities, the accompanying unconsolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018 include a free provision at an amount of TL 220.000 thousands, of which TL 30.000 thousands and TL 190.000 thousands was provided in current and prior years respectively by the Bank management, for possible results of the circumstances which may arise from possible changes in the economy and market conditions and include the reversal of deferred tax asset at an amount of TL 41.800 thousands, which was accounted based on the free provision provided in 31 December 2017. Due to the fact that the above mentioned items do not meet the requirements of TAS 37, the “Prior years’ income/losses” as of 31 December 2018 is understated by TL 148.200 thousands after deducting the tax effect and the “pretax income” is understated by TL 30.000 thousands. Our audit was conducted in accordance with “Regulation on independent audit of the Banks” published in the Official Gazette no.29314 dated 2 April 2015 by BRSA (BRSA Independent Audit Regulation) and Independent Auditing Standards (“ISA”) which are the part of Turkish Auditing Standards issued by the Public Oversight Accounting and Auditing Standards Authority (“POA”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Bank in accordance with of Code of Ethics for Independent Auditors (Code of Ethics) published by POA and have fulfilled our other responsibilities in accordance with the code of ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements of the current period. Key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the unconsolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 136 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 137 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Key Audit Matter How the matter is addressed in our audit Pension Fund Obligations Financial impact of transition to TFRS 9 “Financial Employees of the Bank are members of “TSKB A.Ş.

We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the unconsolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. (The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.) • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. 1 February 2019 İstanbul, Turkey • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the unconsolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the unconsolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 140 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 141 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT TÜRKİYE SINAİ KALKINMA BANKASI A.Ş.

(the Bank) and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2018 and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter on the consolidated financial statements described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Türkiye Sınai Kalkınma Bankası A.Ş (the Bank) and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2018 and consolidated financial performance and consolidated its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (“BRSA”) Accounting and Financial Reporting Legislation which includes “Regulation on Accounting Applications for Banks and Safeguarding of Documents” published in the Official Gazette no.26333 dated 1 November 2006, and other regulations on accounting records of Banks published by Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency and circulars and interpretations published by BRSA and Financial Reporting Standards (“TFRS”) for those matters not regulated by the aforementioned regulations. Basis for Qualified Opinion As explained in Note 7 in the Explanations and Disclosures related to the Liabilities, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2018 include a free provision at an amount of TL 220.000 thousands, of which TL 30.000 thousands and TL 190.000 thousands was provided in current and prior years respectively by the Bank management, for possible results of the circumstances which may arise from possible changes in the economy and market conditions and include the reversal of deferred tax asset at an amount of TL 41.800 thousands, which was accounted based on the free provision provided in 31 December 2017. Due to the fact that the above mentioned items do not meet the requirements of TAS 37, the “Prior years’ income/losses” as of 31 December 2018 is understated by TL 148.200 thousands after deducting the tax effect and the “pretax income” is understated by TL 30.000 thousands. Our audit was conducted in accordance with “Regulation on independent audit of the Banks” published in the Official Gazette no.29314 dated 2 April 2015 by BRSA (BRSA Independent Audit Regulation) and Independent Auditing Standards (“ISA”) which are the part of Turkish Auditing Standards issued by the Public Oversight Accounting and Auditing Standards Authority (“POA”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with of Code of Ethics for Independent Auditors (Code of Ethics) published by POA and have fulfilled our other responsibilities in accordance with the code of ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. Key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. 158 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 159 TSKB 2018 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Key Audit Matter How the matter is addressed in our audit Pension Fund Obligations Financial impact of transition to TFRS 9 “Financial Employees of the Parent Bank are members of “TSKB A.Ş.

We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. (The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.) • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Our İstanbul, Turkey conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit.
