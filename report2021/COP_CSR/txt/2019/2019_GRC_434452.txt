P a g e 8 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 2.1. Sustainable Development Goals At AFEA, we recognize how important it is for our societies to achieve the Global Goals for sustainable development (Sustainable Development Goals) and for this reason we actively support them and align as much as possible our strategy to those standards. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.

Moreover, we try to engage with local suppliers, whenever this is possible, so that the positive impact is maximized for local communities, while the negative environmental is minimized. For example, transportation services and catering are sourced locally, while also people from local communities are hired to support reception and registration processes. AFEA is also supporting various organizations and NGOs and their work. During February 2019, AFEA donated 22 computer screens to “Zoodohos Pigi”, an NGO which is focusing in providing support to other organizations and NGOs that support people in need from vulnerable social groups. Doing good for the society by doing good for the environment as well AFEA on the one hand is looking to minimize its environmental footprint and on the other hand to support various vulnerable social groups. It is great to have sometimes the opportunity to combine those two! AFEA During May 2019, supported the NGO “Kivotos tou Kosmou” by donating conference bags instead of throwing them to waste. “Kivotos tou Kosmou” is supporting children in need that come from families of low income.

P a g e 12 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 3. Our progress As signatories of the UN Global Compact, we implement as much as possible in relation to the 10 principles, in our day to day activities. A fundamental principle and important factor for our success so far, is the sound governance we put in practice, as well as the care for our people and the environment. Moreover, we participate in sectoral unions and organizations and we cooperate with other companies and various stakeholders in our industry. We consider this approach as of strategic importance as it allows us to develop partnerships that create shared value for all our stakeholders.

Moreover, we offer our employees competitive wages and other benefits such as parental leave, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, all employees receive bonuses in the form of cash checks that can be used for grocery shopping. 3.3. Environment Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 4.3.1 Our commitment Code of conduct and environmental policy P a g e 19 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 Climate change is possibly the biggest threat for humanity today. It is clear now more than ever that all companies, regardless their business sector, should act against climate change. We are dedicated to contributing to the protection of the environment and act again climate change. For us, operating responsibly definitely includes respecting and protecting the environment. We recognize that climate change is probably one of the biggest challenges for our society and economy. We also see that addressing climate challenge can also create new opportunities for businesses and societies and contribute to their sustainable growth and prosperity. Our constant care is to reduce all negative environmental impacts from our daily operations and to increase the actions that can positively contribute to the protection of environment. Through the Environmental Policy and Code of Conduct that we have developed and implement, we commit to saving energy and reducing GHG emissions, to minimize the use of materials (natural resources) at our daily operations and to implement recycling practices aiming to the reduction of waste generated by our operations. As a leader in our sector, we offer our clients the option to organize their events in the most sustainable way. Sustainable Events, a unique service offered by AFEA, aims at managing all sustainability related issues of an event, including environmental. During last year we continued applying environmental criteria to our procurement practices. We talked with various business partners that we maintain a business relationship and we informed about possible steps that they can make so that the whole industry can move to a more sustainable direction. We continued raising awareness among our partners and suppliers, regarding environmentally friendly practices and precautionary measures. P a g e 20 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 We recognize that the transformation of the economy and our sector cannot happen overnight. We commit in continuing our efforts and in developing and promoting services that take into consideration sustainable development and environmental protection. 4.3.2 Our actions Energy As service providers, our direct impact due to energy consumption is limited. Nevertheless, we take measures to manage and minimize this low impact to even lower levels. To this extend, all lamps in our office were replaced with new ones of LED technology, which resulted in significant reduction in the energy consumption (around 35%). Waste Waste generated directly from our offices is mainly paper and some other kinds of waste related to office operations, such as empty toners, aluminum containers and municipal waste. We try to minimize the use of paper to the minimum necessary, and whenever this is not possible, we recycle it. Last year we estimated that we recycled 500kg of paper (estimation: around 2 kg/working day) and 100kg of plastic and aluminum (estimation: around 0,5 kg/working day). In addition, we recycle an estimate of 180 tonners annually (total consumption per year) and other chemicals deriving from our printers. Moreover, we aim to minimize waste during conferences and events by taking various actions including initiatives such printing in certified paper coming for forests that are managed in a sustainable way, printing exactly as much printing material as needed, offering name tags / badges that are eco-friendly and without plastic parts and others. P a g e 21 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 Good Practice: Sustainable events by AFEA Events, small or large, have significant impacts on the environment as usually they are related to extensive resource (materials, energy, water, etc.) use and therefore waste generation. Using less of everything by increasing efficiency and choosing products, suppliers and processes with an improved environmental profile, benefits the environment, trains attendees, inculcates environmentally friendly behavior and builds credibility for the organizations involved. A responsible or sustainable event is the event which is designed in a way that potential negative impacts are managed and minimized, while it leaves a beneficial legacy for the host local community and all parties involved, including raising awareness and maximizing positive experience for all. AFEA, launched its new service: Sustainable Events, with the aim to support its clients on the organization of their future sustainable event, conference or corporate meeting. This new service promotes the respect to the environment and practices of responsible behavior and consumption. More information regarding the service can be found here. P a g e 22 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 3.4. Anti-corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 4.4.1 Our commitment AFEA provides a wide range of high-quality services with reliability and professionalism. For us it is a non-negotiable commitment to conduct business in an ethical way and to respect national and international laws and regulations. We are committed in making business in the most transparent and ethical way possible. Corruption is a serious obstacle to economic and social development around the world with significant negative impacts on sustainable development. Corruption particularly affects business growth, escalates costs and poses serious legal and reputational risks. It also undermines fair competition, impedes long-term foreign and domestic investment, and distorts development priorities. AFEA is committed in operating with zero-tolerance to corruption practices and expects the same for its business partners. Bribery, of any form, is a negative practice and completely opposite to AFEA’s business ethics as it does not reflect, at any form, Company’s culture and policies. AFEA operates in alignment to its Code of Conduct which has been communicated to all stakeholders including employees, partners, suppliers, third parties such as lawyers etc. with the aim to operate on the basis of these guidelines and principles. 4.4.2 Our actions Anti-corruption measures P a g e 23 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 AFEA assesses the risk of corruption on its daily business practices. We have developed a specific mechanism to prevent illegal actions in all forms. As part of our strategy, we evaluate the possibility of corruption and we take measures to prevent any incident. For this reason, we pay specific attention on the transparency of the contracts and transactions we made as well as in the selection of our partners. GDPR: Protecting Personal Data AFEA fully complies with the General Data Protection Regulation of EU about Personal Data and a relevant Policy has been developed and is available in the website. Moreover, as part of the contracts and collaboration agreements that we sign with our business partners, we frequently perform due diligence about business ethics and sign their Codes of Conduct as well as extensive legal provisions regarding business ethics and anti-corruption measures. AFEA is always operating with the highest standards of ethical behavior. As a result of all above mentioned measures, no incident of corruption has been reported to the company during the reference period of this report (as well as before). P a g e 24 | 26 Communication on Progress Report 2018-2019 4. About this Report This report is AFEA’s second Communication on Progress Report on the United Nations Global Compact.
