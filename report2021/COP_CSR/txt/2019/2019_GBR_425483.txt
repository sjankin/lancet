Tuesday, January 29th, 2019 The Company Now in our 45th year, Dowlis Inspired Branding continues to be one of the UK’s largest promotional product suppliers with a reputation for quality and service. We manage over 30 corporate programmes, serving 85 overseas markets, and source from all over the world. Our clients trust us as custodians of their brands, which proves the importance of the standards we maintain throughout our operation. As well as our EcoVadis Gold rating, ISO 9001 and 14001 accreditations, we are fortunate to have a new EMEA Managing Director with a background in sustainable waste management. Joining Dowlis in May 2018, he designed and advised FTSE 250 companies on their processes to maximize recycling and deliver zero waste strategies. With these shared values, Dowlis are confident for the future, upholding the goals and principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Statement of support from Mr. David Lynn, CEO: I am pleased to confirm that Dowlis Inspired Branding Limited reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this our fourth annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We are committed to sharing this information throughout the business and with both our customers and suppliers using our primary channels of communication. The Principles of the United Nations Global Compact:Human Rights Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and make sure they are not complicit in human rights abuses Our corporate social responsibility code published on our website is based upon the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code and specifically declares our respect of human rights. For anyone to become a supplier to Dowlis, they must first sign this code agreeing to comply with these principles. Our Employee Handbook published in 2016 set out the rights of our employees clearly and this remains available for reference as and when required. In 2019 we updated our own Modern Day Slavery statement and this is available to view on our company website. Dowlis fully recognizes the importance of the UK Modern Day Slavery Act and, although the obligations within the legislation are not directly applicable to our company, we have internal processes in place to monitor our supply chain in accordance with the law. Target: With further training, Dowlis intends to carry out our own spot checks to actively identify any potential breaches of human rights or indicators of Modern Day Slavery amongst our operations and supply base. Labor Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. They should aim to eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor and strive for the effective abolition of child labor. Discrimination will not be tolerated. We are an equal opportunities employer and have a published policy to ensure that all job applicants and employees are treated fairly and without favour or prejudice. Our Operations Director has successfully implemented new interview assessment criteria to reflect these principles. Our company handbook covers policies concerning our employee rights and responsibilities. We assess labour related risks and conduct third party audits on those factories we work with to drive transparency through our supply chains and ensure our labour principles are being followed. Should an audit discover any htrejdeviation from our CSR code, we work with the supplier to correct the non-conformance or, for major breeches, terminate our business with the factory concerned. No violations were reported over the last 12 month period. Environment Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges and undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Certified since January 2010 to ISO 14001 regarding Environmental Management Systems. Certified since January 2010 to ISO 9001 regarding Quality Management Systems.

We use an independent market research company to obtain feedback from our customer base and internally amongst our staff. All surveys are anonymous so that the answers can be freely obtained. We also thoroughly record and investigate any negative feedback in relation to our supply base. Any poor feedback is followed up and a resolution reached where possible. Our procedures for action closure are shown to be effective. We only use internationally accredited and recognized auditing partners to carry out checks on our supply chain, whose impartiality can be relied upon.
