Other sustainability initiatives that have been implemented at StormGeo: • New waste bins that separate food, plastic, paper and other • All employees have received reusable water bottles and stainless steel straws • Local sustainability representatives have been identified at each office to allow for better communication on environmental initiatives, areas in need of improvement and best practices within the entire organization Carbon accounting is another fundamental tool that allows us to identify concrete measures to reduce our energy consumption and corresponding GHG emissions in order to adnvance SDG 7. The annual report enables us to benchmark performance indicators and evaluate progress over time. Data is collected (using an external verifiable system such as CEMAsys) from each local office on the following three scopes: Scope 1 – Direct emissions produced by the burning of fuels from transportation, stationary combustion, process emissions Scope 2 – Indirect emissions generated by the electricity consumed and purchased from electricity, district heating/cooling Scope 3 – Indirect emissions produced by our activities from air and business travel, mileage allowance, goods transportation, waste, consumption of products This data is then collated together for regional and global figures and comments are produced into a report by CEMAsys (or a similar company). The analysis is based on the international standard; A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, developed by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative (GHG protocol). This is the most important standard for measuring greenhouse gas emissions and was the basis for the ISO standard 14001. The policy and our environmental performance is communicated to the appropriate people working for or on behalf of the organization. We raise environmental awareness of all employees through information, training, supervision, and provide feedback regarding our performance. This Policy is regularly reviewed to ensure ongoing suitability. Any Business Partners of StormGeo must seek to avoid pollution and to minimize emissions and waste production. They must also seek to develop and implement environmentally friendly technologies and processes in their activities. // 10 // 11 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + // stormgeo. //commitment stormgeo. annual of progress. report. 2019 2018 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + // Anti-Corruption + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + StormGeo does not engage in or tolerate any form of corruption, bribery, extortion or embezzlement.

StormGeo and management focus on the personnel policy based on equal pay for equal work, which means that women and men have equal pay when in the same position, provided that other conditions are equal. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + StormGeo’s aim is to be a non-discriminatory workplace. Within StormGeo’s workforce, over 20 different + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + nationalities are represented as well as many different religions. The Group ensures equal opportunities and rights in recruitment, remuneration and working conditions, as well as promotion, personal development and + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + protection against harassment. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Results based on carbon footprint accounting for 2018: + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + According to CEMAsys, StormGeo’s total carbon footprint in 2018 was calculated at 784.3 tCO2e, which is 7.8% higher GHG emission in comparison with 2017 caused mainly by increase in flight trips and higher petrol + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + consumption for employee commuting. Therefore the largest source of emission became Scope 3, which now accounts for 56.8% of the total GHG emission in StormGeo. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Scope 1 – Decrease in natural gas consumption in US offices together with phasing out fossil fuel fleet led to + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + over 23% reduction in Scope 1 emission since 2017. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Scope 2 – Lower electricity consumption in US offices led to around 10% decrease in Scope 2 GHG emission in comparison with previous year. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Scope 3 – Higher number of flights due to an increase in number of employees caused an increase in petrol + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + consumption in 2018. This resulted in a 29% increase in Scope 3 GHG emission since 2017. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Looking at StormGeo’s performance reflected in KPIs, GHG emission per full-time employee (FTE) has slightly decreased since 2017. This is due to an 8.1% increase in employment balanced by corresponding increase in + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the total GHG emission. GHG emission per revenue has been reduced by around 4%. That was caused by over 12% increase in revenue since 2017. Looking on energy consumption per square meter, it has decreased by + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + around 22% since 2017.
