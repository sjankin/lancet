Those are (1) supporting Nomura Group’s sustained growth from a financial perspective, (2) maintaining an appropriate financial base that enables compliance with regulations, and (3) providing appropriate shareholder returns. One achievement from the past fiscal year is that (2) we have solidified our financial base and have become more responsive to various financial regulations. 15 There are several global financial regulations that Takumi Kitamura 16 Nomura Group must comply with.
