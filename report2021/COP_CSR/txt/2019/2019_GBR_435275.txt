Being a signatory to the UN Global Compact enables us to demonstrate to all of our stakeholders our commitment to be a sustainable business so that we can continue to be a trusted and respected global organisation in the eyes of our employees, clients and other stakeholders. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. 1.1 Introduction Nextgen Clearing was established in 2007 in the UK by Kirit Ruperalia. He was approached by key mobile operators who suggested that the industry needed an innovative clearing provider that could truly support the rapid pace of change in the mobile market. He took up that challenge and founded Nextgen Clearing. In 2013, Nextgen Clearing recruited some of the most renowned data clearing experts in the industry to create our Data Clearing platform from the ground up. After its launch, we had 9 customers in less than 9 months migrate this fundamental roaming business function to us. We strive to be the best in our industry by investing and use our commitment to the UN Global Compact, and associated global frameworks, to help shape our approach. Our activity is aligned with and supports the UN Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on those areas where we can make the greatest contribution. We believe that active dialogue with our people, our clients, our peers, NGO and beyond enriches our understanding of our responsibilities. 1.2 Working in partnership We deeply believe in the power of listening to ignite the human mind and unlock its hidden potential. Our implementation teams start by listening to our clients’ objectives and taking the time to understand the unique challenges they face. These insights can then be taken forward to create a set of solutions for their organisation based around our Financial Clearing, Data Clearing and IOTRON applications. Today, we’re the global expert in mobile roaming clearing solutions, evolving to help operators optimise their business in this continually evolving industry. We are constantly developing new technologies that deliver value to the ever-increasing number of operators that migrate to Nextgen.
