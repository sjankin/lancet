While this inevitably impacted Olam’s performance, the Company continued to grow profitably by capturing opportunities across the food and agri-business sector. Compared with a particularly strong performance in the previous year, Olam’s 2018 results across key metrics were lower year-on-year amid tougher market conditions than anticipated. This impacted the entire industry. Operational PATMI declined 19.7% to S$346.6 million while EBITDA was down 6.9% from the previous year to S$1,235.8 million. However, the Company’s continued efforts to optimise working capital and capital expenditure while executing on planned divestments allowed it to deliver an improved Free Cash Flow to Equity of S$1.1 billion. Gearing also reduced to 1.32 times compared to 1.46 times as at the end of 2017. The Board of Directors has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 4.0 cents per share, maintaining the total dividend at 7.5 cents per share for 2018 – the same as the previous year. Strategic Plan In 2018, Olam completed its Strategic Plan for 2016-2018, as it remained focused on pursuing growth in prioritised platforms, worked to turn around underperforming assets and ensured gestating assets continued the journey to contribute to their full potential. Looking ahead to the next 6-year planning cycle, 2018 was also a moment for the Company to consider how it can refocus on strengths and capitalise on new opportunities through its 2019-2024 Strategic Plan. With a winning business model honed over the past 30 years – developing expertise in farming and farm-gate origination, end-to-end traceability, sustainability, processing and manufacturing, as well as digital initiatives, Olam is well-positioned to help customers meet key trends now shaping the sector. These include an increasing demand for healthier foods, traceable and sustainable sourcing and e-commerce, driven by consumers and advances in technology. As a key player and leader in sourcing raw materials and transforming them to deliver food, feed and fibre to the world, Olam has laid the foundations that will balance near-term returns with long-term sustainable growth. 8 Olam International Limited Annual Report 2018 The Board worked closely with Management over This culture has been essential to Olam’s success, the past year to review and finalise the latest Plan, reinforced by the Company’s values.

Members of the Board visited Vietnam last September as Olam Vietnam celebrated its 20th Chairman, Non-Executive and anniversary of operations there. During the visit, the Independent Director Board met with regional and country management and employees on various aspects of Olam’s core businesses and strategy in Vietnam, the fastest growing economy in Southeast Asia. The visit brought to life for the Board how Olam Vietnam has mirrored the Group’s and the country’s growth over the past 20 years to become a leading producer, processor and exporter of various commodities by fostering a close partnership with farmers.

Based on these surveys and group discussions, 8 focused group discussions were conducted as part of a qualitative survey to do a deep dive on the main themes and key issues that emerged. The summary output of this exercise showed that Olam has a very high score on its insurgency. 1.

Executive Committee; Operating Committee; Management Committee olamgroup.com 19 Group CEO review continued Re-imagining Olam: New 6-year strategy to create value from tomorrow’s consumer landscape Building towards 2024 and Our strategic plan is on trend beyond As part of a regular cadence, every 3 years we review and refresh our strategy, developing a 6 year plan split into two 3-year cycles. In 2018, we therefore undertook a comprehensive review of the business and in January 2019 announced our 2019-2024 Strategic Plan. The Plan builds on the pivotal role we play in agri value chains – sourcing raw materials from origins Right-for-me Page 28 across the world, transporting and processing them into speciality agri-products and ingredients for manufacturers, multinational brands, retailers and others. In particular, it has been developed in direct response to a number of rapidly evolving consumer preferences, as well as the technology advances influencing both purchasing behaviour and food and fibre production. Consumer preferences include increasing demand for healthier and nutritious foods, and a desire for the ‘simplification’ of ingredients and ‘clean labels’ Right-for-the-planet Page 30 (‘Right-for-Me’); concerns about supply chain provenance, and whether a product is both environmentally and socially sustainable, and an increasing demand for ‘Purpose’ brands (Right-forthe-Planet and Right-for-the-Producer). Meanwhile e-commerce and ‘out-of-home’ eating/drinking is changing the face of ‘How I live and consume’. Finally, the way food and fibre is The Plan has been being produced is also changing dramatically. From our plantations developed in direct to our factories, the Internet of Right-for-the-producer Page 32 response to a number of Things (IoT) helps achieve a precision in resource use or rapidly evolving consumer operational excellence unprecedented in previous years preferences, and – we now have long wingspan technology advances. drones at our disposal to map plantations and orchards so we can recognise where to intervene for disease infestation or nutritional deficiency – a process far faster than inspecting trees on foot. Taken together, these consumer trends and How I live and consume Page 34 technology advances have a very large impact on our customers, and therefore on our business, our strategy and our business model. They will require us to rethink the way we supply agri products and food ingredients, a ‘Re-Imagining’ of Olam.

This refreshed strategy has meant making some tough choices regarding the de-prioritised businesses of Sugar, Rubber, Wood Products, and Fertiliser. While they remain good businesses, which can be seen is this Report, they no longer fit with our strategic priorities. As a result of this process, we expect to release about US$1.6 billion of cash to redeploy in chosen businesses. However, we will only divest from a position of strength, and in a responsible and orderly manner at the right time, over the next 6 years. Indeed, the pathway to exit might be a partial sell down and then full exit. Until then, we will be supporting these businesses to be in the best possible position and making any transition as smooth as possible. We will be looking for responsible buyers who will provide effective environmental stewardship, particularly given the concessions in the Republic of Congo and Republic of Gabon. We are also looking to redeploy as many people as possible, as was the case with the Fundamental Fund and the Sugar desk which have already closed. 2.

Right-for-me Olam spices up ingredients with natural flavours Spices are punching above their weight. Americans and Europeans are embracing heat and unusual flavour combinations. Take ‘sweet heat’ Mexican hot chocolate made with cinnamon and guajillo pepper, a lightly spiced chilli that accentuates the cinnamon without overwhelming it. We’re even seeing spice perk up more traditional meals like breakfast, such as jam infused with cayenne or spiced maple syrups, even garlic. Authenticity is valued especially in ethnic street food dishes – with such a broad and integrated sourcing portfolio we can offer ‘deep indigenous spices’ – the high spice level found at the heart of countries of origin. But ‘authentic’ spices can come with manufacturing challenges. The R&D team responded to customer requests for a more palatable high-heat chilli pepper ingredient for sauces by reducing the heat measurement of Scorpion chillies from 1 million to 50,000 Scoville Heat Units. The milder blend ensures better heat consistency and customers no longer have to wear respiratory equipment during the handling process! Then you have customers looking for innovation. Plant proteins like pea are growing in popularity but they often have flavours that may need some masking and would benefit from some onions, garlic and cumin. Also the reduction and replacement of sugar with spices versus artificial sweeteners is very much on-trend. The sugar content in rich and sweet Jill Houk is corporate Thousand Island Dressing can be reduced by substituting red pepper purée for the chilli sauce research and development and ketchup. As for colour, we have such a vibrant natural chef for Olam Spices, and palette to choose from – which can be sold with a ‘clean label’.

Right-forthe-planet Global consumption of nuts needs to double Edible Nuts were already an exciting category to be in before we even read the report from the Eat Lancet Commission* earlier this year. The authors are looking to set the first scientific targets for a healthy diet that can be grown within the earth’s available resources given they are already under so much pressure: “Transformation to healthy diets by 2050 will require substantial dietary shifts. Global consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes will have to double”. And this is on the back of tree nuts consumption growing around 60% between 2006 and 2016 according to INC**. The major drivers? Firstly, a continuing recognition of the health benefits by consumers – almonds are relatively well known, but take hazelnuts, they are a source of vitamin E, manganese, copper, omega-6 and antioxidants. Secondly, manufacturers are innovating with exciting ingredient formats – from snacking to low glycaemic cereal bars, butters to milks – almond milk is now joined by cashew milk. Consumers are also increasingly willing to pay a premium for nuts with a low environmental and high social impact. Olam is unique in being able to offer the largest variety of nuts from all major origins, all-year-round and backed by extensive farmer and worker livelihood programmes as we have in Turkey for hazelnuts under Olam Progida and cashew. The Cashew team can offer traceability right from the Raw Cashew Nut farms to the shelf and are the largest supplier of Organic and Fairtrade. We also provide extensive processing capabilities, turning raw nuts into customised ingredient formats using advanced technologies to keep the flavour and nutritional values intact. Our new almond blanching and ingredients facility in Vietnam is hitting quality, yield and efficiency targets. In the USA, our Peanuts team is producing peanut pastes, granulated ingredients and Ufuk Özongun, Country Head dry roasted peanuts from a unique configuration of shelling, blanching and manufacturing assets. As for Turkey, and co-founder of walnuts, we offer hand cracked walnut halves from both northern and southern hemispheres for that year round Progida Hazelnut Processing supply, then they are processed and packed in modified air packaging to ensure they get to our customers without losing quality.

Right-forthe-producer Increasing farmer resilience Cocoa has been a part of who I am since my first job in a cocoa processing factory over 35 years ago. I’ve come to know cocoa farmers across every continent and lead the development of a business in my native country with the largest procurement network for sustainable cocoa. Côte d’Ivoire accounts for over 40% of world cocoa bean production. The trees are grown by around a million smallholder cocoa farmers, on tiny farms, where running water and electricity are luxuries. Deforestation is a major issue facing the industry but it’s inherently bound up with poverty as farmers encroach to grow more. We must ensure that we tackle both together – to source cocoa that is both Right-for-the-Producer and Right-for-the-Planet. We are therefore focused on 3 key areas: Sustainable production and farmer livelihoods – we have many long-standing programmes across the world but technology today is driving greater impact potential. As part of our goal to achieve 100% traceable cocoa volumes from our global, direct origination supply chain by 2020, we have scaled up our range of digital mapping tools. By recording data like labour and agricultural practices, as well as farm size and distance to infrastructure, we can issue farmers with tailored Farm Development Plans, delivering advice based on data about their farm – something they just never had. Forest protection and restoration – this includes helping to preserve and rehabilitate 460,000 ha of classified forest here in Côte d’Ivoire. Social inclusion and community engagement – such as partnerships to improve access to education for children. We also shouldn’t under-estimate the importance of investing in processing in countries where cocoa Arouna Coulibaly, is grown. Our year-round presence on the ground and our processing facilities give farmers visible Director General market access. Having managed cocoa processing facilities in Europe, I’m pleased to now be closer to Cocoa & Coffee the farmers. From our ultra-modern factories in Abidjan and OUTSPAN, OCP Olam San Pedro, we produce single origin cocoa cake, cocoa masses and cocoa butters under our Unicao Cocoa, Côte d’Ivoire brand. These ingredients, with their distinctive West African flavour, become part of recipes worldwide. And this journey is one that we can now map for customers across multiple sustainability metrics for more informed interventions – Côte d’Ivoire being the first cocoa origin on AtSource. 32 Olam International Limited Annual Report 2018 Olam Cocoa: Creating a sustainable cocoa supply #1 originator of cocoa beans and leading processor of cocoa ingredients 650,000 cocoa farmers in global sourcing network 228,000+ cocoa farmers in sustainability programmes 11 cocoa processing facilities worldwide 6 cocoa and chocolate ingredient brands (deZaan, Macao, Joanes, Britannia, Unicao and Huysman) Read more: COO Review, Confectionery and Beverage Ingredients, page 60 Read more: https://www.olamgroup.com/products/confectionerybeverage-ingredients/cocoa.html olamgroup.com 33 Our strategy in action continued Key trends driving our strategy 4. How I live and consume Coffee: The story behind every cup As a native Colombian, coffee runs through my veins. And that’s before I start my job each day looking for the most outstanding Colombian coffee to sell to our discerning customers. Our Colombian portfolio includes regional and own brands from our famous Dulima profile to exotic and complex varieties like Geisha, which find their way into homes, cafés and restaurants around the world. In fact, the trend for specialty coffee is driving out of home consumption with an emphasis on experience. In 2017, 46%* of coffee in the USA was consumed outside the home while 59% of all coffee consumed by North Americans is specialty. Brands and coffee shop roasters are therefore looking to Olam to cater to multiple consumer demands, but this can impact cost and earnings variability. So Olam’s Big Data Analytics team employs algorithms to analyse both historical purchase data and social media posts on trending coffee flavours. We can then respond quicker to shifts in buying behaviour as well as recommend alternate grades or aromas. Specialty Coffee is also characterised by the direct relationships with the farmers that grow the crop – offering a story behind every cup, bringing the origin closer to consumers. With more people drinking coffee that comes at a higher price premium, the credit extends beyond the barrister, to the roaster and producer too. This was exactly the rationale behind the initiative ‘Tip the Farmer’, launched last year in partnership with ELAN RDC, Bean There Coffee Co., and Motherland Coffee Co. Tips, payable at the till or online, allow coffee drinkers to recognise the role of the farmers behind their cup. For the smallholder farmers in Democratic Republic of Congo and Catalina Gonzalez, Burundi, it provides a necessary financial boost, with the aim of increasing their revenue and Head of Sustainability funding better education, agronomy and community developments. and Differentiated Our coffee customers will be able to track the impact of social programmes like this, as well Coffee, Olam Agro as the environmental footprint of their products, through Olam’s new sustainable sourcing Colombia S.A.S. solution AtSource.

How it’s produced Precision palm production The past year marked key progress on our palm plantations in Gabon since we first began our development 7 years ago. Olam Palm Gabon1 has become the first RSPO2 certified new planting producer of palm oil in Africa. We anticipate our certified volumes will double in the year ahead as more trees reach maturity. At the same time, we are focused on implementing practices to optimise productivity. The scale of opportunity brought by advances in digital and big data, mean that we can respond to variables more accurately and more swiftly by adopting precision agriculture practices that improve yields, make best use of resources and reduce impacts. Digital apps and dashboards enhance worker productivity and provide timely management intervention. From automated weather stations located across the plantations, we linked up climatic forecast data with a tensiometer system on a 126-hectare drip irrigated trial plot, and this prescribes exactly the right amount of water and nutrition for the trees giving us an impressive 89% improvement in yield. Meanwhile, our trial of a mechanised spraying and fertiliser application has seen a 3-fold and 14-fold increase in productivity and uniformity respectively. We are now aiming to reach more than 10,000 ha by end-2019. Access to aerial imagery via drones has been a game changer – we are seeing the benefits of this technology on our almond orchards, as well as on our palm plantations. Our GIS team monitors crop health, as well as our protected High Conservation Value areas (HCV) of forest and savannah – about the size of Singapore – and can alert our 64-strong HCV team in Gabon to control illegal activity. The drones are also monitoring the integrity of riparian Supramaniam buffer in the conservation area – critical for securing clean water resources for all users and Ramasamy, creating corridors for wildlife. These innovations and best practices are shared President and Global via our global Plantations Community of Practice – with almonds, black pepper, palm, rice, coffee Head of Plantations and rubber all learning from each other. This Community’s ambition is to see Olam become the ‘world’s best planter’ – it drives our every move, getting more crop from less land and essentially re-imagining agriculture for the better. ​ 36 Olam International Limited Annual Report 2018 Olam Palm Gabon: Sustainable plantations 1st certified new planting producer in Africa 55,385 HA RSPO certified to date 31,500 MT of certified sustainable palm oil in 2018 2 palm oil mills, 1 kernel crushing plant, 3 refineries, 1 processing unit 72,000 HA protected as High Conservation Value areas Read more: COO Review, Food Staples and Packaged Foods, page 64.

This was primarily driven by the growth in Grains trading volumes. EBITDA was, however, lower by 19.7% compared with a strong 2017 performance. This was mainly due to reduced contribution from the Dairy, Rice and Edible Oils businesses. While the upstream operations in Russia did well, the farming operations in Uruguay experienced drought conditions, leading to higher feed costs. The Rice business reported lower earnings as it reduced merchandising volumes into Africa due to intense competitive pressures in the market.

Packaged Foods turned the corner in 2018 with strong positive EBITDA and market share for long-term value gains in both Nigeria and Ghana. Invested capital came down by S$100.4 million compared with 2017 mainly due to continued optimisation initiatives, change in product mix and improved access to supplier credit, all of which reduced the impact on working capital despite the nearly 10 million-tonne increase in Grains volumes.

Rare bird species find safe haven in rice fields Throughout the origins that Olam operates in, there is a strong focus on creating and maintaining living landscapes to protect and encourage biodiversity, for instance with responsible use of agri-chemicals. In 2018, the Rice team in Nigeria published the findings of a 26-month field study on the bird life inhabiting Olam’s paddy fields. By identifying particular species, their numbers and food chains, the study presented a clear picture of the positive effect of Olam’s Rice farming operations on the bird life in the region. Drawn to an abundant and safe food supply, the growing populations and rare sightings of non-native species – such as the Forbes Plover pictured – are a reassuring sign that these rice fields and surrounding habitat provide a safe and attractive landscape where birds and other wildlife can thrive. Some species also serve a useful role in keeping rice pests and rodents at bay. 66 Olam International Limited Annual Report 2018 Supply chain Protecting Gabon’s animals and habitats Empowering female Indian sugar farmers Social Capital Olam Palm Gabon (OPG) implements an extensive • To encourage climate-smart practices in biodiversity plan to protect iconic species including sugarcane farming in India, Olam, together with gorillas (pictured – a pregnant female), chimpanzees NGO Solidaridad, major brands and International and elephants living in the forest around the plantations.

The assessment was initiated in March 2017, as a precautionary approach to ensure we uphold our commitments on HCV and HCS. The Makouke HCV assessment report was submitted in April to the Quality Panel of the HCV Resource Network Assessor Licensing Scheme (ALS), and the review process was successfully concluded in December 2018 (a requirement for any new plantings under RSPO’s New Plantings Procedure).
